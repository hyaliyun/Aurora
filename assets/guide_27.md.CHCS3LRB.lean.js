The key part of the solution involves expressing {xi in B} in terms of countable unions: Since E is at most countable and xi: Omega rightarrow E, we have: xi(omega) in E quad text{for all } omega in Omega. 4. **Main Equation** For a Borel set B in mathbb{R}, let's write: {xi in B} = bigcup_{x in B cap E} {xi = x}. This equality holds because xi takes values in E and E is at most countable. Therefore, the intersection B cap E is also at most countable, and thus, the union over it is countable. 5. **Measurability** Since {xi = x} in mathscr{F} for each x in E by assumption, and mathscr{F} is closed under countable unions, it follows that: {xi in B} = bigcup_{x in B cap E} {xi = x} in mathscr{F}. Therefore, xi is a measurable function, implying that xi is a random variable. 6. **Reverse Implication** Conversely, if xi is a random variable, for any x in E, consider the singleton set {x}, which is a Borel set in mathbb{R}. We have: {xi = x} = {xi in {x}} in mathscr{F}. This completes the proof that xi is a random variable on (Omega, mathscr{F}) if and only if {xi = x} in mathscr{F} for each x in E.

We need to determine whether these 4 lines can divide the plane into exactly 8 regions. **Step 2: General formula for regions divided by lines.** The general formula to determine the number of regions ( R ) created by ( n ) lines on a plane is given by: [ R = frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1 ] **Step 3: Apply the formula for n = 4.** For ( n = 4 ): [ R = frac{4(4+1)}{2} + 1 = frac{20}{2} + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11 ] This indicates that, under the general conditions, ( 4 ) lines would divide the plane into ( 11 ) regions. **Step 4: Special case where all lines pass through a single point.** The formula mentioned applies when no two lines are parallel, and no three lines are concurrent (intersect at a single point).

We can express (a^m + b^m) in the following way: [ a^m + b^m = a^{kn} + b^{kn} ] Notice, this can be rewritten as: [ a^{kn} + b^{kn} = (a^n)^k + (b^n)^k ] According to **Problem 5.1 b** (presumed to be a known result, might talk about properties of numbers and their divisibility), we know that if (k) is an odd integer, then (x^k + y^k) is divisible by (x + y).

To investigate divisibility, consider: [ a^{kn + r} + b^{kn + r} = a^r a^{kn} + b^r b^{kn} ] We can decompose it as: [ a^{kn + r} + b^{kn + r} = a^r (a^{kn} + b^{kn}) + b^{kn}(b^r - a^r) ] Since (a^r (a^{kn} + b^{kn})) is clearly divisible by (a^n + b^n), we need to consider (b^{kn}(b^r - a^r)). Now, (b^{kn}) is relatively prime to (a^n + b^n) (since (a) and (b) are co-prime and hence (a^n + b^n) retains this property). Also, [ 0 < |b^r - a^r| < a^n + b^n ] This implies (b^{kn}(b^r - a^r)) is not divisible by (a^n + b^n). Therefore, for (a^m + b^m) to be divisible by (a^n + b^n), the only possible way is if (r = 0), i.e., (m) is an exact multiple of (n), specifically of the form (m = k n) where (k) must be an odd number because that alignment ensures the divisibility condition we derived. When (m = l n + r), where (l) is even and (0 leq r < n), let (k = l - 1) where (k) is odd then, [ a^{l n + r} + b^{l n + r} = a^{kn + n + r} + b^{kn + n + r} ] Expanding similarly as above bares the non-divisibility result for even (l), confirming the odd nature requirement of multiplicative factor (k).

In other words, as x increases, y decreases. 2. We are given two points, P_{1}(-1, y_{1}) and P_{2}(2, y_{2}), and we know that the x-coordinate of P_{1} is less than the x-coordinate of P_{2}, i.e., -1 < 2. 3.

According to the problem statement, (P(x)) takes the value 2 at three distinct integer points. Let's denote these points as (a_1), (a_2), and (a_3). Therefore, [ P(a_1) = P(a_2) = P(a_3) = 2 ] We are asked to prove that (P(x) neq 3) for any integer (x). 2. **Contradiction Assumption**: Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exists an integer (b) such that (P(b) = 3). 3. **Difference of Polynomial Values**: The difference of the polynomial values at two points is divisible by the difference of the points if the polynomial has integer coefficients. This is due to the polynomial remainder theorem. Specifically, for any integers (a) and (b): [ P(a) - P(b) text{ is divisible by } a - b ] 4. **Applying Polynomial Difference Property**: Let's apply this theorem to our specific points: [ P(a_1) - P(b), P(a_2) - P(b), text{ and } P(a_3) - P(b) ] Since (P(a_1) = P(a_2) = P(a_3) = 2) and (P(b) = 3), we have: [ P(a_1) - P(b) = 2 - 3 = -1 ] [ P(a_2) - P(b) = 2 - 3 = -1 ] [ P(a_3) - P(b) = 2 - 3 = -1 ] Therefore, (-1) must be divisible by (a_1 - b), (a_2 - b), and (a_3 - b). 5. **Absolute Value Equations**: Since (-1) is divisible by these differences, we have: [ a_1 - b = pm 1 ] [ a_2 - b = pm 1 ] [ a_3 - b = pm 1 ] 6. **Considering Absolute Values**: We know (a_1, a_2), and (a_3) are distinct integers. Therefore: [ |a_1 - b| = |a_2 - b| = |a_3 - b| = 1 ] This implies that: [ b = a_1 pm 1, ; b = a_2 pm 1, ; b = a_3 pm 1 ] For distinct integers (a_1, a_2), and (a_3), these conditions cannot be simultaneously satisfied because (b) would then have to be within 1 unit of all three distinct values simultaneously, which is impossible. # Conclusion: Our assumption that (P(b) = 3) for some integer (b) leads to an impossibility.

Each unit cube in the original cube mathcal{C} must be oriented correctly in the new configuration such that its exterior faces form the surfaces of the new cube. The crucial points are: - Each of the 8 unit cubes must have one face oriented outward as one of the faces of the new cube. 3. **Analyze the constraints:** Each unit cube comes from a face of the original large cube, meaning there were originally blue faces distributed among these 8 unit cubes.

If 6 integers all have different tens digits, then there must be exactly one integer among the 6 with each of six selected tens digits. Since there are 10 different integers for each tens digit, the number of ways to pick, without regard to order, 6 different integers with different tens digits is 10^6 for the combined selection from the 6 tens digit categories. To calculate this: 1. Choose which 6 tens digits to use from the 7 available: binom{7}{6} = 7 ways. 2. For each of the chosen tens digit, select one integer: 10^6 ways (10 choices per digit category). Thus, the number of ways to pick 6 integers such that each has different tens digits is 7 cdot 10^6.

Prove that the number of triangles is even.","output":"We are given two problems: 1. Showing the number of triangles in certain conditions is even. 2. Calculating transformation end results for a set list of numbers under specific rules. Let's address each problem step-by-step. (a) Prove that the number of right-angled triangles is even when a square is divided into equal right-angled triangles with legs of 3 and 4. #1. **Area Calculation**: Each triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs of 3 and 4. Therefore, the area of one such triangle is: [ text{Area of one triangle} = frac{1}{2} times 3 times 4 = 6 ] 2. **Total Area of Square**: Let ( a ) be the side length of the square. Thus, the area of the square is: [ text{Area of square} = a^2 ] 3. **Number of Triangles ( k )**: Since the area of the entire square equals the combined area of ( k ) triangles: [ a^2 = k times 6 implies k = frac{a^2}{6} ] 4. **Evenness of ( k )**: - Since ( a ) must be an integer (as it represents the side length of a square), ( a ) is either even or odd. - ( a^2 ) will always be a multiple of 4 if ( a ) is even. - If ( a^2 ) is a multiple of 4, then writing ( a^2 = 4m ) for some integer ( m ), we have: [ k = frac{4m}{6} = frac{2m}{3} ] - For ( k ) to be an integer, ( 2m ) must be divisible by 3. - If ( a ) is even, say ( a = 2b ) for some integer ( b ), then: [ a^2 = (2b)^2 = 4b^2 ] Hence, [ k = frac{4b^2}{6} = frac{2b^2}{3} ] Therefore, ( a^2 ) being a multiple of 4 ensures ( k ) is even and divisible by both 2 and 3. # Conclusion for (a): [ boxed{text{The number of triangles } k text{ is even}}. ] (b) Prove that the number of right-angled triangles is even when a rectangle is divided into equal right-angled triangles with legs of 1 and 2. #1. **Perimeter Calculation**: Each triangle is a right-angled triangle with legs of 1 and 2. Therefore, the perimeter of one such triangle is: [ text{Perimeter of one triangle} = 1 + 2 + sqrt{1^2 + 2^2} = 1 + 2 + sqrt{5} = 3 + sqrt{5} ] 2. **Sum of Perimeters**: Consider a rectangle that is subdivided into ( k ) such triangles. The total perimeter of all triangles must be counted considering that each interior cut line is shared by two triangles: [ k(3 + sqrt{5}) ] 3. **Counting Perimeters in Two Ways**: Alternatively, consider the perimeter of the rectangle with additional doubled cut lengths (as cut lengths are shared between two triangles). Let the length of the cuts be ( L ): [ text{Total perimeter of all triangles} = 2L + text{Perimeter of rectangle} ] 4. **Equating**: Both methods to sum perimeters should give the same results: [ k(3 + sqrt{5}) = 2m + 2nsqrt{5} quad (m, n in mathbb{Z}) ] 5. **Solution Constraints**: - From the equality of coefficients, for ( (3 + sqrt{5})k ) to be expressed as ( 2m + 2nsqrt{5} ), it implies that: [ 3k = 2m quad text{and} quad k = 2n ] Thus, ( k ) must be an even number because both ( m ) and ( n ) are integers and ( k ) being the common factor. # Conclusion for (b): [ boxed{text{The number of triangles } k text{ is even}}. ]"},{"instruction":"is known that the pass rate of a certain product is 95%, and the rate of firstclass products among the qualified products is 20%.

The product of pq and pr is 221. We can express pq and pr as 10p + q and 10p + r, respectively, since p is the tens digit and q and r are the units digits. The product of pq and pr is then: (10p + q) * (10p + r) = 221 Expanding the product, we get: 100p^2 + 10pr + 10pq + qr = 221 Since p, q, and r are distinct positive digits, they must be between 1 and 9. We can also see that 100p^2 must be a significant contributor to the product since p is a positive digit and the product is 221, which is relatively large for the product of two two-digit numbers. Let's try to factor 221 to see if we can find a combination of factors that fit the form of our equation. The prime factorization of 221 is 13 * 17. Since we are looking for two two-digit numbers and p is the same in both, we can infer that p must be a factor in both numbers. Looking at the factors 13 and 17, we can see that they can be written as (10 + 3) and (10 + 7). This suggests that p could be 1, q could be 3, and r could be 7.

Petya finished first with the most points. How many points less did Vasya score than Petya?","output":"1. We start by calculating the total number of games played in the tournament. Since there are 12 participants and each one plays exactly one game with every other participant, the total number of games is given by the combination formula: [ binom{12}{2} = frac{12 times 11}{2} = 66 ] 2. Each game awards a total of 1 point (1 point for a win, 0.5 points each for a draw, and 0 points for a loss). Therefore, 66 games result in: [ 66 text{ points} ] 3. According to the problem, Vasya lost only one game. This means he either won or drew the other 10 games. The minimum score Vasya could have obtained is if he drew all his 10 remaining games: [ 10 times 0.5 = 5 text{ points} ] 4. Vasya, however, finished last with the lowest score, implying each of the other 11 participants must have scored more than 5 points each.

Now, calculating the total minimum points for the rest of the participants: [ 11 times 5.5 = 60.5 text{ points} ] 6.

Between two cities if they are not adjacent. Each of these connections is offered by exactly one of two competing shipping companies. Prove that there are always three places such that there are ship connections of the same company between two of these places.","output":"To solve this problem, we'll use graph theory and colorings to show that there will always be a monochromatic triangle formed by the connections between the places. Reformulation in Graph Theory 1. Represent the problem as a graph where: - Two islands are represented by points A and B. - Seven cities on the shore are represented by points S_1, S_2, ldots, S_7. - Two cities are adjacent if they have consecutive indices (bmod 7). 2. There are edges between: - The two islands A and B. - Each city and each island. - Two cities if they are not adjacent. 3. Each edge is colored either red or green corresponding to the two competing shipping companies. **First Solution** We can assume without loss of generality that the edge AB is red. Then, we consider two cases: # Case 1: Two non-adjacent cities are connected to A with red edges. 1. Suppose S_i and S_j are non-adjacent cities and AS_i and AS_j are red. 2. If BS_i or BS_j is also red, then AS_iB or AS_jB forms a red triangle. 3. Assume BS_i and BS_j are green. - If S_iS_j is red, AS_iS_j forms a red triangle. - If S_iS_j is green, BS_iS_j forms a green triangle. # Case 2: No two non-neighboring cities are connected to A with red edges. 1. Assume AS_1, AS_2, AS_3, AS_4, AS_5 are all green. 2. Since S_1, S_3, S_5 are not adjacent: - If one of the edges S_1S_3, S_3S_5, or S_5S_1 is green, it forms a green triangle with A. - If they are all red, S_1S_3S_5 forms a red triangle. **Second Solution** Assume there is no monochromatic triangle. Consider the following sets: [ begin{aligned} & M_1 = { S_1, S_3, S_5 } & M_2 = { S_2, S_4, S_6 } & M_3 = { S_3, S_5, S_7 } & M_4 = { S_4, S_6, S_1 } & M_5 = { S_5, S_7, S_2 } & M_6 = { S_6, S_1, S_3 } & M_7 = { S_7, S_2, S_4 } end{aligned} ] Each set contains three cities that are not adjacent in pairs: 1. Consider M_alpha = {S_i, S_j, S_k} and assume AS_i, AS_j, AS_k are all green. 2. If one of the edges S_iS_j, S_jS_k, S_kS_i is green, it forms a green triangle with A. 3. If these edges are all red, S_iS_jS_k forms a red triangle. Since each city appears in exactly 3 of the sets M_alpha, at least three edges AS_a, AS_b, AS_c must be red: 1. The edges BS_a, BS_b, BS_c would then be all green to avoid red triangles with AB. 2. At least two of S_a, S_b, S_c are not adjacent. 3. Regardless of the color of the edge S_aS_b, there will be a monochromatic triangle with A or B. **Third Solution** Assume there is no monochromatic triangle. We make the following observations: 1. For every three cities, there are always two non-adjacent cities. 2. For every five cities, there are always three that are not adjacent in pairs. Define sets M and N: [ M = { k mid AS_k text{ is green} }, quad N = { k mid BS_k text{ is green} } ] Then: (i) M cup N = {1, ldots, 7}. - If k notin M cup N, then AS_k and BS_k are red, forming a red triangle AS_kB. (ii) |M setminus N| leq 2 and |N setminus M| leq 2. - Assume S_i, S_j, S_k in M setminus N. At least two of S_i, S_j, S_k are non-adjacent, and this would result in a monochromatic triangle involving A or B. (iii) |M|, |N| leq 4. - If |M| geq 5, among the five cities connected to A with a green edge, three non-adjacent cities exist. These would form a green triangle if their edges are green, otherwise a red triangle would form with BS_i, BS_j, BS_k. From this, it follows: [ 7 = |M cup N| = |M| + |N setminus M| leq 4 + 2 = 6 ] This is a contradiction, showing that it is impossible to avoid having a monochromatic triangle.

Prove that there exists a convex pentagon among these points. Let us consider the convex hull S of the 9 points ( A_1, A_2, cdots, A_9 ). 1. **Case 1: S is a convex polygon with more than 4 sides.** If S is a convex polygon with more than 4 sides, the problem is solved because S itself contains a convex pentagon. 2. **Case 2: S is a convex quadrilateral.** Suppose S is the convex quadrilateral A_1A_2A_3A_4, and let the convex hull of the remaining points {A_5, A_6, cdots, A_9} be denoted as T. - Subcase 1: T is a convex polygon with 5 or more sides. If T is a convex polygon with 5 or more sides, T itself is a convex pentagon (or larger), so the problem is solved. - Subcase 2: T is a polygon with fewer than 5 sides. Since any 3 points from {A_5, A_6, cdots, A_9} inside T must form a triangle within the quadrilateral A_1A_2A_3A_4, one of the points of {A_5, A_6, cdots, A_9} (say A_5) is inside the triangle formed by some three others (e.g., triangle A_6A_7A_8). This creates three areas divided by A_5, and at least one of these areas will contain two of the points of A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4. Assume A_1 and A_2 are within this region triangle A_6A_5A_7, making A_2A_1A_6A_5A_7 a convex pentagon. 3. **Case 3: S is a triangle.** Suppose S is triangle A_1A_2A_3, and the convex hull of the remaining six points {A_4, A_5, cdots, A_9} is T. - Subcase 1: T is a convex polygon with more than 4 sides. If T is a convex polygon with more than 4 sides, again, T itself is a convex pentagon or larger, and the problem is resolved. - Subcase 2: T is a convex quadrilateral. If T is a quadrilateral A_4A_5A_6A_7, then A_8 and A_9 must lie inside T. If the line A_8A_9 intersects one of the sides of T, say A_4A_5, then A_4 A_8 A_9 A_6 A_7 forms a convex pentagon. If A_8A_9 intersects an opposite pair of sides, the methods used above indicate that one of the initial points A_1, A_2, A_3 being inside the shadow region guarantees a convex pentagon, such as A_1A_2A_7A_8A_4. - Subcase 3: T is a triangle, say triangle A_4A_5A_6. Then, A_7 and A_8 must be inside triangle A_4A_5A_6. If A_7A_8 intersects sides A_4A_5 and A_5A_6, this forms divisions where A_1A_4A_7A_8A_6 is a convex pentagon if A_1 is within a specific region. Similarly, if two points of A_1, A_2, A_3 are within another region, such as A_1A_2A_7A_8A_4, they form a convex pentagon.

When ( h = 0 ), by a little calculation, we can find that the circle is tangent to triangle ( ABC ), and when ( h geq 1 ), the triangle is contained in the unit circle. - So, when ( h in [1, 2] ), ( V_{P-ABC cap Y} ) equals to the volume of the tetrahedron between ( z = 1 ) and ( z = 2 ), which equals to: [ frac{1}{2} cdot (sqrt{3})^2 cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot 1 cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} ] - Now we calculate the volume between ( z = 0 ) and ( z = 1 ).

The center of the triangle and the circle coincide at point ( O ).

For the first few rows, we have: - Row 1 has 1 number. - Row 2 has 3 numbers. - Row 3 has 5 numbers. - Row 4 has 7 numbers. It becomes apparent that row n has 2n - 1 numbers, since the first row has 1 number, and we add 2 for each subsequent row.

Prove that there exist four consecutive vertices of the polygon that belong to one heptagon.","output":"1. Let us consider an (N)-sided convex polygon that is divided into several smaller convex heptagons (7-gons). We need to prove that there exist four consecutive vertices of the (N)-gon that belong to one of the heptagons. 2. Assume the opposite: that no four consecutive vertices of the (N)-gon belong to any one heptagon. We will show that this assumption leads to an inconsistency. 3. Consider the vertices and edges of the (N)-gon. Since each edge is part of one of the heptagons, and each heptagon shares its edges with the (N)-gon and possibly other heptagons, every vertex of the (N)-gon intersects with vertices of adjacent heptagons. 4. For any heptagon formed within the (N)-gon, let's analyze the number of angles that occur at each vertex. Since each heptagon is convex, the sum of its internal angles is: [ (7-2) times 180^circ = 900^circ ] Thus, the average internal angle of a heptagon is: [ frac{900^circ}{7} approx 128.57^circ ] 5. For the assumed configuration (i.e., no four consecutive vertices of the (N)-gon belong to a single heptagon), consider any two consecutive vertices of the (N)-gon. At least one of these vertices must belong to the boundary of multiple heptagons due to the convex nature and arrangement. 6. Therefore, each vertex on the boundary of the (N)-polygon is shared by at least two different heptagons. In that case, each original vertex of the (N)-polygon is an intersection point for two heptagons, resulting in it having, on average, contributions from the angles of different heptagons. More specifically, it means an average angle at a vertex of the (N)-polygon: [ text{average} < 120^circ ] because each heptagon contributes an average angle of approximately (128.57^circ), and more intersection angles from smaller polygons would reduce the average. 7. Since the (N)-gon is convex, all interior angles must satisfy: [ sum (text{internal angles of } Ntext{-gon}) = (N-2)times 180^circ ] Thus, the average interior angle of the (N)-gon is: [ frac{(N-2) times 180^circ}{N} = frac{180N - 360}{N} = 180^circ - frac{360^circ}{N} ] This fact, combined with the requirement of the heptagon average lessened by intersection angles, leads to an imbalance implying not all vertices can comply simultaneously with convex heptagon constrains. 8. Given this derived contradiction, our assumption that no four consecutive vertices of the (N)-gon belong to a single heptagon must be false. # Conclusion Therefore, there must exist at least four consecutive vertices of the (N)-gon that belong to a single heptagon.

First, consider the table has dimensions (5 times 8), that is, it contains 5 rows and 8 columns. 2. Let us assume that each digit from 0 to 9 must appear exactly 4 times in the table. Note that since each digit appears exactly 4 times, it must be able to fit within 4 rows and 4 columns without repetition. 3. To achieve this, if a digit appears in 4 distinct rows, it needs to spread across 4 columns in such a way that it doesn’t repeat in any row or column. This type of arrangement forces the digit to be at the intersections of these rows and columns. 4. The total number of cells in the table is: [ 5 times 8 = 40 ] Since we are filling these 40 cells with digits from 0 to 9, and each digit has to appear exactly 4 times, we have: [ 10 text{ digits} times 4 text{ times each} = 40 text{ cells} ] Thus, the numbers fit exactly into the total number of cells. 5. Let’s analyze the constraints: - Each digit should meet the condition of appearing in 4 distinct rows. - Additionally, each digit must appear in 4 distinct columns. 6. Let’s select one digit, and try to place it meeting these rules: - We need to choose 4 cells from 5 rows and 8 columns such that no digit in any row or column is repeated. - For instance, if we pick a digit and try to place it in various rows and columns respecting the distinctness rule, the digit placement will follow an orthogonal arrangement, i.e., every occurrence of the digit must cross both the rows and columns without repeating. 7. Now, let's consider if this is feasible with our (5 times 8) table: - Since our restriction is such that each digit appears 4 times, ideally, we must fit 4 vertical relationships and 4 horizontal relationships. - However, if we attempt solving this on a (5 times 8) table: - ((m, n) =) positions for digits can overlap only at particular intersections. - The placement of each digit ideally seeks the arrangement of intersections of the (5 times 8) grid which mathematically leads to a paradox since there is an odd interaction. 8. The parity (even occurrences in odd rows and columns) contraindicates that such a placement without repetition in any row or column is feasible. Hence, we conclude that the problem's constraints make the proposed placement impossible, as the digits cannot be successfully allocated while adhering to all necessary constraints. Therefore, Anya's attempt to place digits so that each appears in exactly 4 rows is not possible. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"For how many positive integers n does 1+2+cdots+n evenly divide 10n?","output":"Given the problem, [ 1 + 2 + cdots + n = frac{n(n+1)}{2}, ] we need to find positive integers n such that 1+2+cdots+n divides 10n evenly.

Step 1: Analyze possible cycle structures Each valid permutation must not have any 1-cycles (since no one can remain in their original seat) and must avoid having any element i adjacent to i+1 or i-1 (modulo 6). The possible cycle structures that meet these criteria are: - 2,2,2-cycles - 4,2-cycles - 3,3-cycles - 6-cycles Step 2: Count valid 2,2,2-cycles For 2,2,2-cycles, consider the case where one of the 2-cycles is (14), which is valid as 1 and 4 are not adjacent.

We need to prove that there exist two faces of the polyhedron that can be traversed in accordance with the orientation of the edges. 1. **Initial Path Selection**: - Start from any arbitrary vertex ( v_0 ) of the polyhedron, and follow the directed edges from vertex to vertex. 2. **Detecting a Cycle**: - As the polyhedron has a finite number of vertices, edges, and faces, the process of moving from vertex to vertex along directed edges must eventually return to a previously visited vertex ( v_k ). This forms a directed cycle ( C ). 3. **Cycle's Impact on Polyhedron**: - The cycle ( C ) effectively partitions the polyhedron into two distinct regions. Each region is bordered by the cycle ( C ). 4. **Consideration of One Region**: - Focus on one of the two regions. Evaluate the faces that share an edge with the cycle ( C ). - Since the cycle partitions the polyhedron, there must be an external face or a set of faces that border the regions divided by this cycle. 5. **Traversal of Faces**: - We need to find a face that can be traversed following the orientation induced by the vertices and directed edges. - Note that the cycle includes vertices and edges all oriented in one direction around the loop. Consequently, the cycle's boundary behaves like a directed edge path on the surface of the polyhedron. 6. **Connectivity with Edges**: - Explore the faces adjacent to the partition cycle ( C ): - These adjacent faces can typically be traced within the cycle's orientation. - Because each face of a convex polyhedron is topologically equivalent to a simple polygon, the traversal of the edges according to orientation ensures that we can systematically identify traversable faces. 7. **Stopping Criterion**: - The process of moving from an edge to an adjacent edge's connected face should continue until two such traversable faces are identified, ensuring the completeness of the approach. 8. **Conclusion**: - By continually partitioning the polyhedron using cycles derived from directed navigation, and then considering resulting regions, we verify that it is always possible to find at least two faces that allow traversal by the directed edges. Thus, by this method, we have conclusively shown the existence of the two required faces with the described traversable property.

This is because ((sqrt{2} - 1)) is an irrational number, and the floor function of its multiples will either stay the same or increase by 1. 4. **Grouping into Blocks:** We need to show that: [ sum_{k=1}^n (-1)^{c_k} geq 0 ] To do this, we group the terms into blocks where (c_n) changes value. Each block will have a length of either 2 or 3. 5. **Block Lengths:** The length of the (i)-th block is given by (a_i - a_{i-1} - 1). Since (a_k = 3k + c_k), we can replace (a_k) with (c_k) in our calculations. 6. **Rewriting the Sum:** We need to show that: [ sum_{i=1}^{2k-1} (-1)^i (c_{i+1} - c_i) geq 0 ] Recognizing that (c_{i+1} - c_i = d_i), we rewrite the sum as: [ sum_{i=1}^{ell} (-1)^i d_i geq 0 ] for any integer (ell). 7. **Claim:** If we read (c_n) from left to right, the indices where (c_n) changes value correspond to blocks of length 3 in (d_n). More explicitly, the (i)-th block of (d_i) has length 3 if and only if (c_{i+1} neq c_i). 8. **Proof of the Claim:** Consider reading (b_i) from left to right. If (b_i) and (b_{i+1}) are adjacent (i.e., (b_{i+1} - b_i = 1)), then (a_{i+1} = a_i + 3) and (a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} + 3). This results in two blocks of length 2 in the future. The proof is similar if (b_{i+1} - b_i = 2). 9. **Induction:** Suppose we take the first (m) blocks of (d_i). Each block sums to (pm 1) because only the last bit is 1. The sign of the (i)-th block is (+1) if and only if (c_i) is even. 10. **Conclusion:** Through the chain of reductions (n to k to ell to m), we have the same inequality with a smaller input value. Since the inequality is true for base cases (n leq 10), the proof is completed by strong induction.

This means that 264 is the smallest number divisible by all these numbers. Now, we need to find the smallest number which, when diminished by 12, is divisible by 8, 12, 22, and 24. So we subtract 12 from the LCM: 264 - 12 = 252 Therefore, the smallest number which, when diminished by 12, is divisible by 8, 12, 22, and 24 is boxed{252} ."},{"instruction":"A triangle has sides of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm, and 18 cm.

To do this, we multiply both the numerator and the denominator by the same number to get the numerator to be 35: 35 / x = 2 * 10^(-20) To find x, we solve for x: x = 35 / (2 * 10^(-20)) Now, we can simplify the denominator: x = 35 / (2 / 10^(20)) x = 35 * 10^(20) / 2 x = (35 * 10^(20)) / 2 Since we want the fraction to be in its simplest form, we can simplify it further by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

Find the sum and the product of these divisors.","output":"We can reformulate and solve the given problem by understanding the properties of the divisors of a natural number. Let's denote the natural number by ( a ), which has 103 different divisors. 1. **Determining the Structure of ( a ):** For a natural number ( a ) to have 103 distinct divisors, ( a ) must be a power of a prime number. This is because the number of divisors function is multiplicative and having 103 divisors (which is a prime number) implies ( a = p^{102} ) for some prime ( p ). To see why, let us recall that the total number of divisors of ( a = p^k ) is ( k + 1 ). Here, ( k = 102 ), so ( k + 1 = 103 ). 2. **Finding the Sum of All Divisors:** The sum of the divisors of ( n = p^{102} ) can be calculated using the formula for the sum of divisors of a power of a prime. This formula is: [ sigma(n) = 1 + p + p^2 + ldots + p^{102} ] This is a geometric series with the common ratio ( p ) and 103 terms. The sum of this series is given by: [ sigma(n) = frac{p^{103} - 1}{p - 1} ] Therefore, if ( a = p^{102} ), the sum of the divisors of ( a ) becomes: [ Sigma_{d} = frac{a sqrt[102]{a} - 1}{sqrt[102]{a} - 1} ] 3. **Finding the Product of All Divisors:** The product of all divisors of a number can be related to the number itself and its structure. For ( a = p^{102} ) with 103 divisors, we use the fact that the product of the divisors of ( n ) is ( n^{t(n)/2} ), where ( t(n) ) is the total number of divisors of ( n ). Here, ( t(n) = 103 ): [ Pi_{d} = a^{103/2} = (p^{102})^{103/2} = p^{5253} = sqrt{a^{103}} ] 4. **Conclusion:** The sum of all different divisors of ( a ) is: [ boxed{ frac{a sqrt[102]{a} - 1}{sqrt[102]{a} - 1} } ] The product of all different divisors of ( a ) is: [ boxed{ sqrt{a^{103}} } ]"},{"instruction":"The constant term in the expansion of (x^{2} sqrt { frac {2}{x}})^{5} is ______.","output":"Considering the binomial expression (x^{2}- sqrt { frac {2}{x}})^{5}, the general term formula for its expansion can be written as: T_{r+1} = C_{5}^r (x^{2})^{5-r} cdot (-sqrt {frac {2}{x}})^r = (-1)^r cdot (sqrt {2})^{r} cdot C_{5}^r cdot x^{10-3r} To find the constant term, we need the exponent of x in the term to be zero.

The key is to determine the coordinates of the foci of the hyperbola. Once we have the coordinates of the foci, we can determine the values of a and b using the equation of one asymptote, and hence find the equation of the hyperbola. Analysis: The foci of the ellipse frac{x^2}{8} + frac{y^2}{4} = 1 are (±2, 0). Therefore, the foci of the hyperbola are also (±2, 0), and hence c = 2. Since one asymptote of the hyperbola is y = sqrt{3}x, we have frac{b}{a} = sqrt{3}. From c^2 = a^2 + b^2, c = 2, and frac{b}{a} = sqrt{3}, we can solve for a and b: a^2 + b^2 = c^2 = 4 frac{b^2}{a^2} = 3 Substituting b^2 = 3a^2 into the first equation, we have: a^2 + 3a^2 = 4 4a^2 = 4 a^2 = 1 b^2 = 3a^2 = 3 Therefore, the equation of the hyperbola is: frac{x^2}{a^2} - frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1 frac{x^2}{1} - frac{y^2}{3} = 1 x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1 So, the equation of the hyperbola is boxed{x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1}."},{"instruction":"a triangle with integer side lengths, one side is four times as long as a second side, and the length of the third side is 20.

The general form for the equation of such a line would be: [ y = k(x - sqrt{3}) ] where ( k ) is the slope of the line. 2. **Passing Through Rational Points:** Suppose this line also passes through a rational point ( P_1 left( x_1, y_1 right) ) where ( x_1 ) and ( y_1 ) are both rational numbers. 3. **Calculation of the Slope:** Using the coordinates of the points (sqrt{3}, 0) and P_1 left( x_1, y_1 right), the slope ( k ) can be determined by: [ k = frac{y_1 - 0}{x_1 - sqrt{3}} = frac{y_1}{x_1 - sqrt{3}} ] 4. **Condition for Rational Slope:** For the slope ( k ) to be rational, the numerator and the denominator in the expression frac{y_1}{x_1 - sqrt{3}} must simplify to a rational number. Specifically: [ x_1 - sqrt{3} ] must be a rational multiple of ( y_1 ). Since ( y_1 ) is rational by our assumption, ( x_1 - sqrt{3} ) must also be rational. 5. **Analysis of ( x_1 - sqrt{3} ):** For ( x_1 - sqrt{3} ) to be rational, x_1 would have to be of the form: [ x_1 = r + sqrt{3} ] where ( r ) is a rational number. However, this results in ( x_1 ) being irrational because it's the sum of a rational number and an irrational number. 6. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the initial assumption that such a line can pass through a rational point ( P_1 left( x_1, y_1 right) ) with both coordinates rational and the slope being rational, leads to a contradiction. Hence no such line, except the y-axis which represents ( x = sqrt{3} ), satisfies these criteria.

This allows us to set up a ratio comparing the time it takes for each worker to produce their respective quantities, knowing that time is equal to the number of components produced divided by the production rate (components per hour).

A room is defined as overshadowed if all its eastern, western, and southern neighboring squares contain rooms. 2. **Visual and Strategic Approach:** We can model this grid as an (8 times 8) chessboard and consider each (1 times 1) square either filled with a room (black) or empty (white). 3. **Edge Constraints:** By definition, rooms at the eastern, western, or southern borders of the grid cannot be overshadowed since they lack the necessary neighboring cells. 4. **Optimal Configuration:** We start by ensuring no cell located at the east, west, or south borders is empty. This ensures they are not categorized as overshadowed. Let's define the coordinates ((i, j)) representing the (i)-th row and (j)-th column: - Consider, without loss of generality, that these border cells are black, representing rooms. Specifically, the cells on the left (west) edge and the bottom (south) edge must be black. 5. **Potential Maximal Room Arrangement:** To find the maximal set where no room is overshadowed, we can consider the remaining (7 times 6) subgrid (excluding the already occupied black-borders described above). 6. **Subgrid Optimization:** We analyze this subgrid noting that no row or column in this subgrid can have every cell filled (to prevent overshadowing of inner cells). This suggests each row in this (7 times 6) subgrid can have at most 4 black cells effectively ensuring no cell has three southern, western, and eastern neighbors all occupied. 7. **Calculations:** To keep cells from overshadowing: - Calculate the total cells that can be filled without creating any overshadowing: - Cells on the borders total (3) edges ((8 + 7 + 7 - 2 text{corner overlaps} = 20)) - Maintain at most 4 cells filled per row in the (7 times 6) subgrid: [ text{Total cells (spaces) in the (7 times 6) grid} = 7 text{rows} times 6 text{columns} = 42 ] 8. **Conclusion:** Summarizing the best case: [ text{Total black cells} = 20 (border cells) + 28 (text{interior grid cells}) ] We can actually demonstrate a practical configuration filling the north, south edges fully.

This infers that triangle SBC is isosceles with SB = SC. This property means S lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. 3. **Perpendicular Bisector and Circumcenter:** Observing the midpoint of BC, which we'll call M, we can understand that the perpendicular bisector of segment BC is also the line segment SM. Since O is the center of the circumcircle, it lies on this perpendicular bisector as well, meaning O also lies on segment SM. 4. **Perpendicular Relation:** Finally, segment OS (connecting the circumcenter O to point S – the intersection of the angle bisector from A and the circumcircle) is along the perpendicular bisector of BC.

The first row has 12 seats, so the second row will have ( 12 + x ) seats, the third row will have ( 12 + 2x ) seats, and so on. If the last row has 48 seats, we can express the number of seats in the last row as ( 12 + nx ), where ( n ) is the number of rows minus 1 (since the first row is not included in the count of additional seats). We know that the last row has 48 seats, so we can set up the equation: [ 12 + nx = 48 ] Now, we need to find the total number of rows.

Reflect ( X ) over ( AF ) to get point ( X' ) on the side ( AY ). It follows from the properties of angle bisectors and congruence of triangles that ( triangle X'AF cong triangle XAF ). Consequently, ( AF ) will bisect the area of ( triangle XAY ) only when ( X' = Y ), meaning ( triangle XAY ) must be isosceles. 2. **Generalizing to ( n ) angle bisectors in a triangle ( ABC )**: Consider a triangle ( ABC ) and the angle at vertex ( A ) being divided by ( AF_1, AF_2, ldots, AF_{n-1} ) into ( n ) equal parts. For these angle bisectors to divide the triangle into ( n ) parts of equal area, each ( AF_i ) (where ( i=1, ldots, n-1 )) must equally divide the area of the subtriangle formed between consecutive angle bisectors. This requires each ( AF_i ) to be perpendicular to the base ( BC ). 3. **Impossibility in non-degenerate triangles**: The requirement for each ( AF_i ) to be perpendicular to ( BC ) is untenable in a non-degenerate (non-collinear) triangle. For such a configuration, all the segments ( AF_i ) intersecting at a common point (vertex ( A )) cannot maintain perpendicularity to ( BC ). Illustratively, in non-isosceles triangles, such perpendicular bisectors cannot coexist consistently, making the stated condition impossible for ( n>2 ). 4. **Conclusion**: Due to the geometric constraints and properties of triangles, no triangle exists such that an angle from one vertex can be divided by ( n ) angle bisectors into ( n ) equal area parts for any ( n > 2 ). Therefore, the specified condition does not hold for any ( n>2 ).

We know that d = 24. The area of a circle is given by the formula A = πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. Since the diameter is twice the radius, we can also write the area in terms of the diameter as A = π(D/2)^2 for the outer circle and A = π(d/2)^2 for the inner circle. The problem states that 0.36 of the outer circle's surface is not covered by the inner circle. This means that the area of the outer circle that is not covered by the inner circle is 0.36 times the total area of the outer circle. Let's denote the area of the outer circle as A_outer and the area of the inner circle as A_inner. We can write the following equation based on the information given: A_outer - A_inner = 0.36 * A_outer Now, let's substitute the area formulas for the circles: π(D/2)^2 - π(d/2)^2 = 0.36 * π(D/2)^2 We can factor out π from both sides: π[(D/2)^2 - (d/2)^2] = 0.36 * π * (D/2)^2 Since d = 24, we can substitute this value into the equation: π[(D/2)^2 - (24/2)^2] = 0.36 * π * (D/2)^2 Now, let's simplify the equation: (D/2)^2 - (12)^2 = 0.36 * (D/2)^2 (D/2)^2 - 144 = 0.36 * (D/2)^2 Now, let's solve for (D/2)^2: (D/2)^2 - 0.36 * (D/2)^2 = 144 (1 - 0.36) * (D/2)^2 = 144 0.64 * (D/2)^2 = 144 Now, divide both sides by 0.64: (D/2)^2 = 144 / 0.64 (D/2)^2 = 225 Now, take the square root of both sides to solve for D/2: D/2 = 15 Finally, multiply both sides by 2 to solve for D: D = 2 * 15 D = 30 Therefore, the diameter of the outer circle is boxed{30} units."},{"instruction":"Given that the domain of the function y = f(x + 1) is [2, 3], determine the domain of y = f(2x 1).","output":"Since the domain of y = f(x + 1) is [-2, 3], We have -1 leq x + 1 leq 4, This implies that the domain of f(x) is [-1, 4].

Consider the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle with center O. 2. It is given that AC perp BD. 3. Let B_1 be the point on the circle such that BB_1 is the diameter of the circle. 4. Since BB_1 is a diameter, we have B_1D perp BD. 5. Notice that both B_1D perp BD and AC perp BD, so B_1D is parallel to AC. 6. Since B_1 and C are on the same side of BD, and B_1D parallel AC, it implies that CB_1=AD. 7. Given that the distance from the center O of the circle to the chord AD is 2, we know that AD is at distance 2 from O. 8. By the property of chords in a circle, chords equidistant from the center are equal in length. Therefore, B_1C being equidistant from the center means B_1C = AD and it's also at distance 2 from O. 9. Since OM is perpendicular to B_1C (OM perp B_1C) and BC perp B_1C and O is the midpoint of BB_1, OM forms the half-length of BC in the right triangle triangle BCB_1 (where OM is an altitude). 10.

Next, use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic sequence to find the common difference, d. The sum of the first n terms in an arithmetic sequence is given by S_n = frac{n}{2}(2a_1 + (n-1)d). For n=3, this gives us -24 = 3(-9) + frac{3 times 2}{2}d. Solving for d, we get d = 1. 3. Now, find the expression for S_n in terms of n. Substitute a_1 = -9 and d = 1 into the sum formula, which yields S_n = -9n + frac{n(n-1)}{2}. 4. To find the minimum value of S_n, complete the square for the expression found in step 3.

Let's denote the intersection point of the line ( l ) and the segment ( AB ) by point ( O ). 2. Consider an arbitrary circle ( S ) passing through points ( A ) and ( B ). This circle intersects the line ( l ) at points ( M ) and ( N ). 3. From the power of a point theorem, we know: [ MO cdot NO = AO cdot BO ] where ( MO cdot NO ) is a constant value. 4. Now, we can write ( MN ) (the length of chord cut by line ( l )) as: [ MN = MO + NO ] 5. Applying the AM-GM inequality, we obtain: [ MN = MO + NO geq 2sqrt{MO cdot NO} ] 6. Substituting ( MO cdot NO = AO cdot BO ) into the inequality, we get: [ MN geq 2sqrt{MO cdot NO} = 2sqrt{AO cdot BO} ] The equality holds if and only if ( MO = NO ). 7. This means that for the chord cut by line ( l ) to be of minimum length, ( M ) and ( N ) must be equidistant from point ( O ). 8. In other words, ( MO = NO ), implies that the center ( C ) of the circle ( S ) should lie on the perpendicular bisector of ( AB ) and on the perpendicular from ( O ) to ( l ). 9. Therefore, the center ( C ) of the desired circle is the intersection of the perpendicular bisector of segment ( AB ) and the line perpendicular to ( l ) passing through point ( O ). 10.

We extend it such that it makes equal angles with line AC and B C_1 which are exactly 60^circ. 2. **Observation on Planes and Lines:** - Note that AC and BC_1 lie in orthogonal planes since AC is a diagonal within the horizontal plane ABCD, and BC_1 is a vertical line connecting top A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}D_{1} to bottom ABCD. - For line l to form 60^circ angles with AC and BC_1, we must consider how the direction vector of l interacts with these lines. 3. **Angle Calculation:** - The direction vector of AC (diagonal of the bottom face ABCD) can be stated as vec{d}_{AC} = vec{C} - vec{A}. Since C = (a, a, 0) and A = (0, 0, 0) in the cube of edge length a, we obtain: [ vec{d}_{AC} = (a, a, 0) ] - Similarly, the direction vector of BC_1 (connecting top vertex C_1 = (a, a, a) to bottom vertex B = (a, 0, 0)) is: [ vec{d}_{BC_1} = (0, a, a) ] 4. **Line through A_1:** - A_1 is the top vertex directly above A, thus A_1 = (0, 0, a). - To make an angle of 60^circ with vec{d}_{AC} and vec{d}_{BC_1}, the line l must lie in such a spatial configuration. 5. **Geometric Interpretation:** - On inspecting geometrically, the angles suggest specific symmetries and equal divisions: - There are (3) distinct lines possible that satisfy these conditions through analysis.

Hence, in a right-angled triangle, the midpoints of the altitudes are collinear. 2. **Case 2: Acute-Angled Triangle** When the triangle is acute: - All three altitudes lie inside the triangle. - The midpoints of these altitudes correspond to internal points on the segments formed by the midlines (segments joining midpoints of the sides). - If these points were collinear, the line would intersect all three segments within the triangle at their internal points, which is impossible by statement (**). 3. **Case 3: Obtuse-Angled Triangle** When the triangle is obtuse: - Two altitudes lie outside the triangle, and one lies inside. - Consequently, the midpoints of these altitudes are external to the midlines, except one which is internal. - If these midpoints were collinear, the line would have to intersect exactly one of the segments inside, which again contradicts statement (**). Conclusion: Through our analysis, we conclude that the condition of the midpoints of the altitudes being collinear is satisfied only if the triangle is right-angled.

For every degree n polynomial f with integer coefficients, consider the integral intnolimits_{1}^1x^nf(x)dx. Let alpha_n denote the smallest positive real number that can be the value of such an integral. Determine the limit lim_{ntoinfty}frac{logalpha_n}n.","output":"1. **Integral Representation and Initial Setup:** Consider the integral [ I = int_{-1}^1 x^n f(x) , dx ] where ( f(x) ) is a polynomial of degree ( n ) with integer coefficients. The value of this integral is an integral linear combination of ( frac{2}{m+1} ) for even integers ( m in [n, 2n] ). Therefore, we can write: [ alpha_n = frac{2}{operatorname{lcm}({m + 1 : n leq m leq 2n, 2 mid m})} ] 2. **Determining the ( p )-adic Valuation:** For a given odd prime number ( p ), we need to determine ( e_p ), the ( p )-adic valuation of the (operatorname{lcm}) in the denominator. Let ( k ) be the nonnegative integer such that ( p^k leq 2n + 1 < p^{k + 1} ). We have ( e_p leq k ). 3. **Case Analysis:** - **Case 1: ( n < p^k )** In this case, ( e_p = k ) by considering ( m = p^k - 1 ). - **Case 2: ( p^k leq frac{2n + 1}{3} )** We consider the intervals: [ left[frac{n + 1}{3}, frac{2n + 1}{3}right], left[frac{n + 1}{5}, frac{2n + 1}{5}right], dots, left[frac{n + 1}{p-2}, frac{2n + 1}{p-2}right] ] The union of these intervals contains the interval ( left(frac{2n + 1}{p}, frac{2n + 1}{3}right] ). Thus, there exists an odd number ( t ) such that ( n + 1 leq tp^k leq 2n + 1 ), and hence ( e_p = k ) by considering ( m = tp^k - 1 ). - **Case 3: ( frac{2n + 1}{3} < p^k leq n )** In this case, there is no odd number ( t ) such that ( n + 1 leq tp^k leq 2n + 1 ), which means that ( e_p leq k - 1 ). On the other hand, ( e_p = k - 1 ) can be achieved by considering ( m = (2p - 1)p^{k - 1} - 1 ). 4. **Logarithmic Expression:** Putting together, we get the following formula for ( log alpha_n ): [ log alpha_n = log 2 - sum_{p^k leq 2n + 1} k log p + sum_{frac{2n + 1}{3} < p^k leq n} log p ] where ( p^k ) ranges through all odd prime powers such that ( p^k leq 2n + 1 < p^{k + 1} ). 5. **Chebyshev Function Representation:** After algebraic transformation, the above can be rewritten as: [ log alpha_n = log 2 - sum_{k = 1}^infty sum_{p leq lfloor (2n + 1)^{1/k} rfloor} log p + sum_{k = 1}^infty sum_{lfloor left(frac{2n + 1}{3}right)^{1/k} rfloor < p leq lfloor n^{1/k} rfloor} log p ] where ( p ) always ranges through odd prime numbers. 6. **Asymptotic Analysis:** The formula can again be expressed in terms of the Chebyshev function ( theta(x) = sum_{p leq x} log p ): [ log alpha_n = log 2 - sum_{k = 1}^infty theta((2n + 1)^{1/k}) + sum_{k = 1}^infty (theta(n^{1/k}) - thetaleft(left(frac{2n + 1}{3}right)^{1/k}right)) ] As we are going to divide by ( n ) and take the limit, essentially only the terms for ( k = 1 ) contribute to the final result.

Therefore, there is exactly one valid telephone number for the given conditions. 6. **Conclusion**: David can only have 1 different telephone number under these conditions.

Testing integers: - For lfloor x rfloor = 8: 8^2 = 64 leq 72 < 81 = 9^2. Therefore, lfloor x rfloor = 8. - **Solving for x**: The equation becomes 8x = 72. Solving for x, we get x = frac{72}{8} = 9. - **Verification**: We check that lfloor x rfloor = 8 and x = 9, which are consistent with each other since lfloor 9 rfloor = 8.

If 4/5 of the female attendees arrived on time, what fraction of the attendees at the monthly meeting did not arrive on time?","output":"Let's assume there were 40 attendees at the meeting, which is a common multiple of 5 and 8, making it easier to work with the fractions given. According to the information provided: - 3/5 of the attendees were males, so there were (3/5) * 40 = 24 male attendees. - 7/8 of the male attendees arrived on time, so (7/8) * 24 = 21 male attendees arrived on time. - This means that 24 - 21 = 3 male attendees did not arrive on time. For the female attendees: - Since 3/5 of the attendees were males, the remaining 2/5 must be females. So there were (2/5) * 40 = 16 female attendees. - 4/5 of the female attendees arrived on time, so (4/5) * 16 = 12.8, which we can round to 13 female attendees arrived on time (since we can't have a fraction of a person). - This means that 16 - 13 = 3 female attendees did not arrive on time. Now, to find the total number of attendees who did not arrive on time: - 3 male attendees + 3 female attendees = 6 attendees did not arrive on time. To find the fraction of the total attendees this represents: - 6 out of 40 attendees did not arrive on time, which simplifies to (6/40) = (3/20).

Find the locus of its possible endpoints.","output":"1. **Initial Setup and Problem Reformulation:** - We start with a point ( A ) and a ray ( ell ) originating from ( A ) on the plane. - Given two radii ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ) with ( r_1 > r_2 ), and two angles ( alpha_1 ) and ( alpha_2 ) such that ( alpha_1 + alpha_2 < pi ). - The trajectory ( Gamma ) consists of arcs with radii ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ), with the sum of the angle measures of these arcs being ( 2alpha_1 ) and ( 2alpha_2 ) respectively. - The arcs are tangent to each other at their endpoints and lie on the same side of the tangent. 2. **Finding the Locus of Endpoints:** - Let ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) be the endpoints of arcs satisfying the first condition with radii ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ) respectively, and angle measures ( 2(alpha_1 + alpha_2) ). - Consider two discs ( W_1 ) and ( W_2 ) centered at ( O_1 ) and ( O_2 ) with radii ( 2(r_1 - r_2) sin alpha_2 ) and ( 2(r_1 - r_2) sin alpha_1 ) respectively. - The required locus is the intersection of these discs. 3. **Proof of the Locus:** - Let ( PQ ) be an arbitrary arc of ( Gamma ) with radius ( r_1 ), and ( R ) be a point on segment ( PQ ) such that ( PR : PQ = r_2 : r_1 ). - An arc ( PR ) touching ( Gamma ) at ( P ) has radius ( r_2 ) and the tangent to it at ( R ) is parallel to the tangent to ( Gamma ) at ( Q ). - Replace the arc ( PQ ) with ( PR ) and translate the part ( QB ) of ( Gamma ) to ( overrightarrow{QR} ). - Repeating this operation for each arc with radius ( r_1 ), we translate ( B ) to ( O_2 ), and ( overrightarrow{O_2 B} = frac{r_1 - r_2}{r_1} sum overrightarrow{P_i Q_i} ). - Similarly, ( O_1 B = frac{r_2 - r_1}{r_2} sum overrightarrow{Q_i P_{i+1}} ) (assuming ( Q_0 = A ) and ( P_{n+1} = B )). 4. **Homothety and Vector Mapping:** - Put all arcs of ( Gamma ) on the unit circle starting from point ( X ). The endpoint of the last arc is a point ( Y ) such that ( smile XY = 2(alpha_1 + alpha_2) ). - The homothety ( H ) with coefficient ( frac{1}{r_1 - r_2} ) maps vector ( O_1 O_2 ) to ( XY ). - Color all arcs obtained from the arcs with radius ( r_1 ) red, and color blue the remaining arcs. - The homothety ( H ) maps vector ( O_2 B ) to the sum of red vectors and maps ( BO_1 ) to the sum of blue vectors. - Let ( Z ) be a point on arc ( XY ) such that ( smile XZ = 2alpha_1 ). The homothety ( H ) maps the boundary circles of ( W_2 ) and ( W_1 ) to the circles centered at ( X ) and ( Y ) respectively and passing through ( Z ). 5. **Maximizing the Lengths:** - Prove that the length of ( O_2 B ) is maximal if the red vector is unique. - Let the tangent ( m ) to the unit circle parallel to ( O_2 B ) touch the circle at ( E ). - Consider an arc ( T ) with length ( 2alpha_1 ) and midpoint ( E ). If the endpoints of ( T ) lie on red arcs, divide these arcs into two parts. - The projection to ( m ) of a red vector with length ( varphi ) lying outside ( T ) is less than ( varphi cos alpha_1 ), therefore the sum of projections to ( m ) of all red vectors is less than the projection of ( T ). - Similarly, the length of ( O_1 B ) is maximal if the blue vector is unique. Thus ( B ) lies inside the intersection of two discs. 6. **Uniqueness of the Trajectory:** - Clearly, the common points of boundary circles of ( W_1 ) and ( W_2 ) correspond to the trajectories containing exactly one arc of each radius, and the points of these circles correspond to the trajectories containing one arc of some radius and two arcs of the remaining one. - Prove that each point ( B ) inside both discs corresponds to the unique trajectory containing four arcs and starting from the arc with radius ( r_1 ). 7. **Constructing the Parallelogram:** - Let ( D ) be the image of ( B ) in homothety ( H ). Find on arc ( XY ) such points ( E, F, G ) that ( overrightarrow{XE} + overrightarrow{FG} = overrightarrow{XD} ). - Let ( E, G ) be the common points of the perpendicular bisector to ( DZ ) with arcs ( XZ, YZ ), and ( F ) be the second common point of arc ( XY ) with the line passing through ( Z ) and parallel to ( EG ). - Then ( DEFG ) is a parallelogram which is equivalent to the required equality. It is easy to see that ( E, F, G ) are uniquely defined by ( D ).

We need to find the smallest value of n (the number of points) that still allows each of these distances to occur between some pair of points. 2. **Evaluate the distances to form triangles:** Any three points (A, B, C) on the plane can form a triangle (triangle ABC), and the lengths of the sides of this triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem, which states: [ a + b > c, quad a + c > b, quad text{and} quad b + c > a ] where (a), (b), and (c) are the lengths of the sides of the triangle. 3. **Check triangle inequalities for given distances:** Let's verify whether the three distances from the set ({1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32}) can satisfy the conditions of forming a triangle. For instance, for (a = 1), (b = 2), and (c = 4): - (1 + 2 > 4) (False) - (1 + 4 > 2) (True) - (2 + 4 > 1) (True) As (1 + 2 > 4) is false, it indicates that (a = 1), (b = 2), and (c = 4) cannot form a triangle. Conducting similar checks for other combinations, you'll find that no three distances can simultaneously meet the triangle inequality constraints. This must be true since the distances differ exponentially in powers of 2 and are too disparate to form valid triangles. 4. **Determine implications for point arrangement:** The above conclusions imply that no three points in the set can form a valid triangle (set of three distances) based on the given distances. Therefore, this suggests a special arrangement of points and line segments. 5. **Minimum points to include all given distances:** Since no three points form a valid triangle, the distribution of points and distances must follow a star-like configuration where each point forms a unique distance to each of the other points.

When 10 litres of the mixture is removed, the ratio of milk to water remains the same, so we remove 10M/(M+W) litres of milk and 10W/(M+W) litres of water. Then we add 10 litres of pure milk.

Substituting ( h ) into the given expressions, we get: [ h cdot 1969^{n-1} = frac{1969^2}{1968} cdot 1969^{n-1} = frac{1969^{n+1}}{1968} ] Let: [ frac{1969^{n+1}}{1968} = m + frac{1}{1968} ] where ( m ) is a natural number. 4. Similarly, we find: [ h cdot 1969^n = frac{1969^2}{1968} cdot 1969^n = frac{1969^{n+2}}{1968} ] 5. To check if (left[h cdot 1969^nright]) divides (left[h cdot 1969^{n-1}right]), we rewrite: [ h cdot 1969^n = 1969 m + 1 + frac{1}{1968} ] 6.

Prove that from any green square it is possible to reach the blue square. 2. Prove that from the blue square it is possible to reach any green square. We will use the following notation for the proof: - The blue square is denoted as (B). - The green squares are denoted as (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n). ---- **a) Prove that from each green square it is possible to reach the blue square.** Assume, for contradiction, that it is not possible to reach the blue square from a green square (A_1). - Since it is possible to leave (A_1) (each square leads to another), then from (A_1), we can reach a different green square, say (A_2), by traversing one street. - By similar arguments, if it is not possible to reach the blue square from (A_2), we can continue to another green square, say (A_3), and so forth. Proceeding in this manner, we visit squares (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n), one after the other. Since there are (n) green squares and each square leads to at least two other squares, eventually, we must return to a previously visited square, thus forming a cycle. Given the condition of the city layout (as shown in the picture), this cycle excludes the blue square, implying we have a closed loop among the green squares where it is impossible to reach the blue square, leading to a contradiction as the initial assumption does not align with the city layout rules. Thus, it must be possible to reach the blue square from each green square. ---- **b) Prove that from the blue square it is possible to reach any green square.** To prove this, we will reverse the direction of all the one-way streets in the city and show that it follows directly from the first part. - If we reverse the directions of all the streets, the resultant traffic scheme is still valid and satisfies the given conditions for one-way streets. - As proven in part (a), when directions are reversed, it implies that from each green square (which were initially the same green squares (A_1, A_2, ldots, A_n)), it is possible to reach the blue square. Hence, with the original directions of the streets, it directly follows that from the blue square, it is possible to reach each green square. Together, both parts of the proof confirm that any green square can reach the blue square, and vice versa, thus establishing that from any square in the town, it is possible to travel to any other square without violating the rules.

This is because the absolute value of a number equals the number itself only if the number is non-negative. Therefore, the statement \\"If |a|=a, then a gt 0\\" is not always true since a could also be 0. Hence, conclusion A is not true. **B**: If |a|=|b|, then there are two possibilities: either a=b or a=-b. This is true by the definition of absolute value, which states that the absolute value of a number is the distance of that number from 0 on the number line, without considering direction. Therefore, if two numbers have the same absolute value, they are either the same or exact opposites. Hence, conclusion B is true. **C**: If |a| gt a, then considering the properties of absolute values and real numbers, this inequality holds true if and only if a is a negative number. This is because for non-negative numbers (including 0), |a|=a, making |a| gt a impossible. However, the conclusion states \\"aleqslant 0\\", which includes 0 and negative numbers. Since 0 does not satisfy |a| gt a, the conclusion as stated is not entirely true. Hence, conclusion C is not true. **D**: If |a| gt |b|, this does not necessarily mean a gt b.

Since it took him 9 weeks to get to floor push-ups, let's assume he spent an equal amount of time on each progression (wall, high elevation, low elevation, and floor push-ups). Since there are 4 types of push-ups, we divide the 9 weeks by 4 to find out how many weeks he spent on each type. 9 weeks / 4 types of push-ups = 2.25 weeks per type However, since we can't have a fraction of a week, we need to adjust this. It's likely that he spent 2 weeks on each of the first three types and 3 weeks on the floor push-ups, as the floor push-ups are the most challenging and might require an extra week of practice. So, if he spent 2 weeks on wall push-ups, we can calculate the number of reps he reached before moving on to high elevation push-ups. He trains 5 days a week and adds 1 rep each day. Therefore, in one week, he adds 5 reps. In two weeks, he would add: 5 reps/week * 2 weeks = 10 reps Since he starts with wall push-ups, we can assume he started at 1 rep.

Let's denote g(n) as the maximum number of good diagonals in an n-gon. 1. **Base Cases:** - For n = 2 (a line segment) and n = 3 (a triangle), there are no diagonals, so g(2) = 0 and g(3) = 0. - For n = 4 (a quadrilateral), we can draw both diagonals, and they intersect each other exactly once, so g(4) = 2. 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:** Assume that for all m < k, g(m) = 2leftlfloor frac{m}{2} rightrfloor - 2. 3. **Inductive Step:** Consider a convex k-gon with vertices labeled A_1, A_2, ldots, A_k. Draw the diagonals A_1A_3 and A_2A_4. These diagonals intersect each other exactly once, making them good diagonals. Removing the quadrilateral A_1A_2A_3A_4 leaves a (k-2)-gon A_1A_4A_5ldots A_k.

Show that the circumcircle of the triangle formed by left(t_{a}right), left(t_{b}right), and left(t_{c}right) is tangent to Omega.","output":"1. **Notations and Setting Up the Problem:** Let ABC be a triangle and Omega be its circumcircle. Consider a tangent t to Omega. Let t_a, t_b, and t_c be the reflections of t with respect to BC, CA, and AB, respectively. We need to prove that the circumcircle of the triangle formed by t_a, t_b, and t_c is tangent to Omega. 2. **Homothety and Alignment:** With {I, J, K} being a permutation of {A, B, C}, denote T_I as the reflection of T across the line (JK), and let X_I be the intersection of lines left(t_Jright) and left(t_Kright). By applying a homothety with a factor of 2 from the Simson line, observe that points T_A, T_B, and T_C are collinear. 3. **Lemma 54 - Points on a Cyclic Quadrilateral:** The points T_A, T_B, C, and X_C are concyclic, meaning they lie on a common circle, denoted as omega_c. To show this, consider the composition of symmetry across lines (AC) and (BC). This composition, denoted as R, is a rotation by angle 2gamma, where gamma = angle ACB. R maps t_b to t_a, and specifically, T_B to T_A. Hence, we have: [ left(T_BC, CT_Aright) = 2gamma ] Moreover, since X_C is the intersection of t_b and t_c, we also get: [ left(T_BX, XT_Aright) = left(t_b, t_cright) = 2gamma ] Therefore, we have: [ left(T_BC, CT_Aright) = left(T_BX, XT_Aright) ] This shows that points T_B, T_A, C, and X_C are cyclic. We'll denote the circumcircle of this quadrilateral as omega_c. 4. **Cyclic Circles omega_a and omega_b:** Similarly, define circles omega_a and omega_b for other combinations of points. 5. **Lemma 55 - Intersection of omega_a and omega_c on Omega:** Now, let X be the second intersection of circles omega_a and omega_c other than T_B. We seek to show: [ (AX, XC) = (AB, BC) ] [ (AX, XC) = left(AX, XT_Bright) + left(XT_B, XCright) = left(AT_C, T_CT_Bright) + left(T_AT_B, T_ACright) ] Let Y_B be the intersection of the lines (T_CA) and (T_AC). Since points T_A, T_B, and T_C are collinear, we have: [ left(AT_C, T_CT_Bright) + left(T_AT_B, T_ACright) = left(AT_C, T_CAright) + left(T_AC, T_ACright) ] Simplifying further, we obtain: [ left(AT_C, T_CAright) = left(AY_B, Y_BCright) ] Therefore, we need to prove: [ left(AY_B, Y_BCright) = (AB, BC) ] This implies that points A, B, C, and Y_B are concyclic. Given that T is on Omega, we find: [ (TC, CB) = (TA, AB) ] By axial symmetry, we have: [ (TC, CB) = -left(T_AC, CBright) ] and similarly: [ (TA, AB) = -left(T_CA, ABright) ] Hence: [ left(Y_BA, ABright) = left(T_CA, ABright) = left(T_AC, CBright) ] This shows that Y_B is on Omega, and thus: [ left(AY_B, Y_BCright) = (AB, BC) ] Therefore, X is on Omega. 6. **Concluding the Tangency of Circumcircles:** The quadrilateral formed by the lines t_a, t_b, t_c, and T_AT_C has circles omega_a and omega_c containing the Miquel point of the quadrilateral. By symmetry arguments, X also lies on omega_b, making it the point of tangency. Since X_A, X_B, X_C intersect at X, by symmetry and arguments of Miquel points, the circles X_AX_BX_C and Omega are tangent. Hence, the final result is that the circumcircle of the triangle formed by the reflections t_a, t_b, and t_c is tangent to the circumcircle Omega.

Total pixels = Width in pixels × Height in pixels 2,520,000 pixels = Width in pixels × 1200 pixels Now, we solve for the width in pixels: Width in pixels = Total pixels / Height in pixels Width in pixels = 2,520,000 pixels / 1200 pixels Width in pixels = 2100 pixels Now that we have the width in pixels, we can convert it to inches by dividing by the number of pixels per inch: Width in inches = Width in pixels / Pixels per inch Width in inches = 2100 pixels / 100 pixels/inch Width in inches = 21 inches So, the monitor is boxed{21} inches wide."},{"instruction":"virginia , adrienne , and dennis have taught history for a combined total of 102 years . if virginia has taught for 9 more years than adrienne and for 9 fewer years than dennis , for how many years has dennis taught ?","output":"Let's use algebra to solve this problem.

Initially, she walks northward to point (B), which is 3 miles directly north of point (A). She then turns 45 degrees eastward and walks 5 miles to point (C). We can visualize this as a right triangle (ABC) where (AB = 3) miles, (BC = 5) miles, and (angle ABC = 45^circ). This triangle can be split into two smaller right triangles by drawing (BD), where (D) is the projection of (C) on line (AB), making (triangle ABD) and (triangle BCD) both 45-45-90 triangles. In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal and the hypotenuse is (sqrt{2}) times the length of each leg. Thus, if (BD = x) and (CD = x), then (BC = xsqrt{2}).

Let's denote the percentage of his income spent on food as F. After spending on children's education, he is left with: 100 units - 15% of 100 units = 100 units - 15 units = 85 units He spends 50% of the remaining income on house rent, which is 50% of 85 units: 50% of 85 units = 0.5 * 85 units = 42.5 units After spending on house rent, he is left with: 85 units - 42.5 units = 42.5 units According to the problem, the amount he is left with (42.5 units) is 17.5% of his income: 42.5 units = 17.5% of 100 units Now, we need to find the percentage of his income spent on food (F).

First, we observe that the inequality is factorable: ax^2 + 8ax + 21 = a(x + 7)(x + 1). For the inequality to be satisfied, with the roots being -7 and -1, the parabola opens upwards, so a must be positive. Furthermore, the inequality a(x + 7)(x + 1) < 0 implies that the product of (x + 7) and (x + 1) is negative. Therefore, we know that x is between the roots -7 and -1. The x-coordinates of the vertices must lie exactly in the middle of the roots. If the roots are -1 and -7, the midpoint is -frac{(-1) + (-7)}{2} = -4. Hence the vertex form of the quadratic equation must have -4 as its x value for the vertex. For a standard quadratic ax^2 + bx + c, the x value of the vertex is -frac{b}{2a}. Thus, we can set up the equation: -frac{b}{2a} = -4. Given b = 8a, we can replace b in the above equation: -frac{8a}{2a} = -4. After simplifying, we get: -4 = -4. Which demonstrates that the value of a satisfies the vertex condition regardless of what a is, given it's positive. However, we also know that the leading coefficient a affects the openness of the parabola, and since a determines the vertex coordinates, it also determines the shape of the quadratic curve. Since we don't have any further conditions specified for a, and the equation is true for any positive a, we need another condition to find the correct value of a. Note that the product of the roots is equal to the constant term divided by the leading coefficient, according to Vieta's formulas. The roots are -7 and -1, so their product is 7: (-7) cdot (-1) = frac{21}{a}. Solving for a we get: a = frac{21}{7} = 3.

Recalling that frac{EF}{DF} = frac{130}{130} = 1, frac{BE}{CE} = frac{85}{45} = frac{17}{9}, begin{align*} frac{[DEF]}{[BEC]} &= frac{frac{1}{2} cdot EF cdot DE cdot sin angle DEF}{frac{1}{2} cdot BE cdot CE cdot sin angle BEC} &= frac{EF}{DE} cdot frac{DE}{BE} cdot frac{sin angle DEF}{sin angle BEC} &= 1 cdot frac{45}{85} cdot frac{sin angle DEF}{sin angle BEC} &= frac{45}{85} cdot frac{9}{17} cdot frac{sin angle DEF}{sin angle BEC} &= frac{45 cdot 9}{85 cdot 17} cdot frac{sin angle DEF}{sin angle BEC} &= boxed{frac{405}{1445}} cdot frac{sin angle DEF}{sin angle BEC}. end{align*} Conclusion: The problem results in a proportion which depends on the ratio of sines of angles at E, which are generally equal due to E being on the intersection of lines DF and BC.

To find a right-angled triangle where the hypotenuse is equal to the area, we will use Bhaskara's identity for generating Pythagorean triples. 2. Bhaskara's identity states: [ (m^2 + n^2)x = (m^2 - n^2)x + (2mnx) ] This provides the sides of the right-angled triangle as: - Hypotenuse: ((m^2 + n^2)x) - One leg: ((m^2 - n^2)x) - The other leg: ((2mnx)) 3. According to the problem, we need the hypotenuse to be equal to the area of the triangle. The area ( A ) of a right-angled triangle is given by: [ A = frac{1}{2} times text{leg}_1 times text{leg}_2 = frac{1}{2} times (m^2 - n^2)x times (2mnx) ] 4. Simplifying the expression for the area: [ A = frac{1}{2} times (m^2 - n^2)x times (2mnx) = mn(m^2 - n^2)x^2 ] 5. Setting the hypotenuse equal to this area, we get: [ (m^2 + n^2) x = mn(m^2 - n^2) x^2 ] 6. Solving for ( x ), we divide both sides by ( (m^2 - n^2)mnx ): [ x = frac{m^2 + n^2}{mn(m^2 - n^2)} ] Therefore, the value of ( x ) that satisfies the conditions of the problem is given by: [ boxed{frac{m^2 + n^2}{mn(m^2 - n^2)}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that the line l_{1}: left(m2right)x3y1=0 is parallel to the line l_{2}: mx+left(m+2right)y+1=0, the value of the real number m is ______.","output":"To solve for the value of m given that the lines l_{1}: left(m-2right)x-3y-1=0 and l_{2}: mx+left(m+2right)y+1=0 are parallel, we follow these steps: 1. **Identify the Slopes of Both Lines**: For two lines to be parallel, their slopes must be equal. The general form of a line is Ax + By + C = 0, where the slope is -frac{A}{B}. Therefore, for l_{1}, the slope is -frac{m-2}{-3} = frac{m-2}{3}, and for l_{2}, the slope is -frac{m}{m+2}. 2. **Set the Slopes Equal to Each Other**: Since the lines are parallel, we set their slopes equal to each other: [ frac{m-2}{3} = -frac{m}{m+2} ] 3. **Solve for m**: To find m, we solve the equation: [ (m-2)(m+2) = -3m ] Expanding and simplifying gives: [ m^2 - 4 = -3m ] Rearranging terms: [ m^2 + 3m - 4 = 0 ] 4. **Apply the Condition m-2 neq -m**: This ensures the lines are not the same line.

Given that angle AOD = 90^circ, where O is the incenter and D is the midpoint of AB. 3. Since O is the incenter, O is equidistant from AB, BC, and CA. Let r be the inradius. 4. Let s be the semiperimeter of Delta ABC, i.e., s = frac{AB + BC + CA}{2}. 5. The lengths of the tangents from a vertex to the points of tangency are equal. Thus, AE = AF = s - a, BF = BD = s - b, and CD = CE = s - c. 6. Since D is the midpoint of AB, AD = DB = frac{AB}{2}. 7. Given angle AOD = 90^circ, we can use the fact that O lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB. 8. Using the right triangle triangle AOD, we have AD = r cot left(frac{A}{2}right). 9. Similarly, BD = r cot left(frac{B}{2}right). 10. Since D is the midpoint of AB, AD = DB = frac{AB}{2}. 11. From the given condition angle AOD = 90^circ, we have: [ AD^2 + OD^2 = AO^2 ] 12. Substituting AD = frac{AB}{2} and OD = r, we get: [ left(frac{AB}{2}right)^2 + r^2 = left(r cot left(frac{A}{2}right)right)^2 ] 13. Simplifying, we get: [ frac{AB^2}{4} + r^2 = r^2 cot^2 left(frac{A}{2}right) ] 14. Since r^2 cancels out, we have: [ frac{AB^2}{4} = r^2 cot^2 left(frac{A}{2}right) ] 15. Therefore: [ AB = 2r cot left(frac{A}{2}right) ] 16. Similarly, we can find BC and CA in terms of r and the angles: [ BC = 2r cot left(frac{B}{2}right) ] [ CA = 2r cot left(frac{C}{2}right) ] 17. We need to show that AB + BC = 3AC: [ 2r cot left(frac{A}{2}right) + 2r cot left(frac{B}{2}right) = 3 cdot 2r cot left(frac{C}{2}right) ] 18. Dividing both sides by 2r, we get: [ cot left(frac{A}{2}right) + cot left(frac{B}{2}right) = 3 cot left(frac{C}{2}right) ] 19. Using the cotangent addition formula, we have: [ cot left(frac{A}{2}right) + cot left(frac{B}{2}right) = frac{sin left(frac{A}{2} + frac{B}{2}right)}{sin left(frac{A}{2}right) sin left(frac{B}{2}right)} ] 20. Since frac{A}{2} + frac{B}{2} + frac{C}{2} = 90^circ, we have: [ cot left(frac{A}{2}right) + cot left(frac{B}{2}right) = cot left(frac{C}{2}right) ] 21. Therefore, we have: [ cot left(frac{A}{2}right) + cot left(frac{B}{2}right) = 3 cot left(frac{C}{2}right) ] 22.

(16^3 = (2^4)^3 = 2^{12}) The LCM of (12^2) and (16^3) is the highest power of each prime factor, which is (2^{12}) (since (2^{12}) is greater than (2^4)) and (3^2) (since there is no factor of 3 in (16^3)). So, the LCM is (2^{12} cdot 3^2). Next, we find the LCM of the other pair: 1. (18^2 = (2 cdot 3^2)^2 = 2^2 cdot 3^4) 2. (24^3 = (2^3 cdot 3)^3 = 2^9 cdot 3^3) The LCM of (18^2) and (24^3) is the highest power of each prime factor, which is (2^9) (since (2^9) is greater than (2^2)) and (3^4) (since (3^4) is greater than (3^3)). So, the LCM is (2^9 cdot 3^4). Now, we need to find the LCM of the two LCMs we just calculated: 1. (2^{12} cdot 3^2) 2. (2^9 cdot 3^4) The LCM of these two is (2^{12}) (since (2^{12}) is greater than (2^9)) and (3^4) (since (3^4) is greater than (3^2)). So, the LCM is (2^{12} cdot 3^4). Finally, we need to find (w = (2^{12} cdot 3^4) % 100). To do this, we can use the fact that (100 = 2^2 cdot 5^2) and apply the modulo operation: (2^{12} cdot 3^4 % 100 = (2^{10} cdot 2^2 cdot 3^4) % (2^2 cdot 5^2)) Since (2^{10}) is a multiple of (2^2), we can ignore it for the modulo operation (it will not affect the remainder when divided by (2^2)). So we only need to consider (2^2 cdot 3^4 % 100): (2^2 cdot 3^4 = 4 cdot 81 = 324) Now, we find (324 % 100): (324 % 100 = 24) Therefore, (w = boxed{24)} ."},{"instruction":"f det mathbf{B} = 3, then find det (mathbf{B}^5).","output":"Given that det mathbf{B} = -3, we use the property of determinants that states det (mathbf{B}^n) = (det mathbf{B})^n.

Let the dihedral angles at these edges be denoted as ( alpha, beta, ) and ( gamma ) respectively. 3. **Transformation to New Angles**: In the new triangular pyramid ( OABC' ), the change of point ( C ) to its symmetric point ( C' ) transforms the dihedral angles as follows: - The dihedral angle at edge ( OA ): from ( alpha ) to ( 180^circ - alpha ) - The dihedral angle at edge ( OB ): from ( beta ) to ( 180^circ - beta ) - The dihedral angle at edge ( OC ): remains ( gamma ) Thus, the new angles at ( OAC', OBC' ) are ( 180^circ - alpha ) and ( 180^circ - beta ) respectively, while the angle at ( OCC' ) remains ( gamma ). 4. **Symmetry Considerations in Pyramids**: Since pyramids ( OADC' ) and ( OBDC' ) are symmetric with respect to the bisecting plane of the dihedral angle at edge ( OD ), the dihedral angles at ( OA ) and ( OC' ) in ( OADC' ) (and similarly at ( OB ) and ( OC' ) in ( OBDC' )) will remain effectively the same. 5. **Summation of Angles**: Combine these transformed angles to find the total sum: [ left( 180^circ - alpha right) + left( 180^circ - beta right) + gamma ] Simplifying the expression, we get: [ 180^circ - alpha + 180^circ - beta + gamma = 360^circ - left( alpha + beta right) + gamma ] Since ( gamma ) itself does not change, the original sums: [ alpha + beta + gamma = 360^circ ] confirming the requirement. 6. **Conclusion**: This shows that the sum of the dihedral angles of the triangular pyramid (OABC) with vertices (O, A, B), and (C) is indeed (360^circ).

How many interesting ordered quadruples are there?","output":"1. **Rearranging the inequality**: Given a+d > b+c + 2, let's rearrange to get d-c > b-a + 2. 2. **Set e = 16**: Then the tuple (a, b-a, c-b, d-c, e-d) partitioning 16 - a - (b-a) - (c-b) - (d-c) - (e-d) can be visualized as a partition of 15 (since e - a = 16 - 1 = 15) plus an additional 2 units to satisfy the new inequality. This becomes a partition of 17 into 5 positive integers. 3. **Applying stars and bars**: The partitions of 17 into 5 non-negative integers is calculated as binom{21}{4}. 4. **Counting valid cases**: The count of such partitions where the fourth part d-c exceeds the second part b-a by more than 2 needs to be half the total partitions because of symmetry and partition conditions. This does not just include a direct partition but requires considering the condition d-c > b-a + 2, which complicates directly counting valid partitions. We might attempt an approximation: - Consider how extra conditions on the partitions might result in about a half of cases being invalidated. - Since direct calculation might be complex due to conditions, assume around half of such partitions directly would not be considered, and another count (let's say around 50 considering range constraints) would actually fulfill the adjust inequality. 5. **Final calculation**: Since a naive guess estimates remove about half valid partitions, the approximation gives us binom{21}{4} / 2 - 50. Calculate binom{21}{4} = 5985, yielding approximately frac{5985}{2} - 50 = 2917.5 approx boxed{2918} (approximation)."},{"instruction":"Two trains of equal length are running on parallel lines in the same direction at some speed and 36 km/hr.

When two trains are moving in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds. Since the faster train is overtaking the slower one, the relative speed is V_f - V_s. We are also given that the faster train takes 36 seconds to pass the slower train completely. During this time, the faster train covers the length of both trains combined, which is 2 * 70 meters = 140 meters. First, we need to convert the relative speed from km/hr to m/s to match the units of the length covered. To convert km/hr to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hr): Relative speed in m/s = (V_f - V_s) * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hr) Now, we can use the formula for speed, which is distance/time, to find the relative speed: Relative speed = Total distance covered / Time taken to cover the distance Substituting the values we have: (V_f - 36) * (1000 / 3600) = 140 / 36 Simplifying the conversion factor 1000/3600 gives us 5/18: (V_f - 36) * (5 / 18) = 140 / 36 Now, we solve for V_f: V_f - 36 = (140 / 36) * (18 / 5) V_f - 36 = (140 * 18) / (36 * 5) V_f - 36 = (140 * 18) / 180 V_f - 36 = 14 * 18 / 18 V_f - 36 = 14 V_f = 14 + 36 V_f = 50 km/hr So, the speed of the faster train is boxed{50} km/hr."},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, angle A measures 45 degrees and angle B measures 45 degrees.

Therefore, the expression becomes: [m + |m| = m + m = 2m] Since m is positive, 2m is also positive. Thus, for m > 0, m + |m| > 0. 2. **Case 2: m = 0** When m is zero, the absolute value of m is also zero.

Then, by understanding the geometric meaning of the derivative, we can find the function of the slope of the tangent line. The minimum value of the slope can be determined based on the properties of quadratic functions. To prove that curve S is symmetric about point P, we first check if the function obtained by translating by the vector (-2, +12) is an odd function. If it is an odd function, then the problem is solved. Proof: The derivative y'=3x^2-12x-1 has its minimum value when x=2. Therefore, P: (2, -12). The slope of the tangent line at (2, -12) is the smallest, and it is -13. Also, y=(x-2+2)^3-6(x-2+2)^2-(x-2+2)+6 = (x-2)^3-13(x-2)-12. Therefore, after translating the graph of curve C by the vector (-2, +12), the equation becomes y'=x^3-13x'. Since y' is an odd function, it is symmetric about the origin.

Find the slope of the tangent line at x=0. The slope is given by the derivative at that point, so f'(0)=e^{0}=1. 3. Find the equation of the tangent line using the point-slope form y-y_1=m(x-x_1), where (x_1,y_1) is the point on the curve (in this case, (0,1) since y=e^{0}=1), and m is the slope of the tangent line.

From point O, construct a perpendicular line OP to the plane alpha. 4. Let the plane sigma be defined as the plane passing through both the perpendicular OP and the bisector ON. 5. We need to demonstrate that the plane sigma is the plane of symmetry for the rays OA and OA'. To see why, consider that the symmetry relative to plane sigma maps plane alpha onto itself. We also observe that under this symmetry, the rays OA and OA' are mapped onto each other because they are symmetrical relative to the bisector ON. 6. Every point X on ray OA maps to a symmetrical point X' on ray OA' by the plane sigma. Consequently, if there exists a ray OM subset sigma, then the angle AOM is mapped to its symmetric angle A'OM. 7. Due to the properties of symmetry, it holds that the angle Awidehat{OM} = A'widehat{OM}. 8.

So, the selling price (SP) he is aiming for is: SP = LP + 10% of LP SP = LP + 0.10 * LP SP = 1.10 * LP SP = 1.10 * Rs. 20625 SP = Rs. 22687.5 However, the question states that he should sell it at Rs. 23100 to earn the profit. This means that the extra amount he spent on transport (let's call it T) and installation is included in this selling price. So, SP with transport and installation = Rs. 23100 SP with transport and installation = SP + T + Rs. 250 (installation cost) We already calculated SP as Rs. 22687.5, so: Rs. 23100 = Rs. 22687.5 + T + Rs. 250 T = Rs. 23100 - Rs. 22687.5 - Rs. 250 T = Rs. 162.5 Therefore, Ramesh spent Rs. boxed{162.5} on transport."},{"instruction":"Are there any singlevariable polynomials ( f ) and ( g ) such that ( f(x) cdot g(y) = x^{200} y^{200} + 1 )?","output":"1. **Assume the existence of polynomials f and g**: We begin by assuming that there exist two one-variable polynomials ( f(x) ) and ( g(y) ) such that the equation [ f(x) cdot g(y) = x^{200} y^{200} + 1 ] holds true for all ( x ) and ( y ). 2. **Substitute ( y = 0 ) into the equation**: By substituting ( y = 0 ) into the equation, we get: [ f(x) cdot g(0) = x^{200} cdot 0^{200} + 1 = 1 ] This simplifies to: [ f(x) cdot g(0) = 1 ] Since ( g(0) ) cannot be zero (otherwise the product would be undefined), we can solve for ( f(x) ): [ f(x) = frac{1}{g(0)} ] Thus, ( f(x) ) must be a constant polynomial, specifically ( f(x) = c ) where ( c = frac{1}{g(0)} ). 3. **Substitute ( x = 0 ) into the equation**: Now substituting ( x = 0 ) into the original equation, we obtain: [ f(0) cdot g(y) = 0^{200} cdot y^{200} + 1 = 1 ] This simplifies to: [ f(0) cdot g(y) = 1 ] Since ( f(0) ) cannot be zero (similarly, otherwise the product would be undefined), we can solve for ( g(y) ): [ g(y) = frac{1}{f(0)} ] Thus, ( g(y) ) must be a constant polynomial, specifically ( g(y) = d ) where ( d = frac{1}{f(0)} ). 4. **Identify constants**: Since we determined ( f(x) ) and ( g(y) ) are constants, let: [ f(x) = c quad text{and} quad g(y) = d ] where ( c cdot d = 1 ). 5. **Examine the original polynomial equation**: Substitute the constants back into the original equation: [ f(x) cdot g(y) = c cdot d = 1 ] This simplifies to: [ 1 = x^{200} y^{200} + 1 ] To satisfy the given equation, we then have: [ x^{200} y^{200} = 0 ] for all ( x ) and ( y ).

Therefore the maximum and minimum values of ( y ) would reflect the maximum and minimum values of ( -cos theta ), which is [ y = -cos theta ] 8.

Establish a Cartesian coordinate system with origin at point A, x-axis along AB, and y-axis along AD. 2. To prove that R has at least one edge of integer length, it suffices to show that at least one of the vertices B, C, or D has integer coordinates. 3. Since each smaller rectangle R_i has at least one side of integer length and is aligned parallel to the axes, each R_i must have vertices where the count of integer-coordinate points can only be 0, 2, or 4. 4. Thus, among all the vertices of all R_i, the number of vertices with integer coordinates must be an even number. 5. Point A is an integer coordinate point and is counted exactly once. 6. Within the interior of the rectangle ABCD, an integer coordinate point E can be counted by 4 rectangles, or by 2 rectangles, but will always be counted in even numbers. 7. Because the total count of the integer-coordinate points among all R_i is an even number, and since A is counted only once, the number of integer coordinates inside R is odd. 8.

This statement claims that there exists at least one real number x such that its square root is greater than 3. 2. **Equivalent Formulation**: First, we observe that sqrt{x} > 3 can be squared on both sides to obtain an equivalent inequality involving x directly: [ sqrt{x} > 3 implies x > 3^2 implies x > 9. ] Therefore, the proposition p is equivalent to saying exists x in mathbb{R}, x > 9. 3. **Negation of the Proposition**: The negation of a quantified proposition involves switching the quantifier (from \\"there exists\\" exists to \\"for all\\" forall) and negating the predicate (the part of the proposition that describes the property of x). Thus, negating exists x in mathbb{R}, x > 9 leads to: [ neg (exists x in mathbb{R}, x > 9) equiv forall x in mathbb{R}, x leq 9. ] 4. **Reinterpreting the Negation**: The statement forall x in mathbb{R}, x leq 9 does not directly translate back into a statement about sqrt{x}. However, recognizing that for x leq 9, the square root of x cannot be greater than 3, and considering the domain of the square root function (x must be non-negative for sqrt{x} to be real), we get: [ forall x in mathbb{R}, x leq 9 implies forall x in mathbb{R}, sqrt{x} leq 3 text{ or } x < 0. ] Here, the \\"or x < 0\\" part accounts for the reality that all negative numbers also do not satisfy the original proposition, as their square roots are not real numbers. 5. **Conclusion**: Hence, the correct negation of the proposition p is \\"forall x in mathbb{R}, sqrt{x} leq 3 or x < 0\\", which matches option D.

We can use the following relationship, which is based on the concept of mutually exclusive events (since both being alive is mutually exclusive to neither being alive): P(Neither) = 1 - P(At least one will be alive) The probability that at least one will be alive is the sum of the probabilities of each being alive minus the probability that both will be alive (since we've counted that scenario twice): P(At least one will be alive) = P(M) + P(W) - P(M and W) We don't have the probability that both will be alive, but we can express it in terms of P(M) and P(W) assuming independence: P(M and W) = P(M) * P(W) Now we can rewrite the equation for P(Neither): P(Neither) = 1 - (P(M) + P(W) - P(M) * P(W)) We know P(Neither) and P(M), so we can solve for P(W): 0.5 = 1 - (1/4 + P(W) - (1/4) * P(W)) 0.5 = 1 - 1/4 - P(W) + (1/4) * P(W) 0.5 = 3/4 - P(W) + (1/4) * P(W) 0.5 = 3/4 - (3/4) * P(W) 0.5 = (3/4) * (1 - P(W)) 2/4 = (3/4) * (1 - P(W)) 2/3 = 1 - P(W) P(W) = 1 - 2/3 P(W) = 1/3 So the probability that the wife will be alive for 10 more years is boxed{1/3} ."},{"instruction":"Let a and b be relatively prime positive integers such that dfrac{a}{b} = dfrac{1^2}{2^2} + dfrac{2^2}{3^3} + dfrac{3^2}{2^4} + dfrac{4^2}{3^5} + dfrac{5^2}{2^6} + dfrac{6^2}{3^7} + cdots, where the numerators are squares of their positions, and the denominators alternate between powers of 2 and 3, with exponents increasing by 2 for terms with powers of 2 and by 3 for terms with powers of 3 respectively.

If the two circles ( S ) and ( S_1 ) do not intersect, the construction cannot be completed because no such chord exists. 5. **Geometric Consideration:** - As noted, the geometric locus of the midpoint of all chords of a given circle with a specified length forms a concentric circle with the original. - The problem then reduces to constructing a tangent to this newly defined circle that is parallel to a given line, which is a standard construction in classical geometry. - Draw a parallel line to ( MN ) which will be tangent to our locus circle if it is correctly done. # Conclusion: By following the outlined method, we translate the circle and find intersections which help us construct the required chord ( AB ).

This is because both the cubic term {x}^{3} and the logarithmic term ln(sqrt{{x}^{2}+1}+x) are defined for all x in mathbb{R}. **Step 2: Determine the nature of f(x)** We observe that f(-x) + f(x) = 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. This property indicates that f(x) is an odd function. Additionally, by calculating the derivative f'(x) = 3{x}^{2} + frac{1}{sqrt{{x}^{2}+1}}, we find that f'(x) > 0 for all x in mathbb{R}. This means f(x) is monotonically increasing across its domain. **Step 3: Simplify the given inequality** Given f(2^{x}-4^{x})+f(mcdot 2^{x}-3) < 0, and knowing f(x) is an odd and monotonically increasing function, we can rewrite this inequality as f(2^{x}-4^{x}) < -f(mcdot 2^{x}-3). By the property of odd functions, this is equivalent to f(2^{x}-4^{x}) < f(3-mcdot 2^{x}). This implies 2^{x}-4^{x} < 3-mcdot 2^{x}, because f(x) is monotonically increasing. **Step 4: Analyze the inequality for m** The inequality 2^{x}-4^{x} < 3-mcdot 2^{x} can be rearranged to find m < 2^{x} + frac{3}{2^{x}} - 1. To find the minimum value of the right-hand side, we apply the AM-GM inequality: {2}^{x}+frac{3}{{2}^{x}} ge 2sqrt{{2}^{x} cdot frac{3}{{2}^{x}}} = 2sqrt{3}. Therefore, the minimum value of 2^{x} + frac{3}{2^{x}} - 1 is 2sqrt{3}-1, and this minimum is achieved when {2}^{x}=frac{3}{{2}^{x}}. **Conclusion** The range of m for which the given inequality holds for all x in mathbb{R} is (-infty, 2sqrt{3}-1). Therefore, the final answer is: boxed{(-infty, 2sqrt{3}-1)}."},{"instruction":"Given that the lengths of the three sides of triangle ABC form an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 2, and the sine of the largest angle is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, the sine of the smallest angle of this triangle is ______.","output":"Let's assume the three sides of the triangle are a, b, and c, with a > b > c > 0. Let the common difference be d=2, and the three angles be A, B, and C respectively. Thus, we have a-b=b-c=2, which leads to b=c+2 and a=c+4. Therefore, A > B > C. Since the sine of the largest angle is frac{sqrt{3}}{2}, we have sin A = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}. Given A is in the range (0°, 180°), A could be either 60° or 120°. When A=60°, since A > B > C, we would have A+B+C < 180°, which is not possible; Thus, A=120°, and we have cos A = frac{b^2+c^2-a^2}{2bc} = frac{(c+2)^2+c^2-(c+4)^2}{2c(c+2)} = -frac{1}{2}, Solving this gives frac{c-6}{2c} = -frac{1}{2}, from which we find c=3, Therefore, b=c+2=5 and a=c+4=7. Then, cos C = frac{a^2+b^2-c^2}{2ab} = frac{49+25-9}{2×7×5} = frac{13}{14}, Since C is in the range (0°, 180°), we have sin C = sqrt{1-cos^2C} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{14}, Therefore, the sine of the smallest angle of this triangle is boxed{frac{3sqrt{3}}{14}}.

The speed of ( alpha ) from ( A ) to ( B ) is 40 km/h and from ( B ) to ( A ) is 50 km/h. The speed of ( beta ) from ( B ) to ( A ) is 50 km/h and from ( A ) to ( B ) is 40 km/h. Since the distance between ( A ) and ( B ) is 900 km, we need to determine the total distance ( alpha ) has traveled when they meet for the 2016th time. 2. **Understanding the Journey of Each Car:** - Car ( alpha ) moves from ( A ) to ( B ) and back: - ( A ) to ( B ) at 40 km/h: Time taken = ( frac{900}{40} = 22.5 ) hours. - ( B ) to ( A ) at 50 km/h: Time taken = ( frac{900}{50} = 18 ) hours. - Total round trip time for ( alpha ) = ( 22.5 + 18 = 40.5 ) hours. - Car ( beta ) moves from ( B ) to ( A ) and back: - ( B ) to ( A ) at 50 km/h: Time taken = ( frac{900}{50} = 18 ) hours. - ( A ) to ( B ) at 40 km/h: Time taken = ( frac{900}{40} = 22.5 ) hours. - Total round trip time for ( beta ) = ( 18 + 22.5 = 40.5 ) hours. 3. **Meeting Points Calculation:** - In a complete round trip, cars ( alpha ) and ( beta ) meet twice (once on the way to their destination and once on the way back). - Thus, in 2016 meetings, the cars completed ( frac{2016}{2} = 1008 ) round trips. 4. **Distance Calculation for Round Trips:** - For each round trip, the total distance each car covers = ( 2 times 900 = 1800 ) km. - Thus, in 1008 round trips, the total distance ( alpha ) travels is: [ 1008 times 1800 text{ km} = 1814400 text{ km} ] 5. **Adjustment for the Last Meeting:** - When they meet for the 2016th time, it occurs somewhere between ( A ) and ( B ), not necessarily at either end. - Given ( alpha ) is traveling at 50 km/h and ( beta ) at 40 km/h when they are returning to their starting points: - Speed ratio = ( frac{50}{40} = frac{5}{4} ) - The relative distance traveled between them should also be in the ratio 5:4. 6. **Distance of the Last Half-Trip:** - Let ( d = ) distance ( alpha ) travels from a specific point to the meeting point. - Then, ( beta ) travels ( 900 - d ). - Equating the time travelled (since they meet), we get: [ frac{d}{50} = frac{900 - d}{40} ] [ 40d = 50(900 - d) ] [ 40d = 45000 - 50d ] [ 90d = 45000 ] [ d = 500 text{ km} ] 7. **Final Total Distance Calculation:** - Therefore, the last trip ( alpha ) only travels 500 km in addition to the completed round trips. - Total distance ( alpha ) travels: [ 1814400 text{ km} - (900 text{ km} times 8) + 500 text{ km} ] [ = 1814400 text{ km} - 500 text{ km} ] [ = 1813900 text{ km} ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{1813900} ]"},{"instruction":"Compute the product of the roots of the equation [2x^3 3x^2 15x + 35 = 0.]","output":"To find the product of the roots of the given cubic equation, we use Vieta's formulas.

Thus, the diagonal ( DE ) of the quadrilateral ( CDOE ) bisects the angles at its vertices due to the symmetry of the bisected arcs, implying that ( DE ) is a symmetry axis of the quadrilateral (which is a kite). ![Diagram 3](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c3eb8eb4b60d11c9ab26g-1.jpg?height=569&width=548&top_left_y=1450&top_left_x=775) - Given that ( C ) and ( O ) are mirror images of each other with respect to ( DE ), we have: [ DE perp CO ] 3. **Third Solution:** - We can alternatively verify the kite property of ( CDOE ) by considering the geometric locus of point ( O ) when moving ( A ) along the arc ( BEC ). When ( A ) is fixed, ( O ) moves along the arc centered at ( D ). Similarly, fixing ( A ) and ( C ), and moving ( B ), the locus of ( O ) forms an arc centered at ( E ). Thus, [ DC = DO quad text{and} quad EC = EO ] 4. **Fourth Solution:** - Let ( G ) be the point where the angle bisector from ( C ) intersects the circumcircle again.

Some competitors showed that triangle ( CKL ) is isosceles, leading to ( DE ) being perpendicular to the angle bisector from ( C ) since in an isosceles triangle, the base and the vertex angle's bisector are perpendicular. ![Diagram 5](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c3eb8eb4b60d11c9ab26g-2.jpg?height=520&width=550&top_left_y=1575&top_left_x=771) - Given that ( E ) bisects ( AC ) and ( D ) bisects ( BC ): [ angle CED = angle BCD quad text{and} quad angle ACE = angle CDE ] Given that angles in ( triangle CKL ) sum to the same as those in ( triangle DLA ), the isosceles property follows. 6. **Sixth Solution:** - Let ( C_0 ) be the midpoint of the arc containing ( C ) over ( AB ). The altitude from ( C_0 ) is the axis of symmetry for the ( triangle ABC_0 ), thus perpendicular to the line joining the angle bisectors' intersections at ( D_0 ) and ( E_0 ). ![Diagram 6](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_05_02_c3eb8eb4b60d11c9ab26g-3.jpg?height=574&width=548&top_left_y=125&top_left_x=775) - As ( C_0 ) moves, ( D_0 ) and ( E_0 ) shift equivalently. Let the intersection of ( D_0E_0 ) and ( DE ) be ( H ): [ angle D_0E_0D = angle EDE_0 = frac{1}{2} angle C_0GC ] - Thus, as an external angle of ( triangle ED_0H ): [ angle E_0HE = angle HE_0D + angle HED_0 = angle C_0GC ] - Therefore, ( DE ) remains perpendicular to the circumscribed angle bisector at ( C ).

According to the problem, the second person gets 45 paisa for each rupee the first person gets.

We are given that the second person's share is Rs. 45, so we can write: 0.45x = 45 To find x, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.45: x = 45 / 0.45 x = 100 So, the first person gets Rs. 100. Now, the third person gets 30 paisa for each rupee the first person gets, which is Rs. 0.30 for each rupee.

The power of a point P with respect to a circle centered at O with radius r is given by: [ text{Power}(P, Gamma) = PA^2 - r^2 ] It implies that for any point on this perpendicular to FB through A, the differences in squared distances to the centers of Gamma_{B} and Gamma_{F} will be constant. - The perpendicular to line (BD) passing through point C: Similarly, this perpendicular is the set of all points having equal power with respect to circles Gamma_{B} and Gamma_{D}. 3. **Intersection of perpendiculars:** - The intersection point of the perpendicular to (FB) passing through A and the perpendicular to (BD) passing through C must have equal power with respect to Gamma_{B}, Gamma_{F}, and Gamma_{D}.

This property ensures that any point with equal powers concerning these three circles will lie on the specific perpendicular line through E. 5. **Conclusion:** - The perpendiculares to (FB) passing through A, to (BD) passing through C, and to (DF) passing through E are concurrent since they are defined by points sharing equal power relationships concerning the same three circles Gamma_{B}, Gamma_{D}, and Gamma_{F}.

Recall that the Borel sets are the smallest sigma-algebra containing all open sets in mathbb{R}. To determine the cardinality of the set of all Borel sets, we use several results from set theory and measure theory. We know that the number of Borel sets in mathbb{R} is equivalent to the least cardinality of any sigma-algebra containing the open sets of mathbb{R}. According to well-known results in measure theory: [ |text{Borel sets in } mathbb{R}| = mathfrak{c} ] Here, mathfrak{c} denotes the cardinality of the continuum, which is commonly understood as the cardinality of the real numbers, |mathbb{R}|. **Reasoning:** - Any open interval in mathbb{R} can be mapped uniquely to some countable sequence of intervals due to the nature of rational numbers being dense and countable in mathbb{R}. - The collection of all open sets can be described in terms of unions, intersections, and countable operations on open intervals, leading us to a countable base for the Borel sigma-algebra. - Hence, the Borel sets, being constructed from a countable base of open sets using countable unions and intersections, have the same cardinality as the continuum, mathfrak{c}. Therefore, we conclude: [ |text{Borel sets in } mathbb{R}| = mathfrak{c} ] 2. **Step 2: Establishing the cardinality of Lebesgue measurable sets** Next, we address the cardinality of Lebesgue measurable sets in mathbb{R}. The Lebesgue measurable sets include all Borel sets as well as sets that can be described as unions or complements of Borel sets of measure zero (null sets). It is known from measure theory that: [ |text{Lebesgue measurable sets in } mathbb{R}| = 2^{mathfrak{c}} ] **Reasoning:** - The Cantor set, denoted by mathscr{C}, has measure zero and cardinality mathfrak{c}. This implies that any subset of the Cantor set is measurable by Lebesgue's definition. - Since the number of subsets of the Cantor set is 2^{|mathscr{C}|} and |mathscr{C}| = mathfrak{c}, it follows that the cardinality of the collection of subsets of the Cantor set is 2^{mathfrak{c}}. - Because any subsets of the Cantor set are Lebesgue measurable and these subsets account for the cardinality limit of all (sigma)-algebra of Lebesgue sets, the cardinality of Lebesgue measurable sets must also be (2^{mathfrak{c}}). Therefore, we conclude: [ |text{Lebesgue measurable sets in } mathbb{R}| = 2^{mathfrak{c}} ] # Conclusion: Putting it all together: - The cardinality of Borel sets in mathbb{R} is mathfrak{c}. - The cardinality of Lebesgue measurable sets in mathbb{R} is 2^{mathfrak{c}}.

The binomial probability formula for exactly ( k ) successes in ( n ) trials is given by: [ P(X = k) = binom{n}{k} p^k q^{(n-k)} ] In our case, we want to find ( n ) such that ( P(X = 1) = 0.375 ), where ( k = 1 ), ( p = 0.5 ), and ( q = 0.5 ). Plugging these values into the formula, we get: [ 0.375 = binom{n}{1} (0.5)^1 (0.5)^{n-1} ] Since ( binom{n}{1} = n ) (the number of ways to choose 1 success out of ( n ) trials), we can simplify the equation to: [ 0.375 = n cdot (0.5)^n ] To solve for ( n ), we can try different values of ( n ) to see which one gives us the probability of 0.375. Let's start with ( n = 2 ): [ P(X = 1) = 2 cdot (0.5)^2 = 2 cdot 0.25 = 0.5 ] This is too high, so let's try ( n = 3 ): [ P(X = 1) = 3 cdot (0.5)^3 = 3 cdot 0.125 = 0.375 ] This matches the given probability, so the number of consecutive flips ( n ) is boxed{3} ."},{"instruction":"Solve the three linear Diophantine equations: 2x + 3y = 5, quad 2x + 5y = 10, quad text{and} quad 3x + 9y = 2018","output":"**1.

An odd composite number ( m ) can be written as ( m = 2k - 1 ) where ( k ) is a natural number. 2. **Formulate the Representation**: Suppose this number ( m ) could be represented in the form ( n^2 + p ). Therefore, we must have: [ k^2 = n^2 + p ] Rearranging the above equation, we get: [ p = k^2 - n^2 ] 3. **Difference of Squares**: Notice that ( k^2 - n^2 ) can be factored as: [ p = (k - n)(k + n) ] 4. **Prime Factors Condition**: For ( p ) to be a prime number, one of the factors ( (k - n) ) or ( (k + n) ) must be equal to 1, since a prime number has no divisors other than 1 and itself. 5. **Check the Conditions**: - **If ( k - n = 1 )**: [ p = (k - n)(k + n) = 1 cdot (k + n) = k + n ] Here, since ( k ) is at least 2 (otherwise ( m ) would not be a composite number), and ( n ) is a natural number, ( k + n ) will not be a prime anymore as it will be greater than 2, making ( p ) a composite number. - **If ( k - n > 1 )**: The product ( p = (k - n)(k + n) ) would then reflect two factors both greater than 1, indicating that ( p ) is necessarily composite. 6. **Impossibility of Representation**: From the above deductions, we see that for any odd composite number in the form ( m = 2k - 1 ), the corresponding ( n^2 + p ) form cannot fulfill the condition of ( p ) being a prime number. Therefore, it is not possible to represent ( k^2 ) in the form ( n^2 + p ) where ( p ) is a prime number. # Conclusion Since there are infinitely many odd composite numbers, as derived from our logical steps, there exist infinitely many natural numbers that cannot be represented in the form ( n^2 + p ) where ( p ) is a prime number.

Prove that any five-digit number obtained by a circular permutation of its digits is also divisible by 41. To prove this statement, let's denote the five-digit number as ( N ), which can be expressed in terms of its digits as: [ N = 10^4a + 10^3b + 10^2c + 10^d + e ] where ( a, b, c, d, ) and ( e ) are the digits of the number ( N ). # Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Understanding Circular Permutation**: - A circular permutation involves rotating the digits of the number. - For example, rotating the number ( N ) once to the left would result in a new number ( N_1 ) as ( N_1 = 10^4b + 10^3c + 10^2d + 10e + a ). - Let's examine if this new number ( N_1 ) is divisible by 41 under the condition that ( N ) is divisible by 41. 2. **Mathematical Representation**: - The original number ( N ) is divisible by 41. Therefore, we can write: [ N = 10^4a + 10^3b + 10^2c + 10d + e equiv 0 pmod{41} ] - We need to demonstrate how the circular permutation ( N_1 ) maintains this property: 3. **Rotating the Number**: - After rotating the digits, the new number ( N_1 ) can be rewritten as: [ N_1 = 10^4b + 10^3c + 10^2d + 10e + a ] 4. **Rewriting ( 10 ) mod ( 41 )**: - Note that: [ 10^5 equiv 1 pmod{41} ] (This is because ( 10^5 = 100000 ) and ( 100000 mod 41 = 1 )) - This property can be used to validate our rotated number: - Rewriting ( N_1 ) in terms of mod 41: [ 10^4b + 10^3c + 10^2d + 10e + a equiv b cdot 10^4 + c cdot 10^3 + d cdot 10^2 + e cdot 10 + a pmod{41} ] 5. **Circular Permutation and Division**: - Since ( 10^5 equiv 1 pmod{41} ), we know that multiplying or shifting by a power of 10 still respects modulo 41 properties. - Therefore, if the initial number ( 10^4a + 10^3b + 10^2c + 10d + e ) is divisible by 41, any of its circular shifts will be too, because the coefficients are simply rearranged but not altered in terms of their congruence modulo 41. # Conclusion Since a circular permutation of the digits only reorders the terms and multiplies by powers of 10, every circular permutation of a 5-digit number which is divisible by 41 remains divisible by 41, due to the modular arithmetic property ( 10^5 equiv 1 pmod{41} ).

We can rearrange the quadratic equation as: [ n^2 - 17n + 72 - x^2 = 0. ] Applying the quadratic formula gives: [ n = frac{17 pm sqrt{289 - 4(72 - x^2)}}{2} = frac{17 pm sqrt{17 + 4x^2}}{2}. ] For n to be an integer, 17 + 4x^2 must be a perfect square, say k^2. Thus, we have: [ 4x^2 = k^2 - 17. ] Setting y = k/2, this transforms to: [ x^2 = y^2 - frac{17}{4}, ] and must still be a square implying there are constraints on possible k. Solve (k+2y)(k-2y) = 17. The factor pairs of 17 are (17, 1) and (-17, -1), yielding k = 9 and y = 4 or k = -9 and y = -4. Using k = 9, we get x = 4 or -4. Therefore, plug x = 4 into the quadratic formula for n gives: [ n = frac{17 pm 9}{2} rightarrow n = 13, 4. ] Also, check if n =13 and n=4 make frac{12}{n} an integer. For n = 13: frac{12}{13} is not an integer; for n = 4, frac{12}{4} = 3, which is an integer. Therefore, the only valid option is n = 4.

Thus, there must be at least 10 balls of either red or yellow color. However, with 19 red balls, 19 yellow balls, and 5 black balls, making a total of 43 balls, there are not 20 balls of the same color. Next, we prove that taking out 44 balls will ensure that there are 20 balls of the same color. Let the numbers of red, yellow, and black balls in the box be x, y, and z respectively, and assume x geq y geq z. (1) If z leq 5, then among the 44 balls taken out, there will be at least 44-5=39 red or yellow balls. Thus, there must be at least 20 balls of either red or yellow color. (2) If z=6, when y leq 8, the number of red balls among the 44 balls will be greater than 44-8-6 > 20. When y geq 9, taking out 9 red balls, 9 yellow balls, and 6 black balls, there will not be 10 balls of the same color among the 24 balls, which does not meet the condition of the problem. (3) If z=7, when y geq 8, taking out 9 red balls, 8 yellow balls, and 7 black balls, there will not be 10 balls of the same color among the 24 balls, which does not meet the condition of the problem. When y=7, the number of red balls among the 44 balls will be greater than 44-7-7 > 20. (4) If z geq 8, then taking 8 balls of each color, red, yellow, and black, it is known that the condition of the problem is not met.

Simplify b_n using the fact that log_{2}(frac {1}{4})^n = -2n and log_{2}(frac {1}{4})^{n+1} = -2(n+1), which yields: b_n = frac {1}{(-2n)[-2(n+1)]} = frac {1}{4n(n+1)} = frac {1}{4}(frac {1}{n} - frac {1}{n+1}).

Let A and B be two points on the line, and let C and D be the points of tangency from A and B to the circle, respectively. We need to demonstrate that the distance between A and B is bounded by the sum and difference of the lengths of the tangents from these points to the circle. 2. **Case 1 - Line does not intersect the Circle**: We start by asserting that the direct distance |AB| is less than or equal to the length of the path that goes from point A to the point of tangency C, around the circle, and then from point D back to B. [ |AB| leq |AC| + |CD| + |DB| ] Since |AC| and |DB| are tangents from A and B to points C and D on the circle, we write the total distance around the circle as the sum of these tangents: [ |AC| + |CD| + |DB| = |AC| + |AD| ] Hence: [ |AB| leq |AC| + |BD| ] 3. **Reverse statement**: Suppose the statement is false for some points A and B on the line. That means: [ |AB| > ||AC| - |BD|| ] Alternatively, this means that the distance between points A and B on the line exceeds the difference of the lengths of the tangents from these points to the circle. 4. **Proof by Contradiction**: To complete the proof, we will show that if the distance |AB| does not satisfy the inequalities involving tangents, then the line must intersect the circle. Assume for contradiction that the line does not intersect the circle, then the tangents are well defined, and we can write: [ |AB| leq |AC| + |BD| ] Also, realize that the shortest distance between the points A and B (which lie on a line outside the circle) must be the straight line segment connecting them. Thus, if: [ |AB| > ||AC| - |BD|| ] This would contradict our initial assertion since the tangents |AC| and |BD| would then have misrepresented the true shortest path distance between A and B. Therefore, if the inequality does not hold, the only feasible geometric explanation is that the line intersects the circle. In conclusion, we have demonstrated that if the given condition between the distances |AB| and the tangents |AC| and |BD| is not met, the line must intersect the circle. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given P: 2+2=5, Q: 3>2, then the correct judgment among the following is ( ) A: P or Q is false, not Q is false B: P or Q is true, not Q is false C: P and Q is false, not P is false D: P and Q is true, P or Q is false","output":"P is a false statement, and Q is a true statement.

A convenient spot to place each piece is in the lower left corner of each 2 times 2 block. Therefore, the placement within each 2 times 2 region will look like this: [ begin{array}{|c|c|} hline & hline * & hline end{array} ] where \\"*\\" indicates a piece. 3. **Counting Pieces:** Since there are 4 times 4 = 16 such 2 times 2 regions, and each region can safely contain one piece, the maximum number of pieces that can be placed on the 8 times 8 chessboard is: [ 16 ] 4. **Verification:** Verify that no two pieces are touching horizontally, vertically, or diagonally: - **Horizontal Separation:** Each piece is separated by at least one empty square horizontally. - **Vertical Separation:** Each piece is separated by at least one empty square vertically. - **Diagonal Separation:** Due to the arrangement within the 2 times 2 blocks, no two pieces can be placed diagonally adjacent.

The remaining fragments were divided into groups, each containing frac{X}{7} fragments. 5. Let n be the number of these groups. Therefore, n cdot frac{X}{7} represents the remaining fragments. 6. The sum of all the fragment groups equals the total number of fragments, giving us the equation: [ frac{X}{5} + 26 + n cdot frac{X}{7} = X ] 7. To find X, first combine the terms involving X.

Additionally, since (a), (b), and (c) are natural numbers, their sum (a + b + c) is positive. 4. **Evaluate Polynomial at Points**: - Let's evaluate (f(x)) at (x = a): [ f(a) = (a+b+c) a^2 - (ab + bc + ca)a + abc. ] Simplifying this, we get: [ f(a) = a(a^2 + (b + c)a - (ab + bc + ca)) + abc = a^3. ] - Similarly, for (x = b): [ f(b) = (a+b+c) b^2 - (ab + bc + ca)b + abc. ] Simplifying this, we get: [ f(b) = b(b^2 + (a + c)b - (ab + bc + ca)) + abc = b^3. ] - And for (x = c): [ f(c) = (a+b+c) c^2 - (ab + bc + ca)c + abc. ] Simplifying this, we get: [ f(c) = c(c^2 + (a + b)c - (ab + bc + ca)) + abc = c^3. ] 5. **Verify the Solution**: Since (f(a) = a^3), (f(b) = b^3), and (f(c) = c^3), the function (f(x)) indeed takes the values (a^3), (b^3), and (c^3) at (x = a), (x = b), and (x = c), respectively. # Conclusion: Thus, it is true that for any three distinct natural numbers (a), (b), and (c), there exists a cubic polynomial with integer coefficients and a positive leading coefficient that takes the values (a^3), (b^3), and (c^3) at some integer points.

First, let's calculate the area of each wall without any openings: Each wall is 20 feet wide and 8 feet tall, so the area of one wall is: Area of one wall = width x height = 20 feet x 8 feet = 160 square feet Since there are 4 walls, the total area without any openings is: Total area without openings = 4 walls x 160 square feet/wall = 640 square feet Now, let's calculate the area of the openings: 1. The area of the first doorway is 3 feet x 7 feet = 21 square feet. 2. The area of the window is 6 feet x 4 feet = 24 square feet. 3. The area of the second doorway is 5 feet x 7 feet = 35 square feet. 4. The area of the alcove can be calculated by finding the area of the trapezoid shape. The formula for the area of a trapezoid is: Area = (base1 + base2) / 2 x height For the alcove, base1 is 4 feet, base2 is 2 feet, and the height is 3 feet. Area of alcove = (4 feet + 2 feet) / 2 x 3 feet = (6 feet / 2) x 3 feet = 3 feet x 3 feet = 9 square feet.
