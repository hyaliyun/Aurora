Jeannie ist bezaubernd &amp; Anthony herrlich komisch! :D . Ja ja, die liebe Jeannie. Schon als Kind habe ich diese Serie mit Freude angeschaut! Es gab sie schon seit etwa drei Jahren in jedem DVD-Geschäft, doch erst vor kurzer Zeit habe ich mich dazu durchgerungen, mir die erste Staffel zuzulegen. Denn ich war etwas skeptisch, ob mir die Serie heute noch gefallen würde... Und was soll ich sagen??? Mittlerweile habe ich schon die zweite Staffel im Regal stehen :)  Jeannie ist einfach (ungewollt) komisch und lässt ihren Meister Anthony ständig in urwitzige Situationen hinein stolpern, so dass er den armen Dr. Bellows fast um den Verstand bringt. Langsam aber sicher war mir spätestens nach drei Folgen wieder bewusst, warum ich diese Serie als Kind so gern hatte! Ich denke, ich werde nicht eher Ruhe finden, bis ich alle Staffeln durch habe ;)  Man sieht zwar deutlich, dass die erste Staffel in schwarz-weiß gedreht und später nachcoloriert wurde, aber das ist - für mich - zu verschmerzen. Viele der Folgen wirken halbwegs natürlich, nur ein paar wenige sind doch arg bunt geraten. Aber was soll's. Von mir gibt's dafür keinen Punktabzug! Bei 2 oder 3 Folgen ist mir an den Bildqualität ein Griseln aufgefallen. Es war nicht wirklich tragisch, aber im Vergleich zu den übrigen Folgen ist es halt aufgefallen.   Die Box an sich ist optisch allein schon sehr hübsch gemacht, vor allem mit den reliefartigen Erhebungen vorn. Der Digipack ist von der Qualität her ebenfalls sehr gut. Dass sowohl die Originalsprachfassung als auch noch neben der deutschen Synchro (meistens) die französische und italienische Sprachfassung dabei ist, ist ebenfalls ein Pluspunkt.  Ein ganz großes Lob gibt es von mir noch für die absolut genialen Extras!  Sind zwar nicht viele, aber dafür sind sie klasse!  Was soll ich noch sagen?

It is, however, more than just forgetting where you put your keys. Hypothesis: A doctor alone can identify dementia.","output":"In order to formulate an hypothesis, let's break this prompt down. The provided context is about identifying the signs of dementia, and it mentions that memory loss is the first and earliest sign of this condition. However, it doesn't provide explicit information about who can identify these signs or whether it specifically requires a doctor. Here's the step-by-step analysis: 1. The context informs the reader about one can identify signs of dementia, successfully educating them on one of the early symptoms - memory loss. This evokes an understanding that a general individual with this awareness could potentially identify signs of dementia in a preliminary stage. 2. The context doesn't specify the involvement or necessity of a doctor in identifying dementia. Therefore, mentioning the need for a doctor to identify dementia would be an assumption, as it was not explicitly stated. 3. It's also important to recognize that while the context provides one sign of dementia (memory loss), it doesn't encompass all symptoms or stages of the condition. A full diagnosis typically requires a comprehensive examination by a healthcare professional. This, however, is an understanding we gain from outside the context provided as it isn't mentioned within the given text. So, based on the provided context, the hypothesis \\"A doctor alone can identify dementia\\" can't be clearly drawn. There's no mention in the text indicating that only a doctor can identify dementia. For a more accurate hypothesis, we would need additional data or context that specifically connects the identification of dementia to a doctor's expertise. Therefore, the hypothesis could be incorrect or too narrow based on the given context. One could, nonetheless, infer that a doctor is necessary for a comprehensive diagnosis, but that's not explicitly stated in the context provided."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Thousands of students, from all around the world, have helped their international careers by taking EIS English studies at South Thames College London - STCL.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"First, let's address the question: \\"What is Green Climate Fund?\\" Step 1: Understanding the question and context In this case, the user is asking for information regarding the Green Climate Fund. This question is not ambiguous, and it intends to get an explanation of what the Green Climate Fund is. Step 2: Research To provide an accurate answer, I will search for reliable information from authoritative and credible sources about the Green Climate Fund. Step 3: Formulating a response based on research The Green Climate Fund (GCF) is a financial mechanism established in 2010 by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change. The fund aims to mobilize and allocate resources, both public and private, to support projects and programs that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, increase climate resilience, and promote low-emission development. Now, let's address the second question: \\"Is global warming a hoax?\\" Step 1: Understanding the question and context The user is inquiring about the validity of global warming, questioning whether it is factual or a hoax. The question implies skepticism and requires clarification on the issue. Step 2: Research To answer this question, I will gather evidence from reputable scientific sources on the topic of global warming, such as peer-reviewed studies, assessments by climate scientists, and reports from organizations like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Step 3: Formulating a response based on research The overwhelming scientific consensus is that global warming is not a hoax. Global warming refers to the long-term increase in Earth's average surface temperature due primarily to the build-up of greenhouse gases, like carbon dioxide, from human activities such as fossil fuel burning and deforestation. This consensus is supported by extensive research and the findings of the vast majority of climate scientists and well-regarded scientific organizations around the world, including the IPCC. Finally, let's address whether these two questions are paraphrases of each other. The two questions: 1. What is Green Climate Fund? 2. Is global warming a hoax? These questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they are inquiring about different topics. The first question seeks information on the Green Climate Fund, which is a mechanism related to climate finance. The second question concerns the validity of global warming, which is a phenomenon driven primarily by human activity. While they are both related to the broader context of climate change, they are not rephrased versions of the same inquiry."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Movie title: Be Kind Rewind Context: BE KIND REWIND is the name of a quaint, little video store that carries VHS titles only because the owner (Danny Glover) can't afford to upgrade to DVD films. It's a small shop set in the middle of a crumbling, poverty stricken neighborhood, made up mostly of minorities. The film stars Jack Black as Jerry, a junkyard worker who magnetizes his brain while trying to sabotage a power plant that he thinks is responsible for his constant headaches. Rapper Mos Def plays Mike, his best friend and the only employee of the video store. The store's owner (Danny Glover) goes on 'vacation' (to spy on a huge franchise video chain), leaving Mike in charge with strict instructions not to let Jerry inside. Of course, Jerry gets in anyway and manages to 'magnetize' all of the VHS movies and wipe them clean. Soon Mike and Jerry are shooting their own versions of classic films like GHOSTBUSTERS and the RUSH HOUR movies with a camcorder, laughably bad 'special effects' and using neighborhood folks in small roles. Unexpectedly, their movie versions (which are referred to as SWEDED becuase Jerry charges 20 bucks to rent a movie, claiming that they are Swedish Imports), become so popular that the small store (facing foreclosure) is actually making money. They begin taking custom orders for movies and end up filming SWEDED versions of THE LION KING, DRIVING MISS DAISY, ROBOCOP and more. Soon, however; they attract the attention of the Feds, who inform them they are breaking the law (of course) and that they must cease and desist. What will they do to save the store now? They make an original film about the history of the city and about a 'famous' musician who was born and raised there. They charge admission and the whole neighborhood comes out to see the film, making them a small profit that still won't save the place from demolition. But a tough, city councilman has a change of heart, in the end after seeing the outpouring of neighborhood support.

Children begin to develop the necessary ability to go out and meet others through getting with their parents. Greet the child warmly and let him know you are glad to see him. Children learn a lot from how their parents stay with them and other people. Teach children how to solve conflicts . Being able to work out conflicts is an important skill in getting along with others. If parents know the children have a conflict, let them work it out on their own. Only step in if it is really necessary, for example, an argument is getting physical. Give children chances to practice staying together. Have children play games that require team work and group problem solving skills. For example, races are fun and provide plenty of practice in teamwork. \\"In what ways didn't you work well together? What might you do differently next time?\\" For these ideas, see books such as Games Book by Terry Orlick, Energizers by Carol Apacki, and Team-Building Activities for Every Group by Alanna Jones.

Down-on-his-luck Los Angeles architect and builder Edward Shaw is approached by Doris Hillman with a business proposal: buying land together, on which he would build houses that she would then sell, using her experience as a former real estate broker. Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife. Madge teams with Shaw to try to foil her sister's scheme, but Doris lures him to a mountain cabin and shoots him with a gun. A wounded Shaw sees both Hillmans struggle then fall to their deaths through a clifftop doorway, just minutes before Madge and the cops arrive.

Please answer the following question: Common causes of heat exhaustion include:[1]  Hot, sunny, humid weather Physical exertion, especially in hot, humid weather Due to impaired thermoregulation, elderly people and infants can get serious heat illness even at rest, if the weather outside is hot and humid, and they are not getting enough cool air. Some drugs, such as diuretics, antihistamines, beta-blockers, alcohol, ecstasy, and amphetamines can cause an increase in the risk of heat exhaustion.[2] Especially during physical exertion, risk factors for heat exhaustion include:[1]  Wearing dark, padded, or insulated clothing; hats; and/or helmets (for example, football pads or turnout gear) Having a higher percentage of body fat Dehydration Fever Some medications, like beta blockers and antipsychotic medicines[2]  Two groups of people were out in the sunny, humid weather of Illinois. Group One wore black clothes and helmets, and Group Two wore white, light clothing. Both groups were comprised of people of all ages and fitness levels and exercised in the sun for an hour.  Which group had fewer inebriated people experiencing heat illness? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information and risk factors for heat exhaustion, it can be inferred that Group Two would likely have fewer inebriated people experiencing heat illness. Group Two wore white, light clothing, which would help reflect sunlight and allow for better moisture evaporation to cool their bodies down. Light clothing is more breathable and will not trap heat as dark, padded, or insulated clothing would. Therefore, Group Two would experience less heat buildup in their bodies due to their choice of clothing. In contrast, Group One wore black clothes and helmets, which increase the risk of heat exhaustion. Dark clothing absorbs more heat from sunlight, causing the body to heat up faster. Helmets, while providing vital protection in specific situations, can also trap heat around the head and prevent the body from cooling down effectively. Moreover, physical exertion in hot, humid weather contributes to the risk of heat exhaustion for both groups. People who are inebriated can have impaired judgment and may no longer be able to recognize early signs of heat exhaustion accurately. Alcohol is also a diuretic, causing people to lose more water through urine, which can contribute to dehydration. Dehydration is one of the risk factors for heat exhaustion. While both groups exercised in the sun for an hour, Group Two's choice of wearing light clothing would have provided them with some level of protection against heat illness. Therefore, Group Two would likely have fewer inebriated people experiencing heat illness compared to Group One. It is essential to note that the specific number of inebriated people experiencing heat illness can't be determined without additional information and data."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \\" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\\" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea.

Context: It’s always interesting to read back on why people do things, especially people who end up making a career or a fortune out of the seemingly benign choices they make. Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as ‘art’. Over the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it’s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I  couldn’t imagine how I ever functioned without it.

Article:The transfer took place on Sunday. Rights groups had raised concerns that some 200 Sri Lankans may have been handed over, including Tamils who say they face persecution at home. The government has not commented on other possible cases, but says everyone was subject to \\"enhanced screening\\" to ensure compliance with Australia's international obligations. This is the first time the government has confirmed it has intercepted people at sea, screened them and returned them to their country of origin. Immigration Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged on Monday that a boat-load of 41 people had been handed back to Sri Lanka, while not commenting on the fate of a second boat reportedly carrying about 150 people. He said they were transferred at sea just outside the Sri Lankan port of Batticaloa on Sunday. \\"All persons intercepted and returned were subjected to an enhanced screening process,\\" he said. The government says only four of those returned on Sunday were Tamils. Mr Morrison added that only one person may have had a case for asylum but he opted to return voluntarily with the rest of the passengers. Sri Lankan officials said the group would be taken to the port of Galle and handed over to police to be investigated. Last week the UN refugee agency UNHCR had expressed \\"profound concern\\" about the reported situation. \\"Requests for international protection should be considered within the territory of the intercepting state, consistent with fundamental refugee protection principles,\\" it said. \\"International law prescribes that no individual can be returned involuntarily to a country in which he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution.\\" Richard Marles, Australia's shadow minister for immigration, questioned the operation. \\"Australia's international obligations are reliant upon a credible processing system and we have deep concerns about how that could have been performed by video link at sea in a way which gave an individual assessment, when all the time the boat was steaming towards Sri Lanka,\\" he said. Sri Lanka has been under heavy international pressure over alleged human rights violations during the final phase of the war against Tamil separatists which ended in 2009. Rights groups say Tamils still face violence at the hands of the military. The fate of those on a second boat reportedly detained remains unclear. Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young urged the government to \\"start being up front with what's happening to them and what their fate will be\\". The Australian government has been criticised for imposing what campaigners call a culture of secrecy around asylum, by refusing to comment on operations. Australia has been taking a tough approach to asylum seekers who try to reach the country by perilous sea journeys. Under current policy, asylum seekers who arrive by boat are sent to detention camps in Papua New Guinea (PNG) or Nauru. If found to be refugees, they will be resettled there, not in Australia. Australia says its asylum policy - which is also widely believed to involve towing boats back to Indonesian waters - is aimed at saving lives. It is also facing tough questions over its offshore processing policy. The UN and rights groups have condemned conditions in its camps in PNG and Nauru. Investigations are continuing into the death of one asylum seeker in violence at the PNG camp. He is believed to have been beaten to death by a 10-person mob comprising camp guards and PNG locals. A summary of the above article is?","output":"This article discusses the controversy around an instance where the Australian government intercepted a boat of asylum seekers and returned them to their country of origin, Sri Lanka. This action marked the first time the government confirmed such an operation, with the transfer taking place on Sunday. Among the 41 people returned, only four were Tamils, despite concerns raised by rights groups regarding the potential return of 200 Sri Lankans, including persecuted Tamils. This move of the government sparked criticism, with UNHCR showing \\"profound concern\\" and Richard Marles, Australia's shadow minister for immigration, questioning the credibility of the processing system.  Immigration Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged that an enhanced screening process was conducted and maintained only one person might have had a valid asylum case, who opted to return voluntarily.

Furthermore, Australia's refusal to comment on asylum operations has led critics to accuse the government of fostering a 'culture of secrecy'.  This incident takes place against a backdrop of Sri Lanka facing global pressure over purported human rights violations towards Tamil separatists during the war that concluded in 2009, with claims that Tamils continue to face violence from the military.

Busy streets and few bike lanes and parking areas can make it a battle. But not even these difficulties can stop Europeans' love for cycling. According to Reuters, more bicycles have been sold than cars in 26 of the European Union's 28 states this year. In some European countries, people really love bicycles. \\"People ride to work and take their bikes to the grocery store\\", Bill Strickland, editor of Bicycling magazine, told the reporter from Reuters. So what has led to cycling's growing popularity in Europe? Cycling is \\"a safe, clean, healthy, inexpensive way to get around town,\\" the Daily Star concluded. \\"It not only reduces traffic problems and pollution, but also contributes to public health.\\" Bike-friendly rules have also been made. Dozens of cities have joined a European Union initiative to make bicycles a form of city transport, like cars. Quite a few cities such as Stockholm, London, Florence and Munich now offer special bike lanes. Copenhagen takes it a step further by keeping bicycles and cars separated as much as possible. On these _ , traffic lights are designed to the rhythms of bicycles, not cars. For people living far from city centers, getting to work by bicycle alone may take too much time.

Lindsay Dee Lohan (born July 2, 1986) is an American actress, businesswoman, fashion designer and singer. Born and raised in New York, Lohan was signed to Ford Models as a child. Having appeared as a regular on Another World at age 10, her breakthrough came in Disney Pictures' The Parent Trap (1998). Lindsay Lohan was born on July 2, 1986, in The Bronx borough of New York City, and grew up in Merrick and Cold Spring Harbor on Long Island, New York. She is the eldest child of Dina and Michael Lohan. Her father, a former Wall Street trader, has been in trouble with the law on several occasions, while her mother is a former singer and dancer. Lohan has three younger siblings, all of whom have been models or actors: Michael, Jr., who appeared with Lohan in The Parent Trap, Aliana, known as \\"Ali,\\" and Dakota \\"Cody\\" Lohan. Lohan is of Irish and Italian heritage, and she was raised as a Catholic. Her maternal antecedents were \\"well known Irish Catholic stalwarts\\" and her great-grandfather, John L. Sullivan, was a co-founder of the Pro-life Party in Long Island. Lohan attended Cold Spring Harbor High School and Sanford H. Calhoun High School, where she did well in science and mathematics, until grade 11, when she started homeschooling. Lohan is a natural red head.  Lohan's parents have a turbulent history. They married in 1985, separated when Lindsay was three, and later reunited. They separated again in 2005 and finalized their divorce in 2007.  Lohan began her career as a child model with Ford Models at the age of three. She modeled for Calvin Klein Kids and Abercrombie, and appeared in over 60 television commercials for brands like Pizza Hut and Wendy's, as well as a Jell-O spot with Bill Cosby. By the age of 10, when Lohan played Alexandra \\"Alli\\" Fowler in the television soap opera Another World, Soap Opera Magazine said she was already considered a show-business veteran.  Lohan returned to Disney in 2005, starring in the comedy Herbie: Fully Loaded, the fifth film in the series with the anthropomorphic car Herbie. Fully Loaded earned 144 million worldwide, but it received mixed reviews. Stephen Holden of The New York Times called Lohan \\"a genuine star who ... seems completely at home on the screen\\", while James Berardinelli wrote that \\"as bright a starlet as she may be, Lohan ends up playing second fiddle to the car.\\" While shooting the film in 2004, Lohan was hospitalized with a kidney infection brought on by stress in her personal life and from recording her first album while the film was in production, prompting Vanity Fair to label it Lohan's \\"first disastrous shoot.\\" She also guest-starred in an episode of That '70s Show, of whose cast Wilmer Valderrama, her boyfriend at the time, was a regular member. According to Vanity Fair, the breakup with Valderrama contributed to Lohan's issues during the Herbie shoot. In 2005, Lohan became the first person to have a My Scene celebrity doll released by Mattel. She also voiced herself in the animated direct-to-DVD film My Scene Goes Hollywood: The Movie, based on the series of dolls.  Following Mean Girls, Lohan spent several years living out of hotels in Los Angeles, of which two years were spent at the infamous Chateau Marmont, where comedy actor John Belushi had died. In late 2007, after settling down in a more permanent residence, she explained that she \\"didn't want to be alone\\" but that \\"it wasn't a way of life ... not very consistent.\\" She had a series of car accidents that were widely reported, in August 2004, October 2005, and November 2006, when she suffered minor injuries because a paparazzo who was following her for a photograph hit her car.  Lohan's next widely released film, the romantic comedy Just My Luck, opened in May 2006 and, according to Variety, earned her over 7 million. The opening weekend box office takings of 5.7 million \\"broke lead actress Lindsay Lohan's winning streak\\" according to Brandon Gray. The film received poor reviews and earned Lohan her first Golden Raspberry nomination for Worst Actress. Following Just My Luck, Lohan focused on smaller roles in more mature, independent movies. Robert Altman's ensemble comedy A Prairie Home Companion, based on humorist Garrison Keillor's works, in which Lohan co-stars with Meryl Streep and Lily Tomlin, had a limited release in June 2006. Peter Travers wrote for Rolling Stone that \\"Lohan rises to the occasion, delivering a rock-the-house version of 'Frankie and Johnny.'\\" Co-star Streep said of Lohan's acting: \\"She's in command of the art form\\" and \\"completely, visibly living in front of the camera.\\" The Emilio Estevez ensemble drama Bobby, about the hours leading up to the Robert F. Kennedy assassination, was released in theaters in November 2006. Lohan received favorable comments for her performance, particularly a scene alongside Sharon Stone. As part of the Bobby ensemble cast, Lohan was nominated for a Screen Actors Guild Award. In 2006, Lohan attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.  The 8-part docu-series Lindsay was transmitted in March and April 2014 on Oprah Winfrey's OWN cable network. The series followed Lohan's life and work as she moved to New York City after leaving rehab. In the final episode, Lohan said that she had had a miscarriage which had interrupted filming of the series. The premiere had 693,000 viewers, described as \\"so-so\\" by The Hollywood Reporter. The ratings then slipped and the finale only had 406,000 viewers. New York Daily News called the series \\"surprisingly routine,\\" Variety described it as boring, while Liz Smith said it was \\"compelling\\" and \\"usually painful to watch.\\" In April 2014, Lohan guest-starred in an episode of the CBS sitcom 2 Broke Girls. In July 2014, she filed a lawsuit against Rockstar Games claiming elements in the video game Grand Theft Auto V were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a dismissal of the case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes. In 2018, Lohan again attempted to sue the makers of Grand Theft Auto V, and lost the case.  Lohan made her stage debut in October 2014, starring in the London West End production of David Mamet's Speed-the-Plow, a satire about the movie business. She portrayed Karen, the secretary of a Hollywood executive, in a role originally played by Madonna. Reviews of Lohan's performance were mixed, with the Associated Press describing critical reception overall as \\"lukewarm.\\" The Stage said she was \\"out of her league\\" while The Times wrote that she \\"can act a bit\\" and The Guardian said she \\"holds the stage with ease.\\" In December 2014, the free-to-play video game app Lindsay Lohan's The Price of Fame was released for the iOS and Android operating systems. Polygon said it was \\"funny, trashy and surprisingly self-aware\\" while Vulture called it \\"a crappy knockoff of Kim Kardashian: Hollywood.\\" In May 2015, a judge ended Lohan's probation after she completed the community service that resulted from her 2012 reckless driving, making it the first time in nearly 8 years that she was probation free.  In 2015, the English band Duran Duran announced that Lohan had been featured on the song \\"Dancephobia\\" from their upcoming fourteenth studio album, Paper Gods. In June 2016, Lohan confirmed her intentions for recording and releasing her third studio album during an online video chat with her fans. Lohan confirmed that she owed her record label one final album, as per her contract, and would only release music once it would not upset her younger sister, Ali, who is also pursuing her own music career.  In December 2016, Lohan opened Lohan Nightclub in Athens, Greece. Lohan serves as a part-owner along with making bi-monthly promotional appearances. In an appearance on The Wendy Williams Show, she hinted at plans to open a second facility in Mykonos.  In June 2017, Lohan announced she was starting a lifestyle site called Preemium, which subscribers could access for 2.99 a month.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Does she have other companies that she owns?","output":"Yes, Lindsay Lohan has other companies that she owns.

Choices: i. yes; ii. it is not possible to tell; iii. no;","output":"i. yes; The premise, \\"So I'd be obliged if you'd tell him to scoot,\\" entails the hypothesis, \\"Please tell him to leave.\\" This is because both statements essentially convey the same request, albeit with varying choices of words and tone. In the premise, the speaker uses the phrase \\"I'd be obliged,\\" which is a polite way of expressing a request or, more specifically, expressing gratitude in advance for a favor that has yet to be granted. Similarly, in the hypothesis, the word \\"Please\\" is used, indicating a polite request. The main action being requested in both statements is for someone to tell another person to leave a certain location. In the premise, the word \\"scoot\\" is employed, which is an informal and possibly quirky way of asking someone to depart from a place. In the hypothesis, the word \\"leave\\" is used, which is a more straightforward and commonly understood term for the same action. Given these similarities in meaning and structure, it is safe to conclude that the premise entails the hypothesis. Both statements are requesting that someone communicate the speaker's desire for a third party to exit or depart from their present location, and both do so in a fairly polite manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mangos grew better in the fields that Hunter owned versus those of Logan even though","output":"The Mangos grew better in the fields that Hunter owned versus those of Logan even though both farmers devoted an equal amount of time and resources, carefully tending to their trees, implementing the latest agricultural practices, and maintaining a diligent eye on their respective crops. This confounding result captured the attention of the local agricultural community, prompting a series of experiments and investigations to understand the underlying causes behind the seemingly inexplicable difference in the mango yield between Hunter's and Logan's fields. Eventually, researchers from the regional agriculture office arrived at the properties to study the phenomenon and gather data on critical factors influencing the crop's success. Working closely with Hunter and Logan, they gathered information on soil composition, irrigation systems, fertilization practices, sun exposure, and numerous other factors that could potentially impact the mango trees. When analyzing the data, a pattern emerged pointing towards differences in the microclimates of the two fields. Despite being located within the same region, subtle variations in temperature, humidity, and wind patterns were present. Hunter's field happened to benefit from a set of unique favorable microclimatic conditions, such as slightly warmer temperatures during the fruit setting stage and cooler temperatures during fruit maturation, which ultimately resulted in superior fruit quality and yield. Furthermore, it was discovered that the soil composition differed considerably at a microscale too. While the overall soil fertility in both fields was similar, the researchers found that Hunter's field had a marginally better pH level and better soil structure, allowing for more efficient water retention and nutrient uptake by the mango trees. Raised beds constructed in Hunter's field also contributed to better drainage, which proved critical during periods of heavy rainfall, preventing overwatering and root rot. Additionally, it was revealed that beneficial microorganisms, such as mycorrhizal fungi, had formed symbiotic relationships with the mango trees in Hunter's field. This partnership positively impacted the overall health of the plants, enhancing nutrient uptake and improving their resistance to pathogens. On the other hand, Logan's field was deficient in these beneficial microorganisms, which inhibited his mango trees from receiving the same beneficial effects. Overall, while it was initially perplexing to comprehend why the mango trees in Hunter's field performed significantly better than those in Logan's field, the mystery unfolded, highlighting crucial elements that contribute to the success of mango cultivation. It stressed the importance of microclimate, soil composition, and biotic relationships in determining the success of a crop. This newfound knowledge not only explained the disparity in yields between the fields but also provided valuable insights that would inform future agricultural practices in the region, improving mango cultivation for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Furthermore, the cause of such issues, as mentioned, is usually due to the .sys files.  DLL files, such as RWia450.dll, are system files that contain small programs shared by multiple applications. As for .sys files, they are crucial system files that support the functioning of your Windows operating system. Both of these file types are vital for the smooth operation of your computer software and hardware. If you are experiencing an issue with the RWia450.dll device and no sound, I suggest you try the following solutions to resolve the problem: 1. Update Your Drivers: Drivers facilitate communication between your computer's hardware and software. Outdated or missing drivers might cause DLL or SYS file issues, so ensure that all your device drivers, particularly the sound drivers, are up-to-date. You can update them from the manufacturer's website or by using a third-party tool like \\"Driver Booster.\\" 2. Run Windows System File Checker: The System File Checker (SFC) is an in-built Windows utility that inspects and fixes corrupted or damaged system files. To perform a system file check, open the Command Prompt by typing \\"cmd\\" in the search bar, right-click \\"Command Prompt,\\" and choose \\"Run as administrator.\\" In the Command Prompt, type \\"sfc /scannow\\" (without the quotes), press Enter, and wait for the scan to complete. 3. Re-register the DLL file: If the specific DLL file is causing an issue, you can try re-registering it. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator, and type the command \\"regsvr32 /u RWia450.dll\\" (without the quotes) to unregister the DLL file. Then, input \\"regsvr32 /i RWia450.dll\\" (without the quotes) to re-register it. After executing these commands, restart your computer and check if the issue persists. 4. Repair or Reinstall the Affected Software: If the issue is limited to specific software or applications, try to repair or reinstall them. This process will restore any missing or corrupted DLL and SYS files associated with the software. 5. Perform a System Restore: If the problem started recently, you might want to revert your system to a previous state when everything was working correctly. Utilize the Windows System Restore feature for this purpose, but remember that any recent software installations or changes will be undone. If these solutions do not resolve the issue, you may require advanced troubleshooting or professional assistance. In such cases, consider seeking help from an IT professional or contacting your computer's manufacturer for further support."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Woodes Rogers was the eldest son and heir of Woods Rogers, a successful merchant captain. Woodes Rogers spent part of his childhood in Poole, England, where he likely attended the local school; his father, who owned shares in many ships, was often away nine months of the year with the Newfoundland fishing fleet. Sometime between 1690 and 1696, Captain Rogers moved his family to Bristol. In November 1697, Woodes Rogers was apprenticed to Bristol mariner John Yeamans, to learn the profession of a sailor. The ships then went to the Dutch port of Batavia in what is now Indonesia, where Rogers underwent surgery to remove a musket ball from the roof of his mouth, and the expedition disposed of the less seaworthy of the two Spanish prizes. Dealing with the Dutch there constituted a violation of the British East India Company's monopoly. When the ships finally dropped anchor in the Thames River on 14 October 1711, a legal battle ensued, with the investors paying the East India Company PS6,000 (about PS820,000 at today's values) as settlement for their claim for breach of monopoly, about four percent of what Rogers brought back. The investors approximately doubled their money, while Rogers gained PS1,600 (now worth perhaps PS218,700) from a voyage which disfigured him and cost him his brother, who was killed in a battle in the Pacific. The money was probably less than he could have made at home, and was entirely absorbed by the debts his family had incurred in his absence. However, the long voyage and the capture of the Spanish ship made Rogers a national hero. Rogers was the first Englishman, in circumnavigating the globe, to have his original ships and most of his crew survive.  After his voyage, he wrote an account of it, titled A Cruising Voyage Round the World. Edward Cooke, an officer aboard Duchess, also wrote a book, A Voyage to the South Sea and Round the World, and beat Rogers to print by several months. Rogers' book was much more successful, with many readers fascinated by the account of Selkirk's rescue, which Cooke had slighted. Among those interested in Selkirk's adventure was Daniel Defoe, who appears to have read about it, and fictionalised the story as Robinson Crusoe.  While Rogers' book enjoyed financial success, it had a practical purpose--to aid British navigators and possible colonists. Much of Rogers' introduction is devoted to advocacy for the South Seas trade. Rogers notes that had there been a British colony in the South Seas, he would not have had to worry about food supplies for his crew. A third of Rogers' book is devoted to detailed descriptions of the places that he explored, with special emphasis on \\"such [places] as may be of most use for enlarging our trade\\". He describes the area of the River Plate in detail because it lay \\"within the limits of the South Sea Company\\", whose schemes had not yet burst into financial scandal. Rogers' book was carried by such South Pacific navigators as Admiral George Anson and privateering captains John Clipperton and George Shelvocke.

Paragraph: Before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month, Malaysia wasn't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world. Some of its Southeast Asian neighbors, including Indonesia and the Philippines, have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis. But Malaysia has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from British colonial rule more than half a century ago. \\"It is one of these countries, because of its geography, that doesn't have earthquakes,\\" said Ernest Bower, senior adviser for Southeast Asia studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. \\"It doesn't have tsunamis. It hasn't been tested with a disaster like this.\\" The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention. And it hasn't emerged with very good grades. \\"I think on a stress test, they're failing,\\" Bower told CNN's Jake Tapper, pointing to the government's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries. China among critics Criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane, including China and Vietnam, and from the relatives of passengers. Malaysian officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation. The majority of the people on board the plane were Chinese, and Beijing has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search, especially after Malaysia announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the Indian Ocean, away from its last confirmed location over the South China Sea. \\"The new information means the intensive search in the South China Sea for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit,\\" said a commentary published by China's state-run news agency Xinhua. \\"Even worse, the golden time for saving possible survivors, if any, was generously wasted.\\"  Question: \\"Of what nationality were the majority of people aboard Malaysia Airlines Flight 370?\\" Answer: \\"The majority of people were Chinese\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Choices: -- no. -- yes.","output":"Answer: yes.

There are hundreds of skills to help you read more in less time. Here are two skills that I think are very good. Preview -- if it's long and hard. Previewing is very useful for getting a general idea of heavy reading like long magazine articles and science reports. Here is how to preview. *Read the first two paragraphs and the last two paragraphs carefully. *Then read only the first sentence of the other paragraphs. Previewing doesn't give you all the details. It tells you not to spend time on things you don't really want or need to read. Skim -- if it's short and simple. Skimming is a good way to get a general idea of light reading, like popular magazines or the sports of your daily paper. Here's how to skim. *Get your eyes to move fast. Sweep them across each line. *Pick up only a few key words in each line. Everybody skims differently. You and I may not pick up the same words when we skim the same piece, but perhaps we'll get the same idea of what it's all about. Question: What should we do when we read a science report? Answer: Answer:","output":"When reading a science report, we should employ the previewing technique to help us consume the content more efficiently and effectively. Previewing is very useful for getting a general idea of heavy reading materials, such as long magazine articles and science reports. To preview a science report, follow these steps: 1. Read the first two paragraphs and the last two paragraphs carefully. These sections usually contain important background information, the main findings, and conclusion. 2. Then, read only the first sentence of the other paragraphs. This approach enables you to grasp the main points from each section without delving deep into the details. It is important to note that previewing does not provide all the details of the science report. However, it helps you to understand the main points and decide whether the report is worth spending more time on, based on your goals and interests.

Big Butte Creek drains approximately 245 square miles (635 km2) of southern Oregon. Elevations range from 1,562 feet (476.1 m) at the creek's mouth to 9,495 feet (2,894 m) at the summit of Mount McLoughlin, with an average of 3,528 feet (1,075 m). About 56 percent is federally owned by the Bureau of Land Management and the United States Forest Service, 44 percent is privately owned, and a small fraction belongs to the City of Medford.The Big Butte Creek watershed experiences a Mediterranean climate. Temperatures range from 10 °F (−12 °C) in the winter to 100 °F (38 °C) in the summer. Precipitation averages between 35 and 80 inches (890 and 2,000 mm) annually. Most precipitation occurs between November and March. Nine percent of the watershed's surface runoff is collected from rain, 35 percent from rain on snow, and 56 percent from snow. The watershed contains the largest groundwater source in the entire Rogue River basin; one major outlet is at Big Butte Springs.The watershed is split into two geographic regions: the High Cascades and the Western Cascades, both volcanic in origin. The Western Cascades compose the western two thirds of the watershed. This region is highly eroded, being between 17 and 38 million years old. Its unstable slopes are primarily made of pyroclastic rock. Due to the rock's high ability to absorb moisture, earthflows are common. The High Cascades are much younger, around three to seven million years old. Mount McLoughlin is the most prominent High Cascade volcano in the watershed, last erupting between 20,000 and 15,000 years ago. Basalt and andesite are the most common rock types in this region.Nearby watersheds include Little Butte Creek to the south, small Klamath River tributaries such as Fourmile Creek to the east, the South Fork Rogue River to the east and north, and minor tributaries of the Rogue River including Reese and Indian creeks to the west. Answer:","output":"Pyroclastic rock is the type of rock that has a high ability to absorb moisture. This rock is primarily found in the Western Cascades region of the Big Butte Creek watershed, contributing to the occurrence of earthflows in the area due to its moisture-absorbing properties."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The schools are all small but they offer wonderful education.  Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. The two sentences provide different pieces of information and do not necessarily imply each other. Sentence 1 states that there are four distinct schools within the structure, and every school has its own portal and inner courtyard. This information focuses on the layout and physical aspects of the schools, but does not provide any details about the quality of education they offer. Sentence 2, on the other hand, talks about the size of the schools and the quality of education provided. It claims that while the schools are small, they provide a wonderful education. This particular sentence focuses on the educational aspects of the schools rather than their structure. Since the first sentence discusses the structure and the second sentence discusses the quality of education, one does not entail the other. In other words, knowing only the information in Sentence 1 would not lead you to necessarily assume the information in Sentence 2, and vice versa. Both sentences can have their own truth values independently and do not necessarily depend on the validity of the other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Is language, like food, a basic human need? Judging from the extreme experiment of Frederick in the 13th century, it may be. Hoping to discover what language a child would speak if he heard no mother tongue he told the nurses to keep silent. All the babies died before the first year. But clearly there was more than language deprivation (,). What was missing was good mothering. Without good mothering, in the first year of life especially, the ability to survive is seriously affected. Today no such extreme deprivation exists as that ordered by Frederick. Nevertheless, some children are still backward in speaking. Most often the reason for this is that the mother is insensitive to signals of the baby, whose brain is programmed, to mop up language rapidly. There are critical times, it seems when children learn more rapidly. If these sensitive periods are neglected, the ideal time for acquiring skills passes and they might never be learned so easily again. Linguists suggest that speech milestones are reached in a fixed order and at a constant age, but there are cases where speech has started late in a child who eventually turns out to be of high IQ. Recent evidence suggests that a baby is born with the ability to speak. What is special about man's brain, compared with that of the monkey, is the complex system which enables a child to connect the sight and feel of, say, a teddy bear with the sound pattern \\"teddy bear\\". But speech has to be developed, and this depends on interaction between the mother and the child, where the mother recognizes the signals in the child's babbling, clinging, grasping, crying, smiling, and responds to them. Insensitivity of the mother to these signals reduces the interaction because the child gets discouraged and sends out only the obvious signals. Sensitivity to the child's nonverbal   signals is basic to the growth and development of language. Question: Frederick's experiment was extreme because   _  . - he wanted to prove children are born with ability to speak - he wanted his nurses to say another language - he was unkind to the nurses - he ignored the importance of mothering to the babies A:","output":"Frederick's experiment was extreme because he ignored the importance of mothering to the babies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

CHAPTER XI  After nearly six months in the Nueces gorge the loneliness and inaction of his life drove Duane out upon the trails seeking anything rather than to hide longer alone, a prey to the scourge of his thoughts. The moment he rode into sight of men a remarkable transformation occurred in him. A strange warmth stirred in him--a longing to see the faces of people, to hear their voices--a pleasurable emotion sad and strange. But it was only a precursor of his old bitter, sleepless, and eternal vigilance. When he hid alone in the brakes he was safe from all except his deeper, better self; when he escaped from this into the haunts of men his force and will went to the preservation of his life.  Mercer was the first village he rode into. He had many friends there. Mercer claimed to owe Duane a debt. On the outskirts of the village there was a grave overgrown by brush so that the rude-lettered post which marked it was scarcely visible to Duane as he rode by. He had never read the inscription. But he thought now of Hardin, no other than the erstwhile ally of Bland. For many years Hardin had harassed the stockmen and ranchers in and around Mercer. On an evil day for him he or his outlaws had beaten and robbed a man who once succored Duane when sore in need.

Questions: Where would you put groceries after you have bought them and reached your house? Options: - refrigerator - supermarket - pantry - shelf - trunk","output":"When you have bought groceries and reached your house, the appropriate place to store them would depend on the type of groceries you have purchased. However, common sense would suggest organizing groceries into different categories, such as perishable items, non-perishable items, and household supplies. Then, store them in the appropriate locations accordingly. Here is a detailed plan for storing the items based on the options provided: 1. Refrigerator: Groceries that require refrigeration or those with shorter shelf lives should be stored in the refrigerator. These include dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese; fresh produce like fruits, vegetables, and herbs; raw meat, poultry, and seafood; and any other items that mention \\"keep refrigerated\\" on their packaging. The refrigerator helps maintain these items at the right temperature, ensuring that they remain fresh and safe for consumption. 2. Pantry: A pantry is an ideal place for storing canned, jarred, and packaged food items that do not require refrigeration or have longer shelf lives. Such items include canned vegetables, soups, and meats, pasta, rice, cereals, and other grain products, baking ingredients like sugar, salt, and flour, and condiments like ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise. These products should be kept in a cool, dry, and dark place to prevent spoilage and prolong their shelf life. 3. Shelf: Kitchen shelves, particularly those used for storing dry/canned goods or spices, are also excellent storage spaces for items that do not need refrigeration. This could include dry, non-perishable items such as cereals, boxed pasta, baking supplies, and spices. Make sure to organize your kitchen shelves to allow proper airflow and prevent overcrowding, which could impact the quality and freshness of the products. 4. Trunk: The trunk is an inappropriate place to store groceries after you have bought them and reached your house. It is usually located inside your car and is meant for temporary storage of items during transportation. Storing groceries in the trunk for an extended period could result in spoilage, damage, and even infestations from insects or rodents. In conclusion, based on the options provided and using common sense, the appropriate places to store your groceries after arriving home from the supermarket would be the refrigerator for perishable items, pantry for non-perishable items that need a cool, dry, and dark place, and shelves for other dry items and spices. Storing your groceries properly will help you maintain their quality and freshness, ensuring that they remain safe to consume, and extending their shelf life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The maker usually ferments the raw meat mixture for a day, then stuffs it into either an edible natural or inedible cellulose casing, and hangs it up to cure. Some recipes apply heat to about 40 °C (104 °F) to accelerate fermentation and drying. Higher temperatures (about 60 °C (140 °F)) stop the fermentation when the salami reaches the desired pH, but the product is not fully cooked (75 °C (167 °F) or higher). Makers often treat the casings with an edible mold (Penicillium) culture. The mold imparts flavor, helps the drying process, and helps prevent spoilage during curing. Is it true that do you eat the white coating on salami?","output":"Yes, it is true that you can eat the white coating on salami. The white coating, often found on the outside of salami and other cured meats, consists of an edible mold called Penicillium. This mold plays a crucial role in the development of the salami's flavor, texture, and preservation. When salami is made, after the raw meat mixture is fermented and stuffed into casings, it is hung to cure. During the curing process, mold cultures, primarily Penicillium, are intentionally applied or allowed to grow on the casings. The mold serves several purposes: 1. Flavor development: The mold contributes to the unique and complex flavor of salami. As the mold grows and develops, it breaks down proteins and fats in the meat, creating distinct flavor compounds. 2. Drying: The mold helps to regulate the moisture content of the salami. As it grows, it absorbs and removes excess moisture from the surface, promoting an even drying process and preventing the growth of harmful microorganisms. 3. Preservation: The mold acts as a natural preservative, preventing the growth of undesirable bacteria and fungi on the salami. This is crucial for maintaining the safety and quality of the product during the lengthy curing process. While the white mold coating is entirely safe and edible, some people may prefer to remove it before consuming the salami. If you find the mold's taste or texture unappealing, you can peel off the casing or scrape off the mold before eating. It is essential to note that this white mold coating should not be confused with harmful mold, which may appear in various colors, including green, blue, or black, and should not be consumed. If you notice any strange odors or off-colored mold on salami, it is best to discard the product as it could be spoiled. In conclusion, the white coating on salami is safe to eat and contributes to the product's unique flavor and preservation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Talk to your doctor about taking vitamin supplements.\\"","output":"Title: \\"Natural Healing: Using Foods, Supplements, and Alternative Therapies for Ovarian Health\\" Introduction: Ovarian health is essential for overall well-being in women. Rich in antioxidants, vitamins, and minerals, certain vegetables and dietary adjustments can provide relief from various conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), ovarian cysts, or even promote ovarian health in general. Additionally, alternative therapies, including using castor oil packs and systemic enzyme therapy, may help support recovery and reduce inflammation. This article explores various methods to help improve ovarian health and support the healing process. 1. Rich in Vegetables for Ovarian Healing: A diet high in vegetables offers an abundance of essential nutrients that promote overall health, including ovarian well-being. Vegetables, such as leafy greens, cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and cauliflower, and antioxidant-rich colorful vegetables like bell peppers, promote optimal hormone balance, reduce inflammation, and improve blood flow to the ovaries, which may help alleviate some ovarian issues. Incorporating a variety of vegetables into your daily meals ensures a well-rounded intake of valuable nutrients. 2. Potassium-rich Foods for Improved Ovary Function: Potassium is an essential mineral that supports nerve and muscle functions, fluid balance in the body, and the proper functioning of cells. Foods high in potassium, such as bananas, sweet potatoes, and spinach, may help in reducing the symptoms associated with ovarian cysts by promoting healthy fluid regulation and reducing water retention. As a counterbalance to sodium, potassium also helps maintain healthy blood pressure levels, which is crucial for overall health and well-being. 3. Drinking Apple Cider Vinegar for Ovary Support: Apple cider vinegar (ACV) has a long history of use as a natural remedy and supports gut health by promoting better digestion. When consumed in moderation – no more than 1 to 2 tablespoons per day – ACV may aid in balancing blood sugar levels and helping detoxify the liver, which in turn can optimize hormonal balance within the body. Diluting ACV in water and ingesting it first thing in the morning is an effective way to incorporate this product into your daily routine. 4. Systemic Enzyme Therapy for Ovarian Health: Systemic enzyme therapy refers to the use of enzymes as a natural healing modality. Enzymes like bromelain, serrapeptase, and papain can help break down excess proteins and support the body’s natural inflammatory response. By reducing inflammation, these enzymes may improve blood flow to the ovaries, alleviate pain, and potentially even reduce the size of ovarian cysts. If considering systemic enzyme therapy, consult with a healthcare professional for personalized guidance and recommendations. 5. Using Castor Oil Packs for Ovary Support: Castor oil, sourced from the seeds of the Ricinus communis plant, is an ancient remedy that may help improve ovarian health by supporting the body’s detoxification processes and reducing inflammation. To use a castor oil pack, saturate a flannel cloth with the oil, place it over the affected ovary, and apply gentle heat using a hot water bottle or heating pad for 45-60 minutes daily. This practice can help stimulate blood circulation and lymphatic drainage, promoting the healing of ovarian cysts and reducing pain associated with other ovarian issues. 6. Vitamin Supplements under Doctor's Supervision: For individuals suffering from ovarian conditions, vitamin supplementation may provide additional support. Vitamins B6, C, D, and E have all been shown to play a role in hormonal balance and ovarian health. It is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any supplement regime, as they will assess your individual needs and recommend the appropriate dosages and combinations of supplements to complement other treatments and dietary approaches. Conclusion: Natural healing methods, such as incorporating a vegetable-rich diet, potassium-rich foods, apple cider vinegar, systemic enzyme therapy, and castor oil packs, coupled with vitamin supplementation, may help alleviate symptoms and support the healing process for individuals with ovarian-related issues. As with any treatment plan, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional to ensure that the selected methods are appropriate and tailored to individual needs for optimal benefits and safety."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Age of Enlightenment, also known as the Age of Reason, refers to an intellectual and philosophical movement that dominated the world of ideas in Europe during the 17th and 18th centuries. The Enlightenment emphasized the importance of reason, science, and individualism and sought to reform society using these principles. Prominent philosophers of this time, including John Locke, Voltaire, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, wrote works that greatly influenced both the American and French Revolutions. The Age of Enlightenment can be considered to have come to an end towards the close of the 18th century, as the scientific and rationalist ideas became more widely accepted, leading to societal transformations. The Industrial Revolution, which began during the mid-18th century, was a period of significant technological advancement, industrial growth, and socioeconomic change. It marked the shift from agrarian, rural societies to industrialized, urban ones. The introduction of new machinery and techniques revolutionized various industries, especially the textile industry. Steam power and iron production also improved, leading to innovations in transportation and communication. Although the Industrial Revolution continued on into the 19th century, its origins and early developments were largely concentrated in the late 18th century. Lastly, the American Revolution, which took place from 1765 to 1783, marked the end of British colonial rule in the Thirteen American Colonies. This period witnessed a series of political and social transformations, sparked by unrest over issues such as taxation, representation, and the perceived tyranny of the British government. The Revolutionary War eventually led to the signing of the Treaty of Paris in 1783, which recognized the independence and sovereignty of the United States. In conclusion, to answer the question \\"What period ended towards the end of the 18th century?\\" it is more appropriate to discuss the Age of Enlightenment, which saw the spread of scientific and rationalist ideas; the early phase of the Industrial Revolution, characterized by technological advancements and industrial growth; and the end of British colonial rule in America due to the American Revolution and the subsequent Treaty of Paris. These events and movements signify major historical shifts that correspond with the end of the 18th century, setting the stage for the developments of the 19th century."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right (Focus Features) is the movie we've been waiting for all year: a comedy that doesn't take cheap shots, a drama that doesn't manipulate, a movie of ideas that doesn't preach. It's a rich, layered, juicy film, with quiet revelations punctuated by big laughs. And it leaves you feeling wistful for at least three reasons: because of what happens in the story, because the movie's over, and because there aren't more of them this good.      Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening) are a middle-aged lesbian couple in Los Angeles with two teenage children, Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson). Nic, a physician, is the breadwinner of this stable, well-off family, while the unfocused Jules has vague plans to start a landscaping business on her partner's dime. Near the start of the movie, Joni, at her younger brother's urging, calls up the sperm bank that provided their mothers with genetic material 18 years ago. Behind their mothers' backs, the siblings make contact with their hitherto anonymous biological father, Paul (Mark Ruffalo), a hedonistic restaurateur who's flattered by the attention but unsure how to proceed. Gradually, Paul is incorporated into the fringes of the family: The children bring him home for an excruciatingly awkward lunch, and against Nic's wishes, Jules takes on the job of landscaping his yard.      It's fitting that gardening—Jules' landscaping project, Paul's achingly trendy farm-to-table restaurant—plays such a large role in The Kids Are All Right, because the movie is at heart about the ecosystem of a family, and the way that system changes when an exotic species is introduced. The presence of Paul changes everything, exposing fault lines in Nic and Jules' relationship and forcing the children to defy their mothers and reassess their peer friendships. (A subplot in which the introverted Laser finally stands up to his jerky best friend is particularly well-handled.)      In one of the movie's funniest scenes, Nic unleashes her hostility toward Paul in an icy diatribe about the organic-food fad: \\"If I hear one more person say how much they love heirloom tomatoes, I'm going to punch them right in the face.\\" Without ever making the comparison outright, Cholodenko and her co-writer Stuart Blumberg draw a parallel between the aspiration for organic purity and the myth of the perfect family. However assiduously you cultivate your garden, they suggest, there's no predicting what might crop up by surprise or how it'll grow.      In a movie whose story hinges entirely on how the characters treat one other, the acting here is really interacting, and this stellar ensemble cast gets it exactly right. Bening makes Nic a force to be reckoned with: an acid-tongued workaholic who loves her wine a little more than she should but who's such lively company you understand what Jules sees in her. A scene in which Nic sings Joni Mitchell's \\"All I Want\\" a cappella at a dinner party veers from embarrassment to exaltation—and then back to embarrassment again.      Advertisement            The ever-astounding Julianne Moore finds lots of layers in Jules: passive-aggression, vulnerability, coquettish vanity, sexual hunger. Ruffalo just Ruffaloes it up, playing the kind of part that's been his subspecialty since You Can Count on Me: the immature but well-meaning and rakishly sexy scamp. And as the kids who aren't always, but eventually will be, all right, Wasikowska and Hutcherson are tentative and tender and convincingly sibling-like. The scene in which the family drops the college-bound Joni off at her freshman dorm will wring tears even from the few audience members who made it dry-eyed through Toy Story 3.      More than anything, The Kids Are All Right is a film about marriage. Not about gay marriage in particular, though the portrait of this couple's decades-long bond underscores the absurdity of the debate about what to call same-sex unions. Cholodenko, who has a donor child with her partner, isn't making a rah-rah commercial for alternative families—in fact, some gay viewers may bristle at the movie's less-than-orthodox take on lesbian sexuality and the complications of donor parenthood. What Cholodenko has aimed for, and achieved, is something bigger: a serious and funny film about the simple yet incomprehensibly fraught act of moving through time with the person you love.

The Kids Are All Right: The movie we've been waiting for all year. ||||| \\"All right\\" doesn't begin to describe it. \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is wonderful. Here is a film that respects andall of its characters, the give-and-take and recklessness and wisdom of any functioning family unit, conventional or un-. The independently financed 5 million indie, picked up for distribution by Focus Features, is the easiest movie to love I've seen all year.In writer-director Lisa Cholodenko 's previous theatrical releases, the New York-set \\"High Art\\" and the Los Angeles -set \\" Laurel Canyon,\\" the filmmaker proved adept at examining relationships from close quarters. She's especially shrewd at delineating how a vulnerable soul can be pulled into undiscovered country, perilous and exciting. Every action or transgression comes with a price, however, and that's why Cholodenko is so good; she sees the reasons behind everyone's behavior. Her films are well-made in a straightforward, humanistic vein, yet emotionally expansive and open-ended, like all good fiction.This holds especially true in \\"The Kids Are All Right,\\" which is set in the sunny hillsides of LA and was co-written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg. Already it has become known as the \\"lesbian moms film\\" or the \\"sperm donor dad movie,\\" both of which are true, if reductive. Doctor Nic ( Annette Bening ) and her longtime partner, Jules ( Julianne Moore ), have two teenagers from the same sperm donor. Daughter Joni ( Mia Wasikowska ), heading off to college, is leaving behind a younger brother, Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ), who has grown curious about the identity of their father.Contact is made, behind the moms' backs, and in a charmingly awkward scene, Mark Ruffalo 's restaurateur Paul — an easygoing SoCal satyr, open to any new experience — says he'd be willing to have some sort of relationship, or friendship, with these two. From there the narrative offers an equal number of satisfying inevitables and gratifying surprises. The Bening character, a hard-drinking, somewhat fearsome control freak, doesn't like the idea of this man entering their lives. Moore's character, a fledgling landscape gardener who's hired to transform Paul's canyon hillside into something more than untended scrub, sees him differently, more forgivingly. She's also intrigued by this boy-man in his 40s who seems to live in a seductive fog of availability.Shot on pleasantly hazy 35 mm by cinematographer Igor Jadue-Lillo, Cholodenko's film is conversational without being stagey. Bening and Moore have never been looser or wittier on screen, and Ruffalo is the perfect foil, a man who enjoys a romantic challenge as much as a sure thing. Wasikowska and Hutcherson are two of the truest, most direct young screen actors working today. Like Kenneth Lonergan's \\"You Can Count on Me\\" a decade ago, which also co-starred Ruffalo, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is a triumph of simple technique wedded to complex and satisfying comedy- drama An LA friend came out of Lonergan's film saying, \\"I love it, and I can't even tell you why, exactly.\\" I suspect Cholodenko's achievement will elicit similar responses among all kinds of moviegoers.R (for strong sexual content, nudity, language and some teen drug and alcohol use)Annette Bening (Nic); Julianne Moore (Jules); Mark Ruffalo (Paul); Mia Wasikowska (Joni); Josh Hutcherson (Laser); Yaya DaCosta (Tanya)Directed by Lisa Cholodenko; written by Cholodenko and Stuart Blumberg; produced by Gary Gilbert, Jeffrey Levy-Hinte, Celine Rattray, Jordan Horowitz and Daniela Taplin Lundberg. A Focus Features release. Running time: 1:44 ||||| Witty, urbane and thoroughly entertaining, \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is an ode to the virtues of family, in this case a surprisingly conventional one even with its two moms, two kids and one sperm donor. Whatever your politics, between peerless performances, lyrical direction and an adventurous script, this is the sort of pleasingly grown-up fare all too rare in the mainstream daze of this very dry summer.Before delving into the layered perfection of Annette Bening Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo , let's start by getting past any hesitations or reservations about the lesbian household premise on which \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is based. The issue of gay marriage is not what's on the table here. At its heart, this is a movie about how families, whatever their composition, stay together, love each other through difficult times, and weather the particularly storm-tossed seas that come when the kids hit their teenage years. (Why the 2s are considered terrible instead of the teens, I'll never understand).Writer-director Lisa Cholodenko and co-writer Stuart Blumberg have put the politics aside for now and created an easy interplay of comedy and drama spawned by typical family pressures — the thank you notes that haven't been sent, the sketchy best friend the parents don't approve of, the house rules made to be broken. It helps that the characters are eminently relatable at the same time intriguingly iconoclastic, no small feat. For those who are wondering, there is some sheet tangling, sweaty sex, but it's mostly of the hetero variety courtesy of the very appealing Ruffalo.The laughter and the tears are set in motion when 15-year-old Laser ( Josh Hutcherson ) presses his 18-year-old sister Joni (an excellent Mia Wasikowska ) to use her new legal standing to find out who their bio-dad is. While curiosity does not quite kill the cat, it definitely upends this seemingly settled family headed by Bening's Nic, a doctor and by-the-book breadwinner and Moore's Jules, the easy-going stay-at-home half. As for the kids, Joni's an honors student headed to college in the fall and Laser's the star athlete trying to figure out his emerging self, so definitely they're all right, but change is in the air.Enter Ruffalo's Paul, a PC-liberal dreamboat of a donor dad, who spends his days tending the organic vegetable garden that supplies his hipster-chic restaurant at night. He also comes with a self-deprecatingly smug charm about his college dropout success, farm-to-table lifestyle and unencumbered bachelorhood. By the time Nic finally breaks in the face of all that eco-goodness dissolving into an anti-composting rant, it's hard to suppress the desire to cheer.With all the players in place, the filmmakers set about deconstructing life as the family knows it, with Paul their weapon of mass deconstruction. Everything about him is seductive, with the kids falling hard for their newly acquired father-figure, followed in short order by Jules and even a very resistant Nic. But then, the lovable incorrigible is Ruffalo's sweet spot and his performance here, if possible, is even more refined than his breakout in another intimate family drama, \\"You Can Count on Me.\\"At first Paul represents endless possibility: the cool parent whom kids fantasize about, the unexpected lover who believes in you and your dreams, the latecomer who turns out to be the life of the party even as his very presence is redefining the family. But in filmmaker Cholodenko's increasingly sure hands, life is neither easy, nor neat and tidy. As she has done in her previous work, \\"High Art\\" and the incisive \\"Laurel Canyon,\\" she cuts to the bone of human emotions, with the humans themselves fraying around the edges.In \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" it's hard to tell who is fraying faster, Nic or Jules. They are a typical long-coupled couple, focused on the routine of daily life and forgetful of the romance that brought them together. At home, as well as at work, Bening's Nic is scalpel sharp. Tension radiates around her like an energy field with Bening using it against her fear of the unknown and then the greater fear of the known.As the serious one with a domineering streak, Bening has the harder task unearthing her character's humanity without any of the cuddle factor that everyone else has been given. But as she did in \\"American Beauty,\\" she makes the unlikable understandable, forgivable. In \\"Kids\\" she manages to be funny in ways so subtle you might miss them if they weren't so perfectly played in the cock of her head, the roll of an eye. And when the deep wounds come, and they do, you're allowed tears even if Nic isn't.Where Nic is brittle, Jules is the bough that breaks and in taking her there Moore is fearless. There are countless moments when the actress strips bare before the camera — sometimes literally, sometimes emotionally, but always with an abandon that exposes all of the character's complicated layers. Jules is an existential bundle of unrealized need and midlife uncertainty, and Moore plays every note perfectly.The kids, who really serve as a counterweight for the craziness brought about by bio-dad's desire to have a place in their lives, are refreshingly real. Wasikowska, in particular, is exceptional — disappointment lingering in her eyes, face quivering on the edge of tears as one after another of her parents lets her down, as parents inevitably do. While she may be best known for her delightful Alice in Tim Burton 's \\"Alice in Wonderland,\\" it is the mix of vulnerability and steel she brings to HBO's \\"In Treatment,\\" as one of Gabriel Byrne 's troubled clients, that most informs Joni.Before they've finished wringing everything out of their actors, the filmmakers dredge through the issues — age old and thoroughly modern — that come along to threaten that most basic of bonds. Fierce, funny, smart and overflowing with love, this unconventionally conventional film sits squarely in the family values camp, which is exactly where it belongs. ||||| Lesbian Family Values in The Kids Are All Right Two moms, two kids, and a sperm donor make one all-American movie      Serious comedy, powered by an enthusiastic cast and full of good-natured innuendo, Lisa Cholodenko's The Kids Are All Right gives adolescent coming-of-age and the battle of the sexes a unique twist, in part by creating a romantic triangle between a long-standing, devoutly bourgeois lesbian couple Nic and Jules (Annette Bening and Julianne Moore) and the newly identified, merrily free-spirited sperm donor, Paul (Mark Ruffalo), responsible for both the couple's teenage children, Joni and Laser (Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson).      Normality, as made clear by the introductory family dinner that features two mothers acting all motherly, rules. The kids refer to their American-as-apple-pie parents in the plural, as in \\"that really hurt the moms' feelings.\\" (The moms' designated kink is their occasional use of gay male porn as an aphrodisiac—although even this gets an amusingly didactic explanation.) Whereas Cholodenko's two previous features, High Art (1998) and Laurel Canyon (2003), each focused on an innocent young woman swept up in the glamorously baffling sex-and-drugs scene swirling around a charismatic older female artist, the situation here is reversed; unexpectedly drawn in to and fascinated by the ultra-domestic household created by a pair of charismatic femmes, the swinger is the straight man (literally).      A happily hippified gardener-/restaurateur-cum-sex-object, Paul is introduced balling his employees and otherwise spreading his (organic) seed. \\"I love lesbians!\\" is his initial response upon coming face-to-face with his grown-up spermatozoa and being informed of their family situation. Although it was the 15-year-old Laser who prompted the father-and-child reunion, he's a sensitive jock who's put off by blithely diffident Paul's lack of enthusiasm for team sports; on the other hand, big sister Joni, still a virgin on the eve of college, finds this groovy stud really cool (as in hot). And so does Jules, especially after Paul engages her to landscape his backyard. (Unlike her workaholic doctor spouse, she has a bit of time on her hands.) We can tell where this is going when she describes Paul's overgrown grounds as \\"fecund.\\"      Cholodenko's previous features have amply demonstrated her talent for directing actresses. High Art (1998), her genuinely edgy debut, gave aged-out brat-packer Ally Sheedy the opportunity to give her first real adult performance as a reclusive photographer, while memorably showcasing then-unknown Patricia Clarkson as Sheedy's hilariously Teutonic lover; Laurel Canyon (2003) provided the much-abused Frances McDormand with a rare opportunity to strut her stuff and even extracted a more than default-decorative turn from Kate Beckinsale. Given a reliably stellar duo in Bening and Moore, Cholodenko makes their rapport her key performance. The actresses are loose and funny, trading off big scenes and clearly enjoying themselves throughout. The acerbic Nic gets the best lines (\\"I need your observations like I need a dick in my ass!\\" she snaps, when Paul presumes to offer her parenting advice) and even gets to drunkenly yowl her way through Joni Mitchell's \\"All I Want,\\" although Jules has the movie's pre-eminent solo of truth.      Premiered last January at Sundance, The Kids Are All Right triggered considerable discussion as well as a lively bidding war. The excitement is unsurprising. Despite, or perhaps in accordance with, its '60s rock-and-roll title, it's actually a pretty conservative movie—particularly when compared to Cholodenko's previous works. Given its juicy premise, The Kids could have been played for sitcom, reality show, or soap opera—had it been made in 1970, it might have been an Echo Park Teorema, with everyone winding up in bed together. Ten years into the 21st century, it's a heartfelt poster for family values. Everything new is old again.      jhoberman@villagevoice.com ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The Kids Are All Right is a comedy-drama film directed by Lisa Cholodenko that tells the story of a middle-aged lesbian couple, Jules (Julianne Moore) and Nic (Annette Bening), living in Los Angeles with their two teenage children, Joni (Mia Wasikowska) and Laser (Josh Hutcherson).

Write an article based on this summary: Scottish Labour leadership hopeful Kezia Dugdale said her politics were not \\"wildly different\\" from left-winger Jeremy Corbyn, who is favourite to win the UK party's contest. Article:","output":"Title: Kezia Dugdale's Politics Resonate with Jeremy Corbyn's Ideals Introduction: The political landscape of the United Kingdom is witnessing a surge in leadership contests within the parties, as politicians vie for control of their respective factions. A notable figure in this scenario is Kezia Dugdale, a Scottish Labour leadership hopeful, who recently voiced her political views and opined that they were not \\"wildly different\\" from those of Jeremy Corbyn, the left-wing frontrunner in the UK Labour Party's leadership contest. This article seeks to explore the implications of their possible alignment in policy and the potential impact on both the Scottish and UK Labour parties. Kezia Dugdale's Standing: As a member of the Scottish Parliament since 2011, Kezia Dugdale has made her presence felt in the Scottish political sphere. With her focus on education and social justice, Dugdale quickly rose through the ranks to become the deputy leader of the Scottish Labour Party in 2014. As she vies for the top post within the party, it is significant that her political views align with the popular Jeremy Corbyn. Jeremy Corbyn's Ascend: Labour MP Jeremy Corbyn has gained a massive following in recent years, often hailed as the face of the left-wing resurgence in UK politics. His policies advocating for economic equality, social justice and an anti-austerity stance have resonated with many working-class Britons, making him a frontrunner for the leadership of the UK Labour Party. Common Ground: Upon analyzing the political stances of both Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn, it becomes evident that their ideologies share several similarities. While they may not agree on every policy, their focus on social justice, education, and the welfare of the working class embodies the ideals of the Labour party itself. The possible convergence of their political strategies offers a tantalizing prospect to the voters in Scotland and the United Kingdom, who are looking for a more formidable force to counter the ruling Conservative Party. Impact on Scottish Labour Party: Should Kezia Dugdale become the leader of the Scottish Labour Party, her like-mindedness with Jeremy Corbyn could lead to a stronger and more united front within the party. This renewed sense of purpose and unity could work wonders in regaining the trust and support of the Scottish people, who have leaned towards the Scottish National Party (SNP) in recent years. Implications for the UK Labour Party: A possible collaboration between Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn could yield fruitful results for the UK Labour Party as well. As the power dynamic shifts within the party, their collective focus on social justice, worker's rights, and progressive policies could serve to reinvigorate the party on a national level, making them a more competitive force against the Conservative majority in Parliament. Conclusion: Politics has often been described as the art of compromise, and in this case, the similar political views shared by Kezia Dugdale and Jeremy Corbyn could pave the way for greater cooperation and success for both the Scottish and UK Labour parties. For the voters in Scotland and the United Kingdom, the union of these two leaders could signal a compelling alternative to the existing political status quo, potentially ushering in a new era of progressive politics in the face of conservative dominance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: In what quarter was the longest touchdown pass?","output":"Title: [A Look Back at the Longest Touchdown Pass in NFL History: The Fateful Quarter] Introduction The game of football, particularly the National Football League (NFL), has been a perennial source of impressive athletic feats and record-breaking milestones. One such unforgettable moment in NFL history is the longest ever touchdown pass, which has left fans and analysts debating the ideal circumstances and strategies that clinched this record. This article delves into the background, unfolding events, and the unforgettable quarter that witnessed this remarkable throwing distance. Background and Context The current NFL record for the longest touchdown pass was set on September 27, 1981, during a regular-season game between the Miami Dolphins and the New York Jets. Jets' quarterback Richard Todd and wide receiver Wesley Walker teamed up for the awe-inspiring play that spanned a total of 98 yards. As of today, this remains the longest completed touchdown pass in NFL history. The Fateful Quarter: A Breakdown The record-breaking touchdown pass happened during the third quarter of the game. Considering the pressing need for strategic plays as the game approached its final stretch, this quarter became the perfect stage for showcasing audacity, grit, and perfect execution. The third quarter took off with the Miami Dolphins leading the scoreboard 21-14. However, the Jets had other plans as they took possession of the ball on their 2-yard line, seemingly unaware of the impending feat. The Jets' quarterback, Richard Todd, took the snap and dropped back into his end zone. As he stood poised to pass, the offensive line provided Todd with the time he needed to scan the field for an open target. Amid a sea of defensive pressure and hasty positioning, wide receiver Wesley Walker broke free from the Dolphins' defenders, rapidly accelerating towards the endzone. When Todd spotted Walker, he launched an electrifying long pass that seemed unstoppable. Wesley Walker outpaced the defense, catching the ball around the 50-yard line, and sprinted towards the endzone. As he crossed the goal line, the realization dawned upon everyone present, including both the teams and spectators, that a historical event had just taken place. After Walker's 98-yard touchdown reception, the game continued to see touchdowns exchanged between the Dolphins and Jets, swinging the matchup's momentum one way, then another. However, this arduous battle eventually wrapped up with the Dolphins winning the game 31-28. Lessons Learned and A Lasting Legacy The longest touchdown pass in the third quarter of the Miami Dolphins versus the New York Jets game has become a symbol of strategic expertise and tactical responsiveness in the modern football world. The fact that this play took place at a crucial point in the game highlights the importance of seizing opportunities when the opposing team's guard is down and making timely, impactful decisions on the field. Moreover, the teamwork and trust displayed between Todd and Walker elevated their respective positions to new heights, proving that splinter-second decisions have the power to change careers – and etch them into the annals of football history. Conclusion The longest touchdown pass in NFL history remains a thrilling highlight from a time when football players defied all expectations during heated contests. The impressive synergy between Richard Todd and Wesley Walker in the fateful third quarter of 1981 will surely serve as a benchmark and an inspiration to both aspiring and established athletes alike. Football fans worldwide look forward to witnessing yet another breathtaking moment that might challenge, or perhaps even shatter, this longstanding record."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

S., China, Israel, and a crowd of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon. So if and when they plant a flag, does _ give them property rights? A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies   are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions   to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative  public-private working group. He was speaking from his personal interest and not on behalf of the agency. To be sure, the United States aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as 2015, in a mission that would include a long-term settlement. China and Israel, among others, are also working on lunar projects. And for the first time, several private groups are building spacecraft to land on the moon in an attempt to win millions of dollars in the Google Lunar X Prize. Some participants say that they plan to gain some property rights in the mission. Question: We can infer from the passage that   _  . Options: A: it's a waste of time to work on the lunar project B: \\" The Outer Space Treaty\\" forbids private groups to land on the moon C: all mankind has the right to land on the moon D: whenever you come to the moon, you'll get some property rights on it Answer:","output":"C: all mankind has the right to land on the moon"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A letter to Edward, a columnist  Dear Mr Expert: I grew up in an unhappy and abusive home. I always Promised myself that I'd get out as soon as possible. Now, at age 20,I have a good job and a nice house, and I'm really proud of the independence I've achieved. Here's the problem: several of my friends who still live with their parents wish they had places like mine -- so much so that they make mine theirs. It started out with a couple of them spending the weekends with me. But now they seem to take it for granted that they can shou up any time they like. They bring boyfriends over, talk on the phone and stay out forever. I enjoy having my friends here sometimes-- it makes the place feel comfortable and warm-- but this is my home, not a party house. I was old enough to move out on my own, so why can't I seem to ask my friends to respect my privacy ? Joan Edward's reply to Joan Dear Joan: If your family didn't pay attention to your needs when you were a child, you probably have trouble letting others know your needs now. And if you've gathesed yourfriends around you to rebuild a happy family atmosphere ,you may fear that saying no will bring back the kind of conflict you grew up with-- or destroy the nice atmosphere you now enjoy. You need to understand that in true friendship it's okay to put your own needs first from time to time. Be clear about the message you want to send. For example, \\"I really love your company but I also need some privacy. So please call before you come over.\\" Question: We can infer from the first letter that_. Yes or no, is the answer \\"Joan's friends visit her more often than she can accept\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"Joan's friends visit her more often than she can accept\\". The inference can be derived from Joan's initial letter to Edward, the columnist. She describes how her friends started out by spending their weekends at her place and have now started to take it for granted that they can show up at any time they want. This includes bringing their boyfriends over, talking on the phone for long durations, and not leaving her home. Despite her feeling proud of her independence and the comfort acheived through some company, there is a sentiment of violation of privacy due to the excessive invasion by her friends. She mentions that while she does enjoy having her friends over sometimes, which makes the place feel comfortable and warm, she still views it as her home and not some sort of communal party house.  Therefore, from Joan's scenarios and the tone in her letter, it's evident that her friends visit her more often than she can accept, thereby compromising her privacy and space. This is an indication of distress and discomfort caused by the lack of understanding and respect towards Joan's personal space on her friends' part.  Joan's predicament highlights a typical interpersonal conflict where the line between personal space and companionship gets blurred. Her struggle to express her feelings to her friends might be related to her past where her needs were overlooked, an insight aptly pointed out by Edward in his response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The three theories below are essential in Earth science. Each accounts for an enormous amount of data. Each is supported by many lines of evidence. All can be used to make predications. As new evidence arises, any of these theories may need to be altered. But none of these three are likely ever to be disproved. They are accepted by nearly all of the credible scientists in their fields.   Q: In science, what is supported by much evidence, widely accepted by credible scientists, and unlikely to be disproved?   A: A:","output":"In science, a well-supported and widely accepted concept that is unlikely to be disproved is often referred to as a scientific theory. A scientific theory is a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that is acquired through the scientific method and consistently tested and refined through experimentation and observation. Scientific theories are grounded in a large body of empirical evidence, which lends them a high degree of reliability and acceptance within the scientific community. In the context of the given paragraph, the three essential theories in Earth science mentioned are prime examples of such widely accepted and well-supported scientific theories. Although it is not explicitly stated which theories these are, they potentially refer to key concepts such as the Theory of Plate Tectonics, the Theory of Evolution, and the Big Bang Theory, among others. All these theories have undergone rigorous scientific testing and are widely accepted by credible scientists in their respective fields. They are capable of making accurate predictions and are consistent with the available empirical data. Moreover, these theories are subject to modification as new evidence arises, which reflects the dynamic and self-correcting nature of the scientific process. It is important to note that scientific theories, while highly reliable and strongly supported by evidence, are never considered to be absolute truths. Instead, they represent the best available explanations for observed phenomena based on the current scientific understanding and the accumulated knowledge to date. However, their widespread acceptance and the extensive evidence supporting them make it unlikely that they will be disproved, although they may continue to evolve and improve as new data becomes available. This underlines the inherently tentative nature of scientific knowledge and highlights the importance of continuous inquiry and innovation in advancing humanity's understanding of the natural world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Dwayne Michael Carter Jr. was born on September 27, 1982, and grew up in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana. His mother, a cook, gave birth to him when she was 19 years old. His parents divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Although Wayne and Birdman have a father-son relationship and Birdman calls Carter his son, Wayne's biological father and namesake (Dwayne Carter) is still alive. Context: Carter's debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot was released when he was 17 and featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys. It debuted at No. 3 on the Billboard 200 and was later certified platinum by the RIAA. The album earned Carter a 1999 Source magazine nomination for \\"Best New Artist\\", and also became a Top Ten hit. The lead single was \\"Tha Block Is Hot\\". After the release of Tha Block is Hot, Carter was featured on the single \\"Bling Bling\\", with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. His verse appeared only on the radio version of the song, while on the album version he performed on the chorus.  His 2000 follow-up album Lights Out failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut but was certified gold by RIAA. Critics noted the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys. The lead single was \\"Get Off the Corner\\", which was noticed for an improvement in its lyrical content and style. The second single, which received less attention, was \\"Shine\\" featuring the Hot Boys. Near the release of Lights Out, Lil Wayne was featured on the single, \\"Number One Stunna\\" with Big Tymers and Juvenile, which peaked at No. 24 on the Hot Rap Tracks chart.  Lil Wayne's third album 500 Degreez, released in 2002, followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. While being certified gold like its predecessor, it also failed to match the success of his debut. The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez. The lead single was \\"Way of Life\\" which failed to match the success of his previous singles. After the release of 500 Degreez, Wayne was featured on the single \\"Neva Get Enuf\\" by 3LW. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects about this article: 1. Lil Wayne's background: Born and raised in the impoverished Hollygrove neighborhood of New Orleans, Louisiana, his challenging upbringing and personal resilience to succeed despite his circumstances are noteworthy. 2. Early success: Lil Wayne achieved significant success with his debut solo album Tha Block Is Hot at just 17 years old, showcasing his talent and potential in the music industry from a young age. The album went platinum and earned him a Source magazine nomination for \\"Best New Artist.\\" 3. Collaborations: The article highlights Lil Wayne's collaborations with other artists, such as the Hot Boys and Mannie Fresh. These partnerships not only contributed to his early career success, but also helped to shape his musical style and development. 4. Evolution of his music: The article points out that critics noted a lack of coherent narratives in his verses during his early career, yet there was an improvement in his lyrical content and style as evidenced by his subsequent albums, such as Lights Out and 500 Degreez. 5. References to other artists: The title of Lil Wayne's third album, 500 Degreez, is mentioned as a reference to Juvenile's recording, 400 Degreez. This reveals how Lil Wayne was influenced by, or responded to, the work of his fellow musicians in the industry. These aspects demonstrate Lil Wayne's early career achievements, collaborations, and evolution as an artist, offering insight into his rise to stardom."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He and his sister, Letty (b. 1943), were raised in Midwood, Brooklyn. He is the son of Nettie (nee Cherry; November 8, 1906 - January 27, 2002), a bookkeeper at her family's delicatessen, and Martin Konigsberg (December 25, 1900 - January 8, 2001), a jewelry engraver and waiter. His family was Jewish, and his grandparents immigrated to the US from Russia and Austria and spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, and German. Allen is a passionate fan of jazz, featured prominently in the soundtracks to his films. He began playing the clarinet as a child and took his stage name from clarinetist Woody Herman. He has performed publicly at least since the late 1960s, notably with the Preservation Hall Jazz Band on the soundtrack of Sleeper. One of his earliest televised performances was on The Dick Cavett Show on October 20, 1971.  Woody Allen and his New Orleans Jazz Band have been playing each Monday evening at Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel for many years (as of 2011, specializing in classic New Orleans jazz from the early twentieth century). He plays songs by Sidney Bechet, George Lewis, Johnny Dodds, Jimmie Noone and Louis Armstrong. The documentary film Wild Man Blues (directed by Barbara Kopple) documents a 1996 European tour by Allen and his band, as well as his relationship with Previn. The band has released two CDs: The Bunk Project (1993) and the soundtrack of Wild Man Blues (1997). In a 2011 review of a concert by Allen's jazz band, critic Kirk Silsbee of the L.A. Times suggested that Allen should be regarded as a competent musical hobbyist with a sincere appreciation for early jazz: \\"Allen's clarinet won't make anyone forget Sidney Bechet, Barney Bigard or Evan Christopher. His piping tone and strings of staccato notes can't approximate melodic or lyrical phrasing. Still his earnestness and the obvious regard he has for traditional jazz counts for something.\\"  Allen and his band played the Montreal International Jazz Festival on two consecutive nights in June 2008. For many years, Allen wanted to make a film about the origins of jazz in New Orleans. The film, tentatively titled American Blues, would follow the vastly different careers of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Allen stated that the film would cost between 80 and 100 million and is therefore unlikely to be made. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: How was Woody Allen involved in music?","output":"Woody Allen was deeply involved in music as a passionate fan of jazz, which is prominently featured in the soundtracks of his films. He began playing the clarinet as a child, inspired by clarinetist Woody Herman, from whom he took his stage name.

He and his New Orleans Jazz Band have been playing regularly at Manhattan's Carlyle Hotel for many years. The band has released two CDs: The Bunk Project (1993) and the soundtrack of Wild Man Blues (1997). Additionally, Allen's jazz band participated in various events, such as the Montreal International Jazz Festival. Besides performing, he has expressed a desire to make a film about the origins of jazz in New Orleans, which would focus on the careers of Louis Armstrong and Sidney Bechet. Overall, Woody Allen's involvement in music mainly revolves around his deep appreciation and love for jazz, playing the clarinet, and performing with his band."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.  Two meteorologists study Earth's climate.

We will discuss the data in terms of the number of lost matches, places, and total matches played in Finland. 1. Number of Lost Matches (6 LOST 5): The first piece of data, \\"6 LOST 5\\", suggests that there were a total of 6 lost matches. The number \\"5\\" may denote that out of these 6 lost matches, the subject from Finland lost 5 matches. This information could indicate the overall performance of the participant/team in a defined time frame or competition. 2. Placement (Finland PLACE 7): The second piece of data, \\"Finland PLACE 7\\", appears to denote the ranking or standing of the subject. In the context of a competition, this could mean that the Finnish participant/team secured the 7th position. This could be taken as a relative measure of success in comparison to other competitors. 3. Number of Matches (Finland MATCHES 6): The third set of data, \\"Finland MATCHES 6\\", represents the total number of matches that the Finnish subject participated in, which amounts to 6 matches. This information helps in understanding the context of their performance and the level of activity in a given time frame or tournament. Upon analyzing these data points, we can draw the following conclusions: - The Finnish participant/team had a moderate performance as they lost 5 out of the 6 matches they played. This performance may not be considered highly successful but might be seen as an opportunity for improvement and growth. - With a 7th place finish, the participant/team managed to surpass several other contenders for the ranking positions, which could be a source of motivation and a boost for the Finnish participant/team when considering future contests. - Out of the 6 matches played, only one match turned out to be victorious or favorable for the Finnish participant/team. However, it's worth noting that competitive environments often demand perseverance and continuous effort. Identifying the areas of weakness and focusing on improving them can contribute to better results in future matches. - Lastly, it is essential to emphasize that different variables might affect the outcomes of each match. These variables could include factors such as the level of competition, the conditions under which matches took place, and the specific rules and methodologies applied in each case.

Question: when did the indian warfare on the texas frontier end?? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, I will follow these steps: 1. Research the history of Indian warfare on the Texas frontier. 2. Identify the key events and timelines associated with the end of the Indian warfare. 3. Provide the best approximate end date for the Indian warfare on the Texas frontier. Step 1: Research the history of Indian warfare on the Texas frontier - Indian warfare on the Texas frontier refers to the violent conflicts between Native American tribes and European settlers/imperial forces in the region that is now Texas. These conflicts began in the 17th century and continued for many years. Step 2: Identify the key events and timelines associated with the end of the Indian warfare - One of the significant factors leading to the end of Indian warfare on the Texas frontier was the increasing presence of the United States military in the region.  - The Indian Removal Act of 1830, signed into law by President Andrew Jackson, forced many Native American tribes to move westward, reducing the conflicts in Texas. - In the 1870s, the final military campaigns against Native American tribes took place, as the U.S government sought to establish dominance over the western frontier. This included the Red River War of 1874-1875, which targeted the Comanche, Kiowa, Southern Cheyenne, and Arapaho tribes in the Texas Panhandle. Step 3: Provide the best approximate end date for the Indian warfare on the Texas frontier - Although minor skirmishes and confrontations continued for some years, the widespread Indian warfare on the Texas frontier is generally considered to have ended following the Red River War in the mid-1870s. In conclusion, the Indian warfare on the Texas frontier effectively ended in the mid-1870s, following the military campaigns against Native American tribes in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The measure, which requires trillions in spending cuts and a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution in return for raising the debt ceiling, passed along party lines, with nine Republicans—including Michele Bachmann and Ron Paul—abstaining, and five Democrats voting with the GOP majority, the AP reports.

They named it the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan. This plan wanted to cut a lot of money that the government spends, and make sure the government doesn't spend more money than it has. The plan also needed a new rule to be added to the Constitution, which is like a big rulebook for the country. Then one day, the House of Representatives, who are a group of people who help make rules for the country, talked about this plan. They finally decided to say \\"yes\\" to the plan. But, this was only the first step. The plan still needed to be approved by another group of people called the Senate. A lot of people didn't think the plan would pass in the Senate. Even the President of the United States, who is like a big leader of the country, said he would not let the plan go forward if it came to him. There was another group of people called the \\"Gang of Six\\" who also had a plan to reduce the money that the government spends. The President liked this plan better. But the House of Representatives kept the hope alive for the \\"cut, cap and balance\\" plan. They also talked about making another plan, just in case their first plan didn't work.

Muscat is a port city located on the northeastern coast of Oman, along the Gulf of Oman and the Arabian Sea. Known for its rich history and cultural significance in the region, Muscat has been an important trading center between the East and the West for centuries. Muscat is not only the political capital of Oman but also serves as the economic, cultural, and administrative center of the country. The city is home to the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, the Royal Opera House, and many museums that showcase the history, art, and traditions of Oman. It also houses the Al Alam Palace, the ceremonial palace of Sultan Haitham bin Tariq Al Said, which is a symbol of Oman's rich architectural heritage. The region of Muscat has been inhabited since at least 6,000 years ago and has been ruled by various indigenous and foreign powers. Among these are the ancient Persians, the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the British, all of whom left their mark on the city and its culture. In the early 16th century, the Portuguese established a stronghold in Muscat and controlled the region for around a century. However, by the mid-17th century, the Omani people successfully expelled the Portuguese, and the city's importance continued to grow under domestic rule. In 1970, Sultan Qaboos bin Said Al Said came to power, bringing with him several modernization efforts and a focus on economic growth. Under his rule, the city of Muscat rapidly developed infrastructure, educational institutions, and transportation systems, transforming it into the modern capital city we see today. Today, Muscat continues to thrive and expand. Its strategic location along global trade routes has made it a hub for commerce, trade, and diplomacy. The city is divided into multiple districts, such as Muttrah, Ruwi, and Qurum, each offering a unique blend of traditional Omani and modern urban charm. With its scenic beauty, historic landmarks, and vibrant cultural scene, Muscat is a fascinating destination for tourists and a symbol of the remarkable transformation that the Sultanate of Oman has undergone in recent decades."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

How do we see it and how can we solve the problem? We know that the traffic jam happens in many places, especially in big cities. What are reasons for the problem? On one hand, some people think that they should have a car when they have enough money, and then it's easy to go out and they can feel comfortable. On the other hand, a growing number of people hope to use their cars to show off  . What's more, years of research has shown that one of other reasons for the traffic jam is the driving habit. For example, many young people enjoy driving very fast, so they can feel excited. At last, most of them hardly care about the speed rules. Many governments are working at how to make the traffic better. In my opinion, firstly, the governments should educate those people who have cars or plan to buy cars. The governments must make them know that the traffic jam is very serious, and set up a much more perfect traffic system to solve the traffic pressure. Question: What should the governments do to make the traffic better? Options: A: They should educate those people who are young. B: They should set up a much more perfect traffic system. C: They shouldn't allow people to buy so many cars. D: They should make people know the difficult to solve the problem of the traffic jam.

Help as much as you can. Background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  Paragraph: A team of hikers split into two groups. Group Jones hiked north and camped there  overnight. Group George went east. Both groups made campfires and heated cans of soups. Group Jones didn't make holes in the cans, so the cans exploded. The others heated their soup cans the right way, by venting them first.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: This study examined whether an infection with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) potentiates respiratory signs upon exposure to bacterial lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Five-week-old conventional pigs were inoculated intratracheally with the Lelystad strain of PRRSV and received 5 days later one or two intratracheal LPS administrations. The necessary controls were included. After LPS administration, pigs were intensively monitored for clinical signs. Additionally, some pigs were euthanatized after a second LPS administration for bronchoalveolar cell analysis and virological examinations of the lungs. Broncho-alveolar lavage (BAL) cells were counted and differentiated. Lung suspensions and BAL fluids were titrated for PRRSV. Exposure of pigs to PRRSV only resulted in a fever for time periods ranging from 1 to 5 days and slight respiratory signs. Exposure of pigs to LPS only resulted in general signs, characterized by fever and depression, but respiratory signs were slight or absent. PRRSV-LPS exposed pigs, on the other hand, developed severe respiratory signs upon LPS exposure, characterized by tachypnoea, abdominal breathing and dyspnoea. Besides respiratory signs, these pigs also showed enhanced general signs, such as fever and depression. Lung neutrophil infiltration was similar in non-infected and PRRSV-infected pigs upon LPS exposure. PRRSV quantities were similar in lungs and BAL fluids of pigs infected with PRRSV only and PRRSV-LPS exposed pigs.

Reflect on past experiences: Taylor should recognize that one rejection is not the end of the world. Examining previous social experiences that went well can boost self-esteem and provide some helpful perspective to face the situation head-on. 2. Seek advice and support from friends: Taylor can share feelings of nervousness or apprehension with close friends. They might offer some encouragement, advice, or even firsthand experiences that can help Taylor to see the bigger picture and build the courage to ask another person to the dance. 3. Practice self-affirmations: Taylor can remind themselves of their strengths and positive qualities. Positive self-talk can build confidence when it comes time to ask someone else to the dance. 4. Visualize a positive outcome: Instead of focusing on the possibility of rejection, Taylor should visualize a successful interaction – the person saying yes, sharing a great time at the dance, and making lasting memories. 5. Develop a backup plan: To ease anxiety, Taylor can consider other options if asking someone out is unsuccessful. Knowing that there is a backup plan, such as going with a group of friends, can make the task feel less daunting. 6. Approach the situation with enthusiasm and genuine interest: Taylor should know that genuine enthusiasm can be contagious. When asking another person to the dance with true interest and excitement, the other person might be more inclined to mirror those positive qualities. 7. Practice the ask: Taylor can try rehearsing what to say when asking the other person to the dance. This practice can help in finding the most comfortable, natural way of speaking and conveying the message. In conclusion, Taylor needs to get up the courage to ask another person to the dance following these suggestions. This will involve a combination of self-reflection, seeking support, focusing on visualization and positive thinking, practicing the act of asking, and approaching the situation with enthusiasm. By doing this, Taylor will be well-prepared to face their fears and ask someone else to the dance, regardless of any previous rejections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A telescope is an optical instrument that aids in the observation of remote objects by collecting electromagnetic radiation (such as visible light). The first known practical telescopes were invented in the Netherlands at the beginning of the 17th century, by using glass lenses. They found use in both terrestrial applications and astronomy.  Within a few decades, the reflecting telescope was invented, which used mirrors to collect and focus the light. In the 20th century, many new types of telescopes were invented, including radio telescopes in the 1930s and infrared telescopes in the 1960s. The word \\"telescope\\" now refers to a wide range of instruments capable of detecting different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum, and in some cases other types of detectors.  The word \\"telescope\\" (from the Ancient Greek , \\"tele\\" \\"far\\" and , \\"skopein\\" \\"to look or see\\"; τηλεσκόπος, \\"teleskopos\\" \\"far-seeing\\") was coined in 1611 by the Greek mathematician Giovanni Demisiani for one of Galileo Galilei's instruments presented at a banquet at the Accademia dei Lincei. In the \\"Starry Messenger\\", Galileo had used the term \\"perspicillum\\".  The earliest existing record of a telescope was a 1608 patent submitted to the government in the Netherlands by Middelburg spectacle maker Hans Lippershey for a refracting telescope. The actual inventor is unknown but word of it spread through Europe. Galileo heard about it and, in 1609, built his own version, and made his telescopic observations of celestial objects.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. By Richard Shears PUBLISHED: 08:22 EST, 30 October 2012 | UPDATED: 14:56 EST, 30 October 2012 The young wife of North Korea’s leader has made her first public appearance in two months, bringing to an end what might have been a period of ‘home detention’ for being too carefree. Ri Sol-ju had been photographed earlier this year smiling and strolling about in a casual manner when accompanying her husband Kim Jong-un, the newly appointed leader of the secretive Stalinist state. But then she disappeared from view, provoking speculation that she might be pregnant but more likely because she was not presenting the dour image promoted by her husband’s late father, Kim Jong-il. The happy couple: North Korean leader Kim Jong-un walks arm in arm with his wife OPTIONS: - Kim Jong-il in July, before she her two-month absence - Kim Jong-un in July, before she her two-month absence - North Korea in July, before she her two-month absence - Ri Sol-ju in July, before she her two-month absence - Richard Shears in July, before she her two-month absence - Stalinist in July, before she her two-month absence","output":"- Kim Jong-un in July, before she her two-month absence The most logical completion of this news story is \\"Kim Jong-un in July, before she her two-month absence.\\" This is because the news story talks about the young wife of North Korea's leader, Ri Sol-ju, being seen in public after a two-month absence. The other options do not make sense because: - Kim Jong-il is Kim Jong-un's late father, and the story is about the wife of Kim Jong-un, so mentioning Kim Jong-il would be incorrect. - North Korea is the country and not a person; thus, it cannot walk arm in arm with someone. - Ri Sol-ju is the wife mentioned in the story, and it would be redundant to say she was seen with herself. - Richard Shears is the author of the news story, and it is unlikely that he would be walking arm in arm with the North Korean leader's wife. - Stalinist is an adjective referring to the political system and not a person, so it cannot walk arm in arm with someone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1266, the Genoese had made an alliance with Baibars, who was to outfit some troops for an expedition against Acre, but the Genoese' promised fleet never got underway. In 1267, Genoa managed to capture the Tower of Flies and blockade the harbour of Acre for twelve days before being evicted by a Venetian flotilla. The ongoing warfare between Genoa and Venice had a major negative impact on the Kingdom's ability to withstand external threats to its existence. Save for the religious buildings, most of the fortified and defended edifices in Acre had been destroyed at one point or other  and according to Rothelin, the continuator of William of Tyre's History, 20,000 men in total had lost their lives, a frightful number considering the Crusader states were chronically short on soldiery. The War of Saint Sabas was settled in 1270 with a pact to cease the hostilities between the Venetians and the Genoese. In 1288, Genoa finally received their quarter in Acre back.

Summarize this article: Over-exercising your dog when he is young can lead to bone and joint issues that may lead to the development of hip dysplasia. Gentle, low impact exercises can be beneficial for puppies, but avoid letting your pup run, leap, or jump until he is physically mature. High impact sports like jumping and leaping can be hard on your puppy’s developing joints, so avoid doing these activities with your puppy until he is fully developed. Keep your dog active to help him stay physically fit with moderate exercise like running, walking, and swimming. Dogs with large, strong leg muscle mass may be less likely to develop hip dysplasia than dogs with a smaller muscle mass. Activities that might apply too much force on your dog’s joints, such as jumping for a Frisbee or leaping for a ball, can lead to development of hip issues. Consistent walking, running, and swimming can help your dog build muscle strength without putting too much stress on his body. Summary:","output":"Over-exercising young dogs may cause bone, joint issues, and possibly hip dysplasia. High impact activities such as jumping and leaping should be avoided until a puppy is fully grown, as these exert unnecessary pressure on developing joints.

For anyone who wants to make a serious play for the Latino vote -- and not just go through the motions -- here's what you need to know: Latinos are single-issue voters. The issue is respect. Or, as we say, respeto. Nothing else matters. If you want the votes of Latinos, show some respect. Or we'll show you the door. I know what you're thinking. What's so special about this constituency? Three things: Size, geography and unpredictability. In 2008, about 10 million Latinos voted; the 2012 figure could be higher. Latinos are well represented in \\"battleground\\" states (i.e. Colorado, Florida, Nevada, New Mexico). And, in the case of the Mexicans and Mexican-Americans who make up about 66% of the U.S. Latino population, they're in play because they have shown a willingness to vote for moderate Republicans even though most are registered Democrats. Polls show that Latinos are just like other voters in that they care about education, jobs, the economy and health care. But their antennae go up when they see politicians using the immigration issue to scare up votes -- and, in the process, treating them like piÃ±atas. That is disrespectful. And while neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney has gone that far, there is still a problem. Neither of these candidates seems to respect Latinos, as evidenced by their cynical attempts to manipulate the immigration issue and take gimmicky shortcuts to get Latino support. This is why both are having trouble with Latino voters. \\"Trouble\\" is defined differently for each candidate. In polls, Romney is having trouble getting as much as 30% of the Latino vote. Political observers note that a Republican presidential hopeful needs at least 35% to win. Obama has more than twice that level of support but his problem is that there's an enthusiasm gap and, if Latinos don't turn out for Obama, Romney will win. Romney took a wrong turn when he lurched to the right in the Republican primaries to pander to the nativist wing of the party. He portrayed illegal immigrants as takers and usurpers of public benefits and giveaways. He knows better. He is well aware of the fact that illegal immigrants -- most of whom come from Latin American countries -- are lured here by jobs offered by U.S. employers. Romney should have learned this lesson when it came to his attention, during his stint as governor of Massachusetts, that he had hired a landscaping company that employed illegal immigrants. Romney claimed that he didn't know the workers tending to his lawn were in the country illegally. Nonetheless, the experience should have illustrated for him the law of supply and demand: Without a demand for illegal immigrants, there would be no supply. Obama is not much better. Raised in a black and white world, the president doesn't know much about Latinos. And he hasn't seemed all that interested in learning. Our most important institution is the family. One good way to get on our bad side is to divide hundreds of thousands of families by deporting more than 1.2 million people in three years. And when you accomplish that feat by roping local police into the enforcement of immigration law through a program like Secure Communities in ways that invite ethnic profiling, this isn't going to win you any friends among Latinos. Finally, when you get caught in the act and these things come to light, it's not a good idea to insist that most of the folks deported were criminals, when criminal activity has been cited as a reason for deportation in only 17% of the cases last year. So far, in 2012, that figure is down to 14%. Who makes up the rest? It's likely that the answer is gardeners, housekeepers and nannies who pose no threat to society. Naturally, neither Romney nor Obama wants to talk about immigration. When Romney spoke to a Latino business group recently, he talked about education but didn't say a word about the DREAM Act, which would give legal status to undocumented students who go to college or join the military. When administration officials recently invited a group of Latina bloggers to the White House, the main topics of discussion were education and health while immigration was conspicuously left off the agenda. Guess what? Immigration came up anyway, when the bloggers asked about it during the question and answer session. That's the thing about immigration. Unless it is dealt with head-on, it seeps into the discussion of other issues. It happened during the health care debate, when what consumed many conservatives was the question of whether illegal immigrants could access benefits under \\"Obama-care.\\" Gentlemen, you can run but you can't hide. You have to talk about immigration. Until you clear the air, admit what you've done wrong, and try to make it right, you can't expect Latinos to listen to what you have to say on any other subject -- or if they do, to believe what they hear. Gov. Romney, stop pandering to racists and nativists in the GOP base by portraying illegal immigrants as takers; acknowledge that the only thing that lures them here are jobs provided by U.S. employers who need to be held accountable; stop proposing simplistic solutions like saying that all illegal immigrants should \\"self-deport\\"; and take up the cause of American businesses who can't find U.S. workers to do jobs that immigrants wind up doing because parents are raising their kids to feel entitled to avoid hard work. President Obama, stop saying you don't have the executive power to stop deportations when it has been established by a slew of legal experts, including nearly 100 law professors who recently sent a memo to the White House, that you do. Stop deportations of college-age students who would have been eligible for legal status under the Dream Act and the parents of U.S.-born children; stop portraying Republicans as singlehandedly preventing immigration reform, and take your share of responsibility for not getting it done; and propose to Congress a specific plan for comprehensive immigration reform. Do all that, and we'll be able to get past immigration and move onto other topics. Jobs. The economy. Education. The environment. Whatever you want. But immigration comes first, because it lets us assess your character. Or lack thereof. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Ruben Navarrette.

Given the question: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... How did the prison population drop below 1.5 million? Pick the correct answer from the following options: - There was a sharp increase in the number of inmates in federal prisons. - Sentencing reforms were passed in recent years. - not enough information - Tough-on-crime policies were enacted in the 1990s. The answer is:","output":"Sentencing reforms were passed in recent years. The drop in the prison population below 1.5 million can be attributed to several factors, as mentioned in the provided information. The primary cause is the sentencing reforms that have been enacted in recent years at both the federal and state levels. These reforms have led to an eight-year downward trend in the U.S. prison population. In 2017, there was a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons, alongside decreases in several states with large prison populations. As a result, the total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000, with the number of federal prisoners falling to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declining to 1.3 million. It is important to note that the downward trend in the prison population is not solely due to recent sentencing reforms. The decline also reflects the evolving attitudes towards criminal justice and a shift away from the tough-on-crime policies that were enacted in the 1990s, which contributed to the growth of the prison population in the first place. However, it is still uncertain whether the trend of declining prison population in the U.S. will continue. The Vera Institute for Justice, the criminal justice reform organization that reported this information, cautions that the future of this trend depends on the ongoing efforts in criminal justice reform and how well communities continue to adopt and support decarceration strategies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

Question: If everything is not spelled out in a treaty, how are details clarified? Context: In the United States, the term \\"treaty\\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.","output":"If everything is not spelled out in a treaty, details can be clarified through executive agreements.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft. After poking around his opinion, what shook out was that his real issue was not with Microsoft’s open source work (he was supportive of this), but it was with the fact that they still produce... The narrator believes that: - Microsoft is too greedy - not enough information - Microsoft is a better company now - Microsoft is worse than it was before Answer:","output":"The news of Microsoft acquiring GitHub has brought about a variety of opinions and reactions from different people in the tech community. Some view this acquisition as a strategic move for Microsoft to better support developers, while others perceive it as an intrusion into the open source ecosystem. Despite some criticism, the overall outlook for the acquisition appears to be quite positive, and there are multiple reasons to believe that there is a bright future ahead for both Microsoft and GitHub. It is essential to understand that there have been significant changes in Microsoft's approach, especially under the leadership of their CEO, Satya Nadella. No longer the adversary of open source projects, Microsoft has emerged as a major investor and participant in numerous open source projects. In addition to hiring open source developers and running their own open source projects (such as VSCode), Microsoft actively sponsors and supports many open source conferences, events, and initiatives.  While it is true that there still might be some deep-seated discomfort regarding Microsoft's involvement in open source, it is crucial not to overlook its evolution. Many employees of Microsoft genuinely appreciate their work at the company and share similar values and goals as developers and other members of the open-source community. Microsoft is undoubtedly not the same company it was in the late nineties, and its transformation has been significant. Despite the progress Microsoft has made, there is still a level of cynicism that lingers. This primarily stems from concerns over trust and the company's intentions with open source projects. However, it is important to remember that no company is perfect, and Microsoft's massive shift in its approach to open source signifies a willingness to adapt and grow. In conclusion, the acquisition of GitHub presents a promising future for both Microsoft and GitHub, as well as the open-source community as a whole. Although some skepticism still exists, it is important to recognize the substantial evolution Microsoft has undergone, especially regarding its involvement in open-source development. By continuing to engage and contribute to the open-source community, Microsoft has the potential to break down any lingering barriers and foster an environment of collaboration and progress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: -  You must draw up a plan to what kind of orbit the satellite will travel - You make preparations for the rocket that will travel into space - Prepare the crew that will send it there - You begin the countdown date for the rocket - And then you send the rocket carrying the satellite into space - Once in orbit the satellite will be placed where it was planned.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process would be to determine the mission objectives and requirements for the satellite, which will inform the type of orbit it needs to occupy. This decision depends on a variety of factors, such as the purpose of the satellite (communication, Earth observation, weather monitoring, etc.), desired coverage of the Earth's surface, and budget constraints. Based on these factors, an appropriate orbit can be selected, which can be one of the following three main categories: 1. Low Earth Orbit (LEO): Ranging from altitudes of 160 to 2,000 kilometers above the Earth's surface, LEO satellites provide high-resolution imagery and communication services over short distances. They usually have an orbital period of 90-120 minutes and require frequent ground tracking. 2. Medium Earth Orbit (MEO): Operating at altitudes of 2,000 to 36,000 kilometers, MEO satellites have larger coverage areas and allow communication signals to travel farther. These satellites are ideal for GPS navigation systems and have orbital periods ranging from 2 to 24 hours. 3. Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO): Located at altitudes of around 36,000 kilometers, GEO satellites hover above a specific location on the Earth's equator, enabling uninterrupted coverage of the same area. These satellites have an orbital period equal to Earth's rotation (24 hours) and provide weather observation and communication services. Once the type of orbit has been decided, the subsequent steps can be outlined as follows: 1. Design and development of the satellite: Once the objectives and specifications for the satellite are defined, engineers can design and build the required components, such as power supply systems, control and stabilization systems, communication components, and payload instruments. Rigorous testing ensures the satellite's reliability and functionality during its operational lifespan. 2. Selection and preparation of the launch vehicle: After the satellite's development, a suitable rocket has to be chosen to transport the satellite into space. The satellite's mass, size, and desired orbit play crucial roles in this decision. The chosen rocket should be capable of accommodating the satellite payload and reaching the target orbit. 3. Assemble and integrate the satellite with the rocket: The satellite is carefully enclosed within the rocket's payload fairing, ensuring proper alignment and connectivity with the launch vehicle. Moreover, the satellite's systems are checked and final preparations are made before sealing the fairing. 4. Crew readiness and training: The personnel involved in the launch, such as mission control officers and ground crew, must be trained in their respective tasks, including telemetry monitoring, communications, and emergency procedures. Continuous coordination ensures a smooth execution of the mission. 5. Establish the countdown date and timeline: A suitable date for the launch must be chosen, taking into account weather conditions, availability of launch facilities, and potential restrictions stemming from air or ground traffic. Prior to the launch date, a detailed countdown timeline is set, outlining the activities at each phase, such as fueling of the rocket and various system checks. 6. Launch of the rocket: Once all the preparations are complete, the rocket is launched following the countdown sequence, carrying the satellite into space. 7. Deployment of the satellite in the target orbit: Upon reaching the desired orbit, the satellite is carefully deployed from the rocket, and it begins its various operational activities, including the orientation of solar panels, activation of communication antennae, and conducting its designed missions. By following these steps, a satellite can be successfully placed in its intended orbit to carry out its predefined functions, contributing to advancements in communication, research, and understanding of our planet."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

B. Use glue paste.","output":"When it comes to repairing a broken statue, several factors need to be considered before choosing the most appropriate option. These factors include the material of the statue, the nature of the damage, and the purpose of the statue after repair (i.e., aesthetic display or functional use). Based on these factors, one must evaluate which out of the two options - A. Using super glue or B. Using glue paste - makes more sense to accomplish this goal. Option A: Using super glue  Super glue, also known as cyanoacrylate, is a strong and quick bonding adhesive. It forms an almost instant bond within seconds of application and can provide considerable strength to the repair. Using super glue could be appropriate for certain types of materials such as resin, ceramic, and porcelain statues. Additionally, it is especially effective when repairing clean, precise breaks with minimal gaps. Benefits of using super glue include: 1. Faster curing time - Super glue bonds quickly, which can be advantageous if the statue needs to be restored and displayed rapidly. 2. Clear drying - Super glue forms a transparent bond, so it won't be as visible in the final repair. 3. High bonding strength - Super glue can offer high bonding strength and durability, depending on the material of the statue and the nature of the break. Drawbacks of using super glue include: 1. Brittle bond - Super glue can form a somewhat brittle bond, which might not be ideal for statues meant for outdoor display or those that face environmental exposure. 2. Necessity for precise alignment - The quick bonding time of super glue means that statue parts must be aligned correctly on the first try, which can be challenging. 3. Fewer options for gap filling - Super glue works best when the broken pieces fit together snugly, and it is less suitable for filling gaps in the statue. Option B: Using glue paste  Glue paste, a mixture of adhesive and a thickening agent, is a versatile bonding solution. It is often used when dealing with porous materials like wood, paper, or textiles but can also be used in other applications and materials. Glue paste is typically less brittle and more flexible than super glue, and it's better suited for filling gaps between broken pieces. Benefits of using glue paste include: 1. More flexibility - Due to its less brittle nature, glue paste could be more suitable for outdoor statues or those that require a flexible adhesive. 2. Longer working time - Glue paste generally has a longer drying time, allowing more time for accurate alignment and adjustment of the broken pieces. 3. Better gap filling - Glue paste can be used to fill gaps in the statue more effectively than super glue. Drawbacks of using glue paste include: 1. Longer drying time - Glue paste usually takes longer to dry and bond, which may delay the repair process and display of the statue. 2. Potential visibility of repairs - Glue paste may not dry as clear or as invisibly as super glue, resulting in visible repairs. 3. Lower initial bonding strength - Glue paste may offer lower initial bonding strength, which may not be suitable for extremely heavy or large statues. Conclusion In conclusion, the choice between using super glue and glue paste would mainly depend on the material, the type of break or damage, and the purpose of the repaired statue. For clean, precise breaks with minimal gaps in materials like resin, ceramic, and porcelain, super glue would be a more suitable choice. On the other hand, glue paste would be ideal for statues that require a more flexible bond, have gaps to fill, or are made of porous materials. Additionally, it's essential to consider factors like drying time, bonding strength, and visibility of the repairs when choosing the appropriate adhesive. For best results, consult a specialist or read product instructions to determine which adhesive to use for your specific statue repair project."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

This tragic irony works to emphasize that the film does not simply present a gay-martyr story, but rather engages in a deeper exploration of the complexities surrounding gender and societal norms. Consequently, the premise highlights the irrelevance of gender in determining one's identity, the value of relationships, and understanding one another as individuals. Analyzing the hypothesis, \\"It is sad to know that those close to him would not approve of his true identity,\\" it is clear that the sadness stems from the fact that Brandon forms deep connections with people who, ultimately, would reject him based on his true gender. This notion reflects the importance of acceptance and understanding in forming meaningful relationships, and how societal norms and expectations can sometimes disrupt these connections. In light of the premise, the hypothesis appears to be accurate as it recognizes the tragedy that Brandon faces in not being able to be genuine with those he cares about. It highlights the importance of acceptance and love, regardless of one's gender identity. Further, it serves as a reminder of the harsh reality for individuals who experience discrimination or persecution based on aspects of their identity, such as gender or sexual orientation. Moreover, the hypothesis emphasizes the critical nature of promoting empathy and understanding in society to foster more inclusive relationships, where individuals are not pushed away or discriminated against due to their gender identity. Ultimately, this sad reality that Brandon faces in the film shows how societal norms and expectations can stifle personal growth, relationships, and one's ability to be their authentic self. To conclude, if we accept the premise as true, it demonstrates that the film moves beyond the scope of a gay-martyr tale and delves into a multifaceted examination of gender and its impact on relationships and identity. This understanding, when applied to the hypothesis, confirms that it is indeed sad knowing that those close to Brandon would not approve of his true identity. The powerful message of the film's tragic irony lies in the exploration of the consequences of societal norms and the importance of empathy and understanding for more inclusive relationships and discussions of gender."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To elaborate further, Kevin Kocot's in-depth research and extensive field experience in studying invertebrates provide him with a unique perspective on the marine ecosystem. As climate change continues to impact the planet, bringing about shifts in ocean temperatures, acidity levels, and oxygen levels, the marine life, including these tiny mollusks, are experiencing direct and indirect effects. Mollusks, being an integral component of the marine ecosystem, serve various essential functions. They are a vital food source for many marine creatures, contribute to nutrient recycling, and participate in bio-calcification processes that form structures such as shells and reefs. By examining the changes in mollusk distribution, morphology, and physiology in relation to climate change, Kocot aims to unravel the complex interplay of factors that drive these changes in the marine environment. Moreover, mollusks have been present in Earth's history for more than 500 million years, and their fossil record provides valuable information about past climate conditions. Thus, by comparing past and present mollusk populations, Kocot endeavors to detect crucial patterns that can reveal the mysteries of climate change and its impact on marine life—both in present times and the future. In conclusion, the sentence follows the preceding text as it further explains Kevin Kocot's research goals and establishes how meticulously studying tiny mollusks could potentially contribute to uncovering the effects of climate change on marine life.

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: One night in Portsmouth, England in 1787, a press gang breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service. One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is the HMSÂ Bounty. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is William Bligh (Charles Laughton), and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The Bounty leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (Franchot Tone) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian. During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of Tahiti, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take home, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani (Movita Castaneda), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti (Mamo Clark). Christian promises her he will be back someday. After leaving Tahiti the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr.Â Bacchus (Dudley Digges), and Bligh cuts water rationing...

Question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that Peter Banning misses their baseball game? is inside the article: Peter Banning is a successful corporate lawyer living in San Francisco. Though he loves his family, his workaholic lifestyle causes him to spend little time with his wife, Moira, and children, 12-year-old Jack and 7-year-old Maggie, and even miss Jack's Little League Baseball game, which is straining his relationships with them. They fly to London to visit Moira's grandmother, Wendy Darling. Wendy is ostensibly the true creator of the Peter Pan stories, with J. M. Barrie, her childhood neighbor, merely having transcribed the tales. During their stay, Peter angrily yells at the children when their playing disturbs his important call, leading to an audacious argument with Moira, who throws his cellphone out of the window. Peter, Moira and Wendy go out to a charity dinner honoring Wendy's long life of charitable service to orphans. Upon their return, they discover the house has been ransacked and the children have been abducted. A cryptic ransom note, signed Captain James Hook, has been pinned to the playroom door with a dagger. Wendy confesses to Peter that the stories of Peter Pan are true and that Peter himself is Pan, having lost all of his childhood memories when he fell in love with Moira. In disbelief, he gets drunk up in the playroom, but Tinker Bell appears and takes him to Neverland to rescue his children from Hook., can you guess it ?

Information:  - Chambers of rhetoric were dramatic societies in the Low Countries. Their members were called Rederijkers (singular Rederijker), from the French word 'rhétoricien', and during the 15th and 16th centuries were mainly interested in dramas and lyrics. These societies were closely connected with local civic leaders and their public plays were a form of early public relations for the city.  - Chrétien de Troyes (\\"Christian\\") was a late-12th-century French poet and trouvère known for his work on Arthurian subjects, and for originating the character Lancelot. This work represents some of the best-regarded of medieval literature. His use of structure, particularly in \\"Yvain, the Knight of the Lion\\", has been seen as a step towards the modern novel. Little is known of his life, but he seems to have been from Troyes, or at least intimately connected with it, and between 1160 and 1172 he served at the court of his patroness Marie of France, Countess of Champagne, daughter of Eleanor of Aquitaine, perhaps as herald-at-arms (as Gaston Paris speculated).  - Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic.  - Thibaut de Blaison , Blason , or Blazon ( died after March 1229 ) was a Poitevin nobleman , Crusader , and trouvère from a noble family with lands in Blason and Mirabel . Eleven poems -- one contested and one definitely spurious -- have been ascribed to Thibaut in the chansonniers . Three further anonymous songs have also been attributed to him by Terence H. Newcombe , his modern editor . Thibaut was the seneschal of Poitou and his uncle was Maurice , Bishop of Poitiers . In 1214 Thibaut helped negotiate a truce between Philip II of France and John of England . In 1212 he was taking part in the Reconquista in Spain and he was among the Albigensian Crusaders besieging Toulouse in 1218 . He appears alongside the trouvère Amauri de Craon in a document of 1219 . He attended the coronation of Louis IX in 1226 , along with the trouvère Hue de la Ferté . Theobald I of Navarre , also a trouvère , dedicated the song De ma dame souvenir to Thibaut and also used Thibaut 's Amours , que porra devenir as a model for a religious poem of his own . Gautier d'Espinal also borrowed the melody of Amours for one piece . Thibaut himself borrowed from rhythms from the polyphonic repertoire of the day . He may have based his Bien font Amours lor talent on the conductus Quid frustra consumeris and Chanter et renvoisier seuil on Sol sub nube latuit . With the exception of three chansons that are restricted to a sixth -- Amours , que porra devenir , Chanter et renvoisier seuil , and Huimain par un ajourant -- and one , Li miens chanters ne puet mais remanoir , which is severely restricted in movement , most of Thibaut 's melodies move freely . They are all basically syllabic , with only Li miens chanters exhibiting more complex melisma . Compared to his melodies ( all recorded in bar form ) , his prosody is usually simple , though three songs -- Bien font Amours lor talent , Bon jour ait hui cele a cui sui amis , and Quant je voi esté venir -- exhibit some variety . The simplicity of Bien font Amours is more in keeping with Thibaut 's...  - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies.  - Blason is a form of poetry. The term originally comes from the heraldic term \\"blazon\\" in French heraldry, which means either the codified description of a coat of arms or the coat of arms itself. The Dutch term is Blazoen, and in either Dutch or French, the term is often used to refer to the coat of arms of a chamber of rhetoric.  - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz.  - In heraldry and heraldic vexillology, a blazon is a formal description of a coat of arms, flag or similar emblem, from which the reader can reconstruct the appropriate image. The verb \\"to blazon\\" means to create such a description. The visual depiction of a coat of arms or flag traditionally has considerable latitude in design, while a blazon specifies the essentially distinctive elements; thus it can be said that a coat of arms or flag is primarily defined not by a picture but rather by the wording of its blazon (though often flags are in modern usage additionally and more precisely defined using geometrical specifications). \\"Blazon\\" also refers to the specialized language in which a blazon is written, and, as a verb, to the act of writing such a description. This language has its own vocabulary, grammar and syntax, or rules governing word order, which becomes essential for comprehension when blazoning a complex coat of arms.    What object entity has the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'thibaut de blaison'?   Choices: - composer  - literary  - performer  - poet  - public relations  - reader  - rhetoric  - troubadour  - trouvère","output":"Thibaut de Blaison had the occupation of a trouvère, a poet-composer in the northern dialects of France. He was also a Crusader and a nobleman with his works mainly as lyric poetry. His role included composing and performing his songs, making him a performer as well. So, the objects having the relation of 'occupation' with the subject 'Thibaut de Blaison' are trouvère, poet, composer, and performer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He grew up in Orange County, California, attending Cypress High School and the Orange County High School of the Arts, studying acting and musical theater and writing plays in his spare time. He hosted a public-access television show called Centurion Highlights, based on the school's mascot. In a 2015 interview, Aukerman said \\"I'm still doing that same show, just with celebrities instead of my high school cafeteria.\\" Context: After a brief period studying at the Pacific Conservatory of the Performing Arts and touring the country as a musical theater actor, in 1995, at the request of his friends, Aukerman and Porter started performing at The Comedy Store in Los Angeles under the moniker \\"The Fun Bunch\\", a name meant to parody improvisation groups at the time.  Mr. Show co-creator Bob Odenkirk was in the audience for the second performance, and soon tapped the duo to write for and occasionally perform on the show in its fourth season. This led to an Emmy nomination in 1999 for Aukerman and the rest of the staff. Aukerman appeared sporadically on the show, most notably as the model Theo Brixton in the Taint Magazine sketch.  After the show's cancellation, Aukerman and Porter segued into writing film and television scripts, most notably Run Ronnie Run! and the first draft of the film Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny. In 2004, he and Porter received an \\"Additional Dialogue\\" credit on the animated feature film Shark Tale. They went on to write an unproduced script for the sequel, as well as an unproduced Shrek spin-off film based on the character Puss in Boots. In 2007, a feature film script he wrote with Porter and Odenkirk, titled Kanan Rhodes: Unkillable Servant of Justice, was purchased by MTV Films with the intent of starring Rainn Wilson, although it currently remains unproduced. Also in 2007, Aukerman released a self-described \\"joke record\\", Scott Aukerman's Koo Koo Roo's Greatest Hits, which featured Aukerman and Sarah Silverman Program writer Jon Schroeder shouting over current soft-rock hits. This was put out in limited release on AST Records.  In 2009, Aukerman and Porter wrote a pilot script for NBC, titled Privates. The network ultimately passed on the show.

Please answer this question: what is the fate of excess intake of dietary protein?","output":"Alright, imagine you're eating a lot of chicken, fish, or eggs and giving your body a big protein party. If the body gets too much protein, it can't save it all for later like a toy box. Instead, it breaks down the extra protein into different parts. Some parts are used for energy, and the leftover waste goes out of your body when you use the bathroom. It's important to eat the right amount of protein because having too much can put a little extra work on your kidneys, the bean-like organs that clean your blood.

Article:","output":"Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Tanner Brownlee. When he was 15 years old, his dad, a brave and kind police officer, was shot and killed while working to keep people safe. Fast forward five years later, and Tanner found out that his dad's old police car was going to be sold at a charity auction. Tanner really wanted his dad's car because it reminded him of his dad and made him feel close to him. The auction was held to raise money for a group called COPS, which helps families who lost their loved ones while they were bravely working as police officers. Tanner went to the auction, hoping to buy his dad's car, but the price went higher and higher. Poor Tanner did not have enough money to keep bidding. But then, something magical happened. A kind and generous man named Steve Wells, a rancher, won the bid for the car by paying 60,000. Tanner felt disappointed that he couldn't get the car, but Steve did something that would change Tanner's life forever. Instead of keeping the car for himself, Steve handed the keys to Tanner and said, \\"Tanner, here's your car.\\" The two had never met before, but Steve understood how much the car meant to Tanner. With tears in his eyes and happiness in his heart, Tanner thanked Steve for his incredible generosity. The car now belonged to Tanner, and he would have an invaluable piece of his dad's life with him.

Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries. With presidential support, the Justice Department in recent years has directed prosecutors to rein in the use of harsh mandatory minimums. Eggleston once again called on...

A mustang is what type of creature?","output":"A Mustang is a type of horse, specifically a free-roaming, feral horse that is native to the Western regions of North America. The name \\"Mustang\\" comes from the Spanish word \\"mestengo,\\" which means \\"stray livestock animal.\\" These horses are descendants of domesticated Spanish horses that were brought to the Americas by Spanish explorers and settlers in the 16th century. Over time, these horses either escaped or were released from captivity, and they went on to breed with other horses in the wild, forming the distinct population known as the Mustang. Mustangs eventually adapted to their new environment, becoming more resilient and hardy than their domesticated counterparts. They are known for their strong endurance, sure-footedness, and level-headed temperament. These qualities make them highly sought after by riders and horse enthusiasts, particularly for western riding disciplines such as ranch work, rodeo competitions, and trail riding. However, due to their feral nature, they require experienced handlers for training and taming. In terms of physical appearance, Mustangs exhibit a wide variety of colors, patterns, and sizes, as they possess a diverse genetic background. The average height of a Mustang ranges from around 14 to 15 hands (56 to 60 inches, or 142 to 152 cm) tall, and their weight typically falls between 700 and 800 pounds (about 320 to 360 kg). Common coat colors include bay, black, chestnut, dun, and gray, among others. In order to protect and manage the population of Mustangs, the United States government passed the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act in 1971. The act grants protection to these horses, and the population is monitored and managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the United States Forest Service. The BLM conducts periodic roundups to help control the population numbers and finds homes for many Mustangs through its adoption program. Adopting a Mustang does require a certain level of experience, knowledge, and commitment, as they often need specialized training and handling to transition from a wild horse to a working or companion animal. Despite efforts to protect and manage the population, Mustangs still face threats, including habitat loss, disruption to their natural behavior due to human intervention, and potential risk of slaughter. Conservation and advocacy groups, such as the American Mustang Foundation, work tirelessly to promote awareness, protect the welfare of these horses, and ensure their future as an enduring symbol of the American West. In conclusion, a Mustang is a type of feral horse found in the Western regions of North America. Descended from Spanish horses, these creatures are known for their strength, endurance, and adaptability. They are closely tied with the history and culture of the American West, and their legacy is protected under national law and carefully managed by federal agencies. The Mustang is not just a creature, but a symbol of the untamed spirit and natural beauty that define the American landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Well, Louis Braille's work changed the world. Born in a small town near Paris in 1809, shortly after his third birthday Louis blinded himself in one eye while playing with a sharp pointed tool in his father's workshop. He soon lost the sight in his other eye when the infection  spread. He wanted to go to school, but in his small town there was no school for him. At that time, blind people did not get any school education. Braille went to Paris to study, but there were few books for the blind. Louis knew that books were the key to learning.

(which just went on the block) and Neiman Marcus (being sold by a PE group that includes TPG, Warburg Pincus, Leonard Green and Credit Suisse) — and then merging the two companies together. To be sure, there are some good business arguments for such a move. For example, a Citi research note points out that the two companies have some overlapping stores that drive down performance at each, and also that the combined company could have greater leverage over suppliers. And KKR may be able to mitigate the high asking price for Saks SKS – its current trades are around the same EBITDA multiple paid for Neiman Marcus, so a premium would be rich — by doing sale-leaseback transactions on its some of its underlying real estate assets. The bigger question may be one of logistics. Neiman Marcus shareholders originally began laying IPO groundwork last summer, and also appear to have been contemplating a parallel sale process. In other words, Neiman Marcus should be further along than Saks – a timeline issue exacerbated by the fact that it private-to-private deals like Neiman Marcus are usually easier/faster to complete than are public-to-private deals like Saks. Would KKR make the completion of Saks (or at least shareholder approval) a precondition to closing Neiman Marcus? And, if so, would Neiman’s private equity owners be willing to wait? Or does KKR have a model where Neiman Marcus can produce adequate returns on its own, with Saks serving as gravy? Not saying that such a two-step can’t be done, but it could be a tricky manuever.

What is the most logical next event? How to choose healthy cereals for your baby  Read the nutrition label.  When you're looking for a healthy and nutritious baby cereal, the first place you'll need to look is the food label. This is where you'll get a lot of information on the product and be able to compare to other items in the store.","output":"The most logical next event after learning how to choose healthy cereals for your baby is to proceed by discussing factors to consider while reading the nutrition label and suggesting tips on making the right selection based on your baby's specific nutritional needs:  1. Check the ingredients list:  Look for cereals with whole grains as the first ingredient, such as whole wheat, brown rice, or oat. Whole grains are rich in nutrients and can help promote digestive health in your baby. Avoid cereals containing added sugars, artificial colors, or preservatives, which could cause allergies or other adverse effects. 2. Analyze the sugar content:  The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends limiting the intake of added sugars during the first two years of life. Therefore, pick a cereal containing no or low amounts of sugar. You can add natural sweeteners like pureed fruits or a dash of cinnamon to enhance taste. 3. Assess the fiber content:  Fiber helps to promote digestion and prevent constipation, which is a concern for babies during the early stages of solid food introduction. Choose a cereal with at least 2 grams of dietary fiber per serving. Fiber-rich cereals can support a baby's digestive system and bowel movements, making the transition from breast milk or formula to solid food smoother. 4. Look for fortified cereals:  Iron-fortified cereals are preferable for babies above six months of age, as the primary source of their iron intake becomes food rather than milk; however, consult a pediatrician to verify iron levels for your baby. Additionally, fortified cereals may contain essential vitamins and minerals such as zinc, calcium, and Vitamin B that contribute to overall growth and development. 5. Consider your baby's age and food allergies: Choose cereals appropriate for your baby's age and development. Ensure that the cereal is not too coarse or difficult to swallow, especially if it's their first time eating solid foods. Gradually introduce new textures as your baby grows and becomes more accustomed to different types of grains. Also, be mindful of potential allergens like gluten when choosing cereals if your baby has a history of allergies or a family history of food-related allergies. 6. Opt for organic cereals:  If possible, consider choosing certified organic cereals, which are made without pesticides, synthetic fertilizers, or genetically modified organisms (GMOs). This option may be healthier and potentially safer for your baby. 7. Taste test:  Try out different flavors and textures to find the cereals that your baby enjoys the most. It is essential to encourage a healthy relationship with food from an early age, and providing a variety of tastes can foster this goal. In conclusion, selecting the healthiest cereal for your baby may seem daunting at first, but by using these guidelines based on nutritional labels and ingredients can help you make an informed decision. Remember to introduce new foods one by one and consult with a pediatrician about any concerns or questions related to your child's diet and nutrition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the name who supported himself in England, with the help of George Grove and others, by giving recitals?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the... Answer:","output":"The person who supported himself in England, with the help of George Grove and others, by giving recitals is Saint-Saëns.

Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet.

Write a negative yelp review ( [-] negative; [-] positive;).","output":"Title: A Disappointing Encounter Rating: ★☆☆☆☆ 1/5 Let me preface this review by saying that I usually try to find the silver lining in most situations, but my recent experience at this establishment warrants no such generosity. There are times when the reality falls drastically short of expectations. This particular instance at the place in question was an embodiment of the aforementioned statement. Upon entering the establishment, the first issue that came to my attention was the less-than-hospitable environment. Far from the comfort and warmth shown in the photos provided online, the real place was a stark contrast. The lighting felt uncomfortably harsh, more akin to a DMV office than a place of intended leisure. This fact was only accentuated by the indistinct noise echoing around, making it difficult to carry on any semblance of conversation. Next, let's discuss the service, which unfortunately didn't redeem the experience either. Though I understand that everyone can have a rough day, the waitstaff was notably aloof and inattentive. A long wait for service is undesirable, but even worse when coupled with staff that seemed more interested in their phones than in customer service. We faced multiple instances of incorrect orders and slow service, turning what was supposed to be a pleasurable experience into a frustrating one. As for the food, it left much to be desired. The presentation lacked refinement and appeared rushed. Beyond appearance, taste profiles of the dishes we ordered were lackluster. They lacked the balance of flavors crucial to their respective dishes. The quality of the ingredients brought into question their commitment to delivering value to their patrons.  The prices, when considered with the quality of food and service, were exorbitantly high. To charge customers premium rates, one expects a corresponding level of quality, which was unfortunately absent. The overall value for the cost was poor, thus making it seem as though the business was more interested in their profit margins than delivering a satisfactory dining experience to its customers. Lastly, despite bringing these issues to the establishment's attention, the management seemed unbothered and didn’t offer an apology or effort to rectify the situation. This lack of customer service felt like a comprehensive disregard for consumers, an approach that seemed anchored in the establishment's ethos, given our encounter. In summary, my experience was characterized by a regrettable ambiance, significantly lacking service quality, uninspiring cuisine, inflated prices, and dismissive management. Based on this experience, I find it challenging to recommend this establishment and would caution potential visitors to temper their expectations. I wish the management and staff of this establishment the very best and hope they can use this feedback for substantial improvements in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Fargo Movie plot: In the winter of 1987, Minneapolis car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (Macy) is desperate for money; repayment is due on a large GMAC loan that he fraudulently collateralized with nonexistent dealership vehicles. Dealership mechanic Shep Proudfoot (Steve Reevis), an ex-convict, refers him to an old partner in crime, Gaear Grimsrud (Stormare). Jerry travels to Fargo, North Dakota, where he hires Gaear and Carl Showalter (Buscemi) to kidnap his wife, Jean (Kristin RudrÃ¼d), and extort a ransom from his wealthy father-in-law and boss, Wade Gustafson (Presnell). He gives the men a new car from his dealership's lot, and promises to split the 80,000 ransom with them. Back in Minneapolis, Jerry pitches Gustafson a lucrative real estate deal; when Gustafson agrees to front the money, Jerry attempts to call off the kidnapping, but it is already in motion. Then, he learns that Gustafson plans to make the deal himself, leaving Jerry a paltry finder's fee. Carl and Gaear kidnap Jean in Minneapolis as planned. While transporting her to their remote cabin hideout, a state trooper pulls them over outside Brainerd, Minnesota for driving without the required temporary tags over the dealership plates. After Carl tries and fails to bribe the trooper, Gaear kills him. When two passing eyewitnesses spot Carl disposing of the body, Gaear kills them as well. The following morning, Brainerd police chief Marge Gunderson (McDormand), who is seven months pregnant, initiates a homicide investigation. Records from the murdered trooper's last traffic stop, along with a phone call to Proudfoot, placed at a local truck stop by two suspicious men, lead her to Jerry's dealership, where she questions Jerry and Proudfoot. While in Minneapolis, Marge reconnects with Mike Yanagita (Steve Park), an old classmate who takes her to dinner, tells her that his wife, another classmate, has died, and attempts to seduce her.

The morbidly obese cat, who was three times heavier than a healthy cat, was a recent rescuer at a California animal shelter last month after his owners could no longer afford to keep him. Weighing a startling 36 pounds, Little Dude's life was full of complications that ultimately led to his untimely demise, drawing attention to the growing epidemic of pet obesity. Little Dude was welcomed into a foster home last month, where shelter staff diligently worked towards helping him lose weight and regain a semblance of quality of life. In just a few weeks, they managed to bring Little Dude's weight down by a few pounds as they continued their efforts to improve his health. Unfortunately, despite the staff's best efforts and numerous life changes, Little Dude ultimately succumbed to his health challenges on Saturday. The shelter staff attributed his death to the complications related to his severe obesity as well as the accumulated stress of the many alterations in his life in recent weeks. The loss of Little Dude serves as a humbling reminder of the consequences that pet obesity can have on our beloved animals' lives. It highlights the importance of responsible pet ownership and the need for each caretaker to prioritize their furry friend's well-being. According to the Association for Pet Obesity Prevention (APOP), approximately 58.2% of cats and nearly 56.1% of dogs in the United States are overweight or obese. These staggering numbers indicate that pet obesity is an issue that needs to be addressed on an urgent basis. Some of the most common health problems related to pet obesity include diabetes, osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, kidney disease, cancer, and a shortened life expectancy. With those risks in mind, it is essential for pet owners to pay close attention to their pets' overall health, eating habits, and exercise routines. They must actively work to prevent obesity by providing balanced, nutritional meals, implementing portion control, and engaging their pets in regular physical activity. Employing these practices can vastly improve the health and well-being of pets, ensuring they live happy lives devoid of any preventable health issues. Little Dude's story, while painful and unfortunate, is an eye-opener for pet owners. It serves as a stark reminder of the importance of responsible pet ownership, the risks associated with pet obesity, and the need for ongoing education and awareness about pets' nutritional and exercise requirements. Taking a proactive role in maintaining our beloved animals' health is the best way to honor Little Dude's memory and prevent other pets from suffering the same heartbreaking fate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The properties of the alkali metals are similar to each other as expected for elements in the same family. The alkali metals have the largest atomic radii and the lowest first ionization energy in their periods. This combination makes it very easy to remove the single electron in the outermost (valence) shell of each. The easy loss of this valence electron means that these metals readily form stable cations with a charge of 1+. Their reactivity increases with increasing atomic number due to the ease of losing the lone valence electron (decreasing ionization energy). Since oxidation is so easy, the reverse, reduction, is difficult, which explains why it is hard to isolate the elements. The solid alkali metals are very soft; lithium, shown in Figure 18.3, has the lowest density of any metal (0.5 g/cm3). The alkali metals all react vigorously with water to form hydrogen gas and a basic solution of the metal hydroxide. This means they are easier to oxidize than is hydrogen. As an example, the reaction of lithium with water is: 2Li(s) + 2H 2 O(l) ⟶ 2LiOH(aq) + H 2(g).

FINAL EXAM  Question 1. The horse-collar tackle is closely associated with what safety who played college football for the University of Oklahoma?","output":"The horse-collar tackle is closely associated with a former football player from the University of Oklahoma named Roy Williams.  Roy Williams is a former American college and professional football player who was a safety in the National Football League (NFL) for nine seasons during the 2000s. He was born on August 14, 1980, in California. He played college football for the University of Oklahoma, where he was a two-time All-American, and was recognized as outstanding college defensive back in the country. He was drafted by the Dallas Cowboys eighth overall in the 2002 NFL Draft, and he earned five straight Pro Bowl selections from 2003 to 2007. As safety, his primary role on the field was to stop the opposing team's wide receivers and make tackles.  The infamous horse-collar tackle is often associated with Roy Williams due to an incident that occurred during the 2004 NFL season. He made numerous tackles using this technique, which is dangerous and can lead to severe injuries to the player being tackled. Consequently, it stirred up a lot of controversy. The horse-collar tackle method involves a player grabbing inside an opponent's shoulder pads or jersey from behind and quickly pulling down, which jerks the player backward. This abrupt move often causes the tackled player to fall backward or be flipped onto their head, leading to a high risk of injuries like sprains, fractures, or even paralysis. In December 2004, one of these tackles by Williams resulted in Terrell Owens, a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles, suffering from a severe ankle sprain and a fracture in his leg. The incident led to substantial scrutiny of the horse-collar tackle, and the NFL subsequently banned the technique before the start of the 2005 season. Though Williams was also skilled in cover situations, he was best known for his hard hits, blitzing skills and his excellence in run support, his tackling style overshadowed these traits. Despite the controversy his tackling style caused, there's no denying Williams' prowess as a player. His agility, speed, and strength made him a standout during his time in college and the NFL. He redefined the position of safety and left a lasting impact on the sport of football. His career is remembered for these rather polarizing reasons—remarkable talent, the horse-collar tackle, and the change in rules it initiated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better.

Here is another sentence: Many sunken ships rest on the ocean floor. Does the term floor mean the same thing in both these sentences?","output":"In both sentences, the term \\"floor\\" refers to the base or the lowest level of a structure or space; however, the context and implications of the term are different in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"The pit floor showed where a ring of post holes had been,\\" the term \\"floor\\" refers to the base of a pit, which is likely an excavated or dug-out area on land. This type of floor is specifically related to an archaeological or construction context – the surface upon which a structure is built, or a space created by earthmoving activities. The floor of a pit might be uncovered during an excavation or through other methods of archaeological research. It can provide crucial information about the previous occupants or usage of that area, as evidenced by the presence of post holes. In this context, the term \\"floor\\" is more closely associated with the ground or the lowest level of a terrestrial space. In contrast, the second sentence, \\"Many sunken ships rest on the ocean floor,\\" the term \\"floor\\" refers to the base of the ocean. The ocean floor is the lowest part of a water body – an underwater surface that consists of a variety of geographical and geological features such as trenches, ridges, and plains, as well as underwater ecosystems. This context is vastly different from that in the first sentence, as it addresses a marine environment and involves factors such as water pressure, marine life, and underwater geological formations. In this context, the term \\"floor\\" signifies the lowest level of an underwater space. In summary, while the term \\"floor\\" does indicate the lowest level or base of a space in both sentences, the specific meaning and context differ based on whether it is applied to a terrestrial pit (an excavated, constructed, or archaeological space) or the underwater base of the ocean. These different contexts highlight the versatility of the word \\"floor,\\" which can adapt its meaning depending on its relationship to the surrounding environment and circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The use of a catalyst involves intermediate reactions which have lower activation complexes than the original reaction. On a simplified reaction energy diagram, this can be thought of as lowering the activation energy for a given transformation. If the activation energy of a reaction is decreased, more collisions will have enough energy to overcome this lower barrier, so the reactant-to-product transformation will occur more frequently. As a result, the overall reaction rate will be higher than for an identical reaction with a larger activation energy barrier.  Paragraph: A chemist is working in the lab with two beakers, beaker R and beaker T, filled with identical solutions. In her experiment, she is going to pour one liquid into beaker R and the same amount of a different liquid into beaker T. After pouring the liquid into beaker R, there is no noticeable change. Pouring the liquid into beaker T, she observes a change in the liquid.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: The reaction in which beaker has a higher activation energy? Answer:","output":"The reaction in beaker R has a higher activation energy. In the scenario given in the paragraph, the chemist pours equivalent amounts of two different liquids into two identical solutions housed respectively in beaker R and beaker T. The solution in beaker R remains unchanged after the addition of the liquid. Meanwhile, the solution in beaker T exhibits some form of change subsequent to the introduction of its liquid. This divergence in reactions indicates a differential in the catalytic effect of the specific liquids added. The theory supporting this centers on constructing an understanding about how catalysts function. Catalysts, by their fundamental working principle, provide a lower energy pathway for reactions, which effectively decrease the requisite activation energy. This lower energy barrier empowers more collisions to occur, successfully overcoming this barrier, thus accelerating the transformation rate from reactants to products. Under such circumstances, an immediately observable change in the beaker's contents would be expected since the addition of the liquid in effect enhances the reaction rate by lowering the activation energy. Conversely, in a situation where the activation energy remains high, fewer collisions manage to overcome the energy barrier and, as a result, the transformation of reactants to products is noticeably slower or potentially even visually imperceptible, mimicking the scenario in beaker R. Therefore, based on the information presented and the principles of chemistry, the reaction in beaker R has a higher activation energy. The lack of observable change in beaker R suggests that the liquid added didn't act effectively as a catalyst, thus the reaction would need a higher amount of energy to proceed, leading to a higher activation energy. Conversely, the observed change in beaker T signifies that the liquid added to this beaker acted as a catalyst and consequently reduced the activation energy required, resulting in a visibly quicker reaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   An ovule is a female reproductive structure in seed plants that contains a tiny female gametophyte. The gametophyte produces an egg cell. After the egg is fertilized by sperm, the ovule develops into a seed.   Q: In seed plants, after fertilization, what will the ovule eventually develop into?   A: The answer is:","output":"In seed plants, after fertilization, the ovule will eventually develop into a seed. This transformation occurs as a result of the reproductive process taking place within the ovule, which houses the female gametophyte. Here is a more detailed explanation of the role of the ovule in seed plant reproduction and its development into a seed: 1. Initially, within the ovule, there is a tiny female gametophyte, which is responsible for producing an egg cell. This egg cell contains the genetic material necessary for the formation of a new plant. 2. The process of fertilization occurs when a sperm cell, which is produced by the male reproductive structure called pollen, unites with the egg cell within the ovule. This union of sperm and egg results in a fertilized egg or zygote, which now contains a complete set of genetic information from both parents. 3. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes a series of cell divisions, eventually leading to the formation of an embryo. This embryo contains the beginnings of the root, shoot, and leaf structures that will eventually develop into the mature plant. 4. As the embryo continues to grow, the ovule itself also undergoes changes to accommodate and nourish the developing new plant. The cells of the ovule's outer layers begin to differentiate and form specialized tissues, such as the seed coat, which will protect the embryo and help it to survive in different environmental conditions until it is ready to germinate. Additionally, some of the other cells in the ovule will serve as the source of food reserves for the growing embryo in the form of stored nutrients, such as starch, lipids, and proteins. 5. Eventually, the entire structure of the ovule, including the embryo and the surrounding specialized tissues, will develop into a mature seed. This seed contains all the necessary components needed for the emergence of a new plant, allowing it to survive, grow, and reproduce once it germinates in a suitable environment. In summary, the ovule in seed plants plays a critical role in the reproduction process, as it houses the female gametophyte responsible for producing the egg cell. Once fertilization occurs, the ovule undergoes a series of developmental changes to transform into a seed, which carries the potential for a new plant's growth and continuation of the plant's life cycle."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Article: My daughter went to see The Wild One recently and she commented that Marlon Brando was wearing jeans so long ago. Of course he helped set the trend, so that got me thinking about the link between films and trends in fashion. Fashion and films have gone hand in hand for long. The Wild One is a good example: it appeared in 1954, starring Brando. Dressed in a black leather motorcycle jacket, leather cap and jeans, he created a look which is still considered \\"cool\\" today. Everyone from Madonna to middle-aged men is seen wearing the classic leather motorcycle jacket. Another strong influence on fashion trends was Breakfast at Tiffany's, starring Audrey Hepburn. She made famous the simple black dress that looks perfect at either a cocktail party or just standing around an expensive department store like Tiffany's with a pastry and coffee in your hand, as Audrey Hepburn does in the film. She looks so elegant, wearing simple but beautiful dresses, big dark glasses and a string of pearls around her neck. Audrey Hepburn still influences women's fashion with her \\"Tiffany's look\\". In more modern times, the film star Uma Thurman created a major fashion trend when she appeared in the film Pulp Fiction, made in 1994. Her style was very simple. Her black trousers, crisp white shirt and hair style was copied by women in the world. Influencing fashion trends can often be about timing. The movie Memoirs of a Geisha came just in time to start a trend in Japanese fashion. It started the Chinese actress Zhang Ziyi, who wore beautiful silk kimonos , and it won an Oscar for Costume Design. Many travel companies picked up on the trend and ran \\"geisha trips\\" to Japan. The film has also led to a regained interest in kimonos. It is now quite common to see young Japanese women wearing kimonos not just on traditional occasions, but at various social events. The fashion is also beginning to spread to western countries. Question: What does the film Memoirs of a Geisha lead to? Options: A: The popularity of the Chinese actress.

Letty climbs onto the GNX's hood and hops onto the last fuel tanker while Dom pulls ahead of the semi and stays in front of it to keep it at a certain speed. The first pickup (driven by Han from the third film, 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift') does a perfect 180-degree U-turn and continues in reverse while his female occupant flips over a part of the truck and lands perfectly onto the hitch on the back of the last fuel tanker. Letty is already spraying the hitch connecting the fuel tankers to each other and smashes it with a hammer once it's frozen so the last two tankers become detached and eventually come to a stop. As the second pickup is preparing the same feat (with Dom talking to them on walkie-talkies, hinting that they're not particularly great at what they are doing), Letty is standing on top of one of the tankers, and the semi driver sees her in his rear view and begins to speed up, hitting the GNX. Things get a little hectic, and the second pickup is pretty much getting dragged since they pulled off the U-turn and are connected to the trailer hitch. Letty gets knocked off of her feet but hangs on, though her hammer falls. While driving alongside of her, Dom orders Letty to spray the hitch, despite her no longer having a hammer. He instead pulls a 180-degree turn with the rear end of his car hitting the tanker, which shatters the frozen hitch, though he is now driving in reverse. At this point, they are already heading downhill, and the semi driver jumps out with his pet lizard. The semi and its trailer detach as Dom urges Letty to jump, particularly because the road curves but the semi is rolled over onto its side and is blocking the road. She jumps, and he eventually stops in front of the flipped semi as the fuel tanker, flaming... The answer is:","output":"No answer"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Highly sought after by collectors, and trading for as much as 850 each within a week of discovery, the error coins were identified by the absence of the edge impressions \\"E PLURIBUS UNUM IN GOD WE TRUST 2007 P\\". The mint of origin is generally accepted to be mostly Philadelphia, although identifying the source mint is impossible without opening a mint pack also containing marked units. Edge lettering is minted in both orientations with respect to \\"heads\\", some amateur collectors were initially duped into buying \\"upside down lettering error\\" coins. Some cynics also erroneously point out that the Federal Reserve makes more profit from dollar bills than dollar coins because they wear out in a few years, whereas coins are more permanent. The fallacy of this argument arises because new notes printed to replace worn out notes, which have been withdrawn from circulation, bring in no net revenue to the government to offset the costs of printing new notes and destroying the old ones. As most vending machines are incapable of making change in banknotes, they commonly accept only 1 bills, though a few will give change in dollar coins.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Accoring to many books, Chrysanthemum boreale belongs to compositae family\\"?","output":"The statement \\"According to many books, Chrysanthemum boreale belongs to the compositae family\\" is technically accurate as per the provided information. However, it's important to note that classifications and nomenclature in the field of botany can often undergo revisions as scientists' understanding of plant relationships and related genetic data evolves over time. To elaborate, Chrysanthemum boreale, a member of the Asteraceae family, was previously classified under the Compositae family. Compositae is an older designation for what is now commonly known as the Asteraceae family. Therefore, older texts, references, or resources might refer to Chrysanthemum boreale—and indeed other plants—as a member of the Compositae family.  However, in the modern plant taxonomy, the family Compositae has been largely substituted by Asteraceae. The rationale behind this change is to reflect recent genetic and molecular research that suggests a more accurate way to classify these plants. So, to clarify, Chrysanthemum boreale is still the same plant it was even when it was classified under Compositae. The change in nomenclature represents revised thinking and understanding in the scientific community, not a change to the plant itself. Therefore, it might be more accurate and contemporary to assert that Chrysanthemum boreale currently belongs to the Asteraceae family, even though older texts might refer to it as belonging to the Compositae family. This highlights the need for periodic updates to biological nomenclatural references to reflect current, more accurate scientific consensus and to avoid potential confusion.  In terms of the fundamental biology of Chrysanthemum boreale, this plant is a perennial species, meaning it lives for more than two years. Known for its yellow flowers, it's also notable for having 18 chromosomes in its diploid stage, indicating that it possesses two complete sets of chromosomes, one from each parent – which is a common characteristic for most animals and many plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"The second sentence \\"I wish I could play like I used to when I was younger\\" is not explicitly entailed by the first sentence. Entailment, in linguistics, refers to the logical relation between two sentences where the truth of one requires the truth of the other. In other words, if sentence 1 is true, then sentence 2 must also be necessarily true. Looking closely at the first sentence, it does narrate a story where the speaker used to be a good piano player but became involved in many other things, and they no longer have a piano to play on. The speaker also expresses some degree of regret about this situation, seeing it as \\"sad\\" that they have let their piano playing ability \\"slip away\\".  Meanwhile, the second sentence is a standalone statement where the speaker expresses a desire to be able to play the piano as they used to in their younger days.  While one can reasonably infer or interpret a sense of longing or wishful thinking from the first sentence based on its overall sentiment, the first sentence does not explicitly state a wish or a desire to be able to play like the speaker used to. Thus, we cannot say that the second sentence is logically entailed by the first. It's more of an implied sentiment rather than a clearly stated fact. However, these two sentences obviously share a common theme and contribute to building a coherent narrative about the speaker’s relationship with piano playing over time. Yet, while they are related in theme and sentiment, direct entailment does not exist between them. The first sentence does not necessitate the truth of the second sentence. It's possible to feel sad about losing a skill without necessarily wishing to regain it. So, while the sentiment of the second sentence is consistent with the first sentence, a logical entailment does not exist."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Pensioners must shoulder some of the burden of the spending cuts or their benefits could bankrupt the welfare state, the Government’s social mobility tsar has said. Alan Milburn, a health secretary under Labour, called on the Government to slash universal benefits for over-65s such as free TV licences and winter fuel payments. He said it was ‘unfair’ that better-off pensioners were protected from the impact of the cuts while working families with children were bearing two-thirds of the burden of cutting the deficit. His comments were dismissed as ‘bonkers’ by pensioners’ groups, as well as Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who said: ‘Punishing pensioners isn’t going to help a single child achieve more in life.’ David Cameron’s official spokesman also dismissed the claims, saying: ‘The Prime Minister believes it’s right to make the commitments he’s made to pensioners and to introduce the triple lock which means pensioners will get a 2.7 per cent rise.’ Mr Milburn’s Social Mobility Commission unveiled its report on the state of the nation yesterday. He warned that the burden of cuts had fallen disproportionately on middle-class families, and that for the first time in more than a century there was a risk that the next generation of adults could end up with lower living standards than today’s generation. As a result, Mr Milburn claimed pensioners should shoulder more of the burden. The report highlights that the number of pensioners is rising, their state benefits are going up and the numbers who can fund them are in decline. It said ministers had allowed an ‘inter-generational injustice’ which sees better-off pensioners protected but families with children bearing two-thirds of spending cuts. ‘We do not believe that favouring pensioners over their children and grandchildren will be a sustainable position over the long-term if a meaningful dent is to be made in the UK’s high levels of child  poverty and low levels of social mobility,’ it added. Mr Milburn said pensioners should shoulder more of the burden and said their benefits could bankrupt the welfare state (file picture) Nick Clegg said: 'Punishing pensioners isn¿t going to help a single child achieve more in life' Mr Milburn later told the Mail that the Government was simply trying to protect its share of the vote among pensioners. ‘I just don’t think it’s right that you have ordinary hardworking middle-income families who are finding their finances being squeezed and their public finances being cut and, at the same time, wealthy pensioners seeing their benefits not just protected but enhanced,’ he said. ‘I think that is going to be increasingly hard to justify.’ He added that sparing pensioners from being charged the spare room subsidy if they rented homes that were bigger than they needed was also ‘part of the same picture’. ‘Pensioner benefits are rising by 17.5 per cent during the course of this parliament,’ he said. ‘That is equivalent to half of the reductions in expenditure on welfare. ‘I understand politically why a.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the person who probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling in prayer in the now lost opposite panel?  Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling... The answer is:","output":"Van Eyck"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Associated Press. PUBLISHED:. 16:15 EST, 29 September 2013. |. UPDATED:. 21:44 EST, 29 September 2013. NASA is preparing to launch a 3-D printer into space next year, a toaster-sized game changer that greatly reduces the need for astronauts to load up with every tool, spare part or supply they might ever need. The printers would serve as a flying factory of infinite designs, creating objects by extruding layer upon layer of plastic from long strands coiled around large spools. Doctors use them to make replacement joints and artists use them to build exquisite jewelry. In NASA labs, engineers are 3-D printing small satellites that could shoot out of the Space Station and transmit data to earth, as well as replacement parts and rocket pieces that can survive extreme temperatures. Made in space: Project manager Matthew Napoli, left, and director of research and development Michael Snyder test a 3D printer which will eventually be used in space. ‘Any time we realize we can 3-D print something in space, it's like Christmas,’ said inventor Andrew Filo, who is consulting with NASA on the project. ‘You can get rid of concepts like rationing, scarce or irreplaceable.’ The spools of plastic could eventually replace racks of extra instruments and hardware, although the upcoming mission is just a demonstration printing job. ‘If you want to be adaptable, you have to be able to design and manufacture on the fly, and that's where 3-D printing in space comes in,’ said Dave Korsmeyer, director of engineering at NASA's Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, about 35 miles south of San Francisco. For the first 3-D printer in space test slated for fall 2014, NASA had more than a dozen machines to choose from, ranging from 300 desktop models to 500,000 warehouse builders. Test run: Tools and parts made by a 3D printer are displayed. One of the biggest obstacles to space exploration is that you need to bring everything with you including tools, equipment, spare parts and satellites. All of them, however, were built for use on Earth, and space travel presented challenges, from the loads and vibrations of launch to the stresses of working in orbit, including microgravity, differing air pressures, limited power and variable temperatures. As a result, NASA hired Silicon Valley startup Made In Space to build something entirely new. ‘Imagine an astronaut needing to make a life-or-death repair on the International Space Station,’ said Aaron Kemmer, CEO of Made in Space. ‘Rather than hoping that the necessary parts and tools are on the station already, what if the parts could be 3-D printed when they needed them?’ When staffing his start up in 2010, Kemmer and his partners warned engineers there would be ups and downs - nauseating ones. In more than a dozen flights in NASA's ‘vomit comet’ reduced-gravity aircraft, Made In Space scientists tested printer after printer. Ready for launch: Aaron Kemmer, CEO and co-founder of Made in Space, looks through some items. Specialized 3D printers would allow astronauts to produce the things they need on-demand when they're in space, allowing them to travel farther from the Earth. Last week at their headquarters on NASA's campus, Made In Space engineers in lab coats and hair nets tinkered with a sealed 3-D printer in a dust free cleanroom, preparing the models for further pre-launch tests. As proof of its utility, the team revisited the notorious 1970 moon-bound Apollo 13 breakdown, when astronauts were forced to jerry-rig a lifesaving carbon dioxide filter holder with a plastic bag, a manual cover and duct tape. A 3-D printer could have solved the problem in minutes. ‘Safety has been one of our biggest concerns,’ said strategic officer Michael Chen. Sparks, breakages and electric surges can have grave consequences in the space station. ‘But when we get it right, we believe these are the only way to manifest living in space,’ he said. Space-bound printers will also, eventually, need to capture gasses emitted from the extruded plastics, be able to print their own parts for self-repairs and have some abilities to recycle printed products into new ones. Scott Crump, who helped develop 3-D printing technology in 1988 by making a toy frog for his daughter with a glue gun in his kitchen, said he never conceived how pivotal it could be for space travel. But he said that until metal becomes commonly used in 3-D printers, the applications will be limited. ‘The good news is that you don't have to have this huge amount of inventory in space, but the bad news is now you need materials, in this case filament, and a lot of power,’ he said. NASA and other international space agencies are pressing forward with 3-D printing. Mastering space manufacturing, along with finding and producing water and food on the moon or other planets, could lead to living on space. Last month, the space agency awarded Bothell, Wash.-based Tethers Unlimited 500,000 toward a project to use 3-D printing and robots to build massive antennas and solar power generators in space by 2020. It replaces the expensive and cumbersome process of building foldable parts on Earth and assembling them in orbit. For Made In Space's debut, when it's shuttled up to the space station aboard a spaceflight cargo resupply mission, the initial prints will be tests - different small shapes to be studied for strength and accuracy. They're also discussing with NASA about what the first real piece that they should print will be. Whatever it is, it will be a historic and symbolic item sure to end up in a museum someday. ‘It's not something we're discussing publicly right now,’ said CEO Kemmer. Then, Jason Dunn, the chief technology officer, beckoned, dropping his voice as he grinned. ‘We're going to build a Death Star,’ he joked softly, referring to the giant space station in the ‘Star Wars’ movies that could blow up planets. ‘Then it's all going to be over.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"This article is about NASA preparing to send a 3D printer into space next year. The 3D printer is a helpful machine that can make different things by putting layers and layers of plastic together. In this case, it can help astronauts by making tools, spare parts, and other things they might need while they are in space. This can help them save space and weight on their spacecraft by not having to bring everything they might need with them. A company called Made In Space was asked by NASA to build a special 3D printer that can work well in space. They went on many airplane rides that made them feel like they were in space so they could test how well the 3D printer would work there. In the future, when astronauts need to fix something or build something new in space, they may be able to use a 3D printer like this one to make the parts they need instead of having to wait for supplies to be sent from Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Why do the Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan? === The answer to the above question is Answer:","output":"The Democrats oppose the Trump tax plan for several reasons that revolve around their concerns about its impact on the economy, the federal deficit, and the distribution of benefits among different income groups. Here are some key reasons why the Democrats do not support the Trump tax plan: 1. Benefits skewed towards the wealthy: Democrats argue that the proposed tax cuts disproportionately benefit the wealthiest individuals and large corporations, at the expense of the middle class and working families. They believe that the plan's provisions, such as the lowering of the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, the reduction of the top individual income tax rate, and the elimination of the estate tax, would mainly benefit the rich, further exacerbating the income inequality in the United States. 2. Increase in federal deficit: Critics of the tax plan, including many Democrats, are concerned about its impact on the federal deficit. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the tax plan would add approximately 1.4 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. Democrats argue that this increase in the deficit would have long-term negative effects on the economy and would likely lead to cuts in key social programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, which benefit vulnerable populations. 3. Limited economic growth potential: Democrats dispute the Republicans' claim that the tax cuts are essential for generating significant economic growth and job creation. Several independent analyses have suggested that the tax cuts would provide only modest economic growth and would not be sufficient to offset the increase in the federal deficit. Democrats argue that alternative approaches to taxation and public investment would be more effective in promoting economic growth. 4. Temporary benefits for individuals, permanent for corporations: The Trump tax plan proposes temporary tax cuts for individuals that would expire after 2025, while the corporate tax cuts would be permanent. Democrats argue that this approach demonstrates preferential treatment of corporations over individual taxpayers, and that working families would ultimately face tax increases once the temporary cuts expire. 5. Reduction in state and local tax deductibility: The limitation on the deductibility of state and local taxes under the Trump tax plan is a significant concern for Democrats, particularly those representing constituents in high-tax states. By reducing the amount of state and local taxes that can be deducted from federal income tax, this provision would effectively impose a double tax burden on many taxpayers and potentially lead to reduced public investment in vital services such as education, infrastructure, and public safety. These reasons, among others, have led Democrats to strongly oppose the Trump tax plan. They contend that the plan is inequitable, fiscally irresponsible, and detrimental to long-term economic growth and the well-being of middle-class and working families."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How does a program break out of the repetition of a task? Context: Program execution might be likened to reading a book. While a person will normally read each word and line in sequence, they may at times jump back to an earlier place in the text or skip sections that are not of interest. Similarly, a computer may sometimes go back and repeat the instructions in some section of the program over and over again until some internal condition is met. This is called the flow of control within the program and it is what allows the computer to perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian...

Movie plot title: Original Sin Movie plot: Original Sin is set in the late 19th century Cuba during the Spanish rule,[3][4] and flashes back and forth from the scene of a woman awaiting her execution by garrote while telling her story to a priest, to the actual events of that story. Luis Vargas (Antonio Banderas), a wealthy Cuban businessman, sends for American Julia Russell (Angelina Jolie) to sail to his country to be his bride. Julia departs from the ship, looking nothing like the photos she's sent prior to her voyage. Julia explains she wants more than a man who is interested in a pretty face, and that's why she's been deceptive - substituting a plain-looking woman in place of her own picture. Luis also admits to deception; he's been misleading her into believing he's a poor working man, instead of the rich owner of a coffee company. Luis and Julia wed within hours of her setting foot in Cuba. Luis falls passionately in love with his new wife. Meanwhile, Julia's sister Emily has been trying to contact her, worried about her after such a long trip to a strange land. Luis forces Julia to write back, fearing that if Julia continues to ignore Emily's letters, Emily will assume something terrible has befallen her sister and might send the authorities to check on her welfare. Holding off as long as possible, Julia finally pens a letter to her sister. In order to assure that his wife has everything she wants, Luis adds Julia to his business and personal bank accounts, giving her free rein to spend as she pleases. Luis discovers Julia has run off with nearly all of his fortune, and then teams up with a detective, Walter Downs (Thomas Jane), hired by Emily to find her real sister Julia. Walter reveals to Luis he believes Julia to be an impostor and the intended wife to be dead by her hand, and that she may be working with someone. The two set out together looking for her.

The remaining fragments of the U.S. government and military hide out in fortified military bases and colonies, attempting to find a solution to the zombie pandemic. Sarah, Private Miguel Salazar, radio operator William \\"Bill\\" McDermott, and helicopter pilot John fly from their base to Fort Myers, Florida, in an attempt to locate additional survivors. They encounter a large horde of the undead, and return to their army base in the Everglades, where a small group of scientists, supported by a skeleton crew of soldiers, is searching for a way to stop or reverse the re-animation process. Dr. Logan, the lead scientistÂ â also known as \\"Frankenstein\\" due to his grisly surgical dissections of zombies Â â believes that the zombies can be trained to become docile, and accordingly has amassed a collection of test subjects, which are kept in a large underground corral in the compound, in spite of the objections of base-commander Captain Henry Rhodes. The tension between soldiers and scientists worsens in the face of dwindling supplies, loss of communication with other survivors, and slow progress in research. During a meeting between the scientists and the soldiers, Rhodes announces that he is taking command of the base, that the scientists henceforth will work under his orders, and that anyone who objects will be instantly killed.

Help as much as you can. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

The popular commercial station claims that its BBC rival, which has overhauled its schedule over the last 18 months, has imitated a string of ideas: from listener phone-ins to request slots.

The correct answer is \\"Classic FM presenter\\" because the story is talking about BBC Radio 3 copying Classic FM's program format and style. The other options are incorrect because they do not directly relate to the topic of the story. For example: - BBC presenter, BBC Radio 3 presenter, and Radio 3 presenter: These are wrong because the story is about BBC Radio 3 copying from Classic FM, not keeping their own presenters. - Britain presenter and John Stevens presenter: These options don't make sense, as they are not relevant to the radio stations mentioned in the story. - Global Radio Network presenter: This is incorrect because the story focuses on BBC Radio 3 and Classic FM, not Global Radio Network. - Radio 2.5 presenter: This is not a station mentioned in the story, so it is not relevant. - Stephen Miron presenter: This is incorrect because Stephen Miron is the boss of Global Radio Network who accused BBC of copying Classic FM's format, so he is not a presenter. So, the answer is Classic FM presenter because the story is about BBC Radio 3 copying ideas from Classic FM."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In the first quarter the 49ers took the early lead with QB Alex Smith making a 12-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. Then DB Taylor Mays recovered a blocked punt in the endzone for a touchdown. Then the Falcons rallied with QB Matt Ryan completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR Harry Douglas. Then the Falcons took the lead with three field goals from kicker Matt Bryant. He made a 37-yard field goal near the end of the 2nd quarter, a 31-yard field goad in the 3rd.  Late in the 4th quarter, CB Nate Clements intercepted Matt Ryan's pass which should have sealed the game for the 49ers who were then up 14 - 13.  However, instead of going down, Clements continued down the left sideline attempting to score.  He would return the interception 39 yards before Falcons WR Roddy White was able to strip the ball from him and the Falcons recovered the fumble.  After regaining possession, the Falcons drove down the field again and this time was able to win the game on a 43-yard field goal by Matt Bryant, giving the 49ers another loss. How many yards longer was Smith's TD pass to Davis than Ryan's TD pass to Douglas?","output":"Alex Smith's touchdown pass to Vernon Davis was 12 yards long, and Matt Ryan's touchdown pass to Harry Douglas was 8 yards long. To find the difference in the length of the two passes, subtract the length of Ryan's pass (8 yards) from the length of Smith's pass (12 yards). 12 yards (Smith's pass) - 8 yards (Ryan's pass) = 4 yards Smith's touchdown pass to Davis was 4 yards longer than Ryan's touchdown pass to Douglas."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fifteen minutes after the purple prose of Babbitt's form-letter, Chester Kirby Laylock, the resident salesman at Glen Oriole, came in to report a sale and submit an advertisement. Babbitt disapproved of Laylock, who sang in choirs and was merry at home over games of Hearts and Old Maid. He had a tenor voice, wavy chestnut hair, and a mustache like a camel's-hair brush. Babbitt considered it excusable in a family-man to growl, \\"Seen this new picture of the kid--husky little devil, eh?\\" but Laylock's domestic confidences were as bubbling as a girl's.  \\"Say, I think I got a peach of an ad for the Glen, Mr. Babbitt.

Given the question: Recently the subject of discrimination has been something I have been thinking a lot about. It was the subject of some meetings with ubuntu-women, something I have discussed with my friend Sulamita in a Brazilian bar at 4.30am and the subject of various ad-hoc discussions at the Ubuntu Developer Summit. As the wider Open Source community grows, it becomes more of an issue every day, and something we all need to be aware of. While in Brazil I made a promise to Sulamita that I would be blogging about the issue of discrimination against women, and I have been holding off writing an entry until I had some real, practical, implementable steps that I can advise people to take to help make the situation better. Although I will never fully understand how some women are made to feel at the hands of such discrimination, I have been hoping my contribution could be to help contribute to an awareness of the issue, and for that to happen I felt I needed to construct some doable steps that people can execute. Solving social problems is hard though, which ain’t all that surprising, so I had held off on a blog post until I had some such action points. I have since discovered that there is really one key step that we all need take – don’t accept or allow discrimination in your community. In my mind all discrimination is bad. Every day people get up and are discriminated due to gender, age, race, mobility, technical knowledge and more. The issues of discrimination, while different in the specifics (e.g. women are discriminated in different ways to age discrimination), the underlying issue is very similar – mistreating people because of a grouping they are part of. We have all suffered this in different ways, from serious racial hatred to someone not taking you seriously because you have long hair and an Iron Maiden t-shirt.

Write a summary based on this article: AOL Inc. and several private-equity firms are exploring making an offer to buy Yahoo Inc., according to people familiar with the matter, devising a bold plan to marry two big Internet brands facing steep challenges.      Silver Lake Partners and Blackstone Group LP are among the firms that have expressed interest in teaming up with AOL to buy Yahoo or trying to take it private on their own, these people said. They added that at least two or three other firms could be interested in participating if a formal buyout proposal is drawn up.      The people familiar with the matter cautioned that these discussions—involving private-equity firms, AOL executives and financial advisers—are preliminary and don't yet involve Yahoo. The conversations may not lead to an approach given the complexities in structuring a proposal, the people said.      Spokeswomen for Yahoo and AOL declined to comment.      Yahoo has asked its banker Goldman Sachs about the rumors, verify whether they are credible and if there is an approach, what steps to follow, a person familiar with the matter said. The person characterized these discussions as routine in response to market speculation.      Yahoo has a long-standing relationship with Goldman, which advised it on Yahoo's takeover defense against Microsoft Corp. in 2008.      AOL, which spun off from Time Warner Inc. in late 2009, currently has a market capitalization of 2.68 billion, far smaller than Yahoo's 20.56 billion market value.

Some 49.6 million Yahoo shares changed hands on Wednesday considerably higher than the average of 17 million shares a day so far this month. It was one of the best-performing tech stocks of the day.      One of the scenarios under discussion among the buyout firms is a complex deal in which China's Alibaba Group would buy back Yahoo's roughly 40% stake in Alibaba, the people said. Some of Yahoo's other assets would also be sold off to interested media or technology firms, and the remaining company would be of a much smaller valuation that private-equity firms could get financing for, one of the people said.      Another scenario involves AOL combining its operations with Yahoo in a reverse merger after Yahoo disposes of the Alibaba stake, the people said. It is unclear if the resulting entity would be listed publicly.      Alibaba Chief Executive Jack Ma has expressed interest in repurchasing Yahoo's stake in his company, which analysts value at about 10 billion. A big chunk of Yahoo's current market value comes from its Alibaba stake.      Separately, AOL Chief Executive Tim Armstrong has also talked privately about the idea that Yahoo could buy AOL, according to a person familiar with the matter. Another person familiar with the matter said private-equity firms may also look to partner with media companies to buy Yahoo.      A combined Yahoo-AOL would have greater scale to compete in online advertising against industry juggernaut Google Inc. While both companies draw huge amounts of users, their advertising businesses have struggled as they've faced competition from a range of websites. The scenarios being discussed are similar to ones financial firms have discussed before. Yahoo and AOL discussed a merger in 2008, as Yahoo weighed a 45 billion takeover offer from Microsoft Corp. Microsoft eventually pulled its bid.      While private-equity firms have long contemplated a deal for Yahoo, talks have heated up in recent weeks as several senior Yahoo employees have left the company, intensifying pressure on Yahoo Chief Executive Carol Bartz to prove she can turn the company around, the people familiar with the matter said.      Ms. Bartz has improved Yahoo's profitability by cutting costs, but revenue hasn't grown much and the company faces other problems. The Internet pioneer, for example, has shown fewer benefits than competitors from a broad recovery in display advertising—an area where it faces increasing competition from Google and Facebook Inc.      The company, which reports third-quarter earnings next week, claims that more than 600 million people use its home page, email service or other sites every month. But the number of Yahoo pages viewed by its users, known as \\"user engagement,\\" began shrinking in the second quarter. Yahoo also has seen a drop in the value of advertising against content that Yahoo pulls from other sources. Ms. Bartz said in a recent interview she needed more time to pull off a turnaround.      —Amir Efrati      contributed to this article.      Write to Jessica E.

Inc., which spurned an acquisition bid from Microsoft Corp. in 2008, is working with Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to help defend against possible takeover approaches, said three people familiar with the matter.      While the Sunnyvale, California-based company hasn’t received an offer, Yahoo has been working with advisers for about two weeks to field any approach, said the people, who asked not to be named because the talks are private. AOL Inc. has talked with private-equity funds including Silver Lake about a possible bid, two people familiar with the matter said.      Yahoo climbed 4.5 percent today after paring earlier gains of as much as 9.9 percent. The company had lost half its value since Microsoft, the world’s largest software maker, withdrew an almost 50 billion bid in 2008, and sales haven’t grown under Chief Executive Officer Carol Bartz, leaving Yahoo vulnerable to fresh overtures.      “The shareholders own this company and the shareholders have lost a lot of value because of the actions of the directors and the management of this company,” said Lawrence Haverty, a portfolio manager at Gamco Investors Inc., which holds Yahoo shares. “Something’s going to happen.”      Discussions between AOL and private-equity firms are preliminary and have recently focused on a possible purchase of parts of Yahoo, two people said. The private-equity funds have weighed raising 10 billion to 12 billion, these people said.      Takeover Defense      Neither AOL nor private-equity funds have made an approach to Yahoo, the people said. Representatives of AOL, Yahoo and Goldman Sachs declined to comment.      Yahoo began preparing for an outside offer after some of its advisers picked up tips that private-equity funds were trying to raise money for a takeover, these people said.      Private-equity firms, bankers and some Yahoo investors have been pitching the idea of a Yahoo takeover to AOL and News Corp., according to a person familiar with the conversations. The idea is that Yahoo should focus on being a media company and align itself with another media-focused business, the person said. A spokeswoman for News Corp. declined to comment.      Yahoo rose 68 cents to 15.93 at 4 p.m. New York time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. AOL fell 17 cents to 24.95 on the New York Stock Exchange. AOL has gained 7.2 percent this year.      After withdrawing its Yahoo takeover bid, Microsoft struck a 10-year agreement to handle search for Yahoo’s sites. Microsoft has no current plans to make another bid for Yahoo and expects that its search deal would stand up to a change of ownership, two people familiar with the matter said.      Ballmer’s Comments      Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, when asked whether he’s interested in bidding for all or part of Yahoo, said that’s “not something I’m working on.” Asked to elaborate, he declined to comment. Earlier he had held a question-and-answer session at the University of Washington in Seattle.      AOL’s discussions focus on bringing Yahoo’s media operations under the management of AOL CEO Tim Armstrong, according to two of the people.      Yahoo General Counsel Michael Callahan has been in charge of the takeover-defense effort, two people said. The company’s thinking is that an outsider may be interested in Yahoo’s 39 percent stake in China-based Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., which analysts say is worth about 10 billion, these people said.      John Spelich, Alibaba’s spokesman in Hong Kong, didn’t reply to requests seeking comment.      Alibaba, China’s biggest electronic-commerce company, said last month it offered to buy back its stake in May, though the talks collapsed the following month.      Alibaba Stake      Now that Yahoo uses Microsoft’s Bing search technology and is phasing out its own capabilities, Alibaba no longer needs the company as a partner, David Wei, head of the Chinese company’s Alibaba.com Ltd. unit, said Sept. 10.      Alibaba Group sold the stake to Yahoo in 2005 for 1 billion and ownership of Yahoo’s Chinese unit. Under the agreement, Alibaba would have the right to buy back the stake if Yahoo were to be taken over, according to a 2005 SEC filing.      The Hangzhou-based parent of Hong Kong-listed Alibaba.com operates Yahoo’s local website and other Internet businesses, including Taobao.com, China’s biggest online shopping site.      Yahoo also owns 35 percent of Yahoo Japan Corp., operator of the nation’s most visited Web portal. Fumihiro Ito, a spokesman at Yahoo Japan’s largest shareholder, Softbank Corp., said the company is sticking with its intention of holding on to its stake.      Yahoo in Asia      Yahoo’s enterprise value after removing the stakes in Alibaba and Yahoo Japan is about 13.3 billion, compared with AOL’s 2.9 billion valuation, according to Miller Tabak & Co. analyst David Joyce.      If AOL were to be involved in a deal, private-equity funding would be necessary, unless it was structured as a reverse merger with AOL gaining managerial control, Joyce, who recommends buying AOL stock, wrote in a note today.      A combination of AOL and Yahoo would bring together Web properties that have struggled against Google Inc. and Facebook Inc. Yahoo, under a turnaround effort led by Bartz, announced last month the exodus of three of its top managers after reporting second-quarter sales that missed analysts’ estimates.      AOL, also in a turnaround effort led by CEO Armstrong, was short of sales estimates in its second quarter after being spun off from Time Warner Inc. last December.      This isn’t the first time the combination of AOL and Yahoo has been considered. Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes said in December 2008 that talks about possible deals for AOL were under way with Yahoo, Microsoft and Google. When those talks didn’t lead anywhere, Time Warner opted for a spinoff.      News Corp., based in New York, owns the Wall Street Journal, Fox News, a film studio and MySpace. AOL, since its December spinoff from Time Warner, has been trying to reshape itself into a media-driven company by investing in community news and niche online content and last month buying news blog TechCrunch Inc.      The technology blog AllThingsD previously reported that companies including AOL and Silver Lake have weighed an offer for Yahoo.

This idea is still very new, and nobody has actually talked with Yahoo directly about it. Some of the people eager to buy or join with Yahoo include Silver Lake Partners and Blackstone Group, and a few others might be interested too. However, this joining was a bit like building a really big and complex Lego tower - it could topple at any moment! So, everyone was taking small steps and discussing different ideas on how they could make it work. But nobody was exactly sure of what to do. Yahoo came to know about these talks and asked Goldman Sachs, a special friend who gives them business advice, to check if these talks were real, like when mommy asks if the cookie jar it is actually empty or not.  Another part of the plan was for a company named Alibaba, from China, to buy back some parts that Yahoo owns. Then, some other parts of Yahoo could be sold off to interested companies. Remember that yard sale you had last summer? It's similar to that. A different plan said that AOL might mix its business with Yahoo after Yahoo gets rid of some parts. This would be like mixing two different arts and craft projects into one big project. Alibaba's boss, Jack Ma, and AOL's boss, Tim Armstrong, both might want to buy AOL.  If AOL and Yahoo joined, they could be really big in the internet world and could compete against another powerful company called Google in the online advertising game. It's like having a really big team in a football match! Even though some people have thought about this kind of joining before, talks became more serious recently as some important people from Yahoo left the company. This put pressure on Yahoo's boss, Carol Bartz, to prove that she could make the company better. However, Yahoo is facing some difficulty, which is why it is considering different ideas. You can compare it to when you had a hard time completing that jigsaw puzzle? In the end, everyone was just trying to make sure that things would work out best for their companies, like when we try to pick the best ingredients for our cookies. So, they were all taking their time and considering all different options they have."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve this linear equation, let's follow these steps: 1. Simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable n. 2. Isolate the variable n by adding or subtracting terms. 3. Solve for n by dividing by the coefficient of the variable. Step 1: Combine the terms with the variable n. The equation is 5n - 3n - 6 = 0. We will combine the terms with the variable n (5n and -3n). 5n - 3n = 2n So the simplified equation is 2n - 6 = 0. Step 2: Isolate the variable n. To isolate n, we need to move the constant term to the other side of the equation. We do this by adding 6 to both sides of the equation: 2n - 6 + 6 = 0 + 6 2n = 6 Step 3: Solve for n by dividing by the coefficient of the variable. Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of n, which is 2. 2n / 2 = 6 / 2 n = 3 The answer is n = 3."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: Child's Play Movie plot: On the morning of November 9, 1988 in Chicago, Illinois, while being chased by Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon), Charles Lee Ray, a serial killer known as \\"The Lakeshore Strangler\\" (Brad Dourif), is shot and mortally wounded. Before dying, Charles takes cover inside a toy store, finding boxes of talking \\"Good Guy\\" dolls and then uses a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into one of the dolls. The store is then struck by lightning and it burns to the ground.Later that morning, 6-year-old Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) tells his widowed mother Karen Barclay (Catherine Hicks) that he wants a Good Guy doll for his birthday. Unable to afford the full price, Karen buys a stolen doll from a street peddler, which is the same doll into which Charles Lee Ray had earlier transferred his soul.That night, as Andy is playing with the doll who has introduced himself as \\"Chucky\\" Karen's friend, Maggie Peterson (Dinah Manoff), who is babysitting Andy, scolds him for turning on the evening news and placing Chucky in front of the TV. When Andy tries to deny the accusation, she doesn't believe him and sends him to bed. Maggie is later violently struck with a hammer by an unseen figure and falls out of the apartment kitchen window to her death. Andy, when questioned, insists that Chucky has revealed himself to be alive and that he killed Maggie.The next day, Andy visits the house of Eddie Caputo (Neil Giuntoli), Charles Lee Ray's accomplice, who had betrayed him. Chucky sneaks into Eddie's house and blows out the pilot light on the stove and turns up the gas. Eddie discovers Chucky is alive and, in panicked self-defense, fires his gun and the house explodes, killing him.Authorities place Andy in a psychiatric ward after he is found near the crime scene.

After threatening to throw him in the fireplace, Chucky comes alive in her hands, bites her and runs out of the apartment. She... Answer:","output":"Chucky bleeds in the movie \\"Child's Play\\" because his body is undergoing a transformation. When Charles Lee Ray used the voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into the Good Guy doll, he began a process in which the longer his soul stayed inside the doll, the more human-like the doll became. Throughout the movie, Chucky becomes more and more indistinguishable from a real human, with his body taking on human characteristics, such as bleeding. This transformation is also supported by the voodoo curse which allowed Charles' soul to pass into the doll in the first place. This further solidifies the supernatural aspects of the curse and its consequences beyond just the ability to animate the inanimate object. The bleeding is a visual indication to the audience of this transformation, showing that Chucky is not just a simple toy anymore. This added element of danger and suspense increases the horror aspect of the movie and contributes to the fear that the characters—and viewers—are experiencing throughout the film. As Chucky becomes more human-like, he becomes more believable as the villain, and as a result, the stakes for the characters rise, making their efforts to end his terror all the more urgent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"flowers require _.\\" is \\"pollen\\", given that  flowers require insects? Answer:","output":"In providing an answer to the question \\"flowers require _,\\" it is essential to consider the broader context and the various factors that contribute to the growth and reproduction of flowers. While it is true that many flowers require insects for pollination, it would be incomplete and somewhat misleading to say that flowers require pollen. Pollen is a crucial part of the reproductive process for many plants, including flowers, as it is a powdery substance consisting of microspores that carry male gametes. However, it should be noted that pollen is produced by the flowers themselves, specifically by the male reproductive organ called the stamen. Thus, it might be more accurate to say that flowers produce pollen rather than require it. Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male reproductive organ (the stamen) to the female reproductive organ (the pistil), allowing fertilization and the formation of seeds. In many cases, flowers depend on insects like bees, butterflies, and moths to carry out this process. These insects are attracted to flowers through various means, such as their color, scent, or availability of nectar, and as they feed on the nectar, they inadvertently collect pollen on their bodies, which is then transferred to other flowers' pistils as they continue their foraging. It is also important to note that not all flowers rely on insects for pollination. Some flowers are pollinated through other means such as wind, water, or even self-pollination. In wind-pollinated flowers, pollen is carried by the wind from one flower to another. Water-pollinated plants typically grow in or near aquatic environments and use water currents to distribute their pollen. Self-pollinating flowers can pollinate themselves, often in the absence of pollinating agents like insects, wind, or water. In addition to pollination, flowers require several other factors for their growth and survival. These include sunlight, water, and proper soil conditions containing essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. These elements, together with carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, are necessary for photosynthesis – the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy for growth and reproduction. In summary, while it is true that flowers require insects for pollination, it would be inaccurate to say that the right answer to the question \\"flowers require _\\" is \\"pollen.\\" Instead, a more comprehensive answer might be that flowers require a combination of factors, such as sunlight, water, nutrients, proper soil conditions, and in many cases, pollination by various agents like insects, wind, or water, to grow and reproduce successfully."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I got out of bed knowing I am going to commit suicide.I don't know where, but I do know how. I didn't want to do it at home. I printed out my suicide notes for everybody and hid it somewhere in my room. As I got ready, I took one last glanced to my dad. I gathered all my medications shoved it in to my bag and went out outside caught the bus that goes to college. I had no plans on going into my classes; I sat onto the college bus stop contemplating if I am going to do it. I did it. I chugged down the whole bottle of my anti-depressant. I closed my eyes for a brief moment, I felt like I was about to faint; I checked my phone to see what time was it and I saw my daughter's face on my home screen. I said to myself, \\"How can you be so stupid?! You have a daughter!\\" Trying my best to be conscious I caught the bus that goes to the hospital and checked in as a crisis patient in need to see a psychiatrist right away. I told my psychiatrist I tried to kill myself, and he escorted me down to the emergency room and I instantly became a 5150 patient. After 8 hours in the emergency room having full blown panic attacks I got transferred to a psychiatric ward 35 miles away from home. And for 4 days that psychiatric ward became my home.

Little Richard was born Richard Wayne Penniman on December 5, 1932, in Macon, Georgia. He was the third of twelve children of Leva Mae (nee Stewart) and Charles \\"Bud\\" Penniman. His father was a church deacon who sold bootlegged moonshine on the side and owned a nightclub, the Tip In Inn. Little Richard stated that as a child, he only played with girls and felt feminine, which was the source of jokes and homophobic ridicule at his expense. Caught wearing his mother's makeup and wardrobe at times, he was brutally punished by his father. He began having sexual encounters with boys by his teen years and also occasionally had sex with older women. Because of his effeminate mannerisms, his father kicked him out of their family home at 15. As Richard later explained in 2010, \\"my daddy put me out of the house. He said he wanted seven boys, and I had spoiled it, because I was gay.\\" He first became involved in voyeurism in his early twenties, when a female friend would drive him around and pick up men who would allow him to watch them have sex in the backseat of cars. He was once arrested after a gas station attendant in Macon reported sexual activity in a car occupied by Little Richard and a couple. Cited on a sexual misconduct charge, he spent three days in jail and was temporarily banned from performing in Macon, Georgia.  During the early 1950s, Little Richard had appeared as a drag performer in various burlesque shows. By the time he entered the Chitlin' Circuit, he began using makeup regularly, influenced by Billy Wright, who recommended his brand of makeup to him, Pancake 31. Later, as he began experiencing success in the mid-1950s, he made members of his band use makeup as a means to gain entry into white clubs during performances. He later told a columnist, \\"I wore the make-up so that white men wouldn't think I was after the white girls. It made things easier for me, plus it was colorful too.\\" In 2000, Richard told Jet magazine, \\"I figure if being called a sissy would make me famous, let them say what they want to.\\" Though he was gay, Little Richard recalled female fans sending him naked photos and their phone numbers.  While attending Oakwood College, Richard recalled a male student exposed himself to him. After the incident was reported to the student's father, Little Richard withdrew from the college. In 1962, he was again arrested after he was caught spying on men urinating at men's toilets at a Trailways bus station in Long Beach, California. Richard returned to participating in sexual orgies after his return to secular music in the 1960s. In 1984, while he claimed homosexuality was \\"unnatural\\" and \\"contagious\\", he would tell Charles White that he was \\"omnisexual\\" after he was asked about his sex life. In 1995, Little Richard told Penthouse that he always knew he was gay, saying \\"I've been gay all my life\\". In 2007, Mojo Magazine referred to Little Richard as \\"bisexual\\".

They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Kevin Toms (born 22, April 1957 in Paignton) is a British computer game designer who founded Addictive Games and is famous for creating the original \\"Football Manager\\", a simulation game released in the early 1980s that included a portrait of his bearded face on publicity material and cassette covers.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA).

He called this stage of his experiment as stage A. Then he started heating the water in the sealed container. He labeled this stage as stage B. Once the temperature reached hundred degree centigrade, he added more heat to it. He called this stage as stage C. Once all the water has turned into steam, he kept adding heat to it. He called this last stage of is experiment as stage D.  and a hint : Continued heating of the water after the ice has completely melted will now increase the kinetic energy of the liquid molecules and the temperature will rise. Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C.

When they finished their jobs as soldiers, they decided to start a special company. This company had a mission to help keep the streets neat and tidy. It was called \\"Xfor\\". Last year, the company made a lot of money, around £1.6 million, just for helping people remember not to throw trash on the ground. How did they do that? Well, they had a deal with some towns and villages. The leaders of these places asked Xfor to help them by teaching everyone that throwing trash on the streets is not nice. The way they taught people was by giving them a special punishment called a \\"fine\\" if they were caught being naughty and dropping things like matchsticks, orange peels, or banana skins on the ground. A fine is a kind of punishment where you have to give some of your money away because you did something wrong. If someone accidentally dropped one of these things and a helper from Xfor saw them, they had to give up to £80 because they didn't follow the rule. The helpers were really good at their jobs, and they caught many people who made the streets dirty. Because of their hard work, Xfor made lots of money. In the end, their company grew, and the streets in the towns and villages they worked with became cleaner. All because people learned the importance of keeping their neighborhoods neat and tidy.

Article: Explorer Benedict Allen has been haunted for decades about having to eat his faithful dog to save his life when lost in the Brazilian rainforest      Since the age of 10 I'd wanted to be an explorer. My dad was a test pilot flying Vulcan bombers and I wished I could be an adventurer like him. So in 1982, I saved up and planned my first trip across the north-eastern Brazilian rainforest.      After five months of trekking, being passed from one indigenous tribe to another, not really knowing what I was doing, I came across some goldminers who attacked me in the night. I was only 22, naive and very scared.      In the darkness I fled towards my canoe. With me was a dog I'd found in a village a few months before; I'd healed its paw, and it had become my companion. But in the chaos, the canoe capsized and I lost everything. I ended up walking on my own, lost in the rainforest with only the dog for company.      As we walked we got steadily weaker and, after about three weeks, I was starving to death; I had malaria and I was delirious. But the dog had become incredibly important to me in terms of keeping my hopes up. We were both suffering, but we were in it together.      I couldn't see myself, but I knew how bad the dog looked. I drew a little jokey cartoon in my diary of us both fantasising about eating one other; I knew it was becoming a very real proposition. I started thinking more about what I might have to do if I ever wanted to see my mum and dad again.      I remember lying on my back one day and thinking I wouldn't get up again if I didn't eat something; the only thing left was to eat the dog. I managed to cook a few bits using a survival kit. It gave me a little strength to keep going but, in a way, I was even more terrified, as knew I'd played my last card.      Some days later, miraculously, I saw a chink of daylight; I'd been in a dark tangle for as long as I could recall, but soon I was standing in a farmer's crop. He treated me with an anti-malarial drink and I was taken to hospital.      When I got back to Britain I was too ashamed to tell my parents how badly things had gone. Then the local paper asked me about the trip. I let slip about the dog and before I knew it the nationals were on to it; my sorry tale became a two-page spread in the Daily Mail. The RSPCA came round with a sack of hate mail.      I often wonder whether what happened was a mistake or not; obviously it kept me alive but it has also haunted me. In a way it has driven me in my career, fuelling my desire to understand why I had survived. But it has always been something I've wanted to rectify.

The BBC's Frank Gardner said Mr Allen had asked to be rescued and efforts were under way to retrieve him, but he was \\"not out of danger yet\\".      A search was mounted for the 57-year-old after his family said he had not taken planned flights home.      Mr Allen was travelling on his own to try to find the reclusive Yaifo tribe, whom he first met 30 years ago.      His agent, Jo Sarsby, said the co-ordinating director for New Tribe Mission in Papua New Guinea, Keith Copley, had confirmed in writing at 17:00 local time that Mr Allen was \\"safe, well and healthy\\", and at a remote airstrip 20 miles north-west of Porgera, Enga Province.      \\"Confirmation on exact location coordinates are now being confirmed in order to arrange evacuation as soon as possible,\\" she said.      She said it was understood the airstrip was not accessible by road, so it was hoped a helicopter would be sent on Friday.      Analysis      By BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner      Benedict Allen was under no illusions about the dangers and difficulties he would face when he chose to march off alone into the jungles of Papua New Guinea, in search of the isolated Yaifo tribe.      This is exactly the sort of challenge he thrives on.      But as well as having to contend with almost impossibly steep and forested terrain, it seems his plans have been disrupted by an outbreak of tribal infighting which often happens in remote areas.      Although foreigners are rarely the target of this violence outside the towns, there is always a risk of being associated with one tribe that is at war with another.      Those now trying to organise a rescue say he chose not to take a satellite phone, made no evacuation plan and left no coordinates of where he intended to end his journey.      They say his only way out is by helicopter or light aircraft.      Mr Allen's older sister, Katie Pestille, had said it was \\"out of character\\" for him to miss his scheduled flight out of Papua New Guinea to Hong Kong.      The explorer, from London, has previously crossed the Amazon Basin on foot and in a dug-out canoe, and participated in a six-week male initiation ceremony in which crocodile marks were carved onto his body.      He has filmed a number of his adventures for BBC documentaries and written books on exploration.      Who is Benedict Allen?      First solo adventure: To the Amazon at 22, during which he was shot at by two hitmen      Tough time: An initiation into manhood in Papua New Guinea. He was kept in a \\"crocodile nest\\" with 20 others, and repeatedly cut with bamboo blades to leave scars that looked like crocodile scales      Low moment: Eating his own dog to survive      Travel habit: Always keeps loo paper in a back pocket. \\"You know how it is,\\" he tells the Lonely Planet.      Philosophy: \\"For me personally, exploration isn't about conquering nature, planting flags or leaving your mark. It's about the opposite: opening yourself up and allowing the place to leave its mark on you.\\"      Career: Six TV series for the BBC, author, motivational speaker      Family: Lives with family in Czech Republic      In his last tweet from 11 October, Mr Allen wrote: \\"Marching off to Heathrow. I may be some time.\\" |||||Summary:","output":"Explorer Benedict Allen, renowned for his solo adventures and survival situations, was in the limelight for consuming his own dog to survive when he was lost in the Brazilian rainforest during his first expedition in 1982. After being attacked by gold miners, losing his belongings, suffering from malaria, and starving, Allen was left with no choice but to cook his canine companion just to keep going. This incident has impacted his life deeply, influencing his career and haunting his conscience. Years later, Allen was spotted \\"alive and well\\" near an airstrip in Papua New Guinea after missing a flight back home. He was reportedly on a mission to locate the elusive Yaifo tribe, which he first encountered 30 years prior. Rescuing Allen required complex planning due to his remote location, inaccessible by road, necessitating a helicopter for extraction.  Allen, an author, motivational speaker, and BBC documentarian, believes that exploration is about allowing oneself to be profoundly marked by the place rather than aiming to conquer it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Process:  - Cold water taken in through a hose to the bottom - Heating element heats water - Pump forces water up in pipes connected to spinning paddles - The forced water makes paddles spin like a sprinkler - Water comes out of small holes in paddles - Water is collected and used again until dishes are clean - Water is drained through a filter - Filter collects particles of food - Water was so hot that it evaporates for dry dishes.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more cold water taken in happens, how will it affect HELPING the dishwasher to clean better.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context refers to the idea that introducing more cold water into the dishwasher system might have an effect on its ability to clean dishes better. To evaluate this hypothesis, it is important to understand the different components of the dishwasher's process and how they may be affected by this change. 1. Cold water intake: Adding more cold water to the system means that there will be a larger volume of water available for the cleaning process. In principle, this could help in cleaning the dishes more effectively by allowing a greater amount of water to be used throughout the cycle. 2. Heating element: The water needs to be heated to a certain temperature to effectively clean and sanitize the dishes. With more cold water entering the system, the heating element will have to work harder and use more energy to heat the increased volume of water. This could lead to a longer heating time and increased energy consumption. However, once the required temperature is reached, the effectiveness of the cleaning process should not be compromised. 3. Pump and spinning paddles: With more water in the system, the pump will also have to work harder to force water through the pipes and make the paddles spin. If the pump is capable of handling the increased amount of water, then the forced water will still cause the paddles to spin, distributing the hot water onto the dishes as intended. However, if the pump struggles to manage the increased water volume, this could potentially lead to reduced effectiveness in the dishwashing process. 4. Water collection and recycling: More water in the system means more water to be collected and reused during the dishwashing process. This could be beneficial in terms of having more water to remove food particles from the dishes. However, it is crucial to ensure that the dishwasher's water recycling system can effectively handle the increased water volume without compromising the overall cleaning process. 5. Water drainage and filtration: After the dishes are cleaned, the water needs to be drained through a filter, which collects the food particles. With a larger volume of water, there may be an increased amount of food particles filtered out, potentially leading to a cleaner end result. However, this also raises concerns about the efficiency of the filter and the possibility of it becoming clogged more quickly with the increased level of food particles. 6. Evaporation for dry dishes: Lastly, the hot water used during the washing process needs to evaporate for the dishes to be dry. With more water in the system, there might be a larger amount of water to evaporate, which could lead to longer drying times. This effect may be minimized by the dishwasher's heating and ventilation capabilities. In conclusion, the introduction of more cold water into the dishwasher system could potentially have both direct and indirect effects on the process. On one hand, it may provide more water to effectively clean the dishes, but on the other hand, it could strain the various components (heating element, pump, filter, and drying system) and increase energy consumption. While it is possible that adding more cold water might help improve the dishwasher's cleaning ability, this effect would be contingent on the various components being able to handle the increased water volume without compromising their efficiency or overall function."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Robles, who was driving a bus with 45 evacuees, experienced the unfortunate mishap when the vehicle caught fire, resulting in 23 deaths. The incident occurred in September 2005, when thousands of people were evacuating the Gulf Coast to escape the devastating Hurricane Rita. Robles’ bus carried 45 passengers, all evacuated from a nursing home in Bellaire, Texas. Tragically, the fire caused significant damage, and 23 elderly passengers succumbed to the smoke and flames. Following the disaster, authorities investigated the cause of the fire and determined it was due to a mechanical failure in the bus's braking system. However, questions have arisen whether there were other contributing factors to the tragedy. Hours before the bus was engulfed, Robles was reportedly fixing a flat tire, and some wonder if the tire repair and possible overheating of the brakes could have played a role in the blaze. Now, the Mexican Consulate has stepped in, questioning the charges brought against Robles. They argue that the investigation should be thorough and fair, considering all factors that may have contributed to the fire. Furthermore, they emphasize that as a driver, Robles might not be the only one responsible for the tragic incident.  The Mexican Consulate is urging authorities not to rush to blame Robles solely, as a more in-depth examination of the circumstances may reveal a multifaceted issue. They have stated that their primary goal is to ensure that justice prevails in the tragic accident.

Choices:  - acidic solution  - exothermic solution  - dissolved solution  - hypotonic solution  A: Answer:","output":"Step 1: Understand the concept of a red blood cell swelling and bursting. When a red blood cell is placed in a solution, it can either swell, stay the same, or shrink based on the solution's concentration compared to the concentration inside the blood cell. The diffusion of water through the cell membrane (osmosis) balances the concentration. Step 2: Consider each choice provided. - Acidic solution: An acidic solution has a low pH, but this does not necessarily affect the swelling or bursting of a red blood cell. It might affect the overall health of the cell but is not the primary reason for a cell to swell and burst. - Exothermic solution: An exothermic solution refers to a process releasing heat, which is not directly related to the swelling or bursting of a red blood cell. Temperature can affect the cell, but it is not the primary reason for swelling and bursting. - Dissolved solution: This term does not provide clear information about the concentration of the solution, which is the essential factor in determining the effect it will have on the red blood cell. - Hypotonic solution: A hypotonic solution has a lower concentration of solute outside the red blood cell compared to the inside. This causes water to move into the cell through osmosis, resulting in the cell swelling and potentially bursting if enough water enters.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: Here are two questions (Question1 and Question2). If these questions have the same meaning and same answer, answer \\"Yes\\", otherwise \\"No\\". Problem:Question1: Why is Hillary Clinton worse than Donald Trump?, Question2: Who would be a better president: Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? Solution:","output":"To answer the given task, let's break down the questions and the guidelines provided: 1. Understand the questions. Question1: Why is Hillary Clinton worse than Donald Trump? This question is asking for reasons why Hillary Clinton could be considered worse as compared to Donald Trump. This might involve discussing specific actions, policies, or qualities that make her seem worse. Question2: Who would be a better president: Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? This question is asking for a comparison between both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, trying to determine who would be a better president. This will involve weighing the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate and making a judgment on who is more suited for the role. 2. Analyze the guidelines. The task is to determine if these questions have the same meaning and the same answer. We need to compare the meaning of both questions and see if they are asking for the same information or perspective. 3. Apply the guidelines to find the answer. Upon analyzing the questions, we can see that while both questions involve a comparison between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, they are framed differently. Question1 is asking for specific reasons why Hillary Clinton is worse, while Question2 is looking for a balanced comparison between the two candidates, focusing on who would be better. Thus, the questions do not have the same meaning. As the two questions have different meanings, their answers will also be different. Question1 would have an answer discussing the reasons why Hillary is considered worse, while Question2 requires an answer that gives an overall comparative judgment on who would be a better president.  So, the answer to the task is: \\"No\\", as the questions do not have the same meaning and do not have the same answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Maurice Daniel Robert Malpas (born 3 August 1962) is a Scottish football player and coach. He signed for Dundee United in 1979 and spent his entire professional playing career with the club until his retirement in 2000. With him United were Scottish champions in 1983 and Scottish Cup winners in 1994. European runs there included reaching the 1983-84 European Cup semi final and the 1987 UEFA Cup Final. Malpas was born in Dunfermline Fife. and played youth football for Leven Royals.  He signed for Dundee United in August 1979. His total of 830 competitive first team appearances is the second highest in the club's history. Malpas initially combined his football career with studying for an electrical engineering degree, and didn't become a full-time professional until 1984. Despite this, he made his debut in for Dundee United in 1981 and won the Scottish Football League Premier Division title in 1983. In the subsequent 1983-84 European Cup United reached the semi final.  United made it to the 1986/87 UEFA Cup Final. En route they defeated Terry Venables' F.C. Barcelona side featuring Gary Lineker and Mark Hughes at home and away in the quarter finals. Kevin Gallacher scored the only goal in the first leg at home. Ian Redford delivered the free kick headed home by John Clark for a 2nd leg equaliser at Camp Nou. This prompted Lineker to prophetically say to one of the United players, 'this mob'll just chuck it.' Iain Ferguson then scored a second for United nodding in Paul Sturrock's cross to win 3-1 on aggregate. In the semi final they drew 0-0 at home to Borussia Monchengladbach. In the return leg in Germany they inflicted Borussia's first home defeat in Europe in 55 games going back to 1970. Ferguson put United ahead just before half time. Redford capped the United performance with a last minute goal to seal a 2-0 win. Billy Thomson was injured after five minutes of the final first leg diving at the feet of Lennart Nilsson and needed five stitches for a blow just behind his left ear. Some reports said Thomson almost lost his ear. Thomson though repelled attack after attack and was beaten only once when Stefan Pettersson scored. McLean described Thomson's performance as \\"magnificent\\". Despite Clark scoring in the final in the 1-1 second leg draw at Tannadice, United lost 2-1 on aggregate.  United played in the Scottish Cup Final in 1987. Ferguson had a much disputed extra time goal disallowed. Five minutes later name sake Ian Ferguson scored the only goal of the game for a 1-0 St Mirren win. Gallagher had United ahead the year after when they lost 2-1 to Celtic. In 1991 Dave Bowman, John O'Neil and Darren Jackson scored in the 4-3 extra time defeat to Motherwell. Captain Malpas lifted the trophy when Craig Brewster scored the only goal in the 1994 Scottish Cup Final win against Rangers.  Malpas won the SFWA Footballer of the Year award in 1991.

Knitting is a way to do that with some special sticks called needles. Now, let's think about our options for needles: 1) Having two needles would maximize efficiency while knitting: This means that using two needles is just the right amount for knitting. It's like holding a pencil with one hand and paper with the other. You need both to draw properly. So with two needles, you can knit quickly and easily. 2) The more needles one has, the better as it would make the knitting much quicker: This idea suggests that having more needles would help you knit even faster. It's like trying to draw with more than one pencil at the same time - it might help in some cases, but it can also make things confusing and not as nice-looking. So, the better choice is the first option: having two needles would maximize efficiency while knitting.

If we try to slide the top block over the lower block, there will be numerous collisions as the bumps impact each other. The forward motion causes the collisions with bumps which then exert a force in opposite way the block is moving. The force of friction always opposes whatever motion is causing the friction.   Q: What force is caused by microscopic bumps, lumps, and imperfections colliding?   A: A:","output":"The force caused by microscopic bumps, lumps, and imperfections colliding as described in the paragraph is friction (D). When two surfaces interact, the imperfections on their surfaces create resistance to motion, and this resistance is what we commonly refer to as friction. The force of friction always opposes the motion causing it, and it plays a crucial role in allowing objects to grip and move across surfaces, while also generating heat as a byproduct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there's one thing everyone knows (or thinks) about the punk look, it's that it's mostly black. And, in general, this is true. But tried-and-true punk rockers also aren't afraid to throw in a little color. And bright colors at that. Think neons -- blues, pinks, yellows, oranges, greens -- and silver and red. Punk is so not the same as being goth or emo, and this is one of the reasons why. Remember how we talked about how punk has gone through all these transitions? Pay 'em homage! Do your research -- there are often military themes, blue-collar themes (work boots and suspenders -- getting down to punk's roots), and British influences. So raid your English uncle's closet. He's bound to have something in there. Body piercings, glitter, rubber, vinyl, kilts, tattoos -- they all have a spot on the spectrum of punk. Bowler hats, studded wristbands, the anarchy symbol, shaved heads or long hair, punk has seen it all. Seriously. Some people will tell you you gotta dye it, but if you take it too far, you'll end up just telling everyone, \\"Hey, look at me! I'm trying so hard to be anti-conformist!\\" So you could dye it, but you could also wear a mohawk, shave it all off, or just do absolutely nothing to it whatsoever. It's totally up to you. Not the answer you were looking for? Well, think about your hair the way you think about your clothes. If most people wouldn't sport it, it's probably on the money.

The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that thought the fairies were cardboard cutouts? is inside the article: In mid-1917 nine-year-old Frances Griffiths and her mother—both newly arrived in the UK from South Africa—were staying with Frances' aunt, Elsie Wright's mother, in the village of Cottingley in West Yorkshire; Elsie was then 16 years old. The two girls often played together beside the beck (stream) at the bottom of the garden, much to their mothers' annoyance, because they frequently came back with wet feet and clothes. Frances and Elsie said they only went to the beck to see the fairies, and to prove it, Elsie borrowed her father's camera, a Midg quarter-plate. The girls returned about 30 minutes later, \\"triumphant\\".Elsie's father, Arthur, was a keen amateur photographer, and had set up his own darkroom. The picture on the photographic plate he developed showed Frances behind a bush in the foreground, on which four fairies appeared to be dancing. Knowing his daughter's artistic ability, and that she had spent some time working in a photographer's studio, he dismissed the figures as cardboard cutouts. Two months later the girls borrowed his camera again, and this time returned with a photograph of Elsie sitting on the lawn holding out her hand to a 1-foot-tall (30 cm) gnome. Exasperated by what he believed to be \\"nothing but a prank\\", and convinced that the girls must have tampered with his camera in some way, Arthur Wright refused to lend it to them again. His wife Polly, however, believed the photographs to be authentic. Towards the end of 1918, Frances sent a letter to Johanna Parvin, a friend in Cape Town, South Africa, where Frances had lived for most of her life, enclosing the photograph of herself with the fairies. On the back she wrote \\"It is funny, I never used to see them in Africa. It must be too hot for them there.\\"The photographs became public in mid-1919, after Elsie's mother attended a meeting of the Theosophical Society in Bradford.

Sister on a mission: the Texas nun using oil company money to fight fracking “I call it redeeming the money,” said Sister Elizabeth Riebschlaeger, munching a turkey sandwich in a bar with a stuffed steer’s head mounted on a wall next to a life-sized poster of John Wayne. About six years ago, when fracking got feverish in the Eagle Ford Shale, a company offered to lease the mineral rights to some land bought by her grandfather in the 1920s. Sister Elizabeth did some research about the consequences of fracking – extracting natural gas by pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure into wells deep underground – and did not like what she learned. But her attorney told her that the company would find a way to get the rights with or without her consent. She decided: “What I’ll do is I’ll take the money and use it for something that will promote responsible development.” The nun would donate her oil and gas windfall to fund watchdog activities, holding the oil and gas industry to account and warning of the dark effects of get-rich-quick, lightly regulated capitalism. The 80-year-old roams the region, educating, advocating and sniffing out malpractice, often in a white Honda Civic with more than 250,000 miles on the clock, a windscreen that keeps getting cracked by road debris kicked up by trucks, and bumper stickers that say “Don’t Mess With Texas” and “No Disposal Pits”. As a result of her vow of poverty, the proceeds from Sister Elizabeth’s mineral rights go to her Catholic congregation, the Sisters of Charity of the Incarnate Word of San Antonio, which funds her tours. Sister Elizabeth is backing a long-running, longshot campaign to stop a fracking waste pit from being built next year in fields just outside the city limits of Nordheim, only half a mile from the main drag and a school with about 170 pupils. It’s an eye-catching battle in the Eagle Ford, which runs for some 400 miles through south Texas from the border with Mexico through to counties north-west of Houston. “With the onset of the fracking we had hectic, frantic activity. Everybody was rushing to get those wells drilled,” Sister Elizabeth said. “Air quality and safety deteriorated a great deal. Lots of people were killed on the roads.” The first well of the Eagle Ford Shale boom was drilled in 2008. That year, 26 drilling permits were issued. In 2014, the height of the frenzy, the figure soared to 5,613. Amid the industry’s continuing downturn, 642 permits were issued from January to August this year. A landscape of cattle ranches became blotched with well pads. As vehicles barreled along once-quiet country roads, fatal traffic accidents in the region increased by 40% between 2011 and 2012. “One man’s American dream quickly becomes another man’s American nightmare,” Sister Elizabeth said. “All you have to do is drive around and you will see the damage being done to the environment. And I point those things out and tell people that it can be reported.” The rapacious pace of the fracking surge and the stress the process puts on the environment is hard for some to digest, even in a pragmatic and conservative state that owes much of its prosperity and population growth to oil. “We didn’t even water our lawns in droughts. Now we see it going out by the truckload so people can waste it by putting it down a hole,” said Lyn Janssen, whose bucolic ranch is a short drive along the same country lane as the planned dump. While other places nearby have grown and smartened up by exploiting the boom’s economic benefits, Nordheim has stayed sleepy. Folks whose families have been here for generations and want a quiet rural retirement like it that way. Which may help explain why, unlike its neighbours, little Nordheim, population 307, fought back. At the least there will be a substantial increase in industrial traffic. At worst, locals fear that the pit and landfill cells will stink and release toxic chemicals into the air and the ground. At 143 acres, the facility will be roughly half the size of the town. Federal rules allow a maximum leakage rate of 100 gallons per acre per day from disposal cells and 1,000 gallons per acre per day from pits. Then there are concerns about the potential for leaks and spills. An underground gas pipeline runs through the site. It ruptured in 2014 only a stone’s throw away and contaminated soil. “Within five years, if it’s put in, this town will die,” predicted Larry Baucum, seated behind the counter at Nordheim Mercantile, a bric-a-brac bazaar in town. In the window, next to a sign stating the opening hours – three days a week – there is a poster with a skull and crossbones and the slogan “Don’t Dump on Nordheim”. He believes that businesses and residents would flee. “It’s not that we’re against the pits – I’m an old oilfield hand,” the 69-year-old said. “But we’re against the location. It does not have to be right next to our city limits.” A posse of Nordheim residents banded together and formed a group called Concerned About Pollution (CAP). Armed with technical knowledge and a stubborn streak, they wrote letters, showed up at hearings in Austin and managed to stall the granting of a permit for three years. Their battle ultimately underlined the limited powers of the state’s oil and gas regulator, the anachronistically named Texas Railroad Commission, which has often drawn accusations that it enjoys an overly warm relationship with the industry it oversees. When the permit was confirmed in May, the developer, Petro Waste Environmental, said in a statement that “high standards of safety and compliance are Petro Waste’s top priority. These core company values played a vital role in the design and engineering process for this facility.” CAP did not admit defeat: it filed an ongoing lawsuit in Austin to challenge the decision. But victory appears unlikely. CAP’s president, Paul Baumann, was born in Nordheim and owns a rental property next to the site. His brother and nephew live close to the entrance. The 72-year-old returned after a career working at a DuPont chemical plant near Houston. “Thought I was gonna be away from chemicals and breathe my clean air down here,” he said ruefully before guiding his pickup truck down a bumpy path next to the future dump along a hayfield dense with dancing butterflies. “It’s a terrible site,” Sister Elizabeth said. But her indefatigable crusade against “capitalism without moral or ethical values” in the Eagle Ford Shale goes on.

Q: Underground criminal Divine lives under the pseudonym \\"Babs Johnson\\" with her mentally ill, egg-loving mother Edie, delinquent son Crackers, and traveling companion Cotton. They all live together in a pink and green trailer on the outskirts of Phoenix, Maryland, in front of which can be found a gazing ball alongside a pair of eponymous plastic pink flamingos. After learning that Divine has been named \\"the filthiest person alive\\" by a tabloid paper, jealous rivals Connie and Raymond Marble set out to destroy her career but come undone in the process.The Marbles run an \\"adoption clinic\\", which is actually a black market baby ring. They kidnap young women, have them impregnated by their manservant, Channing, and sell the babies to lesbian couples. (Channing is seen from behind, but apparently masturbates and ejaculates.) The proceeds are used to finance a network of dealers selling heroin in inner-city elementary schools. Raymond also gets money by exposing himself (with large kielbasa sausages tied to his penis) to unsuspecting women in a park and stealing their purses when they flee. The Marbles send a spy named Cookie in the guise of what Crackers thinks is a date. In one of the film's most infamous scenes, the two of them have sex while crushing a live chicken between them as Cotton looks on through a window. Cookie then informs the Marbles about Babs' real identity, her whereabouts, and her family, as well as information about her upcoming birthday party.The Marbles send a box of human feces to Divine as a birthday present with a card addressing her as \\"Fatso\\" and proclaiming themselves \\"The Filthiest People Alive\\". Worried her title has been seized, Divine proclaims whoever sent the package must die and her two associates agree. Meanwhile, at the Marbles', Channing dresses up as Connie and Raymond, wearing Connie's clothes and imitating their earlier overheard conversations. When the Marbles return home, they catch Channing in the act and respond with outrage, firing him and locking him in a closet until they can return from their tasks and kick him out for good.The birthday party begins as the Marbles arrive to spy on it. Divine receives an assortment of gifts, including lice shampoo, a pig's head, and an axe. Later on, they all witness a topless dancing woman with a snake and a contortionist who flexes his prolapsed anus in rhythm to the song \\"Surfin' Bird\\". One of the guests, the Egg Man, who delivers eggs to Edie daily, confesses his love for her and proposes marriage. She accepts his proposal and he carries Edie off in a wheelbarrow for a honeymoon around the egg industry. The Marbles, disgusted by the reveling, call the police, but this proves unsuccessful as Divine and the other party-goers kill the cops. Divine hacks up their bodies with the axe and the party-goers eat them.After the party ends, Divine and Crackers head to the Marbles' house, whose address they received from the local gossip Patty Hitler, where they lick and rub everything in their house to spread their \\"filthiness\\", which excites them to the point of engaging in oral sex. Divine and Crackers find Channing locked away, but they have no sympathy for him. Once they're in the basement, Divine and Crackers use a large knife to cut the bonds and free the two captive women, then hand over the knife. The women emasculate Channing offscreen.Meanwhile, Connie and Raymond burn Divine's beloved trailer to the ground. Upon their return home they are troubled by the behavior of their furniture. Having been \\"cursed\\" by being licked by Divine and Crackers, the furniture \\"rejects\\" the Marbles when they return home: when they try to sit, the cushions fly up, throwing them to the floor. They then find that Channing has bled to death from his castration and the two girls have escaped.After finding the remains of the burned-out trailer, Divine and Crackers return to the Marbles' home. They take them hostage at gunpoint and return to the site of the trailer. Divine calls the local tabloid media to witness the Marbles' trial and execution, as she proclaims her belief in \\"filth politics\\":âBlood does more than turn me on, it makes me cum. And more than the sight of it, I love the taste of it. The taste of hot, freshly killed blood...Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat shit! Filth are my politics! Filth is my life! Take whatever you like.âDivine holds a \\"kangaroo court\\", asks Cotton and Crackers for their biased testimony, and sentences the bound and gagged Marbles to death for \\"first-degree stupidity\\" and \\"assholism\\". Divine sarcastically offers them the opportunity to speak on their own behalf, but they're of course gagged and they move straight to the execution. They tie the Marbles to a tree, coating them in tar and feathers. Divine then shoots them in the head and the media leave shortly afterward, satisfied with their scoop of a \\"live homicide\\". Divine, Crackers, and Cotton talk about where to base their seat of operations next and they enthusiastically decide to relocate to Boise, Idaho, site of a homosexual scandal a few years previously.[11]The legendary ending opens as Crackers, Cotton, and Divine walk down the street, where they spot a dog and its owner. They look at the dog excitedly and hungrily for some reason. Then the dog defecates on the sidewalk, and Divine sits down next to it. She takes the feces in her hand and puts them in her mouth, proving, as the narrator states, that she is \\"not only the filthiest person in the world, but is also the world's filthiest actress\\". She gags twice and grins at the camera. A:","output":"Question: Which characters live in the pink and green trailer? Answer: Divine, Edie, Crackers, and Cotton.

Look to the top left hand corner of the chart and you will see the ticker designation, or symbol. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? Look to the bottom left hand corner of the chart and you will see the ticker designation, or symbol","output":"No, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we cannot conclude that the sentence is true. The paragraph specifically states that you should look to the top left-hand corner of the chart to see the ticker designation or symbol. In contrast, the sentence mentions looking at the bottom left-hand corner for the same information. Since there is no additional information given about the bottom left-hand corner, we cannot conclude that the statement is true.  To read a stock chart correctly, it's essential to be aware of various elements and how they are presented in the chart. The following are some of the crucial components to consider when reading a stock chart: 1. Ticker Symbol: As mentioned in the paragraph, the ticker symbol or designation can be found at the top left-hand corner of the chart. This symbol represents the abbreviation used to uniquely identify the stock of a company on the stock exchange. 2. Time Frame: Stock charts can display data for different periods, ranging from intraday 1-minute charts to longer-term monthly charts. The time frame can be typically found at the top or bottom of the chart, depending on the charting tool you are using. 3. Price and Volume Data: The main body of a stock chart showcases the price action of the stock over the selected time frame. Various chart types display the price data differently, such as line charts, bar charts, and candlestick charts. The volume, or the number of shares traded, can usually be seen as bars at the bottom of the chart, with each bar representing the volume of shares traded for a specific time frame. 4. Moving Averages: Moving averages are important technical indicators that can give an idea of a stock's trend by smoothing out the price data. They are generally plotted as lines on the stock chart. The most commonly used moving averages are the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, but you can also use other time frames based on your trading strategy. 5. Technical Indicators: Various technical indicators can be plotted on a stock chart to help analyze the stock's price performance. Some popular technical indicators include Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands. Each of these indicators can provide valuable insights into the stock's trend, momentum, and potential entry or exit points for trading. 6. Support and Resistance Levels: Support and resistance levels are horizontal lines on a stock chart that indicate the price levels where buying or selling pressure is strong and may influence future price movements. When reading a stock chart, it's essential to understand the data presented and apply appropriate technical analysis tools based on your trading strategy. Keep in mind that every charting tool or platform may have a slightly different layout, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the tool you are using to analyze stock charts accurately."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If any of the information from your application changes, make sure to report it to the appropriate Medicaid representatives in your area. This can change the status of your application, eligibility, or benefits determination. Because regulations and personal situations are constantly changing, you need to renew your eligibility for Medicaid every year. In most cases, your home state will contact you when your eligibility is about to expire. If you’ve applied for Medicaid in the past, the renewal process is usually not as long as the initial application.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of having proper documents and being thorough when applying for Medicaid. To speed up the process and receive entitled benefits, applicants should have copies of their birth certificate, Social Security number, guardianship papers, driver's license, vehicle registration, proof of residency, pay stubs, proof of income, financial institution details, real estate deeds, unpaid medical bills, and Medicare Benefit Card (if applicable). Reading the application carefully and answering each question accurately is crucial to avoid any disqualification. States generally have a set of screens with questions on each page, so providing honest information and answering as many questions as possible can help with assessing eligibility and qualifying benefits. Knowingly falsifying information is a federal crime, so it is important to provide accurate data about income, disabilities, or other qualifying criteria. Applicants can seek help from local or federal Medicaid officials if they have questions or concerns about their eligibility or the application process. Applications can be submitted online or by mail or fax, and adult applicants must sign them. After submission, applicants should confirm receipt and follow up on their application's status. If any information changes, it should be reported to Medicaid representatives as it could affect eligibility or benefits determination. Finally, applicants must renew their Medicaid eligibility annually, with the renewal process usually being shorter than the initial application."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: A man who faked his drowning death nearly 20 years ago off a Florida beach was found out by North Carolina police who stopped him for a traffic violation, authorities said Thursday. Bennie Wint told police he faked his drowning death in Daytona Beach, Florida, in 1989. Bennie Wint left behind a grieving fiancee and a daughter from a previous marriage. Over the past two decades, he acquired a common-law wife and another child in Marshall, North Carolina. Wint told police he faked his death in Daytona Beach, Florida, because he was \\"paranoid\\" about his narcotics-related activity at the time, Weaverville, North Carolina, police Sgt. Stacy Wyatt told CNN. When pulled over in Weaverville on Saturday because of malfunctioning lights on his license plate, the man said his name was James Sweet, Wyatt said. But when Wyatt ran the name through official databases, he was unable to find any information. \\"I found it suspicious and believed it to be a false name,\\" Wyatt said. He arrested the man on suspicion of driving without a license and giving false information, both misdemeanor offenses, and booked him under the name \\"John Doe.\\" But \\"John Doe\\" finally opened up to Wyatt, admitting he was really Bennie Wint and had been on the run since 1989.  Watch how reports of his death were premature ». Wint returned a call Thursday from CNN and asked what an interview with him would be \\"worth to you.\\" Told that CNN does not pay for interviews, he responded, \\"Unless you want to pay for it, don't come up here. You are wasting your time. There are 'no trespassing' signs on my property.\\" He then hung up. According to police reports, Wint was on a trip to Daytona Beach with his then-fiancee, Patricia Hollingsworth. She told police they were engaged and had discussed getting married while on the trip. But it was not to be. On September 25, 1989, Hollingsworth told beach patrol officials that Wint disappeared while swimming. \\"We spent a bunch of time looking for him,\\" said Volusia County Beach Patrol Capt. Scott Petersohn, who was on the beach patrol at the time, although he did not respond to the call. \\"We used helicopters, boats and boatloads of lifeguards.\\" Hollingsworth, then 37, told officials Wint entered the ocean about 4 p.m. and swam past the breakers before she lost sight of him, according to the incident report. The report notes Hollingsworth was \\"very upset\\" and that after contacting officials, she \\"began to run north and south in the area,\\" looking for Wint. Members of the beach patrol, however, thought the supposed drowning was suspicious. \\"It is very rare to drown offshore and not wash back in onto the shore,\\" Petersohn said. In addition, he said, the lifeguard on the beach told officials he did not see anyone swimming in the area. Wyatt submitted Wint's fingerprints to the FBI for identification and, while waiting for the results, searched the Internet for information on a Bennie Wint. \\"I found a daughter that was looking for him,\\" Wyatt said. The woman posted information about her father in 2007, saying he went missing under suspicious circumstances. Wyatt contacted the now-23-year-old woman, who said she was 4 when her father disappeared. Wint has been released from jail and has not been charged in relation to the 1989 incident. It was not known whether he contacted his daughter. Wyatt said Wint now has a common-law wife, a child and a business selling NASCAR items. The night he was arrested, Wyatt said, his wife was \\"distraught\\" upon learning his true identity. Wyatt said Wint told him he was involved in narcotics in the 1970s and '80s, and \\"he ran out of paranoia, thinking people were out to get him.\\" He said he went from Daytona Beach to Ozark, Alabama. CNN's attempts to contact Hollingsworth were unsuccessful, and it was unclear whether she knows Wint is alive. Petersohn said he is attempting to find the lifeguard on duty at Daytona Beach the day Wint disappeared to tell him the truth about the supposed drowning. \\"For 20 years, that man that works for us thinks he might have missed something in the ocean,\\" Petersohn said. \\"I'm glad the guy's alive. I really am. ... It's unfortunate the way it went down at the time, people looking for a body that wasn't out there.\\"","output":"1.

The city lies on the southern edge of Gdańsk Bay (of the Baltic Sea), in a conurbation with the city of Gdynia, spa town of Sopot, and suburban communities, which together form a metropolitan area called the Tricity (\\"Trójmiasto\\"), with a population approaching 1.4 million. Gdańsk itself has a population of 460,427 (December 2012), making it the largest city in the Pomerania region of Northern Poland.  Gdańsk is the capital of Gdańsk Pomerania and the largest city of Kashubia. With its origins as a Polish stronghold erected in the 980s by Mieszko I of Poland, the city's history is complex, with periods of Polish rule, periods of Prussian or German rule, and periods of autonomy or self-rule as a \\"free city\\".

When legendary Finnish athlete Paavo Nurmi was asked about the reason for his success at the 1924 Olympics despite high-heat conditions, he mentioned what tradition of his country as part of his training?","output":"Paavo Nurmi, the legendary Finnish athlete, achieved groundbreaking success at the 1924 Olympics held in Paris, France, despite the high-heat conditions, which were not favorable for long-distance runners. Nurmi credited part of his success to a tradition of his country: the Finnish sauna. The Finnish sauna is an integral part of Finnish culture and daily life, known for its potential health benefits and relaxation. Saunas in Finland can be found in households, public spaces, and even in recreational areas. The traditional Finnish sauna consists of a small room or building designed to hold dry heat at temperatures between 80-100 degrees Celsius (176-212 degrees Fahrenheit), while occasionally ladling water onto heated rocks produces steam known as \\"löyly.\\" This hot and humid environment is intended to make the occupants of the sauna sweat, releasing toxins and cleansing the body. Nurmi incorporated the use of saunas in his training regime. Now known as \\"heat training\\" or \\"heat acclimation,\\" Nurmi understood that regularly exposing his body to high heat conditions in the sauna could help to improve his performance on the racetrack by training his body to better cope with heat stress. This practice proved to be beneficial, as it allowed him to cultivate higher endurance and heat tolerance. During heat training, the body undergoes various physiological adaptations in response to heat stress. These adaptations include an increase in blood plasma volume, improved cardiovascular stability, enhanced sweat rate, and a decrease in the body's core temperature. With these adaptations, athletes like Nurmi can delay the onset of fatigue and reduce the risk of heat-related illnesses, such as heat exhaustion or heat stroke. By making the Finnish sauna a part of his training routine, Paavo Nurmi was better prepared for the taxing conditions he faced during the 1924 Olympics. Consequently, he secured an astonishing five gold medals in both long-distance and middle-distance track events. Nurmi's achievements on the racetrack, supported by his country's tradition of sauna use and his unique training approach, has made him one of the most revered athletes in the history of sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An ex-orthopedic surgeon and an architect claim to have discovered the holy grail of fashion footwear: high heels that are genuinely comfortable. Dr Taryn Rose, a 47-year-old single mother-of-three based in California, already built a 40 million business with her first namesake shoe collection, and has now launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund her next chapter: 'wing shoes.' The collection of heels are the brainchild of architect and designer Enrico Cuini, and have specially constructed carbon fiber 'wings' built into the insoles, which support and cushion all three arches of the foot; the medial, lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one. Scroll down for video. The holy grail? Dr Taryn Rose, a former orthopedic surgeon, and architect Enrico Cuini have created a line of high heeled shoes (pictured, the peep-toe sandal) which boast carbon fiber 'wings' built into the insoles. 'The wings \\"flutter\\" as you walk to provide a pumping action, which helps blood flow back to your heart from your feet,' Dr Rose tells MailOnline. 'This provides comfort and decreases swelling in your feet.' She adds: 'These wings make your feet feel stable, supported and secure, and gives them a \\"platform\\" to rest on so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel. 'The pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle doesn't wobble.' Mr Cuini came up with the first prototype, after which he approached Dr Rose to come on board. Formerly a European Windsurfing champion, Mr Cuini introduced strong but flexible materials to the shoes that are traditionally used to shape and streamline surfboards. Pretty fly: The wings (pictured) support and cushion all three arches of the foot; the medial, lateral and transverse - rather than just the usual one. Secret weapon: The shoes are fitted with hidden platforms to rest on, so you feel like you are wearing a much lower heel. Pictured, the platform stiletto (left) and the classic stiletto (right) Fancy feet: Their design also means that the pressure is relieved from the balls of your feet and your ankle doesn't wobble. Pictured, the laser-cut bootie (left) and the wedge (right) 'Mr Cuini brings a lot of different perspectives and industries to the shoe industry, which hasn't really changed in 100 years,' Dr Rose points out. The collection includes flip-flips and sneakers as well as classic stilettos, platform stilettos, wedges, peep-toe sandals and booties; all in a range of colors. Prices start at 350 and run up to 1995, but donors to the Kickstarter campaign are rewarded with shoes from the line at up to a 50per cent discount. As the company builds its customer base, they aim to lower the prices where possible. The campaign, which is hoping to raise 100,000 by November 5, will fund the manufacturing molds needed for the new wing technology. Teamwork: Mr Cuini (left) came up with the first prototype, after which he approached Dr Rose (right) to come on board with her industry knowledge. Engineered to fit: The wings 'flutter' as you walk to provide a pumping action, which helps blood flow back to your heart from your feet, thus decreasing swelling. Dr Rose explains: 'We felt that with Kickstarter, it's a way for us to build the community from day one. 'This is a way for someone to be a part of our company from the very beginning whether it's a 5 pledge or a 10,000 pledge.' She and Mr Cuini have chosen to donate a sizable portion of the net profits from their shoes to philanthropic causes concerning water, education and health; something that might be unattractive to private investors, but she feels is crucial. So how did Dr Rose make the transition from orthopedic surgeon, to a shoe business she started in her garage, to a multi-millionaire footwear designer? 'As an orthopedic surgeon - and fashionista - I saw women who wanted to wear fashion shoes but suffered from how uncomfortable they can be...especially high heels. 'And of course, I dealt with several broken ankles from women falling off their heels, usually with the help of a few cocktails.' Construction: Dr Rose enlisted architect and engineer Enrico Cuini to help design the collection, and the Kickstarter campaign will fund the molds used to construct the shoes (pictured) Dr Rose, who earned her M.D. from the University of Southern California, was the first to use a memory foam-type material called Poron on shoes she crafted for diabetic patients to absorb shock. She then had the idea to marry the passion she had for her male dominated field - only around ten per cent of foot surgeons were women at the time - and her love of fashion. She became the first designer to use Poron in a line of fashion shoes, a collection she designed in her garage 17 years ago with Mr Cuini. 'When I saw the prototype that he had made on my kitchen table it took me two seconds to realize, \\"this is the real deal... the next big revolution in footwear\\".' Then and now: Dr Rose had the idea to marry the passion she had for orthopedic surgery with and her love of fashion, and gave up her medical career in 1997 to start her first shoe label, which she sold off in 2008. Women loved the shoes and Dr Rose sold her first collection to Nordstrom. Over the next ten years, she stopped practicing as a surgeon and built a 40 million revenue business instead. 'Once I had the time to look at what I had accomplished, I realized I'd actually built a great company,' she recalls. 'It was hard to grasp.' One of the stunts Dr Rose pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three-inch pumps. She sold her Taryn Rose line in 2008 and spent the next eight years planning her next move. Mr Cuini came back on board two years ago, and inspired by a butterfly, the new wing technology was born. We're convinced! One of the stunts Dr Rose pulled off to prove the merits of her comfortable high heels was to climb 282 steps in a pair of her three-inch pumps (pictured) The surgeon-turned-designer, who is mom to Anneka, 14, Milo, 10, and Peter, 9, estimates she owns around 287 pairs of shoes currently. 'It's human nature to want to be desirable, and high heels do wonders for that,' she says. 'They make your legs appear more toned and elongated, your lower back more arched and your \\"booty\\" more prominent.' And for those of us who can't wait for her wing shoes to go to on sale, estimated to be June 2015, Dr Rose gave us her top tips for high heel shoe-shopping so as to to avoid ending up in pain. 'Shop at the end of the day when your feet are most swollen, and look for shoes with some form of padding for your forefoot, since there's a lot of pressure in that region,' she advises. 'Look for shoes with a built-in platform to decrease the actual pitch of the shoe, and try not to go with shoes narrower than 1 cm of your own foot.'

Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What gives the carrier an advantage over other ships?\\" is in \\"The aircraft carrier dramatically changed naval combat in World War II, because air power was becoming a significant factor in warfare. The advent of aircraft as focal weapons was driven by the superior range, flexibility and effectiveness of carrier-launched aircraft. They had higher range and precision than naval guns, making them highly effective. The versatility of the carrier was demonstrated in November 1940 when HMS Illustrious launched a long-range strike on the Italian fleet at their base in Taranto, signalling the beginning of the effective and highly mobile aircraft strikes. This operation incapacitated three of the six battleships at a cost of two torpedo bombers. World War II in the Pacific Ocean involved clashes between aircraft carrier fleets. The 1941 Japanese surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was a clear illustration of the power projection capability afforded by a large force of modern carriers. Concentrating six carriers in a single unit turned naval history about, as no other nation had fielded anything comparable. However, the vulnerability of carriers compared to traditional battleships when forced into a gun-range encounter was quickly illustrated by the sinking of HMS Glorious by German battleships during the Norwegian campaign in 1940.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The advantage that aircraft carriers have over other ships is their ability to launch carrier-based aircraft with superior range, flexibility, and effectiveness compared to naval guns.

SEOUL (Reuters) - Excess supplies of large liquid crystal displays (LCDs) are forecast to peak in the third quarter of this year, but will balance out by the fourth, a US research firm said on Friday.","output":"This article is about the prediction of an oversupply situation in the large liquid crystal display (LCD) market during the third quarter of the year, with a US research firm forecasting that equilibrium will be attained by the beginning of the fourth quarter. A liquid crystal display (LCD) is a type of flat panel display technology that is commonly used in computer monitors, television screens, and other devices, including smartphones, tablets, and even some high-end automotive displays. The significant advantages of LCDs include their thin, lightweight form factor, energy efficiency, and affordability, which have made them a popular choice among consumers for various applications. Excess supplies of large LCDs can be a result of various factors, some of which include: 1. Overproduction: Manufacturers might have overestimated the demand for large LCD panels and produced more units than required, leading to a surplus. This can cause prices to drop as manufacturers scramble to sell the excess inventory. 2. Changes in technology: As new display technologies, such as OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) and microLED, are gaining popularity, the demand for older and less advanced technologies like LCD may decrease over time, again leading to an oversupply. 3. Market shifts: The consumer behavior and preferences for display devices can be unpredictable and may change quickly (e.g., growth in demand for larger displays during the pandemic when people were spending more time at home). An unexpected shift can cause inventory levels to rise more than anticipated. 4. Competition: Increased competition among display manufacturers can result in overproduction as companies try to gain market share by producing more LCD panels in a shorter period. The forecast by the US research firm indicates that the excess supplies of large LCDs will peak in the third quarter of this year. However, they predict that the market forces will work themselves out, and the supply-demand balance will be attained by the beginning of the fourth quarter. This equilibrium can be achieved through various factors, such as: 1. Adjustments in production: Manufacturers may reduce their production capacity or pause the manufacturing process to address the oversupply. 2. Price drops: Lower prices can spur demand and help clear excess inventory. 3. New applications: LCD manufacturers can explore innovative new applications and markets for their products, driving up demand and reducing the surplus. 4. Consolidation: Mergers and acquisitions in the industry can lead to a more balanced production landscape, thereby reducing the likelihood of an oversupply in the market. In conclusion, the article highlights the temporary challenges faced by the large liquid crystal display (LCD) market as it experiences an excess supply situation, causing disruptions in pricing and forcing manufacturers to adapt their strategies. The US research firm's forecast provides some optimism that equilibrium will be achieved by the fourth quarter of the year, allowing the market to stabilize and continue on a more sustainable path."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It took weeks to transverse the prairie but the mountain took mere days, since the","output":"pass was narrow and relatively easy to navigate. The journey through the mountain proved to be one of the smoothest parts of our entire expedition. Here's how we approached each step to ensure a successful passage. Step 1: Gathering information about the pass We started by talking to locals, experienced guides, and other travelers about the mountain pass. Collecting as much information as possible helped us make informed decisions about the route and potential challenges we might face. This also allowed us to adequately prepare ourselves for the conditions we'd experience during this part of the journey. Step 2: Ensuring proper equipment and supplies Before setting off into the mountains, we made sure that everyone in the group had the necessary gear for the journey, such as warm clothing, sturdy boots, and climbing equipment. Additionally, we stocked up on food, water, and other essentials to sustain us for the duration of our trek through the pass. Step 3: Agreeing on a pace and travel schedule Setting a realistic pace and daily schedule allowed us to stay on track and avoid rushing, which could be dangerous on some of the narrower and steeper paths. By taking regular breaks and setting up camp well before nightfall, we ensured that our group was well-rested and ready to tackle the challenges of the mountain trails. Step 4: Regularly checking weather conditions The weather in the mountains can change suddenly and without warning. By staying abreast of the local weather patterns, we were able to make informed decisions about when to proceed and when to pause our journey due to inclement weather. This helped us avoid getting caught in sudden storms or dangerous conditions. Step 5: Maintaining clear communication Throughout the trek, we emphasized the importance of clear communication within the group. This ensured that everyone was aware of any potential hazards or obstacles, and allowed the team to effectively cooperate in overcoming challenges along the way. Step 6: Adapting the plan as needed We understood the importance of being flexible and adapting our plan as needed. For example, if an unforeseen obstacle made our original path impassable, we discussed alternative routes that could be taken to safely reach our destination. By taking a step-by-step approach, and making careful decisions along the way, we were able to traverse the mountain pass in just a few days. We emerged on the other side, grateful for the breathtaking views and the valuable experiences that had shaped and strengthened our team."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are approximately 70,000 known species of vertebrates, and they can be found in various habitats, from the deep sea to the highest mountains. Vertebrates are usually divided into five major classes: 1. Mammals (Class Mammalia): This class includes humans, along with a diverse array of creatures, such as cows, dogs, bats, and whales. All mammals have a spinal column, and they are characterized by features like having hair or fur, giving birth to live young (in most cases), and having mammary glands. 2. Birds (Class Aves): Birds are warm-blooded vertebrates characterized by their beaks, feathers, and unique skeletal adaptations for flight. Examples include eagles, sparrows, and penguins. All birds possess a spinal column. 3. Reptiles (Class Reptilia): Reptiles are a group of cold-blooded vertebrates that lay eggs (except some snakes and lizards) and have skin covered in scales. Examples include turtles, snakes, lizards, and crocodiles. Reptiles also have a spinal column. 4. Amphibians (Class Amphibia): Amphibians are cold-blooded vertebrates that usually have an aquatic larval stage and a terrestrial adult stage. They often have moist, permeable skin and include animals like frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts. Like other vertebrates, they too have a spinal column. 5. Fish (Classes Agnatha, Chondrichthyes, and Osteichthyes): Fish are aquatic, gill-bearing vertebrates that can be found in various habitats, from freshwater to saltwater environments. Examples include sharks, eels, and salmon. Fish also possess a spinal column. In conclusion, the right answer to the question \\"what has a spinal column?\\" is not just \\"humans,\\" but all vertebrates, which encompass a vast and diverse array of animals in classes such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The fifth Beatle is an informal title that various commentators in the press and entertainment industry have applied to people who were at one point a member of the Beatles, or who had a strong association with the \\"Fab Four\\" (John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison, and Ringo Starr) during the group's existence. The \\"fifth Beatle\\" claims first appeared in the press immediately upon the band's rise to global fame in 1963-64. The members have offered their own beliefs of the \\"fifth Beatle\\": Lennon was critical of individuals who claimed credit for the Beatles' success, including the individual Beatles themselves, saying in his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, \\"I'm not the Beatles. I'm me. George Martin produced nearly all of the Beatles' recordings (except for the Let It Be album, produced by Phil Spector, and the songs \\"Real Love\\" and \\"Free as a Bird,\\" produced by Jeff Lynne) and wrote the instrumental score for the Yellow Submarine film and soundtrack album, and the string and horn (and even some vocal) arrangements for almost all of their songs (with the famous exception of Spector's re-production on Let It Be, and \\"She's Leaving Home\\", which was arranged by Mike Leander). His arrangement of the string octet backing for \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" was widely noted.  Martin's extensive musical training (which he received at the Guildhall School of Music) and sophisticated guidance in the studio are often credited as fundamental contributions to the work of the Beatles; he was without question a key part of the synergy responsible for transforming a good rock-and-roll group into the most celebrated popular musicians of their era. Writer Ian MacDonald noted that Martin was one of the few record producers in the UK at the time who possessed the sensitivity the Beatles needed to develop their songwriting and recording talent. Martin's piano playing also appears on several of their tracks, including \\"Misery\\" and \\"In My Life\\". Martin himself deflected claims of being the \\"fifth Beatle\\" to Beatles' manager Brian Epstein. In 2006, Martin inadvertently strengthened his image as the \\"fifth Beatle\\" by contributing the only piece of new music on the Love soundtrack: a string arrangement on top of George Harrison's solo acoustic demo of \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" from Anthology 3.  Lennon disparaged Martin's importance to the Beatles' music. In his 1970 interview with Jann Wenner, Lennon said, \\"[Dick James is] another one of those people, who think they made us. They didn't. I'd like to hear Dick James' music and I'd like to hear George Martin's music, please, just play me some.\\" In a 1971 letter to Paul McCartney, Lennon wrote, \\"When people ask me questions about 'What did George Martin really do for you?,' I have only one answer, 'What does he do now?' I noticed you had no answer for that! It's not a putdown, it's the truth.\\" Lennon wrote that Martin took too much credit for the Beatles' music. Commenting specifically on Revolution 9, Lennon said, \\"For Martin to state that he was 'painting a sound picture' is pure hallucination. Ask any of the other people involved. The final editing Yoko and I did alone.\\" In a tribute to George Martin after his death, Paul McCartney said \\"If anyone earned the title of the fifth Beatle, it was George. From the day that he gave The Beatles our first recording contract, to the last time I saw him, he was the most generous, intelligent and musical person I've ever had the pleasure to know.\\"  Julian Lennon called him \\"The Fifth Beatle, without question\\".

Apple far decided to start an agroforestry system and other methods to protect their depleted soils, while Pear farm did nothing and had big losses the following years.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farm didn't help stabilize the soil?  Hint: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth: Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is Pear farm that did not take any steps to stabilize or protect their depleted soils. Apple farm, on the other hand, implemented an agroforestry system and employed other methods to address the issue of soil depletion and erosion. By not adopting measures like agroforestry, Pear farm left their soil vulnerable to continued degradation and erosion. The lack of protective groundcover plants, such as naturally growing grasses that are present in agroforestry systems, led to the deterioration of soil quality and stability, resulting in significant losses for the farm in the following years. In contrast, Apple farm decided to take proactive measures by integrating an agroforestry system and utilizing other soil protection methods to improve the overall health and stability of their soil. By doing so, they enhanced soil cover and prevented further erosion. These practices not only helped to maintain a more stable soil structure but also provided additional benefits such as cleaner water by reducing nutrient and soil surface runoff. Through the incorporation of agroforestry and other protective measures, Apple farm managed to create a more sustainable agricultural system with less nutrient loss and healthier soil. Their efforts contributed positively to the overall plant growth and productivity of their farmland. In conclusion, Pear farm is the one that didn't help stabilize their depleted soil, as they failed to implement any protective measures or adopt sustainable practices like their neighboring farm, Apple farm, did. This lack of action on Pear farm's part led to continued soil degradation, erosion, and significant losses in the years that followed."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Jake always tills his land, while Todd uses he no-tillage method.  But I can use this background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted.  What is an answer for this question: Which farmer used fewer chemicals for pest control? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine which farmer, Jake or Todd, used fewer chemicals for pest control. While no-till farming (like Todd's method) can lead to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control due to increased presence of pathogens, insects, and weeds, it also promotes larger predator populations for biological control. Therefore, the actual use of chemicals would depend on individual farm conditions and pest management choices by each farmer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:-  The star does not have enough mass to become a neutron star - The star goes through a change in its core and bonds helium to carbon and oxygen - The star becomes a red giant - A mass of carbon and oxygen builds up in the center of the star - The star sheds its outside layers and becomes a nebula - The star leaves behind the core which becomes a dwarf star.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step in the process of a star evolving into a dwarf star is the main sequence phase, during which a star achieves a state of balance between gravitational forces pulling its matter inward and the outward pressure produced by nuclear fusion.  To provide more context, let's examine the complete process in detail: 1. Nebula formation: Stars initially form from vast clouds of gas and dust called nebulae, primarily composed of hydrogen gas. Over millions of years, the forces of gravity cause these clouds to contract and become denser, leading to the formation of a protostar. 2. Main sequence phase: As pressure and temperature increase within the protostar, nuclear fusion begins, wherein hydrogen atoms combine to form helium, releasing tremendous amounts of energy in the process. This energy counteracts the gravitational forces, and a balance is achieved, marking the beginning of the main sequence phase. This is the point at which a star becomes stable and spends most of its life. 3. Star becomes a red giant: As the hydrogen fuel in the core depletes, the core contracts and heats up, causing the outer layers of the star to expand and cool. This transition marks the star's phase as a red giant. 4. Helium fusion and creation of heavier elements: In the core of the red giant, helium undergoes nuclear fusion, forming heavier elements like carbon and oxygen. The production of these elements occurs through the triple-alpha process, in which three helium nuclei combine to create a carbon nucleus, with oxygen being formed by the fusion of additional helium nuclei with carbon. 5. Sheds its outer layers: Once the red giant has exhausted its helium fuel, its outer layers are expelled, leaving a planetary nebula. The material that it sheds contributes to the cosmic enrichment of elements. 6. Formation of a dwarf star: What remains after the shedding of the outer layers is the core, consisting of carbon and oxygen. This core eventually cools and contracts, forming a white dwarf, which is the final stage of evolution for a low- to medium-mass star. This white dwarf will continue to cool over billions of years before eventually becoming a black dwarf - a hypothetical, cold, dark remnant of a star. In summary, the first step in the process of a star evolving into a dwarf star is the main sequence phase, which initiates the star's life cycle and eventually leads to its transformation into a red giant and later, a white dwarf."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Alonzo Knowles hacked email accounts, from the Bahamas, to steal the images and scripts, which he tried to sell. Knowles used viruses and fake security notifications to obtain passwords. He was caught when he travelled to the US to sell stolen scripts not knowing that he was meeting undercover police officers. The US Department of Justice said Knowles had had a list of the email addresses and phone numbers of 130 celebrities, including actors, musicians and others, that he sought to steal from. Knowles stole 25 unreleased film and TV show scripts as well as banking details and intimate images and videos. In December 2015, law enforcement agencies were alerted to his hacking campaign by a radio show presenter who Knowles approached trying to sell one of the stolen scripts. When contacted by undercover agents, Knowles boasted he had many more scripts to offer worth \\"hundreds of thousands of dollars\\". One stolen script was for a biographical film about rapper Tupac Shakur, who died in 1996, called All Eyez on Me. The sentence for hacking the accounts was more than double the usual amount, said Judge Paul Engelmayer, because Knowles had been shown to be \\"devoid of remorse\\". Emails Knowles sent while in prison that were read in court revealed his plan to write a book exposing more of the secrets he stole.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If there is an increase in acid in the air, it will lead to MORE damage caused by acid rain. This increase in air acidity will intensify the overall effects of acid rain on the environment. Concerning the second effect mentioned, the increased air acidity will lead to a greater rate of aluminum absorption from the soil into the water. This will occur because the higher concentration of acid in the rainwater will cause more soil acidification, which in turn increases the solubility of aluminum. As a result, more aluminum will be released into lakes, streams, and other water bodies. The elevated levels of aluminum in water can be toxic to aquatic life, including fish and their eggs. As more fish species are affected, the disruption to the aquatic ecosystem will worsen, leading to a decrease in biodiversity and possible local extinctions. Increased aluminum levels can also be harmful to other organisms, such as frogs and plants, which also contribute to the imbalance in the ecosystem. In summary, an increase in acid in the air would lead to more severe consequences caused by acid rain, including a greater absorption of aluminum from soil into water bodies. This will, in turn, result in more significant and widespread damage to aquatic ecosystems and the overall environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. The answer is:","output":"No, the answer provided does not address the question about when America was pioneered. The information given in the answer focuses on the geographical and climatic features of the United States, and while it might be interesting, it is not relevant to the question asked.  A more appropriate response would be to discuss when America was pioneered in terms of early European exploration and settlement. It is important to note that indigenous people have inhabited America for thousands of years. However, the term \\"pioneered\\" often refers to the explorations and settlements by Europeans in the Americas. In the context of European exploration and colonization, Christopher Columbus's first voyage in 1492 is often noted as the beginning of America's pioneering era. Columbus's journey, funded by the Spanish monarchy, led to greater awareness of the American continents among Europeans. However, the Norse explorer Leif Erikson is believed to have reached North America five centuries before Columbus, around A.D. 1000. As for the territory that would eventually become the United States, the pioneering period continued throughout the 16th and 17th centuries, with different European nations setting up colonies. For example, the Spanish established St. Augustine in Florida in 1565, and the English founded Jamestown in Virginia in 1607. The French also made various attempts to colonize the Americas throughout the 17th century. More settlements were founded in the following decades, culminating in the establishment of the 13 British colonies along the eastern seaboard of North America by the early 18th century. The pioneering period continued with westward expansion during the 18th and 19th centuries, as more territories were explored, settled, and eventually incorporated into the United States. In summary, the given answer is incorrect, as it does not address when America was pioneered. A more accurate response would discuss the periods of European exploration and settlement spanning from the late 15th century to the 19th century."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

For example, there’s no need to do damage control on your friendship if you discover he likes someone else!  Once both of your feelings are out in the open, you are able to decide how to proceed. In other words, don’t betray your friend by blabbing to your crush about her. She may like him and she may be hurt — but that doesn’t mean he needs to know that. Talk to your crush about your own feelings, and let your friend keep hers private if she wishes. Your friend will be hurt and embarrassed if she discovers you’ve been airing her dirty laundry to a boy she has feelings for.  A good rule of thumb is to simply speak for yourself. Talk only about your own feelings and desires, not anyone else’s. If the feelings are mutual and you want to proceed with a relationship, take your time. Let your friend adjust to the idea of you two being together before you change your Facebook status and start bringing him as a date to everything.

It's Evanescence-type dreck with an orchestra. Silly people creating really silly music. Answer: A:","output":"Based on a thorough analysis of the given product review, it can be concluded that it carries a predominantly negative tone. There are a number of indicators supporting this conclusion, which will be elaborated upon in the following explanation. Firstly, the review mention that the author doesn't know \\"what the reviewers are carrying on about here,\\" suggesting that they do not agree with or understand the positive opinions of others who have reviewed the product. The use of the word \\"carrying on\\" implies that the author sees these positive opinions as exaggerated and perhaps undeserved, further highlighting their disagreement with such sentiments. Moreover, the review describes the music as \\"Evanescence-type dreck with an orchestra.\\" The term \\"dreck\\" carries a negative connotation, as it is often used to refer to something of poor quality, tasteless, or undesirable. By comparing the music to Evanescence, the author may be suggesting that they view the music as derivative or unoriginal, which can also be interpreted as a negative sentiment. Combining these two descriptors certainly reinforces the negative tone of the review. In addition to these observations, the review refers to the people involved in the creation of the music as \\"silly people creating really silly music.\\" The repeated use of the word \\"silly\\" suggests frivolousness and lack of seriousness, indicating that the author does not view the music as having significant artistic value or merit. This derogatory characterization of both the creators and their product further strengthens the negative tone of the review. In conclusion, the overall tone of the product review can be determined as predominantly negative, based on the language and descriptors used by the author. They express disagreement with other reviewers' opinions, use negative terms to describe the music, and criticize the creators as being \\"silly.\\" As a result, their disapproval and negative feelings towards the product are unmistakable."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pokud lampa nesouhlasí s designem interiéru nebo poutá pozornost způsobem, který považujete za neatraktivní, pak je pravděpodobné, že považujete její umístění za hloupé. 2. Funkce: Umístění lampy by mělo být praktické a efektivní. Pokud například lampa osvětluje pouze malou část místnosti nebo nedostatečně osvětluje účelovou oblast, pak je možné, že její umístění není vhodné. Také pokud zasahuje do chodníku nebo blokuje výhled z okna, může to být považováno za chybu. 3. Bezpečnost: Bezpečnost by měla být vždy prioritou při umístění osvětlení. Pokud je lampa umístěna na místě, kde může být snadno stržena nebo způsobit risk zranění, je to určitě špatné rozhodnutí. 4. Úspora energie a životní prostředí: Udržitelnost a ekologie jsou důležité aspekty při návrhu interiérů. Pokud lampa spotřebovává více energie, než je potřeba, nebo pokud je umístěna na místě, které generuje nepřiměřené množství tepla nebo oslnění, pak také její umístění může být považováno za hloupé. 5. Dostupnost: Při umístění lampy by měla být zohledněna snadná přístupnost k ovládacím prvkům, ať už jde o vypínač nebo tlačítko na samotné lampě. Pokud je lampa umístěna na místě, kde je těžké ji zapnout nebo vypnout, je to také ukazatel špatného rozhodnutí.

Mrs. Cadicamo did a very brave thing. She called a special phone number, 911, which is the number we call when we need help from police officers. Police officers are people who make sure everyone is safe and follow the rules. When the police officers arrived at their house, they searched all around the inside, and they discovered that Victor had hidden many dangerous things in their home. They found not one, not two, but five scary tools called firearms and a big long stick called a rifle. What they found next was even scarier: two round things called pipe bombs, which are very dangerous and can hurt a lot of people when they explode. The police officers took all the dangerous things away from the house, so Mrs. Cadicamo and her family would be safe again. Thanks to Mrs. Cadicamo's bravery in calling 911, police officers were able to protect her and make sure that no one got hurt by those scary things hidden in their home. The story shows how important it is to be brave and ask for help when we are in trouble or something is making us feel unsafe. Just like Mrs. Cadicamo, we can make sure our family and friends are safe by reaching out to people who can help us, like the police officers. So, always remember to dial 911 when you need help!"},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Ashkenazi Jews, also known as Ashkenazic Jews or simply Ashkenazim (Hebrew: ash@k@'nazi'ym, Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation: [,aSk@'nazim], singular: [,aSk@'nazi], Modern Hebrew: [aSkena'zim, aSkena'zi]; also y@hv'dey ash@k@'naz Y'hudey Ashkenaz), are a Jewish diaspora population who coalesced as a distinct community in the Holy Roman Empire around the end of the first millennium. The traditional diaspora language of Ashkenazi Jews is Yiddish (a Germanic language which incorporates several dialects), with Hebrew used only as a sacred language until relatively recently. Throughout their time in Europe, Ashkenazim have made many important contributions to philosophy, scholarship, literature, art, music and science. Ashkenazim originate from the Jews who settled along the Rhine River, in Western Germany and in Northern France. The name Ashkenazi derives from the biblical figure of Ashkenaz, the first son of Gomer, son of Japhet, son of Noah, and a Japhetic patriarch in the Table of Nations (Genesis 10). The name of Gomer has often been linked to the ethnonym Cimmerians. Biblical Ashkenaz is usually derived from Assyrian Askuza (cuneiform Askuzai/Iskuzai), a people who expelled the Cimmerians from the Armenian area of the Upper Euphrates, whose name is usually associated with the name of the Scythians. The intrusive n in the Biblical name is likely due to a scribal error confusing a waw v with a nun n.  In Jeremiah 51:27, Ashkenaz figures as one of three kingdoms in the far north, the others being Minni and Ararat, perhaps corresponding to Urartu, called on by God to resist Babylon.  In the Yoma tractate of the Babylonian Talmud the name Gomer is rendered as Germania, which elsewhere in rabbinical literature was identified with Germanikia in northwestern Syria, but later became associated with Germania. Ashkenaz is linked to Scandza/Scanzia, viewed as the cradle of Germanic tribes, as early as a 6th-century gloss to the Historia Ecclesiastica of Eusebius. In the 10th-century History of Armenia of Yovhannes Drasxanakertc'i (1.15) Ashkenaz was associated with Armenia, as it was occasionally in Jewish usage, where its denotation extended at times to Adiabene, Khazaria, Crimea and areas to the east. His contemporary Saadia Gaon identified Ashkenaz with the Saquliba or Slavic territories, and such usage covered also the lands of tribes neighboring the Slavs, and Eastern and Central Europe. In modern times, Samuel Krauss identified the Biblical \\"Ashkenaz\\" with Khazaria.  Sometime in the early medieval period, the Jews of central and eastern Europe came to be called by this term. Conforming to the custom of designating areas of Jewish settlement with biblical names, Spain was denominated Sefarad (Obadiah 20), France was called Tsarefat (1 Kings 17:9), and Bohemia was called the Land of Canaan. By the high medieval period, Talmudic commentators like Rashi began to use Ashkenaz/Eretz Ashkenaz to designate Germany, earlier known as Loter, where, especially in the Rhineland communities of Speyer, Worms and Mainz, the most important Jewish communities arose. Rashi uses leshon Ashkenaz (Ashkenazi language) to describe German speech, and Byzantium and Syrian Jewish letters referred to the Crusaders as Ashkenazim. Given the close links between the Jewish communities of France and Germany following the Carolingian unification, the term Ashkenazi came to refer to both the Jews of medieval Germany and France.

The most common form of oxymoron involves an adjective--noun combination of two words, but they can also be devised in the meaning of sentences or phrases. One classic example of the use of oxymorons in English literature can be found in this example from Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, where Romeo strings together thirteen in a row: do oxymorons have to be next to each other?","output":"No, oxymorons do not always have to be placed directly next to each other to be effective. An oxymoron is a figure of speech where two contradictory or opposites words or ideas are combined to create a unique, paradoxical concept, often for emphasis or poetic expression. Although the most common form of oxymoron consists of an adjective-noun combination (e.g., \\"deafening silence,\\" \\"bittersweet\\"), oxymorons can also be created through phrases or even sentences. The essential feature of an oxymoron is the presence of contrasting elements that bring thought-provoking and expressive depth to its meaning rather than a requirement for the words to be in immediate proximity. Therefore, oxymorons can be spread out through a phrase or sentence while maintaining their effect. This can be seen in various literary works, including Shakespeare's plays and modern literature, where oxymorons are often employed to delicately convey complex emotions, situations, or descriptions. For instance, in the previously mentioned example from Romeo and Juliet, we see the use of several oxymorons. However, they are not presented as simple adjective-noun pairs; some of them are found within phrases, such as \\"feather of lead.\\" In this case, the oxymoron is distributed over several words while still evoking the contradictory juxtaposition of lightness and heaviness as a metaphor for Romeo's emotional turmoil. It is important to note that the key to identifying an oxymoron lies in the internal contradiction that the pairing creates—even when the words are not directly adjacent. When two or more contrasting words come together to produce an intentionally illogical, contradictory, or thought-provoking concept, you have an oxymoron, irrespective of whether they are placed next to each other or spaced out within a larger phrase or sentence. In summary, the essence of oxymorons lies in their ability to create a paradoxical or contradictory meaning rather than in their physical positioning within a text. Consequently, while many oxymorons consist of directly adjacent adjective-noun combinations, the crucial characteristic of an oxymoron is the contrast it presents, which can be achieved even when the contradicting words or ideas are not placed immediately next to each other."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Paragraph: When American 11 struck the World Trade Center at 8:46, no one in the White House or traveling with the President knew that it had been hijacked. While that information circulated within the FAA, we found no evidence that the hijacking was reported to any other agency in Washington before 8:46. Most federal agencies learned about the crash in New York from CNN. Within the FAA, the administrator, Jane Garvey, and her acting deputy, Monte Belger, had not been told of a confirmed hijacking before they learned from television that a plane had crashed. Others in the agency were aware of it, as we explained earlier in this chapter. Inside the National Military Command Center, the deputy director of operations and his assistant began notifying senior Pentagon officials of the incident. At about 9:00, the senior NMCC operations officer reached out to the FAA operations center for information. Although the NMCC was advised of the hijacking of American 11, the scrambling of jets was not discussed. In Sarasota, Florida, the presidential motorcade was arriving at the Emma E. Booker Elementary School, where President Bush was to read to a class and talk about education. White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card told us he was standing with the President outside the classroom when Senior Advisor to the President Karl Rove first informed them that a small, twin-engine plane had crashed into the World Trade Center. The President's reaction was that the incident must have been caused by pilot error. At 8:55, before entering the classroom, the President spoke to National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice, who was at the White House. She recalled first telling the President it was a twin-engine aircraft-and then a commercial aircraft-that had struck the World Trade Center, adding \\"that's all we know right now, Mr. President.\\" At the White House, Vice President Dick Cheney had just sat down for a meeting when his assistant told him to turn on his television because a plane had struck the NorthTower of the World Trade Center. The Vice President was wondering \\"How the hell could a plane hit the World Trade Center\\" when he saw the second aircraft strike the South Tower. Elsewhere in the White House, a series of 9:00 meetings was about to begin. In the absence of information that the crash was anything other than an accident, the White House staff monitored the news as they went ahead with their regular schedules.

Esta cuestión finalmente se resolvió a mediados del siglo XV por Enrique IV, cuando se dictaminó que el área debía ser gobernada de acuerdo con las Ordenanzas que aplicaban a las comunidades de Álava. El conflicto surgió de un sentimiento de inconformidad por parte de las personas que vivían en el Valle con estar bajo el control de Burgos. Sentían que sus intereses y necesidades eran diferentes y deseaban tener un mayor control sobre su propio gobierno y legislación. Si bien se produjeron numerosos intentos de rebelión y negociación, la situación no se resolvió hasta la intervención de Enrique IV. Como rey, Enrique IV tenía la capacidad de tomar decisiones importantes y definitivas en relación con las cuestiones territoriales y de gobierno en su reino. Luego de examinar la disputa, tomó la decisión que el Valle debería ser gobernado en concordancia con las Ordenanzas que aplicaban a las comunidades de Álava. Con esto, la zona del Valle se separó de Burgos y comenzó a seguir un conjunto diferente de reglas y regulaciones, las cuales estaban más a tono con sus propias necesidades e intereses.

It highlights the need for measures to be taken at a European level and also emphasizes the significance of considering the principle of subsidiarity. The principle of subsidiarity is a key foundation in the EU, which states that decisions should be made at a lower, more localized level unless it can be effectively demonstrated that actions taken at a higher level, such as the European level, would yield better results. In this context, the statement recognizes that it is necessary for all 27 member states in the EU to adopt reforms that not only address shared European concerns but also cater to the unique needs and circumstances of each individual member state. Moreover, it suggests that the implementation of such reforms should be done with full consideration of the principle of subsidiarity, ensuring that decision-making processes involve a finely balanced approach between local and EU-wide action.  By emphasizing the need for reforms on both the European level and individual member state level, the statement underscores a comprehensive, cohesive approach toward tackling the challenges faced by the entire EU. This approach can ensure that reforms are effective and capable of catering to the diverse range of interests, priorities, and requirements present in the EU's vast geographical and political landscape.

A goatee is a versatile beard that can look good on many faces, though you may find another beard type that will look better on you. The starker the contrast, the more dramatic your goatee will appear. If the colors are close together, you may want to consider another kind of facial hair style if distinctive and noticeable is what you are going for. Traditionally, a goatee refers only to the hair that grows off your chin, which hangs down like that of a goat. There are other forms of beards that use hair on the chin, and are sometimes referred to as “goatees.” You’ll want to choose the one that best enhances your face, and that you are best prepared to take care of. Look through magazines and websites for pictures of goatee variations that you might want to experiment with. This is a goatee with a disconnected mustache. When wearing a Van Dyke, the rest of your cheeks should be completely shaved and smooth. If you grow a Van Dyke, you’ll want to take special care that it stays trim, as it looks better when the beard is more defined. This is a goatee connected to a mustache that grows in a circle around your mouth. This is a fuller beard, but not so much that it covers your whole face. A circle beard is a great choice for a man with a softer jaw line, or if you have a squarish face or jaw. Because it has a lot of hair, a circle beard can also help to cover up skin breakouts. This look combines a goatee with a Hungarian mustache. This is a more labor intensive beard, but definitely a distinctive one. With a Musketeer, you’ll want to keep your goatee trim, but let it grow a little longer down your chin. Because of the thickness, you’ll want to use some wax or conditioner to help the hair keep its shape. Summary:","output":"A goatee is a versatile beard style suitable for those with a weak chin or rounder face, as it can help provide definition and shape. There are various forms of goatees, including the traditional goatee, Van Dyke, circle beard, and the Musketeer. The traditional goatee refers only to the hair on the chin, while the Van Dyke is a goatee with a disconnected mustache; both require clean-shaven cheeks. The circle beard connects the mustache and the goatee, making it suitable for those with softer jawlines or squarish faces. The Musketeer combines a goatee with a Hungarian mustache and needs more maintenance due to its thickness. To find the best goatee style for you, consider factors such as facial structure, hair color contrast, and maintenance requirements, and browse through magazines and websites for inspiration."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: If you see policemen outside wearing safety vest and holding flashlights, what are they doing? - corner thief - help - searching in dark - direct traffic - hurry along  The best answer is A:","output":"direct traffic"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Sahih al-Bukhari narrates Muhammad describing the revelations as, \\"Sometimes it is (revealed) like the ringing of a bell\\" and Aisha reported, \\"I saw the Prophet being inspired Divinely on a very cold day and noticed the sweat dropping from his forehead (as the Inspiration was over).\\" Muhammad's first revelation, according to the Quran, was accompanied with a vision. The agent of revelation is mentioned as the \\"one mighty in power\\", the one who \\"grew clear to view when he was on the uppermost horizon. Then he drew nigh and came down till he was (distant) two bows' length or even nearer.\\" The Islamic studies scholar Welch states in the Encyclopaedia of Islam that he believes the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, because he was severely disturbed after these revelations. According to Welch, these seizures would have been seen by those around him as convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations. However, Muhammad's critics accused him of being a possessed man, a soothsayer or a magician since his experiences were similar to those claimed by such figures well known in ancient Arabia. Welch additionally states that it remains uncertain whether these experiences occurred before or after Muhammad's initial claim of prophethood.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Eating less food at night time is sensible advice for someone trying to lose weight. The reason often given is that if eat you too much food at night, the body will store all those excess kilojoules as fat because we’re inactive until the next day. The reason sounds plausible, but if it was one hundred percent true then world hunger could be solved by just feeding people one meal at night time. What really matters is how much is eaten over days and weeks for weight gain or weight loss, not so much when it is eaten. There is merit though in advice to eat less at night time as it can help a person to cut back on the total quantity of food eaten. Eating lots of food in the evening can also be a marker for unhealthy dietary habits, especially if much of that extra food is going to fuel couch surfing exploits. So even though advice to eat less at night time seems logical, it hasn’t actually been well tested by science to see how effective it can be for losing weight. Filling this gap, a short-term study involving 29 healthy men looked at how 2 weeks of restricted night time eating fared against 2 weeks of ‘normal’ evening eating. Advice on restricting night eating was very clear: avoid any food or drink containing kilojoules between the hours of 7 pm and 6 am the next morning. No other changes to the participants’ diet or lifestyle was required so each person was free to eat whatever they wished during the day time hours until early evening. Twenty seven of the twenty nine people complied with following this advice for 2 weeks as well as the 2 week control period. Eating at night a waistline hazard So did people eat less when restricting night time eating? Yes, equal to 1000 kilojoules (about 250 Calories) per day less than during their normal eating pattern. This small energy difference was enough to see the men lose 0.4 kg over the 2 week restriction period, and gain 0.6 kg over the 2 week control period. Question: What issue did the author want to address with participants of the study? Options:  A. to prove it doesn't matter when food is eaten, but it matters what type of foods are eaten  B. to change unhealthy dietary habits  C. To encourage men to get off the couch  D. not enough information A:","output":"The author wanted to address the issue of whether restricting night time eating affects overall weight loss (as deduced from the experimental setup and the question they aimed to answer: \\"So did people eat less when restricting night time eating?\\"). However, none of the provided options specifically states this. The closest option that could indirectly relate to the idea of testing the merit of restricting food intake at night, which could potentially contribute to changing dietary habits, is option B.

By Associated Press PUBLISHED: 19:09 EST, 12 March 2013 | UPDATED: 19:46 EST, 12 March 2013 A case involving an Air Force general who dismissed charges against a lieutenant colonel convicted of sexual assault will be reviewed at the top levels of the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said in a letter released on Monday. But it seems unlikely that the ruling would be changed. Hagel said that under military law, neither he nor the Air Force secretary has the authority to reverse Lt Gen Craig Franklin's decision to overturn the November conviction against Lt Col James Wilkerson, a former inspector general at Aviano Air Base in Italy.  OPTIONS: - Air Force was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Associated Press was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Aviano Air Base was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Chuck Hagel was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Craig Franklin was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Hagel was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Italy was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - James Wilkerson was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Pentagon was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. - Sen Barbara Boxer was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman.","output":"Lt Col James Wilkerson was convicted on November 2 by a military panel on charges of abusive sexual contact, aggravated sexual assault, and three instances of conduct unbecoming of an officer and a gentleman. Despite the conviction, Lt Gen Craig Franklin dismissed the charges, a decision that has sparked controversy and prompted the review by top Pentagon officials. As stated by Secretary Hagel, the issue at hand is that neither he nor the Air Force secretary has the authority to overturn Lt Gen Franklin's decision. This situation has led to widespread criticism and concerns about how the military handles and prosecutes sexual assault cases within its ranks. Some lawmakers, including Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., have called for changes in the military justice system that would prevent commanding officers from having the ability to overturn convictions or reduce sentences after a military panel has issued a verdict. In response to the case, the Pentagon has been urged to review and possibly reform its policies and procedures when dealing with cases of sexual assault. The need for a transparent and fair process has been emphasized, ensuring that those who commit such crimes are held accountable while also protecting the rights of the accused. The outcome of the review at the Pentagon is uncertain, but it is clear that the case of Lt Col James Wilkerson has brought the prevalent issue of sexual assault in the military to the forefront of public attention. It remains to be seen whether concrete changes to the military justice system will be enacted as a result, but this case may serve as a catalyst for further examination and potential reform."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Invincible Movie plot: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts.

He decides to prove his bravery by not moving once he sees the chief, Runi (Sessue Hayakawa) and telling his story. The Indians are impressed, and do not kill him. After a while, Runi's son Kua-ko (Henry Silva), who has lived with the missionaries of Caracas and speaks English, tells Abel that Runi has agreed so long as he does not harm them, they will not harm him. Abel agrees, and befriends Kua-ko, who tells him of the \\"Bird Woman\\", who killed his older brother, and that their tribe is not allowed in the nearby forest. Abel ignores the warning and ventures into the forest, where he sees a young woman (Audrey Hepburn) who quickly disappears. He returns to the Indians, and Kua-ko tells him that Runi wishes Abel to use his gun and kill the girl. He returns to the forest, but decides to warn the girl instead. He sees her again, but is bitten by a coral snake. The girl takes Abel to her home and tends his wound. Upon waking up, he meets the girl's grandfather, Nuflo (Lee J. Cobb), who tells him her name is Rima. The next day, with his leg wounded by the snake, Abel meets Rima again and they begin to talk. Rima takes a liking to him, but Nuflo warns her that he will leave once his leg heals. Abel is soon able to walk without a cane, and Rima therefore begins showing him the forest. Abel tells her that he has come to like her as well, and Rima is confused. She goes to speak with her dead mother's spirit, and decides to return to where she came from to ask a village elder about her strange new feelings for Abel. Later, Abel and Rima travel to the edge of the forest, where he shows her Riolama, which she remembers as her village.

Question 1: Is eating rice good if I want a six-pack? What is the diet for a six-pack? Question 2: Can I get a six pack without sticking to a certain diet? If so, how? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Before I address each question individually, let us understand the concept of obtaining a six-pack. Developing a six-pack primarily involves building and defining the abdominal muscles, which requires consistent exercise and a healthy, balanced diet. While specific dietary choices can influence your progress, it is important to maintain a healthy balance for overall well-being. Question 1:  Step 1: Determine if rice is good for individuals wanting a six-pack.  Rice is a source of carbohydrates, and carbohydrates are an essential macronutrient for providing energy. Since whole grains and complex carbohydrates are better for maintaining stable blood sugar levels and preventing hunger, brown rice would be the preferable option in this case. Step 2: Propose a diet for a six-pack. A six-pack diet should be balanced and focus on macronutrients like protein, carbohydrates, and healthy fats, as well as overall caloric intake. This includes: - Lean proteins: Chicken, fish, tofu, beans, and legumes. - Complex carbohydrates: Brown rice, whole grains, sweet potatoes, and quinoa. - Vegetables: Leafy greens, broccoli, and bell peppers. - Healthy fats: Avocado, nuts, and olive oil. - Water: Keep hydrated by drinking plenty of water. Question 2: Step 1: Determine if a six-pack can be a achieved without sticking to a certain diet. While diet plays a crucial role in developing a six-pack and improving overall body composition, it is possible to achieve a six-pack without adhering to a strict diet plan. It would, however, likely take longer and the results might not be as well-defined. Step 2: Suggest methods for achieving a six-pack without a specific diet. To achieve a six-pack without following a specific diet, you must have a consistent exercise routine, especially focusing on core strengthening and abdominal workouts. Incorporate cardio and resistance training as well to support muscle growth and reduce body fat. Now, let me address if the answers to these two questions are the same. The answers to both questions are related but not the same. The first question addresses eating rice and a diet for obtaining a six-pack, while the second question pertains to the possibility of achieving a six-pack without strict dietary guidelines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alternating current will flow through a capacitor until the source of the current is removed. That current can add to the shock you'll get if you mishandle the capacitor, and may keep recharging it. Explanation: The question asks us to continue the paragraph about discharging a capacitor, which is a safety procedure to avoid the risk of electric shock. Answer III is the best choice as it explains the flow of alternating current through a capacitor and the potential risks associated with it. I. Intact capacitors are very likely to have an electrical discharge if the capacitor is not connected. Inspect the capacitor before removing it from the circuit. This answer is incorrect because it focuses on inspecting the capacitor before removing it rather than on the process of discharging a capacitor. II. Fix any problems while running a circuit. When running an circuit, a capacitor does not supply current to the items in it. This option is incorrect as it discusses fixing problems while running a circuit, which is unrelated to discharging a capacitor. IV. Turn off all electricity to the device after removing the capacitor. Attach and hold the capacitor at a 90 ° angle with an insulated insulation board. This answer is incorrect as it suggests turning off electricity after removing the capacitor, which is not a safe way to discharge a capacitor and can cause unnecessary risks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is yes. Lightning is a form of static discharge. It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below.

By Ap Reporter PUBLISHED: 16:24 EST, 17 September 2013 | UPDATED: 05:32 EST, 18 September 2013 The devastating fire that engulfed part of a Jersey shore boardwalk and dozens of businesses was caused by wiring that was damaged by Hurricane Sandy. The Seaside Park, New Jersey boardwalk emerged relatively unscathed from the October 29 storm compared to its neighbor Seaside Heights. But Sandy left her indelible mark after all, last Thursday when a raging fire blazed through 80 buildings across three blocks of the resort town. The fire began at a frozen custard stand, where aged wiring that had been compromised by salt water and sand sparked what would eventually become an inferno, federal and county investigators said at a Tuesday news conference. Catching a break: A 25-foot fire break was smashed into the boardwalk near where Seaside Park meets OPTIONS: - Ap, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park - Frozen Custard, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park - Hurricane Sandy, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park - Jersey shore, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park - Kohr, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park - New Jersey, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park - Sandy, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park - Seaside Heights, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park - Seaside Park, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park","output":"- Seaside Heights, largely sparing the neighboring town from the fire that ravaged Seaside Park The other options are incorrect because they do not make logical sense in the context of the passage.

Question: Where does Quasimodo lives inside his entire life? Title: The Hunchback of Notre Dame Movie plot: Quasimodo being offered water by Esmeralda. The story is set in Paris in 1482. Quasimodo is a deaf, half-blind, hunchbacked bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. His master Jehan, the evil brother of Notre Dame's saintly archdeacon Don Claudio, prevails upon the hunchback to kidnap the fair Esmeralda, a dancing gypsy girl (and the adopted daughter of Clopin, the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris' underworld). The dashing Captain Phoebus rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees. At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square. After being whipped, he begs for water. Esmeralda pities him, and brings him some. To their dismay, Jehan and Clopin both learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by King Louis XI. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt. Clopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet Pierre Gringoire to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Before Phoebus arrives, he is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Don Claudio grants her sanctuary.     Don Claudio restrains Quasimodo from violence. Later that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus's dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force. Quasimodo holds off the invaders with rocks...

Question: Information:  - Norse mythology is the body of mythology of the North Germanic people stemming from Norse paganism and continuing after the Christianization of Scandinavia and into the Scandinavian folklore of the modern period. The northernmost extension of Germanic mythology, Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition.  - In Norse mythology , Baugi is a giant . He is the son of Gilling , brother of Suttungr and paternal uncle of Gunnlöð . Baugi is attested to in Skáldskaparmál in Snorri 's Prose Edda , and does not appear in other texts . Due to his absence in other relevant mythological texts , numerous scholars have argued that Baugi either comes from a source that is not extant today or was an invention of Snorri 's , accidental or intentional .  - Germanic mythology consists of the body of myths native to the Germanic peoples. Commonly featuring narratives focused on Germanic deities and a large variety of other entities, Germanic mythology dates from the Proto-Germanic period and reaches beyond the Christianization of the Germanic peoples and into modern Germanic folklore. Germanic mythology includes Norse mythology, Anglo-Saxon mythology, and Continental Germanic mythology.  - Mythology refers variously to the collected myths of a group of people or to the study of such myths. Myths are the stories people tell to explain nature, history and customs.  - In Norse mythology, Suttungr was a \\"jötunn\\", a son of Gilling, who (along with Suttungr's mother) had been murdered by Fjalar and Galar.  - The jötunn (anglicized jotunn or jotun, plural jötnar , or ; Old Norse jtunn , Icelandic jötunn ; often glossed as \\"giant\\" or \\"ettin\\") are a mythological race that live in Jötunheimr, one of the nine worlds of Norse cosmology. They were banished there by the Æsir who refused them entry to their world, Asgard. The Jötnar can be seen throughout Norse mythology. They frequently interact with the Æsir, as well as the Vanir. They are usually in opposition to, or in competition with them, but also interact with them in a non-hostile manner. Some Jötnar even intermarry with the Æsir and Vanir, and many are named as parents or grandparents of Æsir such as Thor and Odin. This very complex relationship between these two comparable races develops most notably in the Prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, ultimately making it difficult to distinguish them from the more familiar Norse gods.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve this math problem Solve 0 = -85*w + 15*w - 3020 + 3510 for w.","output":"Alright, let's break this problem down.  1. First, let's add all the terms with \\"w\\" and the constant terms separately. We know that \\"-85w\\" and \\"15w\\" are like terms (terms with the same variable), so we can add them together: -85w + 15w equals \\"-70w\\".  2. Similarly, \\"-3020\\" and \\"3510\\" are like terms (just plain old numbers) as well, so you can add them together. When we subtract 3020 from 3510, we get \\"490\\".  3. So now, our equation is \\"0 = -70w + 490\\". 4. Next, to solve for 'w', we want to isolate 'w'. We need to move \\"+ 490\\" from the right of the equals sign to the left. Remember, doing something to one side of the equation means we have to do the same thing to the other side. So if we subtract 490 from the right side we have to subtract 490 on the left side too. This means we subtract 490 from both sides, we get \\"-490 = -70w\\". 5. Now we have \\"-490 = -70w\\". The final step is to remove \\"-70\\" from the right side of the \\"=\\" sign. Because \\"-70\\" is being multiplied by \\"w\\", we do the opposite to get rid of it, which is dividing. So if we divide \\"-490\\" by \\"-70\\", we get \\"7\\".  So, the answer to your question \\"w\\" is \\"7\\".  Imagine you have 70 apples happily hanging out with their friend w. Suddenly, they got separated and couldn't hang out with 'w' anymore, causing sadness (minus 490). To make them happy again and bring back their friend 'w', you need to spread the sadness (minus 490) among all 70 apples. When you do this (dividing -490 by -70), you find out that you need 7 happy things (maybe candies) to offset each apple's sadness and bring back their friend 'w'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Areas of Expertise: Boll is known for his editorial and biographical work on Claudius Ptolemy. He also had a strong interest in astrology and authored several writings related to the subject. 3. Perspective on Astrology: Boll believed that astrology sought to be both religion and science simultaneously, as evident in his quote: \\"Astrology wants to be religion and science at the same time; that marks its essence.\\" He also mentioned that mankind measures time using the stars, and that laypeople often say, \\"The course of the stars determines time,\\" which leads religious people to believe that \\"heaven guides everything on earth.\\" 4. Views on the Book of Revelation: Boll claimed that the Book of Revelation contained an allegorical representation of the shift in astrological ages from the Age of Pisces to the Age of Aquarius. In his view, the apocalypse mentioned in the book is not the end of the world, but rather the end of an aeon. 5. Contributions to the History of Astrology: Boll wrote numerous astrological articles throughout his career. Along with Gundel and Bezold, he produced a comprehensive and well-regarded introduction to the history of astrology. In summary, Franz Boll was a philologist and professor with a keen interest and expertise in astrology. He was known for his contributions to the field, particularly in the areas of Claudius Ptolemy's works and the historical understanding of astrology. His views on the Book of Revelation and the role of astrology in human understanding of time provide insight into his perspective on the subject as a blend of both religion and science."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: When a friend tells you she has wild roses blooming everywhere, it’s not hard to imagine where the conversation headed to next… to turning them into rose petal jam, of course. My friend Simona Quirini and her family run the beautiful Canto del Maggio, a B&B, restaurant and garden, about one hour’s drive from Florence. We arrived to catch Simona with a wooden crate in her hands, already half full of blush pink flower heads, small and as fragrant as honey. It wasn’t just roses that were bursting out of their bushes with colour and fragrance. In fact, every time I go to Canto del Maggio, I notice how lush the property is with fruit, flowers and plants, and every season there are bounties to be collected. The first time I was there I noticed the myrtle bushes and heirloom fruit trees — little tiny, red pears and apples. The garden was full of summer produce and I stole green-skinned figs harbouring raspberry-red flesh off the trees. The next time I went, we picked ripe olives off the trees around the pool and took them down to the local frantoio, olive oil mill, to press the bright green oil out of them. I also came home with buckets of corbezzoli, or Irish strawberries, to make jam. This spring, I noticed the hedge rows of flowering wild strawberries and this last visit we picked the berries off them for an afternoon snack. With the help of my daughter (who was slightly more interested in playing with Simona’s new puppy), we filled a crateful of roses and picked the petals delicately off and into bowls. We were using the rose petal jam recipe and the technique I learned between two wonderful sources — Pellegrino Artusi’s 1891 cookbook (this pastry recipe below is also inspired by it) and the Armenian monks on Venice’s Isola di San Lazzaro Island where I worked for two autumns.
