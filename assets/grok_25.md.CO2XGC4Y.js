Write an article based on this \\"Don't try to mask or dilute the sample. Drink a lot of water starting the day before the test. Urinate as much as possible before the test. Consider substituting synthetic or clean urine for your own.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Tips for Ensuring a Clean Urine Sample: The Importance of Hydration and Safe Alternatives Introduction Whether you are preparing for a drug test or simply seeking ways to maintain a healthy lifestyle, producing a clean urine sample is critical for a variety of reasons. The process can be overwhelming, especially when you're uncertain about potential results and methods of achieving a clean sample. Rather than attempting to rely on risky techniques, such as masking or diluting the sample, it's important to take safer, more effective measures. In this article, we'll discuss the importance of drinking plenty of water, urinating frequently, and potentially considering the use of synthetic or clean urine for your test. Stay Hydrated One of the most crucial aspects of producing a clean urine sample is staying well-hydrated. Start by consuming an ample amount of water the day before the test, and continue drinking throughout the day of the test itself. Adequate hydration can enable your body to better flush out toxins, improving the likelihood of obtaining a clean sample. Remember that drinking too much water in a short amount of time can lead to a condition known as water intoxication, or hyponatremia, which can be dangerous. It is essential to pace yourself while hydrating to avoid any adverse effects. Urinate Frequently In addition to keeping your body properly hydrated, make sure to urinate as much as possible before the test. This helps to eliminate waste and toxins from your body, further increasing the possibility of providing a clean urine sample. Drinking plenty of fluids will naturally encourage frequent urination. Avoid Masking or Diluting the Sample The use of masking agents or diluting your urine may seem like a quick fix, but these methods carry significant risks, as they can result in inconclusive or inaccurate test results. Additionally, many testing facilities have become adept at identifying adulterated samples, which may lead to consequences such as job loss or disciplinary action. Consider Substituting Synthetic or Clean Urine If you're still concerned about providing a clean urine sample, one option you can consider is substituting synthetic or clean urine for your own. Synthetic urine is laboratory-made and contains the same chemical composition as natural urine, making it a reliable alternative for testing purposes. Clean urine refers to a sample from another individual with a known history of being drug-free. It is important to note that substituting urine samples may be against the rules of certain institutions or may have legal implications. Always review the specific guidelines and policies of the testing facility before deciding to use a substitute urine sample. Conclusion Obtaining a clean urine sample is essential for both personal health and adherence to various testing regulations and policies. By staying well-hydrated, urinating frequently, and avoiding risky techniques like masking or diluting the sample, you can increase the likelihood of providing a clean and accurate urine sample. If necessary, and within the bounds of the relevant guidelines, consider using synthetic or clean urine as a safe alternative. Ultimately, understanding and implementing safe strategies for ensuring a clean urine sample will contribute to a healthier lifestyle and peace of mind during testing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the village the Sharpe family lived in after moving from Geneva? is inside the article: On 27 July 1843 Sharpe married Elizabeth Fletcher, second sister of John Fletcher, at Bolton Parish Church. The couple had five children: Francis in 1845, Edmund junior (known as Ted) in 1847, Emily in 1849, Catherine (known as Kate) in 1850, and Alfred in 1853.When Sharpe moved his family from Lancaster to live in North Wales in early 1856 he was aged 47.  The seven years he spent there were later described, in a Memoir published in 1882 by the Architectural Association, as \\"perhaps the happiest years of his life\\". The family initially lived in a semi-detached house called Bron Haul near Betws-y-Coed, on what is now the A5 road.  Two years later he bought a larger property called Coed-y-Celyn on the east bank of the River Lledr, about a mile south of Betws-y-Coed. After moving to Geneva, the family lived for about three years in a rented property called Richemont on the road from Geneva to Chêne-Bougeries. Finally in 1866 the family moved back to Lancaster to live in Scotforth, then a small village to the south of the town.Elizabeth Sharpe died on 15 March 1876, a month after the consecration of St Paul, Scotforth where a plaque to her memory can be found in the chancel of the church. A year later, Sharpe travelled to northern Italy with his two daughters, his youngest son Alfred, and three research assistants, to make drawings of 12th-century churches in the region. During the trip he became seriously ill with a chest infection and died on 8 May, in or near Milan.  His body was taken to Lancaster, where he was buried on 19 May, alongside his wife, in the municipal cemetery.  \\"Glowing obituaries\\" were carried by the local newspapers and the architectural press, including The Builder, The Building News, and The Architect.

Motorhead () were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member, guitarist Larry Wallis and drummer Lucas Fox. The band are often considered a precursor to the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers have played in Motorhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums. Motorhead released 22 studio albums, 10 live recordings, 12 compilation albums, and five EPs over a career spanning 40 years. In July 1978, the band returned to the management of Douglas Smith, who secured a one-off singles deal with Bronze Records. The resulting \\"Louie Louie\\" single was issued in September peaking at number 68 on the UK Singles Chart, and the band toured the UK to promote it, recorded a BBC Radio 1 John Peel in session on 18 September (these tracks were later issued on the 2005 BBC Live & In-Session album), and appeared for the first time on BBC Television's Top of the Pops on 25 October. Chiswick capitalised on this new level of success by re-issuing the debut album Motorhead on white vinyl through EMI Records.  The single's success led to Bronze extending their contract, and put the band back into the studio to record an album, this time with producer Jimmy Miller at Roundhouse Studios. A hint of what the band had recorded for the album came on 9 March 1979 when the band played \\"Overkill\\" on Top of the Pops to support the release of the single ahead of the Overkill album, which was released on 24 March. It became Motorhead's first album to break into the top 40 of the UK Albums chart, reaching number 24, with the single reaching number 39 on the UK Singles Chart. These releases were followed by the \\"Overkill\\" UK tour which began on 23 March. A subsequent single was released in June, coupling the album track \\"No Class\\" as the A-side with the previously unreleased song \\"Like a Nightmare\\" on the B-side. It fared worse than both the album and previous single but reached number 61 on the UK singles chart.  During July and August, except for a break to appear at the Reading Festival, the band were working on their next album, Bomber. Released on 27 October, it reached number 12 on the UK Albums Chart. On 1 December, it was followed by the \\"Bomber\\" single, which reached number 34 on the UK Singles Chart. The \\"Bomber\\" Europe and UK tour followed, with support from Saxon. The stage show featured a spectacular aircraft bomber-shaped lighting rig. During the \\"Bomber\\" tour, United Artists put together tapes recorded during the Rockfield Studios sessions in 1975-1976 and released them as the album On Parole, which peaked at number 65 on the UK Albums Chart in December.  On 8 May 1980, while the band were on tour in Europe, Bronze released The Golden Years, which sold better than any of their previous releases, reaching number eight on the UK Singles Chart. The band had, however, preferred the title Flying Tonight, in reference to the \\"Bomber\\" lighting rig. On 20 August, the band (40 minutes) and Girlschool (20 minutes) were filmed performing live at the Nottingham Theatre Royal for the Rockstage programme, broadcast on UK television by the ATV station on 4 April 1981.

Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Known for sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, and elaborate stage shows, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over thirty years. The youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame. After signing a recording contract with A&M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Jackson began recording her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., in 2005. She recorded with producers Dupri, Jam and Lewis for several months during the following year. The album's title was a reference to the two decades since the release of her breakthrough album Control, representing the album's \\"celebration of the joyful liberation and history-making musical style.\\"  To promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the Today Show and Billboard Awards. Jackson's Us Weekly cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history. 20 Y.O. was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri. Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying \\"If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison.\\"  Jackson's airplay and music channel blacklist remained persistent, massively affecting her chart performance and exposure. However, lead single \\"Call on Me\\", which featured rapper Nelly, peaked at number twenty-five on the Hot 100, number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number six in the United Kingdom. The video for the album's second single, \\"So Excited\\", was directed by Joseph Kahn and portrayed Jackson's clothes disappearing through a complex dance routine.  20 Y.O. was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold 1.2 million worldwide, also receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album. After the album's release, Dupri was condemned for his production and misguidance of the album, and subsequently was removed from his position at Virgin Records. Slant Magazine stated, \\"After promising a return to Janet's dance-pop origins, [Dupri] opted to aim for urban audiences, a colossal mistake that cost Dupri his job and, probably, Janet her deal with Virgin.\\"  Jackson was ranked the seventh richest woman in the entertainment industry by Forbes, having amassed a fortune of over 150 million. In 2007, she starred opposite Tyler Perry as a psychotherapist in the film Why Did I Get Married?. It became her third consecutive film to open at number one at the box office, grossing 60 million in total.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years?

It is composed in the key of E minor using common time and a moderately fast tempo of 140 beats per minute. Instrumentation is provided by strings, horns, a guitar, and a piano, to create what Music Times' Carolyn Menyes described as a \\"crawling beat\\". March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\". Digital Spy's Lewis Corner and Amy Davidson wrote that it is a \\"ska-flecked romp of pumped-up foghorns and plodding brass\\". A writer from Capital XTRA described it as having a \\"mellow beat\\", while Rolling Stone's Daniel Sannwald wrote it has a \\"party-vibe production\\".During the track, Stefani's vocal range spans from the low note of D3 to the high note of A4. Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington. According to Sannwald, the lyrics include \\"Pharrell's 'Happy\\"-ish 'Everybody is the same inside' bridge\\" that allows the song to appeal to both children and their parents \\"without sounding overly patronizing\\". \\"Shine\\" ends with Williams singing in the falsetto register.When discussing the development of the single with MTV News, Stefani said that she initially disagreed with Williams' approach to the lyrics.

I think George Harrison is a genius too. He is the Beatle that is usually not given enough credit. And we'd like to know more about him. This DVD however doesn't do a good job. For those that truly enjoy George Harrison your money will be much better spent on \\"the Concert for George\\" DVD and CD or the last album George Harrison put out \\"Brainwashed\\". These are brilliant! And you'll enjoy them again and again. Answer:","output":"To determine the tone of this product review, I will analyze the reviewer's sentiment towards the product. 1. The title states \\"Mediocre DVD.\\"    - This term carries a negative connotation as it implies the DVD is not satisfactory or impressive.     2. The reviewer mentions, \\"This DVD is not worth having.\\"    - This statement clearly shows a negative opinion about the product. 3. The reviewer says they only watched the DVD once and then donated it to Goodwill.    - This indicates that the reviewer did not enjoy the DVD enough to keep it, which suggests a negative tone. 4. The reviewer does credit George Harrison as a genius and believes he is not given enough credit.    - This part of the review has a positive tone; however, it is not directed towards the DVD. 5. The reviewer states that the DVD \\"doesn't do a good job\\" in providing information about George Harrison.    - This is a negative remark about the product. 6. The reviewer highly recommends other George Harrison products.    - This part of the review has a positive tone, but it is about different products rather than the DVD in question. Conclusion: The tone of this product review is negative. The reviewer expresses dissatisfaction with the DVD, which they believe is not worth having and fails to provide valuable information about George Harrison. While they positively regard other related products, the overall tone directed towards the DVD in question is negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Your answer:","output":"The planet with the longest planetary year among the options provided is [IV] Neptune. A planetary year is the time it takes for a planet to complete a full orbit around the Sun. This period varies depending on the distance of the planet from the Sun and the speed at which the planet orbits. Among the options given, let's compare the length of their planetary years: [I] Earth: Earth takes approximately 365.25 days to orbit the Sun, which is why we have a leap year every four years to account for the extra day that accumulates. The length of Earth's year is the base unit by which we measure time and is thus considered one Earth year. [II] Venus: Venus has a very unique orbital period. It takes approximately 224.7 Earth days to orbit the Sun. Interestingly, Venus rotates on its axis very slowly and in the opposite direction compared to most other planets. As a result, a day on Venus (from sunrise to sunrise) lasts longer than its year, taking about 243 Earth days to complete one rotation. [III] Jupiter: As the largest planet in our solar system, Jupiter takes about 11.9 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. This is due to its greater distance from the Sun and its slower orbital speed. While Jupiter's year is lengthy compared to Earth's, it is not the longest among the given options. [IV] Neptune: Neptune is the farthest recognized planet in our solar system and takes the longest time in the provided options to complete an orbit around the Sun, thus having the longest planetary year. Due to its vast distance from the Sun, it takes approximately 164.8 Earth years to complete one full orbit. This means that since its discovery in 1846, Neptune has only completed a little more than one full orbit around the Sun. In conclusion, among the options provided, [IV] Neptune has the longest planetary year, taking 164.8 Earth years to complete a full orbit around the Sun."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Rufugio Elisabetta is located 3 km north-east of the Col de la Seigne, at the south-wet end of a mountain range in the Alps, located mostly in France and Italy, but also straddling what country? Answer:","output":"Rifugio Elisabetta is located 3 km north-east of the Col de la Seigne, at the south-west end of a mountain range in the Alps. The Alps mountain range extends across several countries in Europe, such as France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and Slovenia. However, based on the location described in the question, the Alps are mostly in France and Italy, but also straddling another country. That country is Switzerland. Let's analyze the information provided: Col de la Seigne is a mountain pass that forms the border between France and Italy. Therefore, the mountain range where Rifugio Elisabetta is located extends predominantly across France and Italy. Given its position to the south-west of the Alp range, the most likely country it straddles, besides France and Italy, is Switzerland, since Switzerland is located to the north and east of France in the Alps and borders both France and Italy.

This is the one day of the year when people around the world care about their sleep and ask themselves a lot of questions about sleep. Why do we need sleep? Nobody as yet can give a correct answer to this question. However, tests have shown that lack of sleep over about four weeks leads to a strong drop in body temperature, great weight loss and finally sickness. Different people need different amounts of sleep. Eight hours a night is considered the average amount of sleep. For teenagers the least number of sleeping hours advised by doctors are ten hours for primary school students, nine for junior highs and eight for senior highs. Some people seem to get along just fine with very little sleep at night. Leading American scientist Thomas Edison said that sleep was a waste of time. He did, however, take naps during the day. On the other hand, Albert Einstein, another great scientist, said he needed at least ten hours' sleep a night. Here are some of the most useful suggestions, for a good night's sleep.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Moon craters may hold ancient asteroid pieces NASA / Goddard Space Flight Center / Arizona State University Sunrise shadows on the moon's Tycho crater, as seen by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter on June 10, 2011. Twenty-five percent of the moon's impact craters may retain substantial remnants of the asteroids that created them, a new study finds. The surprising result suggests that scientists will have to work a little harder than they had perhaps anticipated to figure out what the moon is made of, researchers said. \\"Future studies of the moon's composition will have to show that exposed surface rocks really come from the moon and were not delivered by impacts, especially for unusual or exotic minerals,\\" said co-author Jay Melosh of Purdue University. [10 Surprising Moon Facts] Melosh and his colleagues, led by Zhong Yue of Purdue and the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Remote Sensing Applications in Beijing, used computer models to simulate the formation of lunar craters by asteroid impacts. They determined thatone-quarter of space rock strikes on the moon likely occur at a velocity of 26,800 mph (43,130 km/h) or less — blazingly fast, to be sure, but not fast enough to obliterate the asteroid. Other simulations performed by the team show that, at such impact speeds, little asteroid material is vaporized and lots of it is hurled against the walls of the newly formed crater. If the crater is at least 12 miles (20 kilometers) or so wide, impactor remnants tend to accumulate in a central peak as the crater collapses under the moon's gravity. The findings of the new study, which was published online Friday in the journal Nature Geoscience, could explain the occurrence of minerals called spinels and olivines in the central peaks of large lunar craters such as the 58-mile-wide (93 km) Copernicus. Spinels and olivines are common in many asteroids, so it's possible that these and other minerals that scientists had assumed were indigenous to the moon were actually delivered via space rock strikes, researchers said. \\"We cannot infer the deep composition of the moon from rocks in the centers of large craters without more care than has been used to date,\\" Melosh told Space.com via email. The findings have other intriguing ramifications as well. Some material blasted off Earth by colossal impacts long ago, after all, is thought to have hit the moon at relatively slow velocities. \\"This raises the possibility of finding early Earth material, ejected by collisions billions of years ago, in massive deposits on the moon, and suggests yet another explanation for the spinels: that they are deposits derived from the Earth’s upper mantle, emplaced long ago on to the moon and reworked,\\" Erik Asphaug of Arizona State University writes in an accompanying commentary in the same issue of Nature Geoscience. \\"Even more provocative is the suggestion that we might someday find Earth’s protobiological materials, no longer available on our geologically active and repeatedly recycled planet, in dry storage up in the lunar 'attic,'\\" Asphaug adds.

There were 66 people on board when the Airbus A320 crashed on 19 May while flying from Paris to Cairo. It vanished from Greek and Egyptian radar screens, apparently without having sent a distress call. \\"The signal from a beacon from a flight recorder has been detected,\\" said Remi Jouty of France's Bureau of Investigations and Analysis. A priority search area has been established, he added. Laplace is using acoustic detection systems to listen to the locator \\"pings\\" given off by the black boxes underwater. A specialist vessel carrying robots able to dive to 3,000 metres (3,280 yards) is due to arrive next week. Egyptian investigators first reported that the French vessels had picked up signals from the wreckage search area, saying they were \\"assumed\\" to be from one of the devices. Officials from the country said last week signals from the plane's emergency beacon had been detected but later said they were received on the day of the crash and were not new. What caused the crash remains a mystery. Finding the black boxes is crucial to piecing together what happened in the plane's final moments. A militant attack has not been ruled out but no extremist group has claimed the downing of the plane. Human or technical error is also a possibility. Flight data revealed that smoke detectors went off in the toilet and the aircraft's electrics, minutes before the plane's signal was lost. Black boxes emit signals for 30 days after a crash, giving search teams an ever-narrowing window to locate them before their batteries run out. Debris from the plane has been recovered from the sea, some 290km (180 miles) north of the Egyptian port city of Alexandria. But the bulk of the plane and the bodies of passengers are thought to be deep under the sea. Those on board MS804 included 30 Egyptians, 15 French citizens, two Iraqis, two Canadians and citizens from Algeria, Belgium, Britain, Chad, Portugal, Saudi Arabia and Sudan.","output":"A French vessel has detected signals from one of the EgyptAir Flight MS804 black boxes, which could help establish the cause of the crash that occurred on May 19 in the Mediterranean Sea."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Pope has confirmed he will visit both New York and Washington DC as part of a trip to the U.S. later this year. The Vatican had previously announced that the Pontiff would visit Philadelphia to participate in a massive rally for Catholic families in September. But speaking to reporters on a plane returning to Rome at the end of a trip to Sri Lanka and the Philippines yesterday, Francis said he would be visiting the two cities for the first time since becoming head of the Roman Catholic Church. Scroll down for video. Pope Francis addressing journalists on the papal plane on his way back to Rome after visiting Manila as part of a week long trip to Asia. Here he confirmed he would be visiting Washington and New York later this year. The itinerary for the trip is yet to be finalised but it is expected that he could visit the White House and address Congress as well as speak at the United Nations in New York. It is also believed he could give a mass in Madison Square Garden and visit Ground Zero. However, it has been confirmed that when in the U.S. capital he will take part in a ceremony to cannonise Junipero Serra, an 18th century Spanish Franciscan priest. There had been speculation that the Pope could have included a stop in California as part of his U.S. visit, especially as Serra founded missions in the state. But the 79-year-old said: 'I would like to go to California for the canonisation of Junipero, but I think there is the problem of time. It requires two more days.' He then said that the sainthood ceremony would take place at the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception instead. Serra was born on the Spanish island of Majorca in 1713, went to the Americas in the middle of the 18th century and led one of the first Franciscan missions in California. He arrived in San Diego in 1769 and spent most of the rest of his life there before dying at a mission in Carmel near Monterey in 1784. Meanwhile the city of Philadelphia has already begun preparations for the Pontiff's visit in September, which will coincide at the end of the week long World Meeting of Families. There had been speculation that Pope Francis was set to visit California but he told journalists on the flight that there wouldn't be enough time. It is expected that 1.5 million people could turn out for an open air Mass on the steps of the city's main art museum and that the crowd could fill a one-and-a-half mile stretch of parkway along the Schuylkill River. Francis also disclosed proposed trips to Africa, in particular the Central African Republic and Uganda, which would most likely take place at the end of 2015 to avoid the rainy seasons. There are also plans to visit Ecuador, Bolivia and Chile, most likely in July. He also confirmed he hoped to visit Argentina, Chile and Uruguay in 2016 — and Peru at some point. The announcement of his travel plans comes after the pope addressed a record six million Catholics in Manila on Sunday as his Asian pilgrimage drew to a close. On the flight back to the Vatican, he also spoke of how Catholics 'shouldn't breed like rabbits' and should instead practice 'responsible parenting'. While firmly upholding church teaching banning contraception, Francis said there are plenty of church-approved ways to regulate births. But he said most importantly, no outside institution should impose its views on regulating family size, blasting what he called the 'ideological colonization' of the developing world. Pope Francis, pictured yesterday as he departed Villamor Airbase in Manila, says Catholics do not have to breed 'like rabbits' African bishops, in particular, have long complained about how progressive Western ideas about birth control and gay rights are increasingly being imposed on the developing world by groups, institutions or individual nations, often as a condition for development aid. He said: 'Every people deserves to conserve its identity without being ideologically colonized.' The Pope's comments, taken together with his defence of the Catholic Church's ban on artificial contraception during the trip, could be a signal that a more conservative side to the pope is emerging.

Answer choices: - it keeps an organism warm  - invertebrate  - vertebrate chordate  - gastropod shells  - the body's largest organ  - remains of prehistoric life  - hard boned animals  - roundworm A:","output":"A vertebrate chordate is the kind of animal that is classified as having a vertebrae. Vertebrate chordates are members of the phylum Chordata and the subphylum Vertebrata. These animals possess a backbone or spinal column, which consists of individual vertebrae that house and protect the spinal cord. This characteristic distinguishes them from invertebrates, which lack a spinal column. Vertebrate chordates include a diverse group of animals such as mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. They exhibit a bilateral body plan, meaning they are symmetric along a central axis, with their bodies organized into a head, trunk, and tail. In addition to a vertebral column, vertebrate chordates also possess a number of other distinctive features, such as a well-developed central nervous system, paired sense organs, an internal skeleton made of bone or cartilage, and a closed circulatory system with a multi-chambered heart. Here is a brief overview of the answer choices provided and why they do not describe an animal with a vertebrae as accurately as a vertebrate chordate: - It keeps an organism warm: This is not a classification method but rather a function that some features, such as fur or blubber, serve in certain animals. - Invertebrate: These are animals without a backbone or spinal column and are, therefore, not classified as having vertebrae. - Gastropod shells: These structures are found in a class of mollusks, called gastropods, and are not related to the presence of vertebrae. - The body's largest organ: This refers to the human skin or the integumentary system in general, which is not a classification for animals with vertebrae. - Remains of prehistoric life: This phrase describes fossils, which can be of any ancient organism, not just those with vertebrae. - Hard boned animals: While this might describe some vertebrate chordates, it is not a specific enough classification because some vertebrates have cartilage-based skeletons instead of bone, such as cartilaginous fish (sharks and rays). - Roundworm: This is a type of invertebrate, specifically a member of the phylum Nematoda, and thus does not have a vertebrae. In conclusion, the most accurate classification for an animal with a vertebrae is a vertebrate chordate, as it specifically refers to organisms within the subphylum Vertebrata that possess a backbone or spinal column, distinguishing them from other animals."},{"instruction":"Q: Is this product review positive?

This means the motion of the pen is quicker on the (A) paper napkin (B) cloth napkin Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's consider the factors that contribute to pen motion and friction on both types of napkins. Step 1: Define the relationship between friction and pen motion. - When more friction is present, the pen's motion will generally be slower, as increased resistance from the surface makes it more difficult for the pen to glide smoothly. - When less friction is present, the pen's motion will typically be faster, as the surface offers less resistance and allows for a smoother glide. Step 2: Assess the given information in the question. - The question states that a pen experiences more friction when writing on a paper napkin than on a cloth napkin. Step 3: Apply the information from Step 2 to the relationship defined in Step 1. - Since there is more friction on a paper napkin, the pen's motion will be slower on the paper napkin. - Conversely, because there is less friction on the cloth napkin, the pen's motion will be quicker on the cloth napkin.

S., China, Israel, and a crowd of private companies plan to set up camp on the moon. So if and when they plant a flag, does _ give them property rights? A NASA working group hosted a discussion this week to ask: Who owns the moon? The answer, of course, is no use. The Outer Space Treaty, the international signed by more than 100 countries, states that the moon and other celestial bodies   are the province of all mankind. No doubt that would annoy all of the people throughout the ages, like monks from the Middle Ages, who have tried to claim the moon was theirs. But ownership is different from property rights. People who rent apartments, for example, don't own where they live, but they still hold rights. So with all of the upcoming missions   to visit the moon and beyond, space industry thought leaders are seriously asking themselves how to deal with a potential land rush. \\" This is a very relevant discussion right now. We've got this wave of new lunar missions from around the world,\\" said William Marshall, a scientist in the small-spacecraft office at NASA, but who spoke this week at an event hosted by NASA's Co Lab, a collaborative  public-private working group. He was speaking from his personal interest and not on behalf of the agency. To be sure, the United States aims to send astronauts back to the moon by as early as 2015, in a mission that would include a long-term settlement. China and Israel, among others, are also working on lunar projects.

Under new rules set down by the Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden, camera drones qualify as surveillance cameras and require a licence. Permits can be expensive and paying to apply for one does not guarantee it will eventually be granted. There are no exceptions made for journalists, and critics have said the ruling could mean job losses. In what some are describing as a \\"huge blow\\" to the aerial photography and camera drone industry, the court ruled that drone-mounted cameras are \\"regarded as surveillance cameras\\". Industry group UAS Sweden (Unmanned Aerial System) has argued that the court ruling could put 5,000 jobs in danger. \\"It is a bad decision for Sweden as an entrepreneur country and ominous for the Swedish labour market that is constantly affected by new obscure and complicated regulations from the state and its agencies,\\" said Gustav Gerdes, president of UAS. A lower district court in Sweden had previously ruled that camera drones did not constitute camera surveillance but that decision has now been overruled. According to photography website PetaPixel, more than 20,000 drones were sold in Sweden in 2014 with more than 1,000 permits issued for using camera drones for commercial purposes. In the UK, people wishing to operate a drone must follow some basic safety rules such as keeping it within line of sight, no more than 400ft above and 500m ahead, according to the Civil Aviation Authority's drone code. They will need to obtain permission from the CAA if they are flying a device over a congested area or within 50m of a building. Drone operators must also \\"respect the privacy of people\\" around them and anyone with concerns about drones being used in their area are advised to contact the police. Summary:","output":"The Supreme Administrative Court of Sweden has ruled that camera drones are considered surveillance cameras, thus requiring an expensive license and potentially putting 5,000 jobs at risk in the aerial photography and camera drone industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Midnight Express was a professional wrestling tag team of changing members, mostly under the management of Jim Cornette. The group started in the early 1980s with Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose (and originally Norvell Austin). The late 1980s saw a new incarnation, consisting of Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane, compete in JCP and WCW and shortly feuding with \\"The Original Midnight Express\\" of Condrey and Rose. In the 1990s, the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) combined Bob Holly and Bart Gunn as \\"The New Midnight Express\\". Due to various differences over the direction of the Midnight Express, Cornette, Lane and Eaton also left JCP for a short while, around the time that Ted Turner bought out Jim Crockett and began promoting the federation under the name World Championship Wrestling (WCW). When the issues were resolved, Cornette and the Midnight Express returned to the promotion. In the tournament to determine new World tag team champions, the Midnight Express advanced to the finals before losing to the Freebirds with some assistance from the Samoan Swat Team. They engaged in a feud with the Freebirds and Samoans until the 1989 Great American Bash, where they teamed up with the Road Warriors and Dr. Death Steve Williams to defeat the Freebirds and Samoans in a War Games match.  The Midnight Express soon turned heel as a result of a feud with the Dynamic Dudes (Johnny Ace & Shane Douglas). Jim Cornette duped the Dudes into thinking he wanted to be their manager but then turned on them during their match against the Midnight Express at Clash of the Champions IX in New York. The Dynamic Dudes gained a measure of revenge when the Midnight Express laid out an open challenge for any team for 10,000. After dispatching of a couple of no-name teams, the Express was challenged by the masked Dynamic Duo, billed from Gotham City, who pinned the Express and unmasked as Ace and Douglas. The feud soon lost steam and was forgotten soon after.  After returning to their cheating ways, the Midnight Express started a feud with the up-and-coming team of Flyin' Brian and \\"Z-Man\\" Tom Zenk over the United States Tag team titles. The Express won the titles from the young team in early 1990, but lost them to The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott) three months later. After a loss at Halloween Havoc 1990, the Midnight Express split up when Jim Cornette and Stan Lane left the federation. For the first time in almost a decade there was no Midnight Express. What happened in 1989?","output":"In 1989, the Midnight Express engaged in a feud with the Freebirds and Samoans until the 1989 Great American Bash, where they teamed up with the Road Warriors and Dr. Death Steve Williams to defeat the Freebirds and Samoans in a War Games match.

Concepts: day, pool, relax Write a sentence that includes all these words.","output":"A day at the pool is often viewed as one of the best ways to relax, especially under the summer sun; it's a time where both adults and children can free themselves from their daily routines and immerse themselves in a state of leisure and tranquility. A closer look at these concepts: day, pool, and relax, and their connection to each other gives a sense of an enjoyable activity that is both physically refreshing and spiritually calming. Starting with the concept of a day - a 24-hour period in our lives, it is a fundamental unit of time. Essentially, it's the way we organize our lives, it's divided into work hours, sleep hours, and time for all other activities. We all have good days and bad days, and often, what differentiates them is how we spend our hours. A day represents the opportunity to do something valuable or enjoyable. Turning to a pool, it's not just a repository of water, but also a significant symbol of recreation and relaxation in many cultures around the world. Pools invite us to swim, to exercise, and to have fun. They are places where you can either engage in high-energy splashing and games, or take it easy on a floating device. Pools are centres of social gatherings, a place where we can meet and engage with others. For kids, a pool is a vast sea of adventure, and for adults, it's about finding a temporary escape from the world outside that pool fence. The last concept, relaxation, is a state we all seek. In our fast-paced, high-stress modern society, relaxation is more than luxurious, it's necessary for maintaining mental and physical health. Relaxation refers to the state of being free from tension and anxiety, a state of calmness and peace. When we relax, we allow our bodies and minds to rest, recharge and renew. Putting these three concepts together - a day, a pool, and relaxation, we create a perfect trifecta of recreational activity. What can surpass the joy of spending a day by the pool, where you can forget about your emails and deadlines, soak in the water, enjoy the sun and simply be? This scenario creates a perfect reprieve from the chaos of regular life, where the biggest decision you'll need to make is whether to stay in the water or lounge on a pool chair with a cold drink in hand. Humans are blessed with the ability to comprehend the need for leisure and the ability to appreciate such tranquil moments. A day at the pool provides not only a way to cool down on a hot day, but also an opportunity to bond with family and friends, to enjoy a casual BBQ and just chill. It's a place where laughter fills the air, where you can play, share stories, or catch up on that book you've been meaning to read, all while being in the perfect state of relaxation. In essence, the sentence \\"A day at the pool is the best way to relax\\" signifies not just an activity, but a lifestyle and a state of mind; it's about taking time for yourself, enjoying the simple pleasures of life and handling the balance between work and leisure. This sentence reminds us that sometimes, the most beneficial thing we can do is to do nothing at all, and just relax by the pool."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

After signing with Capitol Records in 1962, Wilson wrote or co-wrote more than two dozen Top 40 hits for the group. Because of his unorthodox approaches to song composition and arrangement and mastery of recording techniques, he is widely acknowledged as one of the most innovative and influential creative forces in popular music by critics and musicians alike.  - Neil Percival Young, (born November 12, 1945), is a Canadian singer-songwriter, musician, producer, director and screenwriter. Young began performing in a group covering Shadows instrumentals in Canada in 1960.

The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.  - Clyde Jackson Browne (born October 9, 1948) is an American singer, songwriter, and musician who has sold over 18 million albums in the United States.

Help as much as you can. Information:  - Baroque music (or ) is a style of Western art music composed from approximately 1600 to 1750. This era followed the Renaissance music era, and was followed in turn by the Classical era. Baroque music forms a major portion of the \\"classical music\\" canon, being widely studied, performed, and listened to. Key composers of the Baroque era include Johann Sebastian Bach, Antonio Vivaldi, George Frideric Handel, Claudio Monteverdi, Domenico Scarlatti, Alessandro Scarlatti, Henry Purcell, Georg Philipp Telemann, Jean-Baptiste Lully, Jean-Philippe Rameau, Marc-Antoine Charpentier, Arcangelo Corelli, Tomaso Albinoni, François Couperin, Giuseppe Tartini, Heinrich Schütz, Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, Dieterich Buxtehude, and Johann Pachelbel.  - Henry Purcell (or ; c. 10 September 1659  21 November 1695) was an English composer. Although incorporating Italian and French stylistic elements into his compositions, Purcell's legacy was a uniquely English form of Baroque music. He is generally considered to be one of the greatest English composers; no other native-born English composer approached his fame until Edward Elgar, Ralph Vaughan Williams, and Benjamin Britten in the 20th century.  - Tomaso Giovanni Albinoni (8 June 1671  17 January 1751) was an Italian Baroque composer. While famous in his day as an opera composer, he is mainly remembered today for his instrumental music, such as the concerti.  - Art music (also known as Western classical music, cultivated music, serious music, canonic music, or more flippantly, \\"real music\\" and \\"normal music\\") is an umbrella term that refers to musical traditions, implying advanced structural and theoretical considerations and a written musical tradition. The main tradition in the Western world is usually called classical music. \\"Serious\\" or \\"cultivated\\" music are terms frequently used as a contrast for ordinary, everyday music (popular and folk music, also called \\"vernacular music\\"). After the 20th century, art music was divided into two extensions: \\"serious music\\" and \\"light music\\".  - Giuseppe Domenico Scarlatti (Naples, 26 October 1685 Madrid, 23 July 1757) was an Italian composer who spent much of his life in the service of the Portuguese and Spanish royal families. He is classified primarily as a Baroque composer chronologically, although his music was influential in the development of the Classical style and he was one of the few Baroque composers to transition into the classical period. Like his renowned father Alessandro Scarlatti, he composed in a variety of musical forms, although today he is known mainly for his 555 keyboard sonatas.  - Jean-Baptiste Lully (born Giovanni Battista Lulli ; 28 November 1632  22 March 1687) was an Italian-born French composer, instrumentalist, and dancer who spent most of his life working in the court of Louis XIV of France. He is considered a master of the French baroque style. Lully disavowed any Italian influence in French music of the period. He became a French subject in 1661.  - Johann Pachelbel (baptised September 1, 1653  buried March 9, 1706) was a German composer, organist, and teacher who brought the south German organ tradition to its peak. He composed a large body of sacred and secular music, and his contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque era.  - George Frideric (or Frederick) Handel (born , ; 23 February 1685 (O.S.) [(N.S.) 5 March]  14 April 1759) was a German, later British baroque composer who spent the bulk of his career in London, becoming well known for his operas, oratorios, anthems, and organ concertos. Handel received important training in Halle and worked as a composer in Hamburg and Italy before settling in London in 1712; he became a naturalised British subject in 1727. He was strongly influenced both by the great composers of the Italian Baroque and by the middle-German polyphonic choral tradition.  - Bach Collegium Japan ( BCJ ) is composed of an orchestra and a chorus specializing in Baroque music , playing with period instruments . It was founded in 1990 by Masaaki Suzuki with the purpose of introducing Japanese audiences to European Baroque music . Suzuki still remains its music director . The ensemble has recorded all of Bach 's cantatas , a project that extended from 1995 to 2013 and accounts for over half of its discography .  - Amsterdam is the capital and most populous municipality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its status as the capital is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands, although it is not the seat of the government, which is The Hague. Amsterdam has a population of 847,176 within the city proper, 1,343,647 in the urban area, and 2,431,000 in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. The city is located in the province of North Holland in the west of the country. The metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - Alessandro Scarlatti (2 May 1660  22 October 1725) was an Italian Baroque composer, especially famous for his operas and chamber cantatas. He is considered the founder of the Neapolitan school of opera. He was the father of two other composers, Domenico Scarlatti and Pietro Filippo Scarlatti.  - Giovanni Battista Draghi (4 January 1710  16 March 1736), best known as Pergolesi or Giovanni Battista Pergolesi, was an Italian composer, violinist and organist.  - The earliest written records regarding the region come from the \\"Nihon Shoki\\", which describes the founding of the Ikuta Shrine by Empress Jing in AD 201. For most of its history, the area was never a single political entity, even during the Tokugawa Period, when the port was controlled directly by the Tokugawa Shogunate. Kobe did not exist in its current form until its founding in 1889. Its name comes from , an archaic title for supporters of the city's Ikuta Shrine. Kobe became one of Japan's 17 designated cities in 1956.  - A. G. M. (Ton) Koopman (born 2 October 1944) is a Dutch conductor, organist and harpsichordist. He is also professor at the Royal Conservatory of The Hague. In April 2003 he was knighted in the Netherlands, receiving the Order of the Netherlands Lion.  - Marc-Antoine Charpentier (1643  24 February 1704) was a French composer of the Baroque era.  - Johann Sebastian Bach (28 July 1750) was a German composer and musician of the Baroque period. He enriched established German styles through his skill in counterpoint, harmonic and motivic organisation, and the adaptation of rhythms, forms, and textures from abroad, particularly from Italy and France. Bach's compositions include the \\"Brandenburg Concertos\\", the \\"Goldberg Variations\\", the Mass in B minor, two Passions, and over three hundred cantatas of which around two hundred survive. His music is revered for its technical command, artistic beauty, and intellectual depth.  - Dieterich Buxtehude (; c. 1637/39  9 May 1707) was a Danish-German organist and composer of the Baroque period. His organ works represent a central part of the standard organ repertoire and are frequently performed at recitals and in church services. He composed in a wide variety of vocal and instrumental idioms, and his style strongly influenced many composers, including Johann Sebastian Bach. Today, Buxtehude is considered one of the most important composers in Germany of the mid-Baroque.  - Antonio Lucio Vivaldi (4 March 1678  28 July 1741) was an Italian Baroque composer, virtuoso violinist, teacher and cleric. Born in Venice, he is recognized as one of the greatest Baroque composers, and his influence during his lifetime was widespread across Europe. He composed many instrumental concertos, for the violin and a variety of other instruments, as well as sacred choral works and more than forty operas. His best-known work is a series of violin concertos known as \\"The Four Seasons\\".  - Heinrich Schütz ( 6 November 1672) was a German composer and organist, generally regarded as the most important German composer before Johann Sebastian Bach and often considered to be one of the most important composers of the 17th century. He wrote what is traditionally considered to be the first German opera, \\"Dafne\\", performed at Torgau in 1627, the music of which has since been lost. He is commemorated as a musician in the Calendar of Saints of the Lutheran Church on 28 July with Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel.  - Pieter William Kee (born August 30, 1927) is a Dutch organist and composer.  - He was born in Kobe to parents who were both Christians and amateur musicians; his father had worked professionally as a pianist. (Suzuki has as an adult joined the Reformed Church in Japan, a Calvinist denomination. ) Masaaki Suzuki began playing organ professionally at church services at the age of 12. He earned degrees in composition and organ at the Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music, then earned Soloist Diplomas at the Sweelinck Conservatory in Amsterdam, where he studied harpsichord and organ with Ton Koopman and Piet Kee and improvisation with Klaas Bolt.  - Georg Philipp Telemann ( 25 June 1767) was a German Baroque composer and multi-instrumentalist. Almost completely self-taught in music, he became a composer against his family's wishes. After studying in Magdeburg, Zellerfeld, and Hildesheim, Telemann entered the University of Leipzig to study law, but eventually settled on a career in music. He held important positions in Leipzig, Sorau, Eisenach, and Frankfurt before settling in Hamburg in 1721, where he became musical director of the city's five main churches. While Telemann's career prospered, his personal life was always troubled: his first wife died only a few months after their marriage, and his second wife had extramarital affairs and accumulated a large gambling debt before leaving Telemann.  - François Couperin (10 November 1668  11 September 1733) was a French Baroque composer, organist and harpsichordist. He was known as \\"Couperin le Grand\\" (\\"Couperin the Great\\") to distinguish him from other members of the musically talented Couperin family.  - Arcangelo Corelli (17 February 1653  8 January 1713) was an Italian violinist and composer of the Baroque era. His music was key in the development of the modern genres of sonata and concerto, in establishing the preeminence of the violin, and as the first coalescing of modern tonality and functional harmony.  - Jean-Philippe Rameau ( ) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the Baroque era. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside François Couperin.  - Giuseppe Tartini (8 April 1692  26 February 1770) was a Venetian Baroque composer and violinist.  - Klaas Bolt (March 6, 1927 in Appingedam  April 11, 1990 in Haarlem) was a Dutch organist and improviser. He taught improvisation at the Sweelinck Conservatory (named for Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck, a Dutch organist and composer of the Renaissance) in Amsterdam, where Masaaki Suzuki was among his students. Bolt was a proponent of the use of slow tempi when playing hymns. He played many hymns at his weekly evening hymn sings, which drew substantial audiences.

Gillian Triggs told Australia's ABC the versions of events given by different parties \\"simply don't add up\\". The Somali migrant at Australia's detention camp in Nauru says she became pregnant as a result of being raped. Australia says she changed her mind when she was allowed into the country last week, but she denies this. The 23-year-old woman - identified by her pseudonym Abyan - was sent back to the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday. Under Australia's asylum policy, any undocumented migrants trying to reach the country by boat are intercepted and held in centres on Nauru and Manus Island, Papua New Guinea. In an interview to ABC TV's Lateline programme, Ms Triggs said: \\"It's extraordinary that she was expected to reach a decision in such a short space of time and when the answer wasn't given immediately she's literally air lifted back to Nauru.\\" Ms Triggs described the migrant as \\"obviously very distressed\\" and the one who \\"really needs counselling and a safe environment\\". She added that the versions of events given by Abyan's statement and comments by Australian Immigration Minister Peter Dutton \\"simply don't add up\\". The migrant was flown to Sydney after requesting an abortion, which is not legal in Nauru in most circumstances. But on Friday night, she was unexpectedly returned to Nauru, alarming her lawyers and rights groups. Immigration Minister Peter Dutton said on Saturday that after seeing doctors, she had \\"decided not to proceed with the termination\\". But in a handwritten note released to the Australian media on Monday, Abyan denied this. \\"I have been very sick. I have never said that I did not want a termination. I never saw a doctor. I saw a nurse at the clinic but there was no counselling,\\" the note read. Abyan said she never saw a doctor, or had any counselling, and and that she was seen by a nurse with no translator present. \\"Please help me,\\" the statement said. Her lawyer, George Newhouse, has said she wanted more time to make the decision, and has accused the government of deporting her before he could seek an injunction blocking it. Is Australia's Cambodia solution 'an expensive joke'? Australia's controversial asylum policy On Monday, Mr Dutton insisted on ABC Radio that the woman had been seen several times by medical and counselling staff, with interpreters on most occasions, and had reached her own decision. He said he would not allow for women in such a situation to be treated as \\"political pawns\\" by opponents of Australia's immigration policy, saying some of the allegations being made were \\"patently incorrect, if not fabricated\\". \\"I'm very, very concerned about the privacy of this lady, but I'm dragged into this debate to clear up what I think is a political motivation by some of the advocates.\\" Last week, Mr Dutton said that refugees and asylum seekers on Nauru were asking for medical care in Australia in order to try to have their refugee claims processed on the mainland. He described the behaviour as a \\"racket\\". The Australian government says its asylum policy deters people traffickers but there has been been criticism of the conditions at the camps. In September, a report by a senate committee found conditions on Nauru were not \\"appropriate or safe\\". It said allegations of rape and abuse should be investigated.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The government is under immense pressure. Its underpaid and overstretched forces have been on the back foot in their first season without Nato combat support. They are trying to push the Taliban back, most recently in the key southern province of Helmand - but the way the insurgents took the northern city of Kunduz still weighs on people's minds. Afghans are watching all this with great concern. It is no surprise that - after Syria - the highest number of migrants in Europe come from Afghanistan. People here wonder which is the greater gamble - continuing to live in Afghanistan or risking death on the journey out. In the current climate one group is doing good business: people smugglers. The BBC gained rare access to one - we will call him Abdul (not his real name). Abdul said a trip out of Afghanistan into Iran, Turkey and ultimately Europe costs between 5,000 and 7,000 (Â£3,250 to Â£4,550). Abdul gets 10%, the rest goes to other smugglers in the network and pays for transportation. Migrants pay a deposit and their families pay the balance when they reach their destination. The journey is fraught with danger, something Abdul said he did not hide. \\"The most dangerous part is between Turkey and Greece. People get shot by police and sometimes the boats capsize. But Allah guarantees safety, not me,\\" he said. People from all walks of life and various parts of the country seek him out, he said, but he will not take them if they are unhealthy, too old, with small children or pregnant. Abdul seems conflicted about what he does - he feels he is helping people, but also acknowledges he is taking their money and sending them to an uncertain fate. \\"I smuggled my own three sons. I miss them a lot and I get upset when I see parents crying. I don't like my job very much you know. I feel guilty sometimes,\\" he said. Standing outside the passport office on a chilly Kabul morning, it is easy to see why people like Abdul are in business. Queues have already started forming. People crouch on car bonnets filling in forms. Everyone wants to leave - and most don't want to come back. Arif Mohamady, in his late 20s, is angry and frustrated. \\"There are no jobs here, no security and lots of corruption. I'd rather live in an infidel country,\\" he said. \\"In 2007 my father was killed in a suicide bombing. My mother and brother were killed by the Taliban. I know it's a dangerous journey but I'd rather die on the way than stay in Afghanistan.\\" Despite the overwhelming sense of despair, some take a more hopeful view. A group of young people have started a digital campaign called \\"Afghanistan Needs You\\". Shakib Mohsanyar, 23, said they wanted to stop the brain drain, while Sharam Gulzad, 26, said many Afghans had unrealistic expectations about life abroad. \\"I was in Germany and I saw Afghans begging for the first time there. It was heartbreaking. People think once they arrive things will get better. They won't,\\" he said. Both acknowledged that the problems of corruption, lack of jobs and insecurity are all too real. \\"When you go out in the morning you don't know if you're coming back home in the evening,\\" said Mr Gulzad. \\"But this is the risk we take. We do have potential. This is not the end of Afghanistan. If we take responsibility and action we will change this country.\\" This article was about:","output":"The article discusses the precarious situation in Afghanistan, a country plagued by a multitude of problems, including overstretched and underpaid governmental forces, the resurgence of the Taliban, and a staggering number of migrants fleeing the nation for a chance at a better life in Europe.  The Taliban have been gaining ground in Afghanistan, causing alarm and concern amongst the populace. The uncertainty and fear have led many Afghans to consider leaving their homeland and undertaking a treacherous journey in search of safety and opportunity in Europe. Afghanistan is currently the second largest source of migrants in Europe, after Syria. People smugglers are profiting from the desperation of the Afghan people, offering to transport them to European countries for a high price. One smuggler, \\"Abdul,\\" disclosed that a journey out of Afghanistan and into Europe would cost between 5,000 and 7,000, with a 10% cut going to the smuggler. The journey is incredibly dangerous, with the most perilous leg occurring between Turkey and Greece—a fact that \\"Abdul\\" admits to his clients. Afghans from various backgrounds and regions seek out people smugglers, putting their lives in the hands of these profiteers who claim to help them while exploiting their desperation and fear. The smugglers often face inner conflicts as they send people on such uncertain and perilous journeys. The atmosphere in Afghanistan is filled with anger, frustration, and a desire to leave. However, some young Afghans cling to hope and have started a digital campaign called \\"Afghanistan Needs You\\" in an effort to prevent a brain drain and encourage their fellow citizens to stay and help bring change to their troubled country. They acknowledge the corruption, lack of jobs, and insecurity that plagues Afghanistan, but hold on to the belief that with collective responsibility and action, they can make a difference."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There were conflicting reports late Tuesday over whether demonstrators who seized control of a Security Service of Ukraine building in Luhansk took hostages. An anti-terrorism unit outside the building claimed the pro-Russian demonstrators were holding hostages, Victoria Syumar, a security service spokeswoman, and Yarema Duh, spokesman for the National Security and Defense Council, told CNN. Fifty-one people were released from the building early Wednesday morning, the security service said in a statement.

Here is an article: Can there be a bigger swing from the ultimate high to the lowest of lows than the one the Angels' Kendry Morales experienced on Saturday? In the celebration following his game-winning grand slam against Seattle, Morales suffered a broken lower leg when he jumped and landed awkwardly on home plate. Morales is scheduled to undergo surgery on Sunday and his recovery will most likely be measured in months, not weeks, according to the Orange County Register. Morales had appeared in every Angels game and was hitting .286 with 11 homers and 39 RBI. There's a chance those could be his totals for the entire season. Fantasy owners will need to make immediate plans to fill the void he leaves behind. Besides Morales, only backup catcher Bobby Wilson has even played a single inning at first all season, so there is no ready-made solution. Starting second baseman Howie Kendrick has played first before, but not since he appeared in 42 games there in 2006. The most likely replacement will come from the Angels' Class AAA affiliate, the Salt Lake Bees. They have major league veteran Robb Quinlan, who's hitting .253 in 23 games and 24-year-old Mark Trumbo, who's hitting .275 with 11 homers and 39 RBI. No matter what the Angels do, the loss of Morales -- however long it is -- is a major blow to their playoff hopes. Fantasy owners feel their pain.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Where does Atticus's daughter live in Go Set a Watchman?\\"  Context: \\"An earlier draft of To Kill a Mockingbird, titled Go Set a Watchman, was controversially released on July 14, 2015. This draft, which was completed in 1957, is set 20 years after the time period depicted in To Kill a Mockingbird but is not a continuation of the narrative. This earlier version of the story follows an adult Scout Finch who travels from New York to visit her father, Atticus Finch, in Maycomb, Alabama, where she is confronted by the intolerance in her community. The Watchman manuscript was believed to have been lost until Lee's lawyer Tonja Carter discovered it; although this claim has been widely disputed. Watchman contains early versions of many of the characters from To Kill a Mockingbird. According to Lee's agent Andrew Nurnberg, Mockingbird was originally intended to be the first book of a trilogy: \\"They discussed publishing Mockingbird first, Watchman last, and a shorter connecting novel between the two.\\" This assertion has been discredited however by the rare books expert James S. Jaffe, who reviewed the pages at the request of Lee's attorney and found them to be only another draft of \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\". The statement was also contrary to Jonathan Mahler's description of how \\"Watchman\\" was seen as just the first draft of \\"Mockingbird\\".

Article: Since the early history of the United States, Amerindians, African–Americans, and European Americans have been classified as belonging to different races. Efforts to track mixing between groups led to a proliferation of categories, such as mulatto and octoroon. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During Reconstruction, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with \\"one drop\\" of known \\"Black blood\\" to be Black, regardless of appearance.3 By the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states.4 Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of \\"Indian blood\\" (called blood quantum). To be White one had to have perceived \\"pure\\" White ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry. This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black. The one-drop rule is specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States, making it a particularly African-American experience.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Two Grown-Up Friends From Different Teams Have an Adventure on a Deserted Island Once upon a time, there were two friends named Jeff Flake and Martin Heinrich. Now, these friends were part of two different teams. Jeff was on the Republican team, and Martin was on the Democrat team. Sometimes, their teams didn't agree on things, but that didn't stop Jeff and Martin from being friends. One day, they decided to go on a big adventure together. They went to a faraway place called the Marshall Islands. The Marshall Islands are a group of islands in the middle of the big, blue ocean. But, instead of going to an island with lots of people, they went to a deserted island. That means there was nobody else on the island – no people, no houses, and no stores! Jeff and Martin had to live on the island for a whole week! Now, you might be wondering, how did they survive with no food or water? Well, Jeff and Martin are very smart and clever. They knew how to find food and water all by themselves. They caught fish from the ocean and found fruit on the trees. They even built a shelter to sleep in at night!  While they were on this adventure, a group of people came with big video cameras. These people were from the Discovery channel, which is a channel on TV that shows interesting and exciting things. They wanted to show the whole world how Jeff and Martin could survive on a deserted island without any help. The people from the Discovery channel made sure to capture all the fun and exciting things that Jeff and Martin did on the island. They showed them making a fire, fishing, and building their shelter. They even showed them having fun, laughing, and learning new things together. Because Jeff is a Republican and Martin is a Democrat, people thought this adventure was very special. It showed that even if people are on different teams and don't always agree, they can still be friends and do amazing things together. So, kids, remember that the world is full of adventures and mysteries. You never know what can happen when you work together, have fun, and learn new things.

Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - A stratovolcano, also known as a composite volcano, is a conical volcano built up by many layers (strata) of hardened lava, tephra, pumice, and volcanic ash. Unlike shield volcanoes, stratovolcanoes are characterized by a steep profile and periodic explosive eruptions and effusive eruptions, although some have collapsed craters called calderas. The lava flowing from stratovolcanoes typically cools and hardens before spreading far due to high viscosity. The magma forming this lava is often felsic, having high-to-intermediate levels of silica (as in rhyolite, dacite, or andesite), with lesser amounts of less-viscous mafic magma. Extensive felsic lava flows are uncommon, but have travelled as far as .  - New Ireland Province, formerly New Mecklenburg, is the most northeastern province of Papua New Guinea.  - Basalt (, , , or ) is a common extrusive igneous (volcanic) rock formed from the rapid cooling of basaltic lava exposed at or very near the surface of a planet or moon. Flood basalt describes the formation in a series of lava basalt flows.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - Lihir Island (a.k.a. Niolam Island) is the largest island in the Lihir group of islands, 22 km long and 14.5 km wide, in Papua New Guinea's New Ireland Province. It consists of a complex of several overlapping basaltic stratovolcanoes rising 700 m above sea level. While the volcanoes are not currently active, geothermal activity is still present. The island is in what was the forearc basin associated with the subduction of the Pacific Plate beneath the North Bismarck Plate. Subduction stopped about 10 million years ago with the collision of the Ontong Java plateau with the subduction zone.  - Subduction is a geological process that takes place at convergent boundaries of tectonic plates where one plate moves under another and is forced or sinks due to gravity into the mantle. Regions where this process occurs are known as \\"subduction zones\\". Rates of subduction are typically in centimeters per year, with the average rate of convergence being approximately two to eight centimeters per year along most plate boundaries.  - Lihir Island Airport is an airport in Londolovit on Lihir Island in Papua New Guinea . The airport has a short unpaved runway long enough to handle a small jet . All flights leave at approximately 4 - 7am . The airport has significantly upgraded its facilities , which now includes air conditioning , x-ray machines and a renovated waiting area . It is assumed that this is because of the introduction of a new international flight to Cairns , Australia , operated by Airlines PNG .  - The North Bismarck Plate is a small tectonic plate located in the Bismarck Sea off the northeast coast of New Guinea.  - Melanesia is a subregion of Oceania (and occasionally Australasia) extending from the western end of the Pacific Ocean to the Arafura Sea, and eastward to Fiji.  - The Pacific Plate is an oceanic tectonic plate that lies beneath the Pacific Ocean.

Its capital, located along its southeastern coast, is Port Moresby. The western half of New Guinea forms the Indonesian provinces of Papua and West Papua.  - A forearc is the region between an oceanic trench and the associated volcanic arc. As such, forearc regions are found at convergent margins, and include any accretionary wedge and forearc basin that may be present. Due to tectonic stresses as one tectonic plate rides over another, forearc regions are sources for great thrust earthquakes   - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east.

The OJP was emplaced 120 Ma with a much smaller volcanic event 90 Ma. Two other south-west Pacific plateaus, Manihiki and Hikurangi, now separated from the OJP by Cretaceous ocean basins, are of similar age and composition and probably formed as a single plateau and a contiguous large igneous province together with the OJP. When emplaced this Ontong Java-Manihiki-Hikurangi plateau covered 1% of Earth's surface and represented a volume of of basaltic magma. This \\"Onotong Java event\\", first proposed in 1991, represents the largest volcanic event of the past 200 million years, with a magma emplacement rate estimated at up to /year over three million years, several times larger than the Deccan Traps. The smooth surface of the OJP is punctuated by seamounts such as the Ontong Java Atoll, the largest atoll in the world.  - In 2000 it had a population of 254,158. it had a population of 364,145, giving it an annual growth rate of 2.1% over a nine-year period.

As the job market becomes increasingly competitive, the hiring process is becoming more complex. More and more companies are turning to psychological (or personality) assessments to determine whether someone is the right fit for the job. Do some serious thinking about the qualifications that are necessary for the particular job that requires the test.  For example, if you are seeking a job as an executive or upper-management, the interviewers will want to make sure that you have strong leadership skills and are an excellent communicator. If you are applying for a job such as a police officer, candidates will be expected to exhibit an ability to deal with high levels of stress and think on their feet. Psychological exams are essentially an assessment of your personality. Think about why you are applying for this job. It is probably because you feel that you are qualified and have the right disposition for this particular career.  For example, if you are applying for a sales job, you know that a portion of your income will be generated by commission. Therefore, you need to be highly motivated. Does that sound like you? Reflect on your personality traits before the test. This will help you be prepared to formulate answers that fit the role. It's important that you be yourself when answering questions. But you should also remember that you are being evaluated. For example, if you were asked, \\"If you knew you would not get caught, would you steal from the company?\\", you should answer \\"No.\\" Even if you know that you might consider stealing, that is not something you would want to say during an interview. During the interview process, you need to not only highlight your strengths, but you need to convey how you can specifically benefit your future employer. Think about what you can do to improve the productivity of the company. If you are conscious of the company's needs, this will likely be reflected in your personality test. Before your test, feel free to ask the recruiter or HR representative what characteristics are most important on them. Then you can focus your answers on conveying those traits. It is impossible to predict the content of the test. However, you can prepare yourself by getting comfortable with the format. Be aware that most psychological exams consist of a face to face interview and a written questionnaire.  You can search for practice tests online. Make sure to choose one from a reputable site that has solid psychology credentials. You can also hire a consultant to give you an in person practice exam. This person will then provide you with analysis and helpful hints.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: What symbolizes Saint George on the British flag? Context: Red is one of the most common colors used on national flags. The use of red has similar connotations from country to country: the blood, sacrifice, and courage of those who defended their country; the sun and the hope and warmth it brings; and the sacrifice of Christ's blood (in some historically Christian nations) are a few examples. Red is the color of the flags of several countries that once belonged to the former British Empire. The British flag bears the colors red, white, and blue; it includes the cross of Saint George, patron saint of England, and the saltire of Saint Patrick, patron saint of Ireland, both of which are red on white. The flag of the United States bears the colors of Britain, the colors of the French tricolore include red as part of the old Paris coat of arms, and other countries' flags, such as those of Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, carry a small inset of the British flag in memory of their ties to that country. Many former colonies of Spain, such as Mexico, Colombia, Ecuador, Cuba, Puerto Rico, Peru, and Venezuela, also feature red-one of the colors of the Spanish flag-on their own banners. Red flags are also used to symbolize storms, bad water conditions, and many other dangers. Navy flags are often red and yellow. Red is prominently featured in the flag of the United States Marine Corps.","output":"The symbol that represents Saint George on the British flag is the cross of Saint George, which is red on white."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was given borough status in the United Kingdom? ?  Stretford was part of the ancient parish of Manchester, within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire. Following the Poor Law Amendment Act of 1834, a national scheme for dealing with the relief of the poor, Stretford joined the Chorlton Poor Law Union in 1837, one of three such unions in Manchester, before transferring to the Barton-upon-Irwell Poor Law Union in 1849. In 1867, Stretford Local Board of Health was established, assuming responsibility for the local government of the area in 1868. The board's responsibilities included sanitation and the maintenance of the highways, and it had the authority to levy rates to pay for those services. The local board continued in that role until it was superseded by the creation of Stretford Urban District Council in 1894, as a result of the Local Government Act 1894. Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933, giving it borough status in the United Kingdom. Stretford Borough Council was granted its arms on 20 February 1933. The roses are the red roses of Lancashire, and the lion in the centre represents John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. Above the lion are a crossed flail and scythe; the flail comes from the arms of the de Trafford family; the scythe is a reminder of the agricultural history of the area; the thunderbolts above represent the importance of electricity in Stretford's industrial development. The boat at the bottom represents Stretford's links to the sea via the Manchester Ship Canal.In 1974, as a result of the Local Government Act 1972, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished and Stretford has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford, in Greater Manchester. Trafford Town Hall – previously Stretford Town Hall – is the administrative centre of Trafford. Answer:","output":"Stretford was given borough status in the United Kingdom when Stretford Urban District became the Municipal Borough of Stretford in 1933. This change occurred as a result of the Local Government Act 1933 which led to the creation of Stretford Borough Council and the granting of its arms on 20 February 1933. The borough status allowed Stretford to have more local autonomy and authority in managing its affairs. However, in 1974, the Municipal Borough of Stretford was abolished due to the Local Government Act 1972, and since 1 April 1974, Stretford has been a part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford in Greater Manchester."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write the answer: \\"What year did students at Oxford University organise the first university \\"\\"athletic sports\\"\\" meeting?\\"","output":"The first university \\"athletic sports\\" meeting at Oxford University was organized in 1860. The event marked a significant milestone in the history of sports at educational institutions, paving the way for future generations of student-athletes and the development of organized sports within universities. During the mid-19th century, there was a growing interest in athletics and physical education within schools and universities. Physical activity and sports were increasingly being recognized as essential components for the development of well-rounded and healthy individuals. As a result, various athletic clubs started forming at educational institutions across England, with Oxford University being one of the pioneers in this movement. The event in 1860, which took place on May 23, was organized by students from the university who shared a common interest in sports and athletic competition. These students sought to create an environment that encouraged friendly competition, camaraderie, and the development of athletic skills among their peers. The first university \\"athletic sports\\" meeting featured track and field events, which were already popular in England. These included running races of various distances, jumping events such as the long jump and high jump, and throwing events like the shot put and hammer throw. The event was held at the University Parks, a spacious area with plenty of room for both competitors and spectators. The successful organization of the first university \\"athletic sports\\" meeting at Oxford University in 1860 set a precedent for other universities around the world. Soon, similar events began taking place at universities in the United States and other countries, ultimately leading to the establishment of international multi-sport competitions, such as the modern Olympic Games. As the popularity of university sports continued to grow throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, intercollegiate athletic organizations were established to oversee the governance, rules, and regulations of sports at colleges and universities. In the United Kingdom, the British Universities & Colleges Sport (BUCS) was founded, while in the United States, the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) was established. In conclusion, the first university \\"athletic sports\\" meeting at Oxford University in 1860 played a vital role in the history of organized sports at educational institutions. It demonstrated the importance of physical activity and competition in the development of well-rounded individuals, fostering a spirit of camaraderie and cooperation that continues to permeate university sports to this day. The legacy of that event lives on, as the passion for athletic competition and excellence still thrives in universities all over the world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I can use this background: Carbon monoxide is used in modified atmosphere packaging systems in the US, mainly with fresh meat products such as beef, pork, and fish to keep them looking fresh. The carbon monoxide combines with myoglobin to form carboxymyoglobin, a bright-cherry-red pigment. Carboxymyoglobin is more stable than the oxygenated form of myoglobin, oxymyoglobin, which can become oxidized to the brown pigment metmyoglobin. This stable red color can persist much longer than in normally packaged meat. Typical levels of carbon monoxide used in the facilities that use this process are between 0.4% to 0.5%.  Now, I have a new situation: Mike went to his local grocery store. He noticed that meats had two different packaging, product A and product B. When he looked closely, he found that in product A packaging carbon monoxide was used, but in product B carbon monoxide was not used. He asked the store clerk what difference it made.  Answer this question please: Which product would less likely look fresher, product A or product B?","output":"Product B, which does not use carbon monoxide in its packaging, would be less likely to look fresher compared to product A. The absence of carbon monoxide in product B's packaging means that the myoglobin in the meat can oxidize to form metmyoglobin, which has a brown pigment. This can cause the meat to appear less fresh over time. On the other hand, product A uses carbon monoxide in its packaging to form carboxymyoglobin, which maintains a bright-cherry-red pigment and allows the meat to retain a fresher appearance for a longer period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chris Mintz, 30, a North Carolina native who had moved to the Roseburg, Ore., area and is studying at Umpqua Community College to become a fitness trainer, hurled himself against the door in an effort to stop the gunman, identified as Christopher Harper Mercer, from entering. When Mercer, who killed at least nine people and injured at least seven before being killed by police, shot his way inside, hitting Mintz at least three time, the former soldier called out that it was his son Tyrek's sixth birthday, according to Mintz's aunt. His plea was rewarded with two more shots, Wanda Mintz told The Daily Beast. \\"I really think that if he wasn't such a strong, young guy, he may have died.\\" \\"He could have very easily died,\\" Wanda Mintz said. \\"I really think that if he wasn't such a strong, young guy, he may have died.\\" Mintz was hit in the abdomen, upper back, left hand, and once in each leg.

Plot title: Heaven Can Wait Movie plot: An aged Henry Van Cleve (Don Ameche) enters the opulent reception area of Hell, to be personally greeted by \\"His Excellency\\" (Laird Cregar). Henry petitions to be admitted (fully aware of the kind of life he had led), but there is some doubt as to his qualifications. To prove his worthiness (or rather unworthiness), he begins to tell the story of his dissolute life. Born in Manhattan on October 25, 1872, Henry is the spoiled only child of stuffy, clueless, wealthy parents Randolph (Louis Calhern) and Bertha (Spring Byington). His paternal grandmother (Clara Blandick in an uncredited role) is also doting and naive, although his down-to-earth grandfather Hugo Van Cleve (Charles Coburn), a self-made millionaire, understands Henry quite well. Henry grows up an idle young man, with a taste for attractive showgirls. One day, Henry overhears a beautiful woman lying to her mother on a public telephone. Intrigued, he follows her into a Brentano's and pretends to be an employee to get to know her better. Despite learning that she is engaged, he begins making advances, finally confessing he does not work there, whereupon she hastily departs. Later, obnoxious cousin Albert (Allyn Joslyn) introduces the family to his fiancÃ©e, Martha (Gene Tierney), and her feuding parents, the Strables (Eugene Pallette, Marjorie Main). Henry is shocked to find that his mystery woman and Martha are one and the same. It turns out that Albert was the first suitor of whom both her parents approved. Fearful of spending the rest of her life as a spinster in Kansas City, Martha agreed to marry him. Henry convinces her to elope with him instead. Though everyone (except Grandpa Van Cleve) is scandalized, eventually they are received back into the family. Henry and Martha enjoy a happy marriage and become the proud parents of a boy. On the eve of their tenth anniversary, however, Martha finds out about Henry's continuing dalliances with other women and goes back to her parents. Henry and Grandpa follow her there.

Q:Planting trees has a positive impact on an ecosystem, and an ecosystem includes the organisms and their habitat. Given these facts, doing what has a positive impact on organisms and their habitat among the following options: - hydrate their cells  - exercise  - By coral exoskeletons  - planting trees  - trimming trees  - planting grass  - buying flowers  - support A:","output":"Planting trees has a positive impact on organisms and their habitat among the given options. This is because trees serve multiple essential functions in an ecosystem. Some of these functions include: 1. Providing oxygen: Through the process of photosynthesis, trees absorb carbon dioxide and release oxygen, which is essential for the survival of many organisms, including humans. 2. Supporting biodiversity: Trees provide a habitat for a wide range of flora and fauna. Birds, insects, small mammals, and various plant species all benefit from the presence of trees. This, in turn, helps create a more balanced and healthy ecosystem. 3. Preventing soil erosion: The extensive root systems of trees help to stabilize the soil, thereby reducing erosion and sediment runoff. This helps to maintain the quality of the land and can prevent water pollution in nearby rivers, lakes, and oceans. 4. Regulating local climate: Trees can help regulate the local climate by providing shade and reducing the urban heat island effect. This can help to keep habitats cool and comfortable for various organisms. 5. Acting as a carbon sink: Trees absorb and sequester carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, helping to mitigate the effects of climate change. 6. Improving water quality: Trees can improve water quality by reducing pollutants and sediments, as well as capturing and filtering rainwater through their root systems. While some other options like planting grass and trimming trees can also positively impact ecosystems, their effects are comparably smaller. Planting grass can contribute to soil stabilization and increase the green cover, but trees provide a wider range of benefits, and trimming trees is a maintenance activity that can help maintain a tree's health while ensuring its benefits are sustained."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Today, many of his writings are included in school textbooks and his works are read by millions around the world. Born in 1881 to rich family, Lu Xun had a happy childhood. In 1893, however, his grandfather was put into prison for taking money. At the same time, his father became seriously ill. From that time on, his family were no longer accepted by their relatives and friends. These early experiences greatly influenced his writing. By the time Lu Xun arrived in Nanjing to study at a college in 1899, he already believed that Chinese government had to change and become modern. In 1902 he went to study in Japan. There he began writing articles for some Chinese student magazines. He showed a gift for writing and translating and he even wrote several books, though none was popular. He returned to China in 1909 because he was in need of money. After working for a few years as a teacher in Beijing, Lu Xun again returned to writing. In 1918, he wrote his famous short story Diary of a Madman. It was the first Chinese novel using the everyday language that people spoke, which helped make it a great success. _ , together with his novel The True Story of Ah Q(1921), made Lu Xun a leading Chinese writer. Though successful, Lu Xun still worried greatly about China's future. In 1926, he moved to Shanghai and gave up writing stories.

A prosecutor did his best to ensure that when he convinced a Maryland jury that Evans was among the worst of the worst, a killer who deserved a punishment more severe than a life spent in prison. He deserved, the prosecutor argued and the jury agreed, to die at the hands of the state. That was nearly 30 years ago. In the years since, the motel where Evans gunned down two employees has been replaced by a Howard Johnson. The star witness in the case, a woman who lost her husband and a sister that day, has died. And Evans, who in his own words has “rebuilt” his character, remains on Maryland’s death row, kept alive in a politically forged purgatory. “In hindsight, it would have been better if he got life without parole,” David B. Irwin, the former prosecutor who handled the case, said recently. “But it wasn’t obvious to us as young prosecutors back then that this was the way it was going to turn out.” As the state Senate prepares to vote this week on whether Maryland should abolish capital punishment, the Evans case illustrates what can happen when the death penalty exists but is not enforced. Unlike Virginia, which has executed more than 100 people since 1976, including one man last month, Maryland has executed five people since it reinstituted the death penalty in 1978, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. No one has been executed in Maryland since 2005. What is essentially a moratorium on capital punishment has been in place in Maryland since 2006, and since 2009, the state has required DNA evidence, a videotaped crime or a videotaped confession in capital cases. Of the five men on Maryland’s death row, Evans and two others have been there for nearly three decades. In that time, Evans has survived a stabbing, come within hours of execution and outlived the widow he left haunted by a burst of gunfire that was meant for her but killed her sister. Even some of the people who most wanted to see Evans dead no longer do, although not because of any sympathy for him. “If [Evans] got executed tomorrow, it wouldn’t bother me a bit,” Irwin said. But he won’t, and for Irwin, that’s the problem with the state’s death penalty. “I’m not morally, religiously or legally against the death penalty,” he said. “It’s on grounds of practicality. It becomes ridiculous and ludicrous after 30 years. If they’re not going to impose the death penalty, why have it on the books?” Evans was 33 and a drug addict in April 1983 when authorities say he agreed to kill two federal witnesses, Scott Piechowicz and his wife, Cheryl. The two worked at the Warren House Motel in Pikes­ville, in Baltimore County,and were set to testify against a drug dealer named Anthony Grandison. Heroin and cocaine had been found in one of the motel’s rooms, and only the couple could tie Grandison to it. It was Evans’s job to silence them, and authorities say that for 9,000 he tried to do so by walking into the motel lobby and firing a Mac-11 machine gun. Six bullets hit Piechowicz and four hit his sister-in-law, Susan Kennedy, who had agreed at the last minute to work for Cheryl. Years later, after the remarried Cheryl died, husband Bob Bradshaw told The Washington Post that she had read Piechowicz’s autopsy so often she memorized the placement of the bullets, the organs they damaged and the size of the holes they made. She also suffered recurring nightmares about her sister, he said: “Her sister’d come up to her in a halter top. And she got six or seven bullets right in the heart. And she’d see the bullet holes, and Cheryl would say, ‘Susan, you can’t walk around with that on — people can see the bullet holes.’ And Susan would look at her and say, ‘That’s right, Cheryl, because I want everyone to see what you did to me.’ ” Dana M. Levitz, the prosecutor who tried Grandison and eventually became a Maryland Circuit Court judge, said that as a prosecutor he had asked juries six times for the death penalty and that each time it was granted. None of those men, including Grandison, has been executed, Levitz said. Instead, he has seen the appeals process extend cases for many years. “The most difficult part of it,” he said, “was dealing with the effect it had on innocent people, the effect it had on victims’ families and the effect it had on the defendants’ families.” These days, Grandison, Evans and the other three condemned men are housed in a maximum-security prison in Cumberland. It is one of the few facilities in the nation where death-row inmates live among the general population, said Warden Bobby P. Shearin. At the prison, where 1,000 of the 1,400 inmates are serving life sentences, those on death row have their own cells, but otherwise, they walk the same beige halls as everyone else and follow the same meal schedule: breakfast at 4 a.m, dinner at 3:30 p.m. Officials denied a request from The Post to interview death-row inmates, but in a letter to The Post, Evans described the prison as a place where decent food is scarce — “I have learned to love peanut butter, sardines and beans from the commissary” — and where he and the others on death row share a tier with mentally ill inmates. “So just imagine loud noises,” he writes. “Men getting mace. Men being drag out their cells. Men playing in their waste.” “A man on death row in the State of Maryland has to have a strong will within and a God to have faith in.” James McEachin, a pastor who grew up with Evans, describes him as an intelligent man who fell into drugs early. But he is not a killer, said McEachin, who thinks that someone other than Evans was the shooter. Over the years, Evans’s supporters have picketed, spoken to lawmakers and at one point formed the Committee to Save Vernon Evans. Evans has spoken by phone to area college students through a program called Live from Death Row. At one point, Evans’s words appeared on a blog titled “Meet Vernon.” In 2006, he received a stay 11 hours before he was to be executed. McEachin said he has visited Evans on death row and prayed through “plexiglass that has got to be at least six inches thick.” In his letter, Evans describes transferring from one prison to another — and from state to state — over the years, each with its own set of challenges. In one, he says, he had to walk with his hand over his heart because “Cubans were wanting to get a murder charge just to stay in the country.” In another, he was stabbed seven times by a man he was teaching to read. When he was placed in the Maryland prison system in 2002, he writes, he “had been living with the company of death for 18 years.” Gov. Martin O’Malley’s proposal to repeal the death penalty — as 17 other states have done — appears on track to pass in the Senate and the House of Delegates. But the bill would affect only future cases. The legislation cannot be applied retroactively to the men on death row because of constitutional concerns, said Raquel Guillory, a spokeswoman for the governor. O’Malley (D) would have options. He could commute all or some of the death sentences to life without parole; he could issue an executive order staying all death warrants; he could do nothing and leave the inmates in the hands of future governors. At a hearing this month, O’Malley told lawmakers that he would “decide each of those cases as they ripen.” Richard Dieter, the executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, said the average time between sentencing and execution is 15 years. Thirty years is rare. “It’s time to just say enough is enough,” said Jane Henderson, executive director of Maryland Citizens Against State Executions. “The problem with the death penalty is it’s a Catch-22. Everything you do to make it fairer is only going to make the process longer and more torturous for the very people we say we do it for.” Catherine Kennedy said she thinks the waiting led to an early death for her brother, John Kennedy, who lost daughter Susan in the motel shooting and had to watch daughter Cheryl endure the court proceedings and appeals for Evans and Grandison. “My brother could not forgive them, and his life just faded away,” Kennedy, 74, said. “I think my brother would very much have liked to be the executioner.” Kennedy said some of her relatives would still like to see Evans and Grandison executed and that at one point she would have joined her brother, a police sergeant, in performing the task. But she now teaches the Bible and said her view has changed. She thinks the men are evil. “And I want God to get rid of evil,” she said. “However, I don’t think he gave me that power.” John Kennedy, 59, died of cancer in 1998. Cheryl, 38, died the same year of a congenital defect that limited blood flow to her brain. Evans and Grandison “destroyed my brother’s family,” Kennedy said. “My brother was one of the best men on the face of the Earth. He was good, loving, gentle. “I think had my brother murdered [Evans and Grandison],” she said, “God would have forgiven him.” After the trial, Irwin find out that John Kennedy was never searched at the courthouse and sat in court with his police-issued firearm at his side. Irwin said he has since questioned the restraint it must have taken for Kennedy to leave the fate of Grandison and Evans to the justice system. “He believed in the system and the system didn’t work for him,” Irwin said. “I wonder what he would have done if he’d known he would die before they did.” John Wagner and Jennifer Jenkins contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of the text discuss the case of Vernon Lee Evans Jr., a man on Maryland's death row for nearly 30 years following the conviction of a double murder. The article highlights the state's reluctance to enforce the death penalty, with only five people executed since it was reinstated in 1978. A moratorium on capital punishment has been in place in Maryland since 2006, with new evidence requirements introduced in 2009. The text also addresses the Maryland Senate's preparation to vote on whether to abolish capital punishment in the state, a stance supported by Governor Martin O'Malley. The impact of the prolonged death penalty process on victims' families and the moral and ethical dilemmas surrounding the death penalty are also discussed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mix the detergent with water and dip a washcloth in the solution. Wipe the pads and gloves with the washcloth, removing any dirt and debris.  Adding a tablespoon of fabric softener to the detergent solution can help eliminate odors and make your pads and gloves flexible. You can check your detergent's pH levels by reading the label, checking online, or contacting its manufacturer. Do not put your pads or gloves in the dryer, as this can damage any leather or plastic pieces. Instead, stuff the pads or gloves with a washcloth or newspaper and let them dry overnight. Wash the lacrosse uniform after every game and practice to keep it fresh. Put your lacrosse uniform in the washing machine and turn it to the gentle cycle with cold water. You can use regular laundry detergent to clean the uniform, but do not add any fabric softener if your uniform is made of spandex. Most fabric softeners restrict the elasticity of spandex.  Washing the uniform with other clothes is okay so long as they can handle the gentle cycle with cold water. You can machine wash the pads and gloves as well, but use a non-acidic detergent. Put your uniform in the dryer immediately after your washing cycle ends. Set the dryer to low heat and check its dryness after the cycle ends. If the uniform is still damp, start another cycle and repeat the process as needed. Do not dry clean or iron your lacrosse uniform, as doing either can discolor the fabric.

Write some highlights for the following article: A day after he made a swift exit from an Islamabad court when a judge revoked his bail, former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf appeared before a magistrate on Friday and was formally placed under house arrest. The development is the latest setback to Musharraf since the former military ruler returned to Pakistan last month to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the country's turbulent political scene by seeking to run in upcoming elections. His arrest also highlights the increased willingness of Pakistan's judiciary, who clashed with Musharraf during his time in power, to pursue cases against high-profile figures previously considered to be untouchable. No former Pakistani army chief has previously been arrested and detained. Amid a long-running fight with the judiciary, Musharraf resigned as president of Pakistan in 2008 after nine years in power and went into exile the following year, living in London and Dubai. He came back to Pakistan last month under heavy security. But so far, his return does not seem to be going according to plan. Earlier this week, Pakistani election officials barred Musharraf from running for a seat in parliament in elections next month, a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge. That decision appears to have emboldened members of the judiciary, many of whom have bitter memories of their treatment by Musharraf during his time in power. But the legal drama concerning a former head of the army appeared to be fueling concerns about how the powerful Pakistani military might respond, with the country under the management of a caretaker government ahead of the elections next month. \\"The fears that the army might sharply react if the cases are taken to their logical conclusion hang in the air,\\" The Nation, an English language newspaper, wrote in an editorial Friday. \\"But Pakistan is now irrevocably destined for a democratic transition, and on this, all institutions agree.\\" Accused of detaining judges. The Islamabad High Court had ordered Musharraf's arrest on Thursday in a case in which he is accused of illegally ordering the detention of senior judges in 2007. The high court said in its ruling that it was an \\"act of terrorism\\" to prevent the judges from doing their job. But he quickly left the building after the judge announced the decision, returning to his farmhouse compound outside the Pakistani capital. His legal status at that point was unclear. Local media reported he had been placed under house arrest, but the judge's order for his arrest remained outstanding. On Friday morning, local broadcaster Geo TV broadcast images of Musharraf arriving at a court building accompanied by uniformed police officers and other members of the security forces. Pakistani authorities have provided some of his heavy security detail since his return. Islamabad police spokesman Naeem Iqbal said officers had formally arrested Musharraf and produced him before a magistrate in court. But Mohammad Amjad, a spokesman for Musharraf's political party said the former president had presented himself in court. He said Musharraf denies the charges against him and never gave any order to detain or abduct the judges in 2007. Farmhouse arrest. After appearing before the magistrate on Friday, Musharraf was allowed to return to his farmhouse, which has been converted into a \\"sub jail\\" where he is being held under house arrest, according to his lawyer, Ahmed Raza Qasoori. Musharraf will continue to seek bail in the case, Qasoori said. An attempt on Thursday to appeal the Islamabad court's decision at the Supreme Court appeared to have so far been unsuccessful. Qasoori said that Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui, the Islamabad High Court judge who ordered Musharraf's arrest, is one of the judges whom Musharraf is alleged to have had detained in 2007. As a result, Qasoori said, Siddiqui should have recused himself from the case. Siddiqui wasn't immediately available for comment on Friday. In another step in the process, Musharraf will have to appear in court again next week. He had previously received bail extensions in the cases concerning him. He was also initially granted \\"protective\\" bail to ward off potential arrest when he returned to Pakistan. But the judiciary appears to have taken a more aggressive line than he may have expected, stepping up the pursuit of cases against him. When asked last week about his fears of arrest, Musharraf brushed the question aside. A mixed reception in Pakistan. Musharraf was disqualified from contesting elections in Pakistan because of the state of emergency he declared in 2007. Even though he hasn't been tried for that action, the move was ruled an act of treason, making him ineligible to run for office. Musharraf maintains he should not be barred because he has not been convicted of any criminal acts. Some Pakistanis are happy to see the return of the ex-military ruler, hoping his leadership could help restore order to a country riddled with political division and plagued by extremist violence. But he also made many enemies in the final years of his presidency, notably among the judges he allegedly detained. The Pakistani Taliban vowed to send a death squad to hunt down the former president if he returned to the country, though Musharraf has said he has been living under threats of death since September 11, 2001, when he supported the American war on terror and fought against the Taliban. The former general became president after a bloodless coup in 1999. Musharraf's popularity began declining in 2007 after he suspended the nation's Supreme Court chief justice for \\"misuse of authority.\\" The move resulted in protests and accusations that he was attempting to influence a court decision on whether he could seek another term in office. CNN's Nic Robertson and journalist Nasir Habib reported from Islamabad. CNN's Jethro Mullen reported and wrote from Hong Kong. CNN's Shaan Khan contributed to this report.","output":"1. Former Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf was placed under house arrest, following his return to the country to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the political scene. 2. This arrest highlights the increased willingness of Pakistan's judiciary to pursue cases against high-profile figures, marking the first time a former army chief has been arrested and detained in the country. 3.

Question: \\"In what ways did the sultan's brother try to oust him?\\" Answer: \\"Execution\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"The initial answer provided, \\"Execution,\\" is not a complete and correct response to the question. Please find a more comprehensive and detailed answer below: Schahzenan, the Sultan Shahryar's brother, attempted to oust him from the throne through multiple strategies. The first instance was by planning a coup d'état along with Shahryar's wife. However, this plot ended in failure when Shahryar accidentally killed his wife during the chaos of the coup. This event led to Shahryar's madness and his distrust of women, ingraining in him the belief that they were plotting to kill him. Later on, when Schahzenan became aware of Shahryar's inability to execute his new wife, Scheherazade, he saw this as a sign of weakness. He took advantage of this perceived vulnerability by gathering his army and marching toward Baghdad. His goal was to use military force to seize power from his brother and claim the throne for himself. However, by the time Schahzenan's army reached Baghdad, Scheherazade's plan of telling stories with hidden morals had successfully cured Shahryar of his madness, and he had fallen in love with her. This transformation led to Shahryar growing stronger and becoming a more effective ruler, which thwarted Schahzenan's attempts to oust him from power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Under the control of a spider-like creature, he becomes embroiled in a battle between powerful corporations and an underground rebellion. Act 1: In the sprawling metropolis of New Athens, a series of mysterious attacks on high-ranking corporate officials has left the city on edge. Walker, a skilled but elusive bounty hunter, has been tasked with bringing the perpetrators to justice. He is equipped with a state-of-the-art suit and helmet that provide him with valuable tools such as AI assistance, advanced weaponry, and enhanced physical abilities, making him the perfect man for the job. Walker is briefed on the situation by his enigmatic employer, Mr. Harlow, who controls the most powerful corporations in the city. Harlow explains that the attacks are not random but part of a carefully devised plan to bring down the corporations and destabilize society. Fearing the rise of an unseen enemy, Harlow charges Walker with the responsibility of finding those responsible and eliminating the threat. Act 2: As Walker goes about his investigation, he stumbles upon an underground rebellion led by a fearless leader named Kasumi. The rebels believe that their society has become too dependent on technology and that the corporations hold too much power. They aim to bring balance back to the world by dismantling the corporate stranglehold and giving power back to the people.  While Kasumi and her group initially view Walker as an enemy, they realize he might be their only chance to bring down Harlow and his allies. As Walker gets closer to the truth, he starts experiencing strange pains and glitches in his helmet's systems. One night, he removes the helmet, only to discover a spider-like creature that has physically attached itself to his head. Act 3: Desperate for answers, Walker consults a brilliant and reclusive scientist named Dr. Sinclair, who reveals that the spider-like creature is a highly advanced form of biotechnology called Cyberarachnid. It was created by Harlow's corporation as a means of surveillance and control, and Walker, along with all other bounty hunters, has been unknowingly under their control. As Harlow becomes aware of Walker's growing allegiance to the rebellion, he activates a hidden failsafe within the Cyberarachnid, causing it to attempt to take complete control of Walker's mind. Despite the constant battle within his own body, Walker leads the rebels in a daring heist to infiltrate Harlow's headquarters and steal valuable information that could turn the tide in their fight for freedom. Climax: Walker confronts Harlow, who reveals that he aims to control the entire world using an army of individuals fitted with Cyberarachnids. Walker, driven by his newfound purpose and desire for freedom, engages in a thrilling fight against Harlow and his security forces, all while struggling against the relentless control of the Cyberarachnid. In the end, Walker manages to defeat Harlow, release the incriminating evidence against him, and shut down the Cyberarachnid program. In a final, fateful decision, Dr. Sinclair removes the Cyberarachnid from Walker's body, risking permanent damage to his mind. As Walker slips into unconsciousness, he finds solace in knowing that he has successfully disrupted the system that sought to control him and others like him. Post-Climax: With Harlow's criminal empire in ruins, Kasumi and her rebels begin the process of rebuilding society and creating a more just and equal world. As for Walker, his future remains uncertain. He is left with a newfound sense of purpose to protect the innocent and fight for a better world while still grappling with the scars left by the Cyberarachnid.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Mao Zedong belonged to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) during the People's War. Established in 1921, the CCP played a significant role in the Chinese Civil War, which was fought primarily between the Communists and the Nationalists, led by the Kuomintang (KMT). Mao Zedong was one of the founding members of the party and a key figure in its leadership. He adhered to Marxism-Leninism and played a pivotal role in strategizing and leading the party's military and political efforts against Japanese invasion and fighting the KMT-led Nationalist government. The People's War, also known as the Chinese People's War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, occurred from 1937 to 1945. During this period, the CCP, under Mao's leadership, cooperated with the KMT in a united front against the Japanese invasion. Although the CCP and KMT had temporarily suspended their hostilities to face the Japanese threat, their underlying tensions and ideological differences persisted. Once the Chinese Civil War resumed following the end of World War II, Mao Zedong led the CCP to victory against the KMT in 1949, resulting in the establishment of the People's Republic of China with Mao as its first leader. The CCP, to which Mao Zedong belonged, has been the ruling political party in China ever since."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 1712*v - 12300 + 1089 = -2986 + 5471 for v.","output":"To solve the equation 1712 * v - 12300 + 1089 = -2986 + 5471 for v, we will follow these steps: 1. Simplify both sides of the equation. 2. Isolate variable (v) on one side of the equation. 3. Solve for v. Let's begin: 1. Simplify both sides of the equation:    On the left-hand side, we can combine the numbers:    1712 * v - 12300 + 1089 = 1712 * v - 11211    On the right-hand side, we can combine the numbers as well:    -2986 + 5471 = 2485 Now, the simplified equation is:    1712 * v - 11211 = 2485 2. Isolate variable (v) on one side of the equation:    Adding 11211 to both sides to move the constant term from the left-hand side to the right-hand side:    1712 * v - 11211 + 11211 = 2485 + 11211    Then we get:    1712 * v = 13696 3. Solve for v:    Divide both sides of the equation by 1712 (the constant coefficient of v):    1712 * v / 1712 = 13696 / 1712    We are left with:    v = 8 So the solution for v in the equation 1712 * v - 12300 + 1089 = -2986 + 5471 is v = 8."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To bounce back she is hired to handle the IPO for Cachet, a privacy company with a social networking platform.  Around the same time Naomi bumps into Samantha Ryan, an old college classmate who now works as a public attorney. Unbeknownst to Naomi, Samantha is investigating Naomi's on-again, off-again boyfriend Michael Connor, a broker at the same firm as Naomi who Samantha suspects is involved in insider trading. Michael tries to get information from Naomi about Cachet but fails.  While doing due diligence, Naomi learns from Marin, one of the coders, that Cachet is hackable.

He was quite skilled in crafting stories set in ancient times, using elaborate language and period-specific details. However, Dennis struggled to create engaging and relatable narratives that appealed to the contemporary reader.  Recognizing Dennis's talent and potential, Brett, a successful modern-day author, decided to lend a hand. They first met to discuss the premise of the story, where they brainstormed ideas and settled upon a mystery set in a bustling city. Keeping contemporary elements in mind, they outlined a plot featuring a tech-savvy detective who used social media, GPS, and cutting-edge gadgets to uncover clues and solve the case. Next, they worked on character development, ensuring that each character was multifaceted and adequately represented the diversity of the modern world. This included creating backstories, motivations, relationships, and dialogue that would captivate readers and evoke a sense of familiarity. As they moved on to writing the actual narrative, Brett guided Dennis in using a more contemporary writing style, focusing on concise and clear language without sacrificing the elegance and eloquence that defined Dennis's work. Brett showed Dennis the importance of pacing and setting up compelling plot twists to keep the readers engaged. During revisions, Brett and Dennis worked together to refine the story, ensuring that it maintained the essence of a gripping mystery while staying relevant to modern readers. They added cultural references and current events, imbuing the story with a sense of timeliness that would resonate with their audience. Finally, they reviewed the manuscript together, making necessary adjustments and polishing the text to perfection. With Brett's guidance, Dennis had successfully transitioned from an archaic writer to one capable of crafting an enthralling modern-day mystery. The collaborative efforts of Brett and Dennis resulted in a novel that captivated readers, blending the timeless charm of an intricately woven mystery with the relatability of contemporary storytelling.

Article: Pope Benedict XVI called on European leaders to spur economic growth by countering the wealth gaps between their countries with the same determination used to reduce the “spreads” among member state’s borrowing costs.      “If the differential index between financial rates represents a source of concern, the increasing differences between those few who grow ever richer and the many who grow hopelessly poorer, should be a cause for dismay,” he said in an address to diplomats at the Vatican today. “It is a question of refusing to be resigned to a ‘spread’ in social well-being, while at the same time fighting one in the financial sector.”      The 85-year-old pontiff and other leading figures of the Catholic Church often use financial terms, concepts and references in speeches on the state of the economy. In 2010, Benedict called on businessmen to put profits earned from production and services back into the “real economy” rather than seeking a “quick return on the financial markets.” The year before, Vatican Secretary of State Tarcisio Bertone said that free-market economics legitimized greed, citing the 1987 movie “Wall Street” and its famous line that “greed is good, greed is right.”      At the outset of the global financial crisis in November 2008, then Italian Finance Minister Giulio Tremonti said Benedict had pronounced a “prophecy” in a 1985 paper stating that a decline in ethics may “cause the laws of the market to collapse.” In his 2009 encyclical “Caritas in Veritate,” Latin for “Charity in Truth,” the pope laid out his thoughts on capitalism and ways out of the worst recession since World War II.      The European Union “requires far-sighted representatives capable of making the difficult choices necessary to rectify its economy and to lay solid foundations for growth,” the pope said today. “Alone, certain countries may perhaps advance more quickly, but together, all will certainly go further,” he said, referring to the risks of a break-up in the euro region.

In addition to issues such as bond market yields and interest rates, world leaders should focus on \\"the increasing differences between those few who grow ever richer and the many who grow hopelessly poorer, \`' Benedict said, promoting the Catholic church's social teaching, which advocates special attention to the needy.      The financial crisis took root, he said, \`'because profit was all too often made absolute, to the detriment of labor, and because of unrestrained ventures in the financial areas of the economy, rather than attending to the real economy.\\"      He urged people to resist the temptations for \`'short-term interests\\" at the expense of the common good.      Benedict also revisited one of his most pressing worries of late: the use of religion as a pretext for violence. He said \`'baneful religious fanaticism\\" has produced many victims.

Sue Fleming's suitcase opens by accident, dropping her clothes from a double-decker bus onto Norman Winthrop. She retrieves her belongings and enters the New York City bus terminal. Intrigued, he follows her and returns a garter belt she overlooked. Steve Borden, the man she is involved with, calls her on the phone (though he is also in the terminal) and tells her to buy a ticket to San Francisco. Afterward, she sees him with another woman. They board the bus too. Norman, who is supposed to go to San Francisco by train, decides to travel by bus instead. Murphy has orders from Norman's father to keep him away from women. To Murphy's satisfaction, Sue rebuffs Norman's initial attempts to become better acquainted. May gives all her money to a friend, but manages to charm the bus driver, various relief drivers and Willy, a talkative, know-it-all passenger, into letting her ride for free. When the bus stops in Poughkeepsie, Steve and Nita Borden prove to be con artists, selling bibles at inflated prices to those who have lost loved ones recently, claiming they were specially ordered by the deceased. Nita, suspecting what is going on, later chats with Sue and introduces her husband, Steve. A disgusted Sue breaks up with Steve. She then makes a date with the persistent Norman at Niagara Falls. While Norman is getting ready, Murphy steals his clothes, but Norman goes with Sue to see the Falls wearing a raincoat provided by the tour company. When a tour employee demands the raincoat, Norman is shown to have only a bath towel on underneath. Norman arranges a candle-lit dinner for two in Chicago, but Murphy invites all the other passengers. When the bus later has engine trouble, the passengers go to a nearby carnival, where Norman challenges Sue to a bow and arrow contest; the prize, if he wins, is a kiss, but she proves to be a much better shot.

The European Central Bank (ECB) is the central bank for the Eurozone, a coalition of 19 European Union (EU) member states who have adopted the Euro as their common currency. Established in 1998 and headquartered in Frankfurt, Germany, the ECB operates under a framework defined in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The ECB, together with the central banks of the Eurozone countries, constitute the Eurosystem. The institution's primary responsibility is maintaining price stability and securing the value of the Euro. It aims to keep the year-on-year increase in consumer prices below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. The ECB also has several key roles and functions in managing the monetary policies within the Eurozone: 1. Monetary Policy: This is the central role of the ECB. It is accountable for managing the monetary policy of the EU, intending to maintain price stability and control inflation. Key tools used include key interest rates, open market operations, minimum reserve requirements for banks, and providing liquidity. 2. Financial Stability and Supervision: The ECB maintains financial stability by supervising significant banks and financial institutions within the Eurozone under the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). It aims to prevent banking crises and mitigate systematic risks. 3. Issuer of Currency: The ECB has the exclusive authority to authorise the issuance of Euro banknotes. Member countries' central banks issue these notes, which are put into circulation by the ECB. 4. Foreign Exchange: The ECB manages the foreign reserves of the Eurozone countries and can intervene in the foreign exchange markets to influence the exchange rate if needed for monetary policy purposes. 5. Economic Policies and Advice: The ECB advises EU institutions (like the European Commission and the European Parliament) on economic and monetary issues. It contributes to the creation of EU-level regulations and policies and provides assessments of EU member states' economic and budgetary plans. 6. Financial Market Infrastructure: The ECB promotes the safety and efficiency of payment, securities settlement, and clearing systems. It also develops related infrastructure projects, such as TARGET2 (for real-time gross settlement) and T2S (for securities settlements in central bank money). The ECB operates independently of national governments, but it’s accountable to the European Parliament and holds regular dialogues with institutional partners, academics, and civil society. This way, the ECB contributes significantly to the financial and economic stability within the Eurozone."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: Where Are Mahindra Tractors Made Suggested answer: With this sponsorship, Mahindra was the first Indian company to sponsor a car in NASCAR.

(B). Neil was a nice person..","output":"People liked being around Jeffrey more than around Neil because Jeffrey was a nice person. This preference can be attributed to a variety of factors that set Jeffrey apart from Neil, even if both of them were nice individuals in their own right. First and foremost, Jeffrey tended to exude a warm, welcoming energy that instantly put people at ease. His open body language and friendly demeanor contributed to an atmosphere of trust, allowing others to be their authentic selves without fear of judgment or criticism. This sincerity enabled deeper connections to form quickly between Jeffrey and those around him, fostering a sense of camaraderie that would elude Neil. In addition to his genuineness, Jeffrey had a knack for active listening and made people feel heard and valued. He often gave his undivided attention to others when they spoke, nodding and occasionally interjecting with thoughtful comments or questions. This made people feel that Jeffrey was not only interested in what they had to say but that he was invested in their well-being and cared about their personal experiences. Furthermore, Jeffrey had a unique ability to empathize with others and be sensitive to their feelings and emotions. This made him an indispensable confidant to those in need, as people could trust him with their most vulnerable thoughts and emotions, knowing he would provide a caring, nonjudgmental response. Jeffrey was also known for his inclusiveness, making a conscious effort to involve everyone in conversations and activities. He intuitively picked up on those who felt left out or uncomfortable and made strides to integrate them within the group. This created an atmosphere of belonging that allowed people to thrive, in contrast to Neil, who might not have had this same level of awareness or concern for other people's feelings. Moreover, Jeffrey had a great sense of humor and was able to make people laugh even during tough times. His playfulness and lightheartedness were contagious, filling those around him with joy and happiness. This ability to spread positivity made it easy for people to gravitate towards him, while Neil might not have shared this same trait. While Neil might also be a nice person with his own unique qualities, people overall tended to feel more connected, cared for, and appreciated in the presence of Jeffrey.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Many types of nuclear propulsion have been proposed, and some of them (e.g. NERVA) tested for spacecraft applications. can we use nuclear power to propel spaceships?","output":"Yes, nuclear power can be used to propel spaceships, and it has been a subject of extensive research since the dawn of the space age. Nuclear propulsion offers several advantages over conventional chemical propulsion systems. It provides much higher energy density, which means that a nuclear-powered spacecraft can carry less fuel mass for a given mission, resulting in substantial weight savings. Additionally, nuclear propulsion can offer higher effective exhaust velocities, which translates into greater potential mission speeds and the ability to perform more demanding maneuvers. Several types of nuclear propulsion systems have been proposed and studied for spacecraft applications, such as nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP), nuclear electric propulsion (NEP), and nuclear pulse propulsion (NPP). Some of these have undergone physical testing, like the NERVA project. 1. Nuclear Thermal Propulsion (NTP): In an NTP system, a nuclear reactor is used to heat a propellant, such as hydrogen, to extremely high temperatures. The heated propellant expands rapidly through a nozzle, generating thrust. The advantage of an NTP system is its high specific impulse (a measure of propellant efficiency), which can be more than twice that of conventional chemical rockets. The most famous NTP project was the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA), which was an American program that operated during the 1960s. The program successfully tested several nuclear rocket engines, but it was ultimately canceled due to budgetary constraints and shifting priorities towards other space exploration methods. 2. Nuclear Electric Propulsion (NEP): NEP systems use nuclear reactors to generate electricity, which is then used to drive electrically-powered thrusters. The most common type of thruster used in NEP systems is the ion thruster, which uses electric fields to accelerate ions to incredibly high speeds. While the thrust produced by NEP systems is relatively low, they provide exceptional specific impulse and fuel efficiency, allowing spacecraft to achieve high velocities over long-duration missions. The main disadvantage of NEP systems is their relatively low thrust-to-weight ratio, making them unsuitable for high-thrust applications like Earth launches. However, they can be excellent for missions such as deep space explorations and interplanetary travel. 3. Nuclear Pulse Propulsion (NPP): NPP systems utilize a series of controlled nuclear explosions to propel a spacecraft. The most well-known NPP concept was Project Orion, which proposed detonating nuclear bombs behind the spacecraft, with each explosion pushing the craft forward. A pusher plate would absorb the impact of the explosion and convert it into forward motion. Although the concept has significant theoretical advantages, such as extremely high specific impulse and the ability to carry large payloads, there are numerous potential downsides. These include the radiation hazards of launching a nuclear bomb-powered spaceship, the environmental impact of nuclear explosions, and the political implications of deploying such a technology. Overall, nuclear propulsion systems offer significant advantages for space travel and spacecraft capabilities. However, there are also challenges to overcome, such as dealing with the radiation emitted from the reactors, managing the heat generated by the system, and addressing safety concerns. Regulatory issues and public perception of nuclear power are also factors that need to be considered. In conclusion, we can use nuclear power to propel spaceships, and there is a wealth of research and development undertaken in this field. However, additional advancements in technology, safety systems, and public acceptance will be needed before widespread use of nuclear-powered spacecraft becomes a reality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Except for their color, there are two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom that the children can use during free time. Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs.  But I can use this background: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop.  What is an answer for this question: Which chair has a higher air pressure? The answer to this question is:","output":"The green chair has a higher air pressure. To justify this answer, let's consider the given situation step-by-step: 1. We have two identical inflatable chairs in a grade school classroom. 2. The only difference between the chairs is their color. 3. Patrick and Mark are allowed to use the chairs, with Patrick sitting on the red chair and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, sitting on the green chair.  Given the background information on Boyle's law, we know that decreasing the volume of a gas (if the temperature is held constant) increases its pressure. Since Mark weighs more than Patrick, he would compress the air volume in the green chair more than Patrick compresses the air volume in the red chair. This results in a decreased volume for the air inside the green chair as compared to the red chair. As a consequence, the air pressure inside the green chair becomes higher than the air pressure inside the red chair, according to Boyle's law."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Abstract: Although blood–brain barrier (BBB) compromise is central to the etiology of diverse central nervous system (CNS) disorders, endothelial receptor proteins that control BBB function are poorly defined. The endothelial G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr124 has been reported to be required for normal forebrain angiogenesis and BBB function in mouse embryos, but the role of this receptor in adult animals is unknown. Here Gpr124 conditional knockout (CKO) in the endothelia of adult mice did not affect homeostatic BBB integrity, but resulted in BBB disruption and microvascular hemorrhage in mouse models of both ischemic stroke and glioblastoma, accompanied by reduced cerebrovascular canonical Wnt–β-catenin signaling. Constitutive activation of Wnt–β-catenin signaling fully corrected the BBB disruption and hemorrhage defects of Gpr124-CKO mice, with rescue of the endothelial gene tight junction, pericyte coverage and extracellular-matrix deficits. We thus identify Gpr124 as an endothelial GPCR specifically required for endothelial Wnt signaling and BBB integrity under pathological conditions in adult mice. This finding implicates Gpr124 as a potential therapeutic target for human CNS disorders characterized by BBB disruption..

Summarize this article: Put forth effort into the relationship and work hard to make it work. Communicate openly with your partner about your goals for the relationship and where you see it going. If you're only interested in a short-term fling, be honest. If you've got an eye toward serious long-term love, be honest. There's nothing wrong with either kind of love, but you need to make sure that your partner is equally committed to the same version of love that you are. Commit to the person and to the relationship. Put in work to make your partner feel special, and work toward making the relationship work. The word \\"intimacy\\" is often associated with sex, but being emotionally intimate is a huge part of a loving relationship. Emotional intimacy involves allowing yourself to feel and express vulnerability around your partner. Avoiding vulnerability can look like withdrawal, attack, or accusations. On the contrary, intimacy can look like sharing fears, discomfort, and disappointment with your partner. Feelings or situations that previously felt unsafe feel safer in an intimate relationship because of the vulnerability and trust that has been developed.  When you begin to feel vulnerable (like experiencing fear, sadness, shame, or hurt), take a moment and pause. Acknowledge whatever feelings come up and allow yourself to feel them; don’t avoid them. Take compassion on the feeling and be gentle with it. Share your vulnerable moments and let your partner support you. If you’re concerned that the initial attraction and strong feelings of love are wearing off, realize that love can occur in waves. Sometimes you feel overwhelmingly in love with someone, and other times you experience less love to or from that person. Just because you hit a low point doesn’t mean that the feelings will last forever. Life happens in cycles, and it’s okay that love experiences highs and lows.  Lots of things can create peaks and troughs in love, such as having children or growing older. You can work through them. You don’t have to be the one in control of the love in your relationship; let your partner express love toward you. Receiving love can feel vulnerable to some people because it requires letting go of control.  Be open to receiving gifts, accepting compliments, and warm gestures toward you. You may feel like you now owe something back, but let that go and enjoy the experience of receiving. Love does not have debts but multiplies. Touching does not need to be sexual, but engaging in a long, supportive hug or reaching out for your partner’s hand is a way to stay connected. Express your love for your partner by initiating and sustaining physical contact. Affection is one way to express care, appreciation, and other connecting, positive emotions.  Affection is a way to make your partner feel loved and for you to feel loving. Sometimes the way we communicate with a partner can be lost in translation, but gratitude is always understood. Affirm your appreciation of your partner by expressing gratitude. Thank your partner for showing that you notice the effort put into the relationship. Show appreciation for the things your partner does, and also for the qualities that your loved one embodies. The whole point of going through life with people you love is so that you can tackle life’s challenges together. Work together to find solutions, solve problems, and comfort each other when times get tough. We can’t solve everything on our own, we can’t know everything there is to know... but a whole bunch of people getting together out of love can solve just about any problem.","output":"This article talks about how to have a good relationship with someone you love.

Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is?

Berlusconi also defended Mussolini for allying himself with Hitler, saying he likely reasoned that it would be better to be on the winning side. The media mogul, whose conservative forces are polling second in voter surveys ahead of next month's election, spoke to reporters on the sidelines of a ceremony in Milan to commemorate the Holocaust. In 1938, before the outbreak of World War II, Mussolini's regime passed the so-called \\"racial laws,\\" barring Jews from Italy's universities and many professions, among other bans. When Germany's Nazi regime occupied Italy during the war, thousands from the tiny Italian Jewish community were deported to death camps. \\"It is difficult now to put oneself in the shoes of who was making decisions back then,\\" Berlusconi said of Mussolini's support for Hitler. \\"Certainly the (Italian) government then, fearing that German power would turn into a general victory, preferred to be allied with Hitler's Germany rather that oppose it.\\" Berlusconi added that \\"within this alliance came the imposition of the fight against, and extermination of, the Jews. Thus, the racial laws are the worst fault of Mussolini, who, in so many other aspects, did good.\\" More than 7,000 Jews were deported under Mussolini's regime, and nearly 6,000 of them were killed. Reactions of outrage, along with a demand that Berlusconi be prosecuted for promoting Fascism, quickly followed his words. Berlusconi's praise of Mussolini constitutes \\"an insult to the democratic conscience of Italy,\\" said Rosy Bindi, a center-left leader. \\"Only Berlusconi's political cynicism, combined with the worst historic revisionism, could separate the shame of the racist laws from the Fascist dictatorship.\\" Italian laws enacted following the country's disastrous experience in the war forbid the encouragement of Fascism. A candidate for local elections, Gianfranco Mascia, pledged that he and his supporters will present a formal complaint on Monday to Italian prosecutors, seeking to have Berlusconi prosecuted. Advocating aggressive nationalism, Mussolini used brutish force and populist appeal evoking ancient Rome's glories to achieve and keep his dictatorial grip on power, starting in the early '20s and lasting well into World War II. His Fascist \\"blackshirt\\" loyalists cracked down on dissidents, through beatings and jailings. He encouraged big families to propagate the Italian population, established a sprawling state economy and erected monumental buildings and statues to evoke ancient Rome. Mussolini sought to impose order on a generally individualistic-minded people, and Italians sometimes note trains ran on time during Fascism. With dreams of an empire, he sent Italian troops on missions to attack or occupy foreign lands, including Ethiopia and Albania. Eventually, Italian military failures in Africa and in Greece fostered rebellion among Fascist officials, and in 1943 he was placed under arrest by orders of the Italian king. His end came at the vengeful hands of partisan fighters, who shot him and his mistress, and left their bodies to hang in a Milan square in April 1945. Berlusconi's former government allies have included political heirs to neo-fascist movements admiring Mussolini. In 2010, he told world leaders at a Paris conference that he had been reading Mussolini's journals, and years earlier Berlusconi had claimed that Mussolini \\"never killed anyone.\\" Berlusconi is running in Feb. 24-25 Parliamentary elections and has repeatedly changed his mind on whether he is seeking a fourth term as premier. Monti is also running, but polls put him far behind front-runner Pier Luigi Bersani, a center-left leader who supported Monti's austerity measures to save Italy from the Eurozone debt crisis. Polls show about one-third of eligible voters are undecided. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about former Italian Premier Silvio Berlusconi praising Benito Mussolini, a Fascist dictator, for \\"having done good\\" despite his anti-Jewish laws. This caused a lot of outrage. Berlusconi also defended Mussolini for partnering with Hitler during World War II.

She is one of 26 bloggers for SPARK, an international group founded in 2010. The group fights the use of the female body as a marketing tool in the media. Alice found out about SPARK when the organization launched a campaign demanding Seventeen Magazine feature a more diverse group of models. She applied to be a blogger for the group in May and won one of the positions. Each month, Alice pitches (...) her girl -and women - centric blog post ideas via online chat to an editor at SPARK. So far, she has written about topics such as female actresses, choosing what to wear, and dealing with anger. Alice said she hopes large companies and media stop editing images of women. Increases in bust   size, decreases in waist size, smoothing and whitewashing skin are what Alice notes. \\"We want them to know that these images are bad for our development,\\" Alice said. \\"Three out of four teen girls feel bad about themselves after reading a fashion magazine for three minutes,\\" she said, according to SPARK's research.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Li family belonged to the northwest military aristocracy prevalent during the Sui dynasty and claimed to be paternally descended from the Daoist founder, Laozi (whose personal name was Li Dan or Li Er) the Han dynasty General Li Guang and Western Liang ruler Li Gao.  This family was known as the Longxi Li lineage (Li lineage; 隴西李氏), which includes the Tang poet Li Bai.  The Tang Emperors also had Xianbei maternal ancestry, from Emperor Gaozu of Tang's Xianbei mother, Duchess Dugu. Li Yuan was Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan, modern Shanxi, during the Sui dynasty's collapse, which was caused in part by the Sui failure to conquer the northern part of the Korean peninsula during the Goguryeo–Sui War. He had prestige and military experience, and was a first cousin of Emperor Yang of Sui (their mothers were sisters). Li Yuan rose in rebellion in 617, along with his son and his equally militant daughter Princess Pingyang (d. 623), who raised and commanded her own troops. In winter 617, Li Yuan occupied Chang'an, relegated Emperor Yang to the position of Taishang Huang or retired emperor, and acted as regent to the puppet child-emperor, Yang You. On the news of Emperor Yang's murder by General Yuwen Huaji on June 18, 618, Li Yuan declared himself the emperor of a new dynasty, the Tang.Li Yuan, known as Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, when he was forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin.  Li Shimin had commanded troops since the age of 18, had prowess with bow and arrow, sword and lance and was known for his effective cavalry charges.  Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573–621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621.  In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626.

Prior to her nomination, Benjamin served as CEO of the Bayou La Batre Rural Health Clinic in Alabama, which she founded in 1990.      The Alabama native was also the first African-American woman board member of the American Medical Association, and served a term as chairwoman of the group's Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs.      Deputy Surgeon General Boris D. Lushniak will serve as interim surgeon general until a permanent pick is nominated. ||||| WASHINGTON - U.S. Surgeon General Regina Benjamin, a Mobile native, is stepping down next month after four years as America's top doctor.      \\"I loved serving as (surgeon general), putting prevention in all we do,\\" Benjamin said in a message posted to her Twitter account today. \\"I leave next month confident we created a more healthy & fit nation.\\"      In an email to staff Wednesday, Benjamin said she will remain involved in public health.      “The Surgeon General announced (Wednesday) that she will be stepping down next month,\\" said Dori Salcido, a spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services. \\"We are grateful for her leadership and service.”      Benjamin, 56, was appointed surgeon general by President Barack Obama in 2009.

What is the relationship between 'vassilis leventis' and 'messini'? Answer:","output":"Vassilis Leventis and Messini share a connection through their origins and context within Greek politics and administrative divisions. Vassilis Leventis is a Greek politician who was born in Messene, Messenia, in 1951. He is the leader and founder of the Union of Centrists, a political party in Greece that follows a Centrism and Venizelism ideology while supporting Greece's integral part within the European Union. Messini, on the other hand, is both a municipality (dimos) and municipal unit (dimotiki enotita) within the regional unit of Messenia, which falls under the region of Peloponnese. Its importance lies in its administrative role in the region, being the seat (edra) of the municipality of Messini. Before the 2011 Kallikratis plan, Messini held a similar position under the Kapodistrias Plan, though it was then a local division within the independent municipality of Ithomi rather than its own full-fledged municipality. The relationship between Vassilis Leventis and Messini is rooted in their shared ties to the region of Messenia and broader Greek political landscape. As a prominent political figure from the area, Leventis has likely influenced or been influenced by policies and initiatives affecting the region, including those involving Messini and its surrounding areas.

Fun, experience, the chance to meet new people --- these are the reasons we try to outdo each other. People will compete over anything. Every Christmas, my neighbors and I have a little Christmas light competition. It is heaven for the electric company, but I think we give Will Rogers Airport a scare. It is bright enough to land a plane in our front yards. I admit that last year my neighbors won, but only because they bought every strand of lights Wal-Mart had before I could get there. Personal competitions are great, but we get a little carried away. I cannot stand to see coaches shout at kids playing sports. Who cares if someone messes up and the other team advances? I'm tired of people competing just to win. It happens not only in sports, but in music competitions, too. People auditioning for chair placement in certain bands can get really unfriendly. This year I did not audition for a certain band, but I went to auditions anyway. This was the first time I actually had the opportunity to comprehend the whole picture. Other times I've been the person who was nervous and anxious. This time, I sat back and observed everyone else. I came to the realization that the people who aren't so good are terrified of the good people, and the good people are scared stiff that the bad people have taken lessons and can now show them up.

Being disrespectful to opponents , letting competition become our life, and becoming so involved that we close ourselves off from friends and family is not the meaning of competition.

Eli -- a sweet, active, blonde-haired preschooler -- had gone to sleep feeling fine, perhaps dreaming of playing with his sisters or having a fun day at school. He didn't make it through the night. While the young boy died sometime between the night of Wednesday, September 24, and the following morning, it wasn't until Friday night that authorities figured out why: enterovirus D68, a particularly pernicious strain of an otherwise common virus that has been particularly widespread this year. While it's been detected in at least four people who died, Eli's case is the first in which authorities have definitively cited enterovirus D68 as the cause of death. Jeff Plunkett, the health officer in Eli's hometown of Hamilton Township, New Jersey, explained Saturday that, while the boy was born premature, \\"he had no other existing condition\\" and his parents no reason to believe he was direly ill before the virus took his life. Eli was 4. \\"He was asymptomatic and fine, and the next morning he had passed,\\" Plunkett told reporters. \\"So the onset was very rapid, very sudden. And that's clearly the big difference (between enterovirus D68 and other enterovirus strains).\\" Authorities are testing one other child who attended preschool at Eli's school, Yardville Elementary, albeit in a different class, for enterovirus D68. That boy has been treated at  Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital and is now recovering at home, according to Plunkett. There are no other suspected cases in the town of 90,000 residents. Nor is there any sign of pervasive sickness at Yardville Elementary or other town schools, with attendance levels around normal. This speaks to the deadliness, the randomness and, in a sense, the pervasiveness of enterovirus D68. Hamilton Township Mayor Kelly Yaede pointed out that his parents \\"nor anyone will ever be able to determine where Eli may have contracted this virus.\\" \\"The virus is out in the community, there is nothing we can do about that,\\" the health officer said. \\"The way to prevent it is from your own personal hygiene and be vigilant with your own children and yourself.\\" Officials did not disclose Eli's last name during a Saturday press briefing. More enterovirus cases are likely. Just last week, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or state public health laboratories had confirmed 277 cases of enterovirus D68. That figure has skyrocketed in recent days, to 538 confirmed cases in 43 states and the District of Columbia as of Friday. And there's no reason to think it won't get even worse. As the CDC points out, \\"Enteroviruses commonly circulate in summer and fall. We're currently in middle of the enterovirus season.\\" Not including Eli's cases, tests showed enterovirus D68 in four people who had died. The CDC, though, reported then that \\"the role that EV-D68 infection played in these deaths is unclear at this time.\\" Mercer County's medical examiner, Dr. Raafat Ahmad, was unequivocal about it's part in Eli's death. \\"The child had some brain swelling, it had some lymph node swelling,\\" Plunkett said. \\"But Ahmad attributed that to the virus as the cause of death.\\" Enterovirus is very common, with the CDC estimating 10 million to 15 million infections each year in the United States. But it has about 100 strains, with D68 among the most dangerous. Authorities say this strain has sent more children than usual to the hospital with severe respiratory illnesses. It seems to be most affecting children with a history of asthma or breathing problems. Enterovirus may also be linked to a small number of cases of a mysterious neurologic illness in Colorado, Boston and Michigan. Doctors in Colorado spotted it first -- a group of 10 children hospitalized with limb weakness, cranial nerve dysfunction and abnormalities in their spinal gray matter. Staff at Boston Children's Hospital have since identified four patients with the same symptoms. And a child in Washtenaw County, Michigan, has also developed partial paralysis in the lower limbs after being hospitalized with the virus, according to the Michigan Department of Community Health. As Plunkett, the Hamilton Township health officer, explained: \\"The D68 strain is a very virulent strain of entire that would attack young children, preschoolers, toddlers who have for the most part compromised immune systems. It has a certain target in our population.\\" Hygiene education, cleaning ramped up in schools. It's not clear, though, whether Eli should have been any more susceptible than anyone else, beyond his age. That and the suddenness of his death makes it especially difficult to fathom or fully understand. People in Hamilton Township, at least, are doing something about it. While officials say they're being careful not to overly alarm students, they are stressing things like hand washing, sneezing into your sleeves, staying home if you're sick and the like to students, teachers and parents to try to prevent the spread of enterovirus D68 and other viruses. Superintendent Jim Parla also said \\"we have ramped up cleaning in all of our schools,\\" devoting extra staff and hours to \\"do cleaning that goes above and beyond what we normally do.\\" Then there's the matter of taking care of Eli's family, namely his parents -- both educators -- and two young sisters. Yardville Elementary Principal Elena Manning said that blue-and-yellow bows, her school's colors, are being put up around the community in Eli's honor. The late boy's preschool teacher and an assistant bought a girlish bedroom set and rug to decorate his sisters' room at home. And the school will soon have a \\"Proud of Me\\" wall to display students' work, because Eli would regularly \\"ask Daddy if Daddy was proud of him,\\" according to Manning. Eli's parents are working with school officials on other things. But their focus now is more on grieving, taking care of their daughters and sending a message to the community. According to Principal Manning, \\"They are most concerned about giving thanks, which is incredible.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Eli, a 4-year-old boy, got sick and passed away because of enterovirus D68. Enterovirus D68 is a strong type of virus that can make young children, especially those with weak immune systems, very sick. It has been spreading more this year and has affected many children in the United States. To prevent the spread of the virus, people are encouraged to practice good hygiene habits like washing hands and staying home when sick. The family and community are remembering Eli and trying to help keep other children healthy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context:  Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the subject whose identification with the cathedral itself is emphasized by her monumental stature?

Albion failed to register a single shot on target, although Craig Dawson headed over and Stephane Sessegnon slashed wide after the break. Villa rarely threatened with Ashley Westwood's low shot their best effort. Villa have been written off as relegation certainties by many onlookers, cut adrift at the bottom of the table following a miserable first half of the Premier League campaign. The Midlanders had earned just eight points after 20 matches, but have managed to give themselves - and their beleaguered fans - a modicum of hope in recent weeks. A home win against Crystal Palace - their first victory since the opening day - has been followed by successive draws at Leicester and Albion. But they still remain nine points adrift of safety with 15 matches remaining. Villa are the league's lowest goalscorers, having netted just 18 times this season, and their lack of cutting edge hampered them again at The Hawthorns. Remi Garde's men enjoyed more than 60% of possession and managed 15 attempts at the Albion goal, but home keeper Ben Foster was rarely stretched. Albion were aiming to clinch a top-flight double over Villa for the first time in 51 years, having won 1-0 at Villa Park in September. England Under-21 striker Saido Berahino was their match-winner on that day, but he has rarely made an impact since amid uncertainty about his future at Albion. Berahino was introduced with about half an hour left against Villa as Tony Pulis tried to add some much-needed attacking impetus to his team. But Berahino, like the rest of the home side, failed to seriously trouble Villa keeper Mark Bunn. Albion did not manage a shot on target when they lost at Southampton last weekend - and failed to do so again. However, the point did move Pulis' side - who are 13th - seven points clear of the bottom three. Aston Villa manager Remi Garde: \\"I'm a little bit disappointed because we wanted three points. In another situation we might be happy with a point but we need more points than that.

Villa should have been awarded a first-half penalty when Jordan Ayew was fouled by Albion's Jonas Olsson. West Brom failed to register a single shot on target, while Villa's best chance was a low shot by Ashley Westwood. The result leaves Villa still nine points from safety at the bottom of the table, while West Brom moves seven points clear of the relegation zone. Aston Villa manager Remi Garde expressed his disappointment with the result, stating that the team needs more points. Garde also mentioned the potential first-half penalty and acknowledged that his team needs to improve their accuracy in front of goal. On the other hand, West Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis praised his team's effort and commitment, as they managed to grind out a point against a determined Aston Villa side. Both teams now shift their focus to their upcoming FA Cup ties next weekend."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is an article: GREENSBORO, N.C., May 25 (AP)  A grass-roots commission that investigated the 1979 shooting deaths of five communist organizers by members of the Ku Klux Klan and the American Nazi Party laid the bulk of blame for the violence on Thursday on the Greensboro police, who knew that the white supremacists had planned to attend the \\"Death to the Klan\\" march, but failed to take action. The \\"single most important element that contributed to the violent outcome of the confrontation was the absence of police\\" from the Nov. 3, 1979, march, the panel, the Greensboro Truth and Reconciliation Commission, wrote in a summary of its report. Despite having a paid informer among the Klansmen, the police \\"showed a stunning lack of curiosity in planning for the safety of the event,\\" commissioners wrote. The report also found fault with both the Klan and Nazi members who opened fire and the communist activists who underestimated the danger posed by repeating their verbal baiting of the Klan. Five people died when Klan and Nazi members opened fire on people gathering for a march and rally in the city's Morningside Homes neighborhood. Ten others were injured. Debate has raged for years over whether the incident was a shooting or a shootout. The commission concluded that some members of the communist Workers Voice Organization, which organized the rally, were armed and did fire at the Nazi and Klan members, but only after the Nazis and Klansmen had fired as many as five shots. The gunmen were captured on videotape by journalists covering the rally, but six people who were charged in the case were acquitted of murder charges at a state trial in 1980. A Klan leader was also acquitted in 1984 of federal charges of conspiracy to interfere with a federal investigation. The lack of criminal convictions, along with a feeling that city leaders had swept the shootings under the rug, has been a source of dissatisfaction among minorities and liberal activists here. The seven-member commission held three public hearings on the matter in 2005. A ceremony was held Thursday at a chapel on the campus of Bennett College for Women. Five lilies represented the victims: Sandra Smith, Cesar Cauce, Dr. James Waller, Dr. Michael Nathan and William Sampson.

It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year. In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school.As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor. It provides vaccinations, family planning consultations, and prenatal information. A maternity hospital was founded in 1991 which is decorated with a fresco by Malang Badji, one of the most famous artists in the region.The Ph.D. thesis published in 2003, La part de l'autre: une aventure humaine en terre Diola, meaning \\"Part of the Other: A Human Adventure in Jola Territory,\\" describes the health challenge present on the island in a more general context.

It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.  Question: \\"What happens when the heat reaches the surface of your skin?\\" Answer: \\"Cools body\\" Is this answer correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

After U2 guitarist the Edge worked individually with Rubin in Los Angeles, the group spent two weeks in September 2006 completing songs with the producer at Abbey Road Studios in London. Later that year, the band released two songs from these sessions on the compilation album U218 Singles: a cover of the Skids' \\"The Saints Are Coming\\" with Green Day, and \\"Window in the Skies\\". In January 2007, lead singer Bono said U2 intended to take their next album in a different musical direction from their previous few releases.

When the 22-year-old entered college in 2009, he decided not to change his rural residence to a students' collective one. But when he finished college and was offered a job with a state-owned enterprise in Beijing, Sun was told that he couldn't accept the offer unless he had an urban hukou (household registration record). This time, he had no choice but to change his residence status. Transferring hukou to a university became optional in 2003, and many students are confronted with the dilemma of whether to do so or not. Professionals suggest they make the decision based on their current situation and future plans. 'I regret transferring my hukou' Wang Jinbi, 20, is an accounting major at Beijing Union University. Coming from Chifeng, Inner Mongolia autonomous region, she transferred her hukou when she enrolled at university. \\"I didn't think it was a big deal,\\" Wang says. \\"Since I'm registering under an urban hukou, it doesn't matter whether it's in Beijing or Inner Mongolia, I thought.\\" What Wang didn't expect, however, is that she would regret her decision later. \\"After two years of study, I've figured out my future plans. I want to return to my hometown and make a living there,\\" she says. That means Wang needs to transfer her hukou back again, which she worries will be a troublesome procedure. \\"I have a friend who graduated last year. She spent a lot of time and energy transferring her hukou back to her hometown again due to complicated paperworks,\\" says Wang. Guidelines for transferring hukou Wang's experience is not uncommon. Many students don't know what their decision means for their future. In order to help these students, Xie Yongqiang, from the Chengdu Municipal Bureau of Justice, posted a guideline for transferring hukou on a micro blog. According to Xie, students should firstly think about where they're going to stay. \\"If you like the city where you're studying and are considering staying there after graduation, then you should transfer your hukou,\\" he wrote. Students should also transfer their hukou if they intend to participate in an exchange program. According to Ju Haojie, deputy director of the household registration department at Shanghai Jiao Tong University, when applying for exchange programs, it saves a lot of trouble if students have a collective hukou registered under the university. But Xie also made suggestions for students with a rural registration. \\"If your family has land and a house, it's possible that you'll get a share of compensation in the event of a forced relocation. For those students, I would recommend them not to transfer their hukou,\\" he wrote. This doesn't affect students in terms of receiving medical insurance and other benefits at university. 'I want to stay in Beijing' Sometimes, students abandon their rural hukou for the prospect of a better future. Tang Yanwei is one of them. The 23-year-old from Yantai, Shandong province, had a rural hukou but transferred it after enrolling at Beijing University of Civil Engineering and Architecture. Although there are a lot of preferential policies for rural residents, for Tang, an urban hukou in Beijing is attractive. \\"I want to stay in Beijing, so a students' collective Beijing urban hukou is a promising start,\\" he says. \\"I'll do anything that could help me stay here. After all, there's no turning back for me now.\\" Now, provide a numbered list of answers to these questions: 1. What decision did Sun Yukun make? 2. Was that a good decision for him? 3. Why? 4. Is this an issue for many students? 5. Is it difficult to maintain previous residential status after if you want to move home? 6. What should the decision be based on? 7. Is it optional? 8.

At Armory’s Winter Antiques Show, Volumes of Variety Celebrated masterpieces are all well and good, but the less-well-lit nooks and crannies of art history are also needed to sustain a true art lover. That’s what a big fair like the Winter Antiques Show at the Park Avenue Armory is especially good for. With 73 purveyors of rare and remarkable objects, from ancient Egyptian sculpture to Modernist painting, it offers innumerable opportunities to encounter and learn about aspects of painting, decorative arts, furniture, jewelry or glass that might be new to even the best-informed visitors. You probably have never heard of Emerson Burkhart (1905-1969) of Columbus, Ohio, for example. He once was a famous American Social Realist painter. Coming upon his nearly life-size portrait of a grizzled, elderly black man from 1943, at Jonathan Boos, you might think you’ve discovered a previously unknown painting by Ivan Albright. Rendered in extreme detail enhanced by white highlighting, Burkhart’s subject, Oscar Coleman, sits in a distressed armchair, wearing a tie, two shirts and a corduroy vest. His lined, worried face and gnarled hands testify to a Lear-like history of anxiety and suffering. Burkhart titled the portrait with a dubious sentiment — “The Life of the Spirit Is Elevated by Pain” — but the painting nevertheless is affectingly empathetic. Another dramatic portrait of a black man, this one Shakespearean, is in the form of a technically impressive bust at Bowman Sculpture’s booth. “Bust of Othello: The Moor of Venice,” by Pietro Calvi (1833-1884), represents our tragic hero contemplating the handkerchief he’d given to Desdemona, who is now dead. He’s enveloped in a hooded robe of white marble, while his face and hands are made of nearly black cast bronze. Looking closely, you see he’s shedding a single tear. An interesting side note is that Calvi based his portrait on the features of Ira Aldridge (1807-1867), the actor who was the first black man to play Othello in Europe. Unless you’re an architect or a historian of the field, you may not know the name of Samuel Yellin, either. A Polish-born ironworker, Yellin set up shop in Philadelphia in 1909, and by 1928 employed 268 men to fulfill hundreds of commissions for metal work. Railings, window grilles and gates at the Cloisters were produced by Yellin. His inventive way with metal is represented by a floor lamp, from around 1925, at the Conner Rosenkranz booth. With its inverted, conical shade of dark metal; its square-section stem; and incongruously graceful three legs and feet, it looks like something a steampunk artist might have dreamed up. Another eminent craftsman not widely known outside his profession was the Danish furniture maker Tage Frid, to whom Moderne Gallery has devoted its entire booth. As a professor of woodworking at the Rhode Island School of Design from 1962 to 1985 and an editor of Fine Woodworking magazine, Mr. Frid exerted a huge influence on the craft of fine-furniture making. He particularly abhorred woodworkers who prized fancy design over sound construction. You can see his ethos of plain-spoken, well-made simplicity in the tables and chairs on view here, including an example of his most celebrated design, “Three-Legged Stool,” which looks like the child of a Shaker artisan and a Danish Modern designer. Along with a delightful set of a dozen 18th-century pocket-watch-size miniatures in oval frames picturing a rabbit, a donkey and 10 different species of birds, at Elle Shushan, there’s a small, deftly made pastel self-portrait by John Raphael Smith. Yet another artist, forgotten now, who was well known during his lifetime — in 18th-century England — Smith was celebrated for his mezzotint prints and pastel portraits. He also happened to be J. M. W. Turner’s first teacher. If you like miniatures — and even if you don’t — one don’t-miss booth is that of Les Enluminures, which has a splendid display of small-to-tiny illuminated books, manuscripts and individual paintings. One visionary paperback-book-size painting is “The Creation of the World,” made by a follower of Giovanni di Paolo around 1475. Followers of modern painting will recognize the name of Allan D’Arcangelo, but they might be surprised by his “Guard Rail” (1964), at Geoffrey Diner. Mr. D’Arcangelo was well known in the ’60s for his expansive, graphically vivid paintings of highways and road signs, which combine Modernist abstraction and Pop Art. This piece is unusual because it has an assertive sculptural element, a rare thing for Mr. D’Arcangelo. The painted part features a diamond-shaped vignette of a white road with black stripes cut into a field of reddish orange. The sculptural part is a real segment of chain-link fencing topped by barbed wire mounted over more than half of the picture. Anticipating by decades the similarly dystopian use of chain-link fencing by the sculptor Cady Noland, it evokes the dark side of the American dream of infinite mobility with eerie prescience. There are lots of folk art in the show, including a lovely and amusing quilt bearing a pattern of black elephants on an intricately stitched red field. Made between 1930 and 1950 by an unknown Pennsylvanian, it’s at Old Hope Antiques. A piece of folk art with a rich back story, at Allan Katz, is a tall secretary from 1876. Made of dark oak and walnut, it has a large clock on its top and is decorated all over with stars, eyes and fan shapes made of white bone. On an upper door, neatly cutout letters spell the name of J. F. Bingham, a soldier in the 16th Regiment of the Connecticut Infantry who was killed at Antietam in 1862. This memorial was made by unidentified friends of Wells Bingham, the dead soldier’s brother; he also fought at Antietam but survived the war. The friends presented it to him in the centennial year of the United States. Sadly, Wells Bingham committed suicide in 1904 at the age of 58. Of course, there are masterpieces to be seen. One is a major painting by the great Hudson River School painter Asher B. Durand called “Lake Hamlet” (1855). Depicting a peaceful, gleaming lake, with purple mountains in the distance, it’s an inspirational expression of transcendentalist faith in God and nature.

Make this lower case","output":"The cluster participants have been tasked with delivering the material for conflict scenarios in Cluster 22. They must work on this project by themselves, which means that they need to collaborate, brainstorm, and develop different perspectives on potential conflicts that could arise within the cluster. After a session of group work, they have managed to come up with headlines for three distinct scenarios that explore a variety of challenges the cluster might face. These headlines help to focus the subsequent discussion and analysis of each potential conflict. The three scenarios are presented as follows: 1. \\"power balance in the cluster\\": This scenario examines the distribution of influence and authority within Cluster 22. Some members may possess greater control or leverage due to their resources, connections, or expertise, while others might find themselves in a position of lesser power. This imbalance could potentially lead to disagreements between members, as well as tensions and competition. This scenario urges the participants to analyze the current power dynamics within the cluster and determine ways to address and mitigate conflicts before they escalate. 2. \\"disagreement on the strategic direction of the cluster\\": Cluster 22 may face disputes regarding its overarching goals, objectives, or strategies. These disagreements could stem from differing opinions on how the cluster should prioritize its resources, which projects it should pursue, or which partnerships should be established. A lack of consensus on the cluster's strategic direction could hinder its progress and create tensions between members. This scenario prompts the participants to engage in a constructive dialogue, share their differing perspectives, and come to a mutual understanding to find the best path forward for the cluster. 3. \\"some members are milking the cluster dry\\": In this scenario, certain individuals or organizations within Cluster 22 may be exploiting the cluster's resources, taking advantage of collaborative opportunities, and reaping the benefits without adequately contributing or sharing in the overall responsibilities. This situation could create resentment among the other members and weaken the sense of trust and cooperation that is essential to a successful cluster. To address this concern, the participants are encouraged to scrutinize the contributions and expectations of each member, setting the foundation for more equitable and fair collaboration. In summary, the three conflict scenarios identified by the group - \\"power balance in the cluster\\", \\"disagreement on the strategic direction of the cluster\\", and \\"some members are milking the cluster dry\\" - serve as a starting point for Cluster 22 participants to evaluate and manage potential challenges. Through collaborative discussion and proactive planning, the group aims to tackle these issues head-on and find solutions that both maintain harmony within the cluster and ensure its continued growth and success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While the Man Called Office Desk (MCOD, or simply Cod in an alternative version) was writing an intuitive program for the management of empty office desk space in software companies, a thing that nobody had ever expected to happen happened. Warm became fused with the chair. The staff at 0-1 Computer were disappointed, they had expected Cod to fuse with a desk.

Martha grew up in a household that always kept their bread in the freezer so that's what she does with her bread.  Which woman's bread will grow mold slower?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. They are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, when you fry an egg, turning up the heat causes the egg to cook faster. The same principle explains why storing food in a cold refrigerator reduces the rate at which food spoils (see Figure below ). Both food frying and food spoiling are chemical reactions that happen faster at higher temperatures.

The federal authorities targeted the stables and horse ranch in their investigation of a money-laundering operation connected to one of Mexico's most powerful and ruthless drug cartels, the Zetas.  Jose Trevino Morales, whose stables were the primary focus of the investigation, was accused of running the sophisticated money-laundering operation on behalf of his older brother, Miguel Angel Trevino Morales. Miguel is a key figure in the Zetas drug operation, and he is presumed to have set up the horse operation that his younger brother managed from the sprawling ranch near Lexington, just south of Oklahoma City. Workers at the prominent quarter horse track in New Mexico were acutely aware of the Trevino family's alleged criminal activities, even giving the stables a nickname, the \\"Zetas' stables.\\" Federal agents staged a strategic raid on Tuesday morning at the Lexington race track and the horse ranch in Oklahoma to gather evidence and dismantle the alleged money-laundering scheme. Armed with bulletproof vests and the full support of federal law enforcement agencies, these agents worked to secure the premises and gather evidence to support the allegations against the Trevino brothers and their suspected associates. The agents remained highly alert during the operation, aware of the potential danger posed by the notoriously violent Zetas cartel. The bags of cash observed by workers at the stables were likely an integral part of the alleged money-laundering operation. Authorities believe that these funds were funnelled through the horse racing business, allowing the Zetas cartel to launder their illicit drug profits into seemingly legitimate assets, such as expensive racehorses. Through this complex operation, the drug cartel was able to maintain and expand its power and reach while obscuring the true sources of its vast wealth. With the raid on the Lexington race track and Oklahoma horse ranch, federal authorities aimed to strike a significant blow against the Zetas cartel's financial operations and weaken the criminal organization. The successful apprehension of crucial evidence and individuals involved in the money-laundering scheme could lead to the eventual dismantling of the cartel's economic infrastructure, as well as the incarceration of key figures in its leadership."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi touted the agreement in a letter to her Democratic colleagues, saying negotiators \\"fought for and achieved drastic reductions to the Trump/GOP plan,\\" including much less funding for the wall than Trump requested and a limit on the number of immigrants that can be... Question: After Trump's Twitter post, citizens of the US are probably feeling what way towards Trump? Options:  A. Frustrated and confused  B. Happy and excited  C. not enough information  D. Calm and reserved  === The correct answer is A:","output":"Frustrated and confused After President Trump's Twitter post about potentially vetoing the 1.3 trillion spending bill, it is likely that many US citizens are feeling frustrated and confused for several reasons.  Firstly, the spending bill was created after extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, representing a significant effort on both sides to come to an agreement. This bipartisan effort is not common in the currently polarized political climate, and citizens may have been hopeful that a compromise was reached that could potentially prevent a government shutdown and deal with multiple pressing issues. However, Trump's unexpected threat to veto the bill introduces uncertainty and raises the risk of a government shutdown, which could disrupt public services, affect government employees, and potentially harm the economy. This threat may cause frustration among citizens who had hoped for stability and continuity in government operations. Additionally, citizens may be confused about Trump's reasoning for the potential veto. In his Twitter post, he claims that the Democrats have abandoned DACA recipients, yet the spending bill offered no protections for the young undocumented immigrants only because the White House and Republicans did not support the bipartisan DACA proposals that were previously presented. This lack of support from the White House contributes to the absence of DACA protections in the bill, adding to the confusion of the public on Trump's stated reasoning. Lastly, the border wall funding issue may also contribute to citizens' frustration and confusion. While the bill does not fully fund the border wall, it still provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and a portion of the wall – a compromise reached in the negotiations. Trump's insistence on full funding for the project, a campaign promise he made, might be seen as a disregard for the concession made by Democrats and the essential nature of the spending bill to keep the government running. Considering these factors, it can be concluded that many citizens of the US would likely feel frustrated and confused towards Trump's stance on vetoing the spending bill."},{"instruction":"Question: Title: Thrilling Storyline!

Objective: make chicken salad Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","output":"When evaluating the soundness of naive physics reasoning, we look to determine which solution adheres more closely to our common sense understanding of the physical world. Although you have not provided specific solutions for making chicken salad, I will present two solutions for your consideration. I'll explain which one is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning and why. Solution 1: Traditional Chicken Salad Recipe 1. Cook 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken breasts by boiling them in water for 10-12 minutes or until fully cooked through. Allow them to cool before shredding or dicing them into small pieces. 2. While the chicken is cooling, finely chop 1/2 cup of red onion, 1/2 cup of celery, and 1/4 cup of fresh parsley. 3. In a large mixing bowl, combine the cooled, shredded chicken, chopped vegetables, and parsley. 4. Add 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Mix until all the ingredients are well combined. 5. Cover and refrigerate the chicken salad for at least an hour or until it is chilled. Serve on a bed of lettuce or as a sandwich. Solution 2: Blended Chicken Salad \\"Smoothie\\" 1. Cook 1 lb of boneless, skinless chicken breasts by boiling them in water for 10-12 minutes or until fully cooked through. Allow them to cool before shredding or dicing them into small pieces. 2. While the chicken is cooling, finely chop 1/2 cup of red onion, 1/2 cup of celery, and 1/4 cup of fresh parsley. 3. In a blender, combine the cooled, shredded chicken, chopped vegetables, and parsley. 4. Add 1/2 cup of mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon of Dijon mustard, 1/2 tablespoon of lemon juice, salt, and pepper to taste. Blend until a smooth consistency is achieved. 5. Pour the chicken salad \\"smoothie\\" into a glass and serve. In terms of naive physics reasoning, Solution 1 is more sound. This solution takes into account our common understanding of how chicken salad should be prepared and consumed. It uses the logical approach of cooking the chicken, then mixing it with vegetables and seasonings to create a well-blended mixture that can be chilled and served easily. On the other hand, Solution 2 deviates from our typical understanding of how chicken salad should be made. Blending all of the ingredients together to create a liquid chicken salad \\"smoothie\\" does not adhere to the fundamental principles of naive physics reasoning, as it goes against our intuitive understanding of the preparation and consumption of chicken salad. People generally expect chicken salad to be a mixture of shredded or diced chicken combined with chopped vegetables and seasonings, not a blended liquid. Therefore, Solution 1 is the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning. It stays true to the commonly accepted method of preparing chicken salad, and it is more consistent with our expectations and understanding of the physical properties of this dish."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Michael Henry Flanders OBE (1 March 1922  14 April 1975) was an English actor, broadcaster, and writer and performer of comic songs. He is best known for his stage partnership with Donald Swann.  - Flanders and Swann were a British comedy duo. The actor and singer Michael Flanders (19221975) and the composer, pianist and lyricist Donald Swann (19231994) collaborated in writing and performing comic songs. They first worked together at a school revue in 1939 and eventually wrote over a hundred comic songs together.  - At the Drop of a Hat is a musical revue by Flanders and Swann, described by them as \\"an after-dinner farrago\\". In the show, they both sang on a nearly bare stage, accompanied by Swann on the piano. The songs were linked by contemporary social commentary, mostly by Flanders. After a long London run the show played in the US, Switzerland, and on tour in Britain.  - At the Drop of Another Hat is musical revue by Flanders and Swann , similar in format to its long - running predecessor , At the Drop of a Hat ( 1956 ) . In the show , they both sang on a nearly bare stage , accompanied by Swann on the piano . The songs were linked by contemporary social commentary , mostly by Flanders . Highlights included \`\` Ill Wind '' , in which Flanders sings rapidly about a pilfered horn to the tune of the Rondo from Mozart 's Horn Concerto No. 4 and \`\` New Built Up Area '' , a soliloquy by Flanders in which a disgruntled resident of Salisbury Plain complains of the newly erected Stonehenge . The revue premiered at the Haymarket Theatre in London on 2 October 1963 and ran until 21 March 1964 . It was revived on the West End , at the Globe Theatre , from 29 September 1965 to 19 February 1966 . The show toured widely , including tours in Australia ( 1964 ) , Hong Kong and England ( 1965 ) and in 1966 Canada and the US . A Broadway production played at the Booth Theatre from 31 December 1966 to 9 April 1967 .  - A revue (from French 'magazine' or 'overview') is a type of multi-act popular theatrical entertainment that combines music, dance and sketches. The revue has its roots in 19th century popular entertainment and melodrama but grew into a substantial cultural presence of its own during its golden years from 1916 to 1932. Though most famous for their visual spectacle, revues frequently satirized contemporary figures, news or literature. Similar to the related subforms of operetta and musical theatre, the revue art form brings together music, dance and sketches to create a compelling show. In contrast to these, however, revue does not have an overarching storyline. Rather, a general theme serves as the motto for a loosely-related series of acts that alternate between solo performances and dance ensembles.

Here is a question about this article: Many contemporary uses of uranium exploit its unique nuclear properties. Uranium-235 has the distinction of being the only naturally occurring fissile isotope. Uranium-238 is fissionable by fast neutrons, and is fertile, meaning it can be transmuted to fissile plutonium-239 in a nuclear reactor. Another fissile isotope, uranium-233, can be produced from natural thorium and is also important in nuclear technology. While uranium-238 has a small probability for spontaneous fission or even induced fission with fast neutrons, uranium-235 and to a lesser degree uranium-233 have a much higher fission cross-section for slow neutrons. In sufficient concentration, these isotopes maintain a sustained nuclear chain reaction. This generates the heat in nuclear power reactors, and produces the fissile material for nuclear weapons. Depleted uranium (238U) is used in kinetic energy penetrators and armor plating.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Given the rod was negatively charged when it touched the neutral electroscope, would the electroscope have a positive or negative charge?  Hint: Similar to the results of a negatively charged rod, if a positively charged rod is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, it will attract some electrons up from the leaves onto the knob. That process causes both of the leaves to be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain positively charged. This is a permanent positive charge.

This option covers all the essential aspects of creating a hummingbird-friendly environment that will entice these beautiful creatures to visit your yard regularly. Here is a detailed plan on how to achieve this: 1. Provide red hummingbird feeders throughout your yard: Hummingbirds are primarily attracted to red, so placing red feeders strategically throughout your yard will help draw them in. It's essential to use hummingbird-specific feeders designed with their unique feeding requirements in mind. These feeders usually have small openings to prevent large birds and insects from consuming the nectar and easy-to-clean parts to maintain proper hygiene. You can use store-bought nectar or make your own using a simple mixture of one part white sugar to four parts water. Boil the solution and let it cool before filling the feeders, and always ensure the feeders are clean, fresh, and full of nectar. 2. Install a birdbath with a mister attachment: Hummingbirds love to bathe and drink clean water, especially if it's moving! A birdbath with a mister attachment is an excellent addition to your hummingbird-friendly yard, as it provides a source of clean, moving water for your feathered guests. A mister attachment sprays a fine mist, which hummingbirds enjoy flying through. This encourages them to visit your yard regularly, as  a clean, reliable water source is vital for their survival. 3. Provide places to perch: Despite their energetic personalities, hummingbirds do need to take breaks and rest from time to time. Create perching spots throughout your yard by adding branches, vines, or trellises. Choose places that are near the feeders and the birdbaths but also provide the birds with some shelter from potential predators. This will give the hummingbirds a sense of security and enable them to relax while visiting your yard. 4. Decorate your yard in red: In addition to the red feeders, it helps to incorporate more red elements throughout your yard as a means of attracting hummingbirds. You can plant red flowering plants such as bee balm, salvia, trumpet vine, and flowering currant, which will not only add a pop of color to your yard but will also provide a natural source of nectar. Alternatively, you can also add red decorative items like flags, wind chimes, or garden stakes to create visual appeal and signal to hummingbirds that your yard is a friendly and inviting space. By implementing these strategies, you'll create an attractive and functional environment that will entice hummingbirds to visit your yard. With a little patience and attention to detail, you'll be able to enjoy the beauty and charm of hummingbirds right outside your door."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As part of a plan to launder billions of dollars in London, \\"the Prince\\" – the head of the Russian Mafia – creates a new bank and has its financial oligarchs sign over their accounts to him. The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick  and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million. Dima refuses to provide the bank account numbers that would verify the corruption until he and his family have been granted asylum in London.

We need to solve for q, which means we need to get q all by itself on one side of the equation. 3. First, let's add 1600*q to both sides of the equation to get all the q terms together. This looks like:    1491 * q - 117458 + 1600 * q = -1600 * q + 1600 * q 4. Now, when we add the q terms together, we get:    (1491 + 1600) * q - 117458 = 0    3091 * q - 117458 = 0 5. Next, let's add 117458 to both sides of the equation:    3091 * q - 117458 + 117458 = 0 + 117458    3091 * q = 117458 6. Finally, in order to find out what q is, let's divide both sides of the equation by 3091:    q = 117458 / 3091 7. When we do the division, we find that q equals 38.

Review: Now don't get me wrong. If you need an insightful summary of everything that been wrong with the history of human civilization as well as a flawless path to brighter future for mankind, who better to turn to than a comedian and practitioner of pop culture? If you need a healthy dose of all the solid, sound reasons why religion has outlived it's usefulness then turn to Sagan or Dawkins, not BILL MAHER for God's(?) sake! That's a good point in and of itself. Maher dismisses our religious past as a neurological disorder conveniently ignoring how his entire society, art and science is rooted in it. In this film, he relies heavily on his keenly-honed skill set of irony and cynicism to make his point while attempting to appear erudite and wise. Unfortunately, his intellect isn't up to the task. Maher makes us laugh but is clearly not the brightest bulb in the box. As an example, he responds to an interviewee's (and I use the term loosely as they were clearly all \\"ambushees\\") assertion that the existence of Jesus is historical fact with a deadpan \\"No, it's not\\" followed by a long stare meant to convey contempt at the subject's naivety (a device nauseatingly overused in this film). The problem is that the person was correct and Maher dead wrong in his assertion that Jesus is mentioned only in what he considers to be the historically- suspect gospels. I guess Mr. Maher has never read the contemporary historian Josephus. But the masses will flock to this pseudo-documentary as they do the fictional works of other intellectual giants like Michael Moore, and they will loudly bray and guffaw (they certainly did at my showing). It's doubly telling, however, that the loudest and most mule-like braying occurred during the approximately 70% of the running time that the film devoted to it's anti-Christian tirade while the audience was wholly mute during the token 10% devoted to criticizing the self-described Religion of Peace. Hmmm. Either criticism of Islam is off-limits to the hip and liberal target audience or they were just afraid to laugh. Very telling, either way.. Now, what is this review like? Pick from: 1. negative; 2. positive;","output":"This review can be characterized as negative. The reviewer criticizes the film for relying on Maher's comedic skills and irony rather than deeper intellectual arguments. The reviewer points out factual inaccuracies in Maher's statements and disapproves of the heavily-targeted critique of Christianity while giving less attention to Islam in the movie. The reviewer also highlights the biased nature of the audience's reaction, finding it hypocritical and indicative of a wider issue with the perception and criticism of different religions. Throughout the review, there is a consistent tone of disapproval and disappointment with both the film's content, Maher's intellectual ability, and the audience's reception of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Lead with Jake Tapper draws not only on Tapper’s deep knowledge of politics and national issues, but also seeks to examine and advance stories across a wide range of topics that demonstrate his own curiosities and interests. Compelling headlines come from around the country and the globe, from politics to money, sports to popular culture, based on news drivers of the day.      The Lead with Jake Tapper airs weekdays at 4 p.m. ET. ||||| It was a catchy political pitch and a chance to calm nerves about his dramatic and complicated plan to bring historic change to America’s health insurance system.      \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\\" President Barack Obama said -- many times -- of his landmark new law.      But the promise was impossible to keep.      So this fall, as cancellation letters were going out to approximately 4 million Americans, the public realized Obama’s breezy assurances were wrong.      Boiling down the complicated health care law to a soundbite proved treacherous, even for its promoter-in-chief. Obama and his team made matters worse, suggesting they had been misunderstood all along. The stunning political uproar led to this: a rare presidential apology.      For all of these reasons, PolitiFact has named \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,\\" the Lie of the Year for 2013. Readers in a separate online poll overwhelmingly agreed with the choice. (PolitiFact first announced its selection on CNN's The Lead with Jake Tapper.)      For four of the past five years, PolitiFact’s Lie of the Year has revolved around the health care law, which has been subject to more erroneous attacks than any other piece of legislation PolitiFact has fact-checked.      Obama’s ideas on health care were first offered as general outlines then grew into specific legislation over the course of his presidency. Yet Obama never adjusted his rhetoric to give people a more accurate sense of the law’s real-world repercussions, even as fact-checkers flagged his statements as exaggerated at best.      Instead, he fought back against inaccurate attacks with his own oversimplifications, which he repeated even as it became clear his promise was too sweeping.      The debate about the health care law rages on, but friends and foes of Obamacare have found one slice of common ground: The president’s \\"you can keep it\\" claim has been a real hit to his credibility.      Why the cancellations happened      How did we get to this point?      The Affordable Care Act tried to allow existing health plans to continue under a complicated process called \\"grandfathering,\\" which basically said insurance companies could keep selling plans if they followed certain rules.      The problem for insurers was that the Obamacare rules were strict. If the plans deviated even a little, they would lose their grandfathered status. In practice, that meant insurers canceled plans that didn’t meet new standards.      Obama’s team seemed to understand that likelihood. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius announced the grandfathering rules in June 2010 and acknowledged that some plans would go away. Yet Obama repeated \\"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\\" when seeking re-election last year.      In 2009 and again in 2012 , PolitiFact rated Obama’s statement Half True, which means the statement is partially correct and partially wrong. We noted that while the law took pains to leave some parts of the insurance market alone, people were not guaranteed to keep insurance through thick and thin. It was likely that some private insurers would continue to force people to switch plans, and that trend might even accelerate.      In the final months of 2013, several critical elements of the health care law were being enacted, and media attention was at its height. Healthcare.gov made its debut on Oct. 1. It didn’t take long for the media, the public and Obama’s own team to realize the website was a technological mess, freezing out customers and generally not working.      Also on Oct. 1, insurers started sending out cancellation letters for 2014.      No one knows exactly how many people got notices, because the health insurance market is largely private and highly fragmented. Analysts estimated the number at about 4 million (and potentially higher), out of a total insured population of about 262 million.      That was less than 2 percent, but there was no shortage of powerful anecdotes about canceled coverage.      One example: PBS Newshour interviewed a woman from Washington, D.C., who was a supporter of the health care law and found her policy canceled. New policies had significantly higher rates. She told Newshour that the only thing the new policy covered that her old one didn’t was maternity care and pediatric services. And she was 58.      \\"The chance of me having a child at this age is zero. So, you know, I ask the president, why do I have to pay an additional 5,000 a year for maternity coverage that I will never, ever need?\\" asked Deborah Persico.      The administration’s botched response      Initially, Obama and his team didn’t budge.      First, they tried to shift blame to insurers. \\"FACT: Nothing in #Obamacare forces people out of their health plans,\\" said Valerie Jarrett, a top adviser to Obama, on Oct. 28.      PolitiFact rated her statement False . The restrictions on grandfathering were part of the law, and they were driving cancellations.      Then, they tried to change the subject. \\"It’s important to remember both before the ACA was ever even a gleam in anybody’s eye, let alone passed into law, that insurance companies were doing this all the time, especially in the individual market because it was lightly regulated and the incentives were so skewed,\\" said White House Press Secretary Jay Carney.      But what really set everyone off was when Obama tried to rewrite his slogan, telling political supporters on Nov. 4, \\"Now, if you have or had one of these plans before the Affordable Care Act came into law, and you really liked that plan, what we said was you can keep it if it hasn’t changed since the law passed.\\"      Pants on Fire ! PolitiFact counted 37 times when he’d included no caveats, such as a high-profile speech to the American Medical Association in 2009: \\"If you like your health care plan, you'll be able to keep your health care plan, period. No one will take it away, no matter what.\\"      Even Obama’s staunchest allies cried foul.      On Nov. 6, columnist Clarence Page of the Chicago Tribune wrote that the public \\"was entitled to hear the unvarnished truth, not spin, from their president about what they were about to face. I don't feel good about calling out Obama's whopper, because I support most of his policies and programs. But in this instance, he would have to be delusional to think he was telling the truth.\\"      The next day, Obama apologized during a lengthy interview with NBC News’ Chuck Todd.      \\"We weren’t as clear as we needed to be in terms of the changes that were taking place, and I want to do everything we can to make sure that people are finding themselves in a good position, a better position than they were before this law happened. And I am sorry that they are finding themselves in this situation based on assurances they got from me,\\" he said.      Political fist-fight      The reaction from conservative talk shows was withering. On Nov. 11, Sean Hannity put Obama’s statements up there with President Richard Nixon’s \\"I am not a crook,\\" and President Bill Clinton’s \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\\"      On the liberal network MSNBC, Joy-Ann Reid said the Obama administration’s intention was to fight off attacks like the ones that scuttled Clinton’s health proposals in the early 1990s.      \\"That’s why the administration boiled it down to that, if you like your health care, you can keep it. Big mistake, but it was a mistake that I think came a little bit out of the lesson\\" of the Clinton years, she said Nov. 12.      Two days later, House minority leader Nancy Pelosi defended Obama’s statement as accurate and blamed insurance companies. \\"Did I ever tell my constituents that, if they like their plan, they could keep it? I would have, if I'd ever met anybody who liked his or her plan, but that was not my experience,\\" she said.      Obama offered an administrative fix that same day, allowing state insurance commissioners to extend current plans. But only some have chosen to do so.      In announcing the fix, Obama again conceded he had exaggerated. \\"There is no doubt that the way I put that forward unequivocally ended up not being accurate,\\" he said. \\"It was not because of my intention not to deliver on that commitment and that promise. We put a grandfather clause into the law, but it was insufficient.\\"      It is too soon to say what the lasting impact of \\"if you like your health care plan, you can keep it\\" will be.      The president’s favorability ratings have tumbled in recent weeks.      A Pew Research/USA Today poll conducted Dec. 3-8 found the percentage of people viewing Obama as \\"not trustworthy\\" has risen 15 points over the course of the year, from 30 percent to 45 percent.      Much depends on the law’s continuing implementation and other events during Obama’s final three years in office, said Larry Sabato, a political scientist who runs the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia.      Still, Obama has work to do to win back public trust, Sabato said.      \\"A whole series of presidents developed credibility gaps, because people didn’t trust what they were saying anymore. And that’s Obama’s real problem,\\" he said. \\"Once you lose the trust of a substantial part of the American public, how do you get it back?\\" |||||Summary:","output":"The article discusses the political fallout from President Obama's declaration that \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\\" This statement was made numerous times during his campaign and after the implementation of the Affordable Care Act. However, it became apparent that the promise was impossible to keep, as cancellation letters were sent out to approximately 4 million Americans. This led to a rare presidential apology and PolitiFact naming the statement the \\"Lie of the Year\\" for 2013. The Affordable Care Act aimed to allow existing health plans to continue under a complicated process called \\"grandfathering.\\" However, the stringent rules set by Obamacare meant that plans that deviated even slightly from the new standards lost their grandfathered status, resulting in insurers canceling plans that did not comply. Despite being aware of this possibility, President Obama continued to insist that individuals could keep their existing health care plans. As the health care law continued to be enacted in the final months of 2013, attention turned to the malfunctioning Healthcare.gov website and the significant number of policy cancellations. The consequences were widespread and led to a damaged reputation for the Obama administration. The administration's response to the failed promise was initially to shift blame to insurers and deflect the issue. However, as pressure mounted, President Obama eventually apologized for the confusion and admitted to the inaccuracy of his previous statements. The lasting impact of the \\"If you like your health care plan, you can keep it\\" statement remains to be seen, but President Obama's favorability ratings have decreased significantly. The challenge lies in regaining the trust of the American public over the course of his remaining time in office."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In June 1848, Paris workers, disenchanted with the new government, built barricades and raised red flags.

The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen. A:","output":"In the context provided, Eep's dad, Grug, imprisons the human boy, Guy, in a log.

One such player is Brazilian midfielder Willian Borges da Silva, better known as Willian. With an impressive 56 appearances for Chelsea, he stands as a shining example of perseverance and dedication. Despite having scored just five goals during his time at the club, Willian is eager to contribute even more and develop as an essential piece in the Chelsea puzzle. This article delves into the Brazilian's hunger for growth and improvement, along with the unique energetic vibe he brings to his team. The Drive to Score More Goals Willian's current goal tally at Chelsea, although not staggering, has shown glimpses of the talent that the winger possesses. However, he candidly admits that he is desperate to find the net more often, which is a testament to his yearning for self-improvement and his awareness of his responsibility towards the team. This hunger is not only a part of his personal growth as a footballer but also contributes to the realization that every goal he scores brings his team closer to victory and possibly more silverware for the club. Jose Mourinho's Words of Encouragement Knowing the potential that Willian carries, Chelsea's former manager Jose Mourinho never hesitated to voice his belief in the Brazilian's capabilities. The conversations between the two revealed the strong bond between them, and Mourinho's expertise in extracting the best from his players is widely regarded. With the Portuguese coach's guidance and motivation, Willian's drive to score more goals received a significant boost, with the midfielder gaining confidence and determination to unleash his full potential on the pitch. The Power of Positivity and Good Vibes While Willian's dedication to improving himself as a footballer undoubtedly pushes him towards success, his insistence on maintaining a positive attitude both on and off the field sets him apart from many of his peers. The Brazilian states that he always aims to be happy and share good vibes with those around him. This infectious positivity not only lifts his own personal morale but also creates a healthy and uplifted team atmosphere. By fostering an environment where players can share their happiness, Willian promotes camaraderie among his teammates, which in turn enhances the collective performance of the squad. Moreover, it opens up channels for open communication and boosts the morale of the players, which is essential for the success of any team. Conclusion Willian's journey at Chelsea so far has showcased the Brazilian's commitment to growth, both as a player and as a teammate. His willingness to contribute more goals to the team's success, driven by the guidance of his former mentor, Jose Mourinho, reflects his unyielding desire to push the boundaries of his capabilities. Coupled with the positive energy and good vibes that he brings to the dressing room, Willian motivates those around him to strive for the same excellence. As Chelsea moves ahead, Willian's ambition to score more goals and his ability to foster a positive team culture make him an invaluable asset. By persistently working towards cultivating these qualities, the Brazilian midfielder is set on leaving an indelible mark on the club's history, both on the field and behind the scenes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury.

Context: In the Vietnam air war radar missile kill reliability was approximately 10% at shorter ranges, and even worse at longer ranges due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. At one point in the Vietnam war, the U.S. Navy fired 50 AIM-7 Sparrow radar guided missiles in a row without a hit. Between 1958 and 1982 in five wars there were 2,014 combined heat-seeking and radar guided missile firings by fighter pilots engaged in air-to-air combat, achieving 528 kills, of which 76 were radar missile kills, for a combined effectiveness of 26%. However, only four of the 76 radar missile kills were in the beyond-visual-range mode intended to be the strength of radar guided missiles. The United States invested over 10 billion in air-to-air radar missile technology from the 1950s to the early 1970s. Amortized over actual kills achieved by the U.S. and its allies, each radar guided missile kill thus cost over 130 million. The defeated enemy aircraft were for the most part older MiG-17s, -19s, and -21s, with new cost of 0.3 million to 3 million each. Thus, the radar missile investment over that period far exceeded the value of enemy aircraft destroyed, and furthermore had very little of the intended BVR effectiveness. Question: Which were radar missile kills more reliable in Vietnam, shorter ranges or longer ranges? Answer:","output":"In the Vietnam air war, radar missile kills were more reliable at shorter ranges as compared to longer ranges. The kill reliability of radar-guided missiles was approximately 10% at shorter ranges. However, at longer ranges, the reliability was even worse due to reduced radar return and greater time for the target aircraft to detect the incoming missile and take evasive action. This lower reliability at longer ranges hampered the intended advantage of Beyond-Visual-Range (BVR) effectiveness of radar-guided missiles. There were multiple factors contributing to the lower reliability at longer ranges, including technological limitations, countermeasures employed by enemy aircraft, and the inherent challenges in acquiring and maintaining a lock on the target at greater distances. All these combined, making radar-guided missiles less effective and reliable at beyond-visual-range engagements during the Vietnam air war. As a result, most of the radar missile kills during this period were achieved at shorter ranges as opposed to the longer ranges that these missiles were initially designed for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(I) negative (II) positiveWould the following phrase be considered positive or negative? flat-out amusing , sometimes endearing and often fabulous , with a solid cast , noteworthy characters , delicious dialogue and a wide supply of effective sight gags .","output":"The phrase given can be considered positive.  The first point to note that indicates the positivity of the phrase is the use of the term \\"flat-out amusing\\". This indicates that the speaker found the subject at hand to be unequivocally funny or entertaining, invoking a positive response. The term \\"flat-out\\" signifies that something is fully or completely as described, emphasizing the speaker's pleasure in the subject’s amusement factor.  The phrase \\"sometimes endearing\\" also indicates a positive sentiment, although it carries a suggestion of intermittency. The term \\"endearing\\" carries a deeply positive connotation, associating the subject with affection or fondness. However, the word \\"sometimes\\" may indicate that these feelings are not consistent, but overall, it still adds to the positive aura of the sentiment. The term \\"often fabulous\\" directly adds to the overall positive outlook of the phrase. \\"Fabulous\\" is a term of high praise implying that the subject is extraordinary or amazing. Used in conjunction with the word \\"often,\\" it implies a consistent level of positivity regarding the subject. The phrase \\"with a solid cast\\" exudes positivity by suggesting that the individuals or characters involved in the subject are reliable or competent. \\"Solid\\" suggests substance and quality, which is a positive attribute in any setting. The term \\"noteworthy characters\\" adds to the positive sentiment as \\"noteworthy\\" implies that the characters are worthy of attention or memorable. The term \\"delicious dialogue\\" suggests that the conversations or spoken elements are rich, intriguing, and enjoyable - another positive aspect. Finally, \\"a wide supply of effective sight gags\\" indicates a large amount of visually humorous content that works effectively. This is certainly a positive point if one were reviewing a play, movie, or TV show, as sight gags often contribute towards the entertainment value of these mediums. Therefore, altogether, the phrase exudes positivity. It carries an overwhelmingly positive sentiment towards the subject, signaling that the observer found enjoyment, humor, and high quality in the subject being discussed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated. After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At Corinth, Philip established a \\"Hellenic Alliance\\" (modeled on the old anti-Persian alliance of the Greco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named Hegemon (often translated as \\"Supreme Commander\\") of this league (known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire.

It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below.  Question: \\"How do clouds develop different regions of charges?\\" Answer: \\"Because of motion present in air molecules, water drops, and ice particles\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Instead I was tearing out my already thinning hair and praying to every diety I could remember that this thing would pick up an IP address and keep it.Once I'd get the adapter going you couldn't get near the adapter because if it lost its connection it might never get it back.If you're thinking about buying this card do yourself a favor and buy a gun instead. Suicide would be more rewarding than owning this intolerable piece of crap.I'm sure if I could find the words to capture how I feel about this adapter and its drivers Amazon would censor them.

After a rollercoaster eight months of intense competition with his Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg, the Briton captured a second world title with victory at the final race of the year in Abu Dhabi. The 29-year-old added the 2014 crown at the twilight season finale to the 2008 title he won with McLaren. The hyped desert duel between Hamilton and Rosberg failed to materialize when the German's car lost power from its hybrid energy recovery system at the halfway stage of the race and his challenge fell away. As the sun set on the 2014 season, OPTIONS: - Abu Dhabi prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - British prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - Briton prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - CNN prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - Formula One prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - German prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - Hamilton prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - Lewis Hamilton prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - McLaren prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - Mercedes prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - Nico Rosberg prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning. - Rosberg prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning.","output":"Lewis Hamilton prepared to have dinner with his family and girlfriend, who had surprised him by flying into Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning.

The other options are wrong for the following reasons: - Abu Dhabi, British, Briton, CNN, Formula One, German, McLaren, Mercedes, and Rosberg are all incorrect because they refer to a place, nationality, organization, or car brand, not the person who would be celebrating victory following the Formula One championship. - Nico Rosberg is incorrect because he is the competitor who lost the race, not the winner of the championship, so he would not be the one preparing to have dinner with his family and girlfriend after winning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that Leonard Tresilian wanted to leave his estate to? from the following article ?  The history of Gilwell Park can be traced to 1407, when John Crow owned Gyldiefords, the land that would eventually become Gilwell Park. Between 1407 and 1422, Crow sold the land to Richard Rolfe, and the area became known as Gillrolfes, \\"Gill\\" being Old English for glen. Following Rolfe's death in 1422, different sections of the property came to be called \\"Great Gilwell\\" and \\"Little Gilwell\\". The two areas were named after the Old English \\"wella\\", or spring. A farmhouse has stood at Gilwell Farm ever since. Around this time, an adjoining 5.6 hectares (14 acres) property was purchased by Richard Osborne. In 1442, he built a large dwelling called Osborne Hall, which stood for 300 years. Legend has it that in the early 16th century, King Henry VIII owned the land and built a hunting lodge for his son Edward. Around 1736 the highwayman Dick Turpin began using Gilwell's forests to conceal himself and for ambushing travellers and freight along roads leading into London.In 1754, William Skrimshire purchased Great Gilwell, Little Gilwell, and half of Osborne's estate, including Osborne Hall. Skrimshire demolished Osborne Hall and built a new residence, which he also called Osborne Hall. That building is now called the White House. Timbers in the White House can be dated to this time, but not to any previous era. Leonard Tresilian (?–1792) bought the estate in 1771 and expanded the land holdings and size of the residence. Tresilian's first wife, Margaret Holland, died young after bearing three daughters. He then married Elizabeth Fawson. Desiring that Gilwell pass on to his eldest daughter, also named Margaret (1750 – c.1844), Tresilian drew up a detailed prenuptial agreement with Fawson's father. By the time of Tresilian's death in 1792, the younger Margaret had married William Bassett Chinnery (1766–1834), the elder brother of the painter George Chinnery.

He is primarily known for his tenure as Music Director of the Metropolitan Opera (the \\"Met\\"), a position he held for 40 years (1976-2016). He was formally terminated by the Met from all his positions and affiliations with the company on March 12, 2018 over sexual misconduct allegations which he denies. Levine was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a Jewish, musical family. His maternal grandfather was a composer and a cantor in a synagogue, his father (Lawrence) was a violinist who led dance bands under the name \\"Larry Lee\\" before entering his father's clothing business, and his mother (Helen Goldstein Levine) was briefly an actress on Broadway, performing as \\"Helen Golden\\".

He also has a younger sister, Janet, who is a marriage counselor.  He began to play the piano as a small child. On February 21, 1954, at the age of 10, Levine made his concert debut as soloist playing Felix Mendelssohn's Piano Concerto No. 2 at a youth concert of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra in Ohio.

And householders are given the pointers during home fire safety checks - to show them how to press the test button on ceiling-mounted smoke alarms. Waste? These 2ft-long red plastic sticks with a white hand and pointing finger at the end were paid for out of public money. But the cost of £1.75 a stick was branded a waste when people can just use their own fingers or any stick or broomhandle to test the alarms. Fire Authority member Gordon Walker said: 'It is absolutely ridiculous waste of money, particularly when budgets are so tight for public services. All people have to do is use a broom handle or something similar'. Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service bought a total of 10,000 of the sticks, at a cost of £1.75 each - a total of £17,500. The sticks are approximately 24in long or just over two foot including the pointing finger. But they were blasted as a 'pointless laughing stock' by some householders.

The holiday crush   this year is estimated to be even heavier than before. Government officials suggest that Chinese people will take to the air, roads and railways 3.62 billion times over a 40-day period around the nation's most important holiday this year as people push their way home for family gatherings or to satisfy their new-found passion for travel. Getting tickets to all those would-be travelers is a _ challenge that tries your patience annually. And the pressure for the railway system is always the greatest. Railways are the transport of choice for low-cost long-distance travel, and that's where the ticketing system regularly falls down. Much of the criticism has focused on the railway's online purchasing system, which has been unable to keep pace with the huge demand and also failed to stop scalpers   from easily getting many of the hard-to-find tickets. Railway officials believed that online sales were the fairest way to get tickets for travelers, and told reporters that the public need to be patient. While by now the railway service is far from satisfying, efforts are being made to provide online identity checks that would reduce the ticket scalping problems, and the situation is expected to get better in a few years. Meanwhile, for those traveling by car, good news is that the country's extremely expensive highway tolls   will be removed for the period of the official holiday.

British Education Minister Elizabeth Truss is to lead a delegation of experts on a fact-finding mission to Shanghai's schools next week to see how children there have become the best in the world at maths, to get a first-hand look at maths classes and teaching methods there, and particularly to investigate why the performance of almost all children in Shanghai is high, regardless of gender or income. Britain was last year placed 50th out of 148 countries and regions in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness ranking in quality of maths and science education.

It aimed to address issues related to naval disarmament, reduce global tensions post-World War I, and prevent the outbreak of another major conflict. The main nations involved in the Washington Naval Conference were the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy. In addition to the primary participants, other countries also joined as observers or sent representatives during the conference. 1. United States: As the host country, the U.S. played a primary role in organizing the conference. President Warren G. Harding and Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes led the American delegation. The U.S. aimed to achieve disarmament of naval forces, particularly among its major naval rivals like Great Britain and Japan, which would reduce potential threats in the Pacific while cutting defense costs. 2. Great Britain: The British delegation was led by Prime Minister David Lloyd George and Arthur J. Balfour, the British Foreign Secretary. The British Empire, being a global maritime power, had a vested interest in maintaining a strong naval presence worldwide. However, Great Britain was also financially burdened after World War I, which led to their willingness to negotiate naval disarmament and reduce military expenditure. 3. Japan: The Japanese delegation was led by Prince Tokugawa, Baron Kato Komei (the Japanese Minister of Foreign Affairs), and Admiral Saito Makoto. Japan aimed to secure naval parity with the United States and Great Britain and ensure its national security in the Pacific region. The recognition of Japan's territorial possessions in the Pacific and its commitment to the Open Door Policy in China were also crucial concerns for the Japanese government. 4. France: The French delegation was headed by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Aristide Briand, and French Ambassador to the United States, Jules Jusserand. France, being a continental power focused mainly on its terrestrial borders, sought to protect its colonial interests and maintain a naval presence in the Mediterranean and the North Atlantic Ocean. 5. Italy: The Italian delegation was led by Carlo Schanzer, the Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Italian Ambassador to the United States, Vittorio Rolandi-Ricci. Italy sought to maintain a strong naval presence in the Mediterranean, which was vital to the country's national security and colonial interests. Several other countries participated in the conference in varying capacities. Belgium, the Netherlands, Portugal, and China attended as observers, while Spain, Brazil, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Greece, Guatemala, Haiti, and Poland sent representatives who participated in some discussions related to their respective interests. The conference resulted in several landmark treaties, the most notable being the Five Power Naval Limitation Treaty (signed by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, and Italy), which limited the naval capacities of the participating nations. Further, the Four-Power Treaty (signed by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, and France) aimed to maintain the status quo in the Pacific, and the Nine-Power Treaty (signed by the United States, Great Britain, Japan, France, Italy, China, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Portugal) reaffirmed the Open Door Policy in China. While the Washington Naval Conference did achieve some short-term success in slowing the naval arms race, its long-term effectiveness in preventing conflicts was limited due to various issues, including the rise of new regional tensions and economic downturns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A scientist is testing chemical reactions. At first he tries mixing two chemicals together at a temperature of 85 degrees Celsius and labels it Trial A. He records the time for the reaction to complete at 2 minutes. Knowing that this isn't the temperature users at home will be combining the chemicals at he tries the reaction again at a more modest 65 degrees Celsius and labels this trial B. Noting this temperature the reaction takes almost 4 times as long which is completely unacceptable, He then gets an idea to add and enzyme designed specifically for these two chemicals and then tries the reaction at the modest 65 degrees Celsius again calling this one trial C  Given that this enzyme is designed specifically for use with the chemicals in this experiment, will the reaction for trial C be faster or slower than the reaction in trial B?  Hint: Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure below . Enzymes aren’t changed or used up in the reactions they catalyze, so they can be used to speed up the same reaction over and over again. Each enzyme is highly specific for the particular reaction is catalyzes, so enzymes are very effective. A reaction that would take many years to occur without its enzyme might occur in a split second with the enzyme. Enzymes are also very efficient, so waste products rarely form.","output":"Given the information provided, the reaction in Trial C, when the enzyme is added, is expected to be faster than the reaction in Trial B. The reason for this is that enzymes are known to increase the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy needed, making it easier for the reactants to start reacting.  Since the enzyme added in Trial C is designed specifically for use with the chemicals in the experiment, it will effectively catalyze the reaction and greatly enhance the reaction speed, even at the more modest temperature of 65 degrees Celsius. As a result, the reaction time in Trial C should be significantly reduced in comparison to Trial B. It is important to note that enzymes are not consumed in the reactions they catalyze, meaning they can repeatedly speed up the same reaction without being used up. Additionally, enzymes are highly specific and efficient, minimizing the formation of waste products during the reaction process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: WHITE HOUSE/BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said there is a plan to reunite the more than 2,000 children who have been detained apart from their parents. \\"We have a plan to do that,\\" the secretary told reporters at an event in Washington Thursday morning. Shortly before she spoke, a VOA reporter at an immigration court hearing in Brownsville, Texas, said prosecutors dropped misdemeanor charges against 17 migrants. The migrants, who were separated from their children remain detained, but dropping the charges could be a means to reunite them and allow the families to be detained as units. David Bier, an Immigration Policy Analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, said if government prosecutors are dropping criminal charges in similar cases across the immigration court system, it calls into question the Trump Administration's 'Zero Tolerance' policy towards immigration. It's \\"an even more clear signal that the whole purpose of bringing these prosecutions is to separate parents from children and not about enforcing the law.\\" he told VOA. The administration's policy requires that anyone who crosses the border illegally face criminal charges. \\"If it continues to be the case that some of these cases or many of them are dismissed by courts – that should be the end of the policy,\\" Bier added. The moves come as the House of Representatives prepares to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations, as well as other issues that have divided the country's major political parties. Nielsen repeated her calls for lawmakers to act. \\"I want to be very clear on this.

Follow these steps: 1. Rewrite the equation as it is. 16*y = 94*y + 312 2. To isolate y, you'll want to eliminate y terms from one side of the equation. To do that, subtract 16*y from both sides of the equation. 16*y - 16*y = 94*y - 16*y 3. Simplify both sides. 0 = 78*y + 312 4. Now, you'll need to eliminate the constant term from the right side of the equation. To do that, subtract 312 from both sides. 0 - 312 = 78*y + 312 - 312 5. Simplify both sides. -312 = 78*y 6. Finally, to solve for y, divide by the coefficient of y (78) on both sides. -312 / 78 = 78*y / 78 7.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations.  and the situation: Carrie bought two parcels of farmland. The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel  had almost no traces of AM fungi.  Answer the following question: Which parcel had a higher soil nutrient content? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it is likely that the Southern parcel had a higher soil nutrient content. This is because arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. In these conditions, plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. The Northern parcel, with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, would suggest that it has relatively lower soil nutrient content compared to the Southern parcel. This phenomenon of a negative relationship between AM fungi prevalence and soil nutrient content arises due to the symbiotic relationship between plants and AM fungi. In lower nutrient conditions, plants rely more heavily on their partnership with AM fungi to access nutrients such as phosphorus, which the fungi can absorb from the soil more easily through their extensive hyphal networks. In return, the plant provides carbon-based resources to the fungi, thus promoting fungal growth and proliferation. This results in high AM fungi concentrations in the soils with lower nutrient content. As nutrient concentrations in the soil increase, plants can more readily access the nutrients directly, and therefore their reliance on fungi reduces. This reduces the amount of carbon allocated to the fungi, causing a decline in their abundance and diversity. Hence, the Southern parcel, with almost no traces of AM fungi, is likely to have higher soil nutrient content than the Northern parcel, where the fungi are more abundant.  Additionally, it is important to note that environmental conditions can be variable, and local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi, and local soil nutrient concentrations can occur over time. Therefore, it may be beneficial for Carrie to regularly monitor the nutrient concentrations and mycorrhizal fungal abundance on both parcels to ensure proper soil management for successful agricultural activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Options: A. Drinks some tea B. not enough information C. Tries to rescue Sheila D. Eats the gumballs Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Sheila split open and the air was filled with gumballs. Yellow gumballs. This was awful for Stan, just awful. He had loved Sheila for a long time, fought for her heart, believed in their love until finally she had come around. They were about to kiss for the first time and then this: yellow gumballs. Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs. He did this because he believed in capitalism, he loved capitalism. He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila. On the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, Sheila came to Stan in a dream. She was standing in a kiddie pool; Stan and his brothers and sisters were running around splashing and screaming; she had managed to insert herself into a Super-8 home movie of Stan's family, shot in the late 70's. She looked terribly sad. \\"Sheila, where are you?\\" Stan said. \\"Why did you leave me, why did you become gumballs?\\" \\"The Ant King has me,\\" Sheila said. \\"You must rescue me.\\" Question: After the story, Stan most likely: Answer: Answer:","output":"C. Tries to rescue Sheila After several months of attending the support group and operating his gumball store, Stan seemed to be moving on from the surreal event that marked the end of his relationship with Sheila. However, when Sheila appeared in his dream the night before the IPO of gumballs.com, she revealed that she was being held captive by the Ant King and needed to be rescued. This new information, combined with the fact that Stan had loved Sheila for a long time and fought for her heart, strongly suggests that he would most likely attempt to rescue Sheila. Even though Stan had created a seemingly stable life for himself and found solace in running his business, the reappearance of Sheila in his life - even if only in a dream - would likely stir up strong emotions and a sense of responsibility to help her. The fact that he was on the cusp of a significant business accomplishment with the IPO might actually motivate him further, as it could indicate that he had dealt with the loss of Sheila to the point where he was able to move forward and succeed in life. This newfound strength and confidence could make him feel more equipped to face the challenge of rescuing her. Additionally, the very nature of the support group Stan attended implies that its members have struggled to accept the surreal events that marked the end of their relationships. They have worked hard on themselves, presumably striving to find a sense of closure and answers, or at least some semblance of understanding. The dream in which Sheila appeared offered Stan exactly that - it provided context and an opportunity for him to take action, which might be a welcome change from the uncertainty he had been dealing with since the yellow gumballs incident. Moreover, the story emphasizes that there is a group for everything in California, hinting at the possibility that Stan could find a group or supportive network of people who might be willing to embark on this rescue mission with him. This detail further suggests that Stan would not be entirely alone in his attempt to save Sheila. In summary, based on Stan's past love for Sheila, his journey towards healing and self-acceptance, and the revelation of a captor and a potential mission, it is most likely that, after the story, Stan would try to rescue Sheila."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, if the premise is true, then it is possible to infer that the hypothesis might also be true. To begin with, let's examine both the premise and hypothesis closely: Premise: \\"Rooms are very chic, with full audio systems.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The rooms themselves are very stylish.\\" In the premise, we are given information that the rooms are chic and possess full audio systems. \\"Chic\\" typically implies that something is elegant, fashionable, or stylish. Therefore, the rooms are depicted as having an aesthetically pleasing design that is also contemporary and trendy. Additionally, they are equipped with comprehensive audio systems, which indicate a functional and possibly upscale aspect to the rooms. Now, let's consider the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the rooms are very stylish. \\"Stylish\\" may be defined as being fashionable, attractive, tasteful, or, in other words, having a sense of style. Both the premise and hypothesis hinge on the rooms exhibiting a visually appealing appearance and a sense of fashion or elegance. Given the premise as true, stating that the rooms are very chic suggests that they indeed possess a sense of style. This aligns well with the hypothesis that describes the rooms as stylish. In this case, the hypothesis might be considered a plausible conclusion drawn from the given premise, as both share the core idea of the rooms having a fashionable, elegant design. However, it's essential to note that while the hypothesis's likelihood is quite high based on the premise, it isn't a 100% guaranteed truth. The premise suggests that the rooms are very chic, but the hypothesis emphasizes the stylishness without specifically mentioning the full audio systems. Therefore, while the hypothesis likely follows suit if the premise is true, the correlation between the two isn't absolute. To solidify the connection, it would be ideal to include information about the full audio systems in the hypothesis. In conclusion, it is possible to deduce that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is likely true as well, as they both emphasize the visually appealing and fashionable aspects of the rooms. However, the hypothesis's validity could be further cemented if it also referred to the full audio systems mentioned in the premise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Recently, some concerns have been raised about the health of the world's banana plants. Many media reports have said that bananas may completely disappear in the coming ten years. Bananas are one of the world's most important food crops. They are also the fourth most valuable export. Bananas do not grow from seeds. Instead, they grow from existing plants. Bananas are threatened by disease because all the plants on a farm are copies of each other. They all share the same genetic weaknesses. For example, the Cavendish banana is most popular in American markets. It is an important export crop. However, some kinds of fungus   organisms easily infect the Cavendish. Black Sigatoka disease affects the leaves of Cavendish banana plants. The disease is controlled on large farms by putting chemicals on the plant's leaves. Farmers put anti-fungal chemicals on their crops up to once a week. Another fungal disease is more serious. Panama disease attacks the roots of the banana plant. There is no chemical treatment for this disease. Infected plants must be destroyed. Panama disease has affected crops in Southeast Asia, Australia and South Africa. There is concern that it may spread to bananas grown in the Americas. This could threaten an important export product for Central and South America. The International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain, whose headquarter lies in France, supports research on bananas. The group says that more research must be done to develop improved kinds of bananas. The group says that fungal diseases mainly affect only one kind of banana. In fact, there are five-hundred different kinds of bananas. The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization says the Cavendish banana represents only ten percent of world production. The UN agency says farmers should grow different kinds of bananas. This protects against diseases that affect only one kind. Experts warn that disease may cause the Cavendish banana to disappear. This has already happened to one popular banana because of its... Question: Panama disease  _  . Options: A: doesn't belong to fungal disease. B: has spread to bananas in the world.

Today, Patrick and Mark, who weighs much more than Patrick, are allowed to use the chairs. Patrick chooses to sit on the red chair, and Mark sits on the green chair. The boys have fun reading books while they sit on their comfortable inflatable chairs.  Which chair has a higher air pressure?  Hint: What does popping bubble wrap have to do with science? Actually, it demonstrates an important scientific law, called Boyle’s law. Like other laws in science, this law describes what always happens under certain conditions. Boyle’s law is one of three well-known gas laws, which state the relationships among temperature, volume, and pressure of gases. (The other two gas laws are Charles’ law and Amontons’ law.) According to Boyle’s law , if the temperature of a gas is held constant, then decreasing the volume of the gas increases its pressure—and vice versa. That’s what happens when you squeeze the bubbles of bubble wrap. You decrease the bubbles' volume, so the air pressure inside the bubbles increases until they pop. The answer to this question is:","output":"The green chair has a higher air pressure. Since Mark weighs much more than Patrick, his weight causes the volume of the gas in the green chair to decrease, while the temperature remains constant. According to Boyle's law, this decrease in volume will cause an increase in air pressure within the chair. Therefore, the green chair on which Mark is sitting has a higher air pressure than the red chair on which Patrick is sitting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Creating a self portrait is not your typical selfie! When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students.

Ask a question about Railway electrification system.","output":"What are the different types of railway electrification systems, and what are their main characteristics and applications? Railway electrification systems refer to the process of powering railway vehicles, typically locomotives and multiple units, using electricity supplied through an external power infrastructure. This method is preferred over other means of propulsion, like diesel or steam, due to its efficiency, lower maintenance, and reduced environmental impact. There are several electrification systems used worldwide, and they can be categorized based on their voltage and current type. Here, we take a look at some of the main types of railway electrification systems, their characteristics, and applications. 1. Direct Current (DC) Systems: DC systems are characterized by the use of direct current for power supply. The most common DC systems include:   a. 600-1000 V DC - This low voltage system is typically used in urban transport systems like trams, light rail, and metro systems. Some examples are the New York City Subway, London Underground, and Hong Kong Tramways.      b. 1.5 kV DC - This voltage is common in older suburban and mainline electrification systems. Countries like France, the Netherlands, and Japan have railways with this system, such as the Paris RER, Dutch railway network, and Japan's Shinkansen.      c. 3 kV DC - This system is used in several countries in Europe, such as Belgium, Italy, and Poland, as well as in South Africa and Argentina. Notable railways include the Italian State Railways and the Buenos Aires metropolitan network.  2. Alternating Current (AC) Systems: AC systems employ the use of alternating current for power supply. The most common AC systems are:   a. 15 kV AC, 16.7 Hz - This frequency is employed mainly in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and other neighboring countries. Railways that use this system are the German DB and the Austrian OBB. The 16.7 Hz frequency is generated by converting standard 50 Hz AC to the required 16.7 Hz using frequency converters.      b. 25 kV AC, 50 Hz / 60 Hz - This system has become the most widely adopted standard worldwide due to its high efficiency and ability to support higher-speed operations. It is used on high-speed rail networks such as the French TGV, the UK's High-Speed 1, Spain's AVE, and the Chinese HSR. The frequency of 50 Hz or 60 Hz is the same as the power grid standard in each country.      c. 11 kV AC, 25 Hz - This type of system was adopted earlier in the 20th century and is still used in some regions. Examples include Amtrak's Northeast Corridor in the United States and some lines on the Argentine railway network. 3. Composite Systems: Some railway networks use a combination of different electrification systems on different lines. An example is India, where the mainline electrification system is 25 kV AC, 50 Hz, while several urban rail systems such as the Kolkata Metro and Delhi Metro use 750 V DC. In conclusion, railway electrification systems can vary greatly depending on the voltage and current type used, with each system having its unique characteristics and applications. The choice of the electrification system depends on factors such as energy efficiency, the availability of power infrastructure, the speed and capacity requirements, and the compatibility with surrounding railway systems. With the growing emphasis on sustainable transport, railway electrification is expected to remain a crucial aspect of modern rail infrastructure development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: One of the most widely accepted, commonly repeated assumptions   in our culture is that if you exercise, you will lose weight. I exercise all the time, but I still have gut fat that hangs over my belt when I sit. Why isn't all the exercise getting rid of it? It's a question many of us could ask. More than 45 million Americans now belong to a health club, up from 23 million in 1993. We spend some 19 billion a year on gym memberships. Of course, some people join and never go. Still, as one major study -- the Minnesota Heart Survey -- found, more of us at least say we exercise regularly. And yet obesity   figures have risen sharply in the same period: a third of Americans are obese, and another third count as overweight by the Federal Government's definition. Yes, it's entirely possible that those of us who regularly go to the gym would weigh even more if we exercised less. But like many other people, I get hungry after I exercise, so I often eat more on the days I work out than on the days I don't. Could exercise actually be keeping me from losing weight? The popular belief that exercise is essential for weight control is actually fairly new. As recently as the 1960s, doctors routinely advised against too much exercise, particularly for older adults who could injure themselves. Today doctors encourage even their oldest patients to exercise, which is sound advice for many reasons: People who regularly exercise are at significantly lower risk for all manner of diseases -- those of the heart in particular. They less often develop cancer and many other illnesses. But the past few years of obesity research show that the role of exercise in weight loss has been wildly over-evaluated. \\"In general, for weight loss, exercise is pretty useless,\\" says Eric Ravussin, exercise researcher at Louisiana State University.

Question: What was the density of particulate matter in the air a day after smog had entered Central and Eastern parts of China? Context: A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang. A lack of cold air flow, combined with slow-moving air masses carrying industrial emissions, collected airborne pollutants to form a thick layer of smog over the region. The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \\"severely polluted\\" for five straight days and \\"heavily polluted\\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013. Between 3:00 pm, 3 December and 2:00pm, 4 December local time, several expressways from Nanjing to other Jiangsu cities were closed, stranding dozens of passenger buses in Zhongyangmen bus station. From 5 to 6 December, Nanjing issued a red alert for air pollution and closed down all kindergarten through middle schools. Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased. The smog dissipated 12 December. Officials blamed the dense pollution on lack of wind, automobile exhaust emissions under low air pressure, and coal-powered district heating system in North China region. Prevailing winds blew low-hanging air masses of factory emissions (mostly SO2) towards China's east coast.

Answer the following question: If I tell you that Cells that divide uncontrollably may form masses of neoplastic origin, and ask you the question \\"cells that divide which way may form masses of neoplastic origin?\\", is the correct answer \\"non-neoplastic\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"non-neoplastic.\\" When defining the type of cells that may form masses of neoplastic origin, it's important to understand the terms in question. Cells that divide uncontrollably, violating the normal rules of cell division, are involved in the formation of masses of neoplastic origin, which is typically associated with cancer. The word \\"neoplastic\\" pertains to a neoplasm, which indicates an abnormal growth of cells. This can occur when cells divide and grow excessively without being regulated by the body's normal control mechanisms. Thus, neoplasms can be benign (non-cancerous), pre-malignant or malignant (cancerous). Malignant neoplasms can invade nearby tissues, spread to distant parts of the body and are generally more serious. Non-neoplastic cells, on the other hand, do not have this excessive and abnormal cell division. Non-neoplastic growths are those that do not involve the growth of cancerous cells. These could be because of inflammation, healing processes, infections, or other non-cancerous conditions. They may be referred as hyperplastic or hypertrophic changes, which are benign and controlled cases of cell growth. Therefore, by definition, only cells which divide uncontrollably, specifically leading to the development of a neoplasm, can form masses of neoplastic origin. Non-neoplastic cells, due to their regular and controlled division, would not typically lead to the formation of these neoplastic masses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: The young man (boy, really) played with his fingers in the garish light cast from the lone bulb in the concrete bunker. He scratched at an imaginary itch on his right hand (just below his thumb) to take his mind off the man in the lab coat who sat across from him at the beaten, scarred, wood table. It didn't work. And whoever this man in the lab coat was, he was insistent about paperwork. He had three inches clipped onto a weathered clipboard which he flipped through with precision. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" asked the boy's captor in a calm, sensitive tenor. The boy, Kurt, continued to scratch the imaginary itch, which had leapt magically from his right hand to the left. Eventually the falseness of the itch would be deduced, and the lab coated man would disappear out of the cell and return with... God knows what. He had seen torture hundreds-if not thousands-of times on TV, and he was glumly certain that there would be no commercial breaks for him. \\"Can I offer you a glass of water?\\" The question was repeated without urgency, like a forgetful waiter. The itch now leaped with the dexterity of a trained flea onto the boy's leg, and the dutiful fingers followed. He watched as the man in the lab coat, without name tag or company insignia, studied his stack of papers attached to the clipboard. Several yellow forms near the top half inch were labeled 27B. The man frowned and wrote a note on the top page. \\"Note: Find out who isn't duplicating 27B in Pink.\\" \\"I'm sorry,\\" he said, \\"I wasn't listening.

The premise tells us that a mother is trying to get her children to smile for a picture. However, it does not provide any information about the location or setting, such as whether the picture is being taken indoors or outdoors.  To conclude the hypothesis, we would need additional information to support the assumption that the mother is taking the picture indoors.

When we spend time lifting a lot of weights we become weaker or stronger?","output":"Engaging in anaerobic exercises, such as lifting weights, can cause muscles to get bigger and stronger over time, rather than weaker. Anaerobic exercise is any physical exercise that prompts the use of glycogen as a primary fuel source, rather than oxygen. This type of exercise includes activities like weightlifting, sprinting, and high-intensity interval training. When you engage in regular weightlifting or strength training, you're stimulating muscle development through a process known as muscular hypertrophy. This process involves the increase of the size (and often strength) of skeletal muscle through the growth of component cells. During this process, muscle fibers sustain microdamage, which triggers the body's repair response. This repair response includes the activation of satellite cells located outside the muscle fibers, which then fuse to the damaged muscle fibers. As a result, the damaged muscle fibers become stronger, larger, and more resilient. This is the fundamental process behind muscle growth and increased strength stemming from anaerobic routines, such as weightlifting. However, this doesn't mean that you will only experience strength gains at all times. There can be instances where you may feel temporarily weaker – this can be due to several factors: 1. Overtraining: Lifting weights without sufficient breaks and recovery time can lead to a decline in overall strength and performance. It is vital to allow your muscles enough time to recuperate between workouts. 2. Insufficient nutrition: Proper nutrition is essential for fueling your muscles and promoting their growth and repair. Failing to consume an adequate amount of protein, carbohydrates, and essential fats can leave your muscles feeling weak and hinder progress. 3. Inadequate sleep: Sleep plays a crucial role in muscle recovery and overall performance. A lack of sleep or poor-quality sleep can result in weakened muscles and negatively impact workout performance. 4. Improper lifting technique: Incorrect weightlifting technique can not only prevent you from achieving optimal strength gains but can also lead to injury. In conclusion, if you follow a well-structured anaerobic exercise routine that suits your fitness level and goals, you will likely experience increases in muscle size and strength. Remember to prioritize proper nutrition, sufficient recovery time, and correct technique to avoid feelings of weakness or compromised progress. Regular engagement in such activities, when done correctly and consistently, will ultimately lead to stronger muscles rather than weakened ones."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: -  Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs - Carbon dioxide released when you exhale.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process of respiration, as described above, is the entry of air into the bronchial tubes. This initial step is crucial for the proper functioning of the respiratory system and begins as follows: 1. Inhalation: The process starts when we breathe in air through our nose or mouth. As we inhale, the diaphragm muscle, located at the base of the chest cavity, contracts and moves downward, creating a negative pressure within the chest cavity. This negative pressure leads to the expansion of the lungs, allowing air to be drawn in. 2. Air filtration and conditioning: The inhaled air first passes through the nostrils and nasal cavity, where it is filtered, warmed, and humidified. Tiny hairs called cilia and mucus in the nose help to trap dust, debris, and other particles to protect our lungs from any harmful substances. This step is essential for maintaining healthy lungs and preventing respiratory infections or irritations. 3. Air transport via trachea: After passing through the nasal cavity and pharynx (throat), the filtered and conditioned air enters the trachea (windpipe), a tube composed of C-shaped cartilage rings that prevent the airway from collapsing during the inhalation process. The trachea transports the air down to the bronchi, which are the two main branches that connect to either lung. 4. Entry into bronchial tubes: The air eventually reaches the bronchial tubes, marking the first step in the process mentioned in the question. The bronchial tubes branch further into smaller tubes called bronchioles within each lung. From here, the process of respiration continues as the air is divided into the bronchioles, then to the alveoli, which are tiny air sacs surrounded by small blood vessels. Oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the walls of the alveoli and enters the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide, a waste product, diffuses from the blood back into the alveoli and is eventually exhaled. In summary, the first step of the process is the entry of air into the bronchial tubes. This occurs after several stages of inhalation, filtration, and transportation of air, which are critical for ensuring that clean, humidified, and oxygen-rich air reaches the lungs to facilitate efficient gas exchange."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In fact, I might even go so far as to say that Alex Comort is more interesting than Delaware. And that's saying something. Answer: A:","output":"Based on the given product review, it is evident that the review is not positive. The title, \\"Painfully laborious!\\" already suggests that the reviewer found the experience of engaging with the product to be quite strenuous and not enjoyable.  The reviewer mentioned they \\"struggled through it,\\" which signifies that they had a hard time engaging with the product, in this case, the audio version of a book or story. The use of the word \\"struggled\\" is a strong indicator that the reviewer did not have a good experience. Furthermore, the reviewer mildly criticized the rendition of the audio, calling it \\"unimaginative,\\" meaning that they found it lacking creativity or originality. This contributes to the overall negative evaluation of the product. The content of the product also did not impress the reviewer as they described it to be \\"less than riveting - considerably so.\\" This implies that the reviewer did not find the story engaging, and it failed to capture their attention. The comparison to another author, \\"Give me Sanford any day,\\" suggests that the reviewer prefers works by Sanford over the current product. It is also important to note the use of the word \\"considerably,\\" which emphasizes the level of dissatisfaction the reviewer has with the content. Moreover, the reviewer mentions that they find another character, Alex Comort, more interesting than the main character of the story, Delaware. This comparison appears to be a clear expression of disappointment, as indicated by the phrase \\"And that's saying something.\\" This statement implies that Alex Comort might not generally be considered an exciting character; however, in comparison to Delaware, Alex appears to be more interesting. This further shows the dissatisfaction the reviewer has with this product. In conclusion, the overall tone and content of the product review are negative. The reviewer expressed disappointment in several aspects of the product: the audio rendition, the unengaging content, and the characters involved. The dissatisfaction with various elements of the product and the preference for alternative works or characters strongly indicate that this product review is not positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They fire pistols at ten paces and Quin falls. Believing that he has killed Quin and will be arrested by the British for murder, Barry flees.On the road to Dublin, Barry is robbed and his horse stolen by a middle-aged highwayman (Arthur O'Sullivan) and the man's son. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British army and finds himself in boot camp. During training, Barry gets into a brawl with a local bully named O'Toole (Pat Roach), and is forced to fight bare-knuckle against the guy. Barry wins the fight by dodging all of O'Toole's blows and knocks out his opponent, which earns him popularity from the rest of his fellow recruits.After basic training, Barry and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. While still in a training camp, Barry learns from an old friend, Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), that Captain Quin is not dead after all and has married Nora. The whole duel was a ploy by Nora's relatives to make Barry flee from Ireland so she can marry Quin.After the death of Grogan in a skirmish, Barry, fed up with the brutality of war, deserts from the British army.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Music for Nations is a British independent record label focusing mainly on rock and metal. It was a subsidiary of the larger label distributor Zomba Records, which in turn is now owned by BMG.  - \`\` Underdose '' is the first single by Essex alternative metal band InMe .

It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Overgrown Eden is the debut album from Essex alternative metal band InMe. The album was released in the UK on 30 January 2003. The album produced four singles before and after the album's release. The singles released were \\"Underdose\\", \\"Firefly\\", \\"Crushed like Fruit\\" and \\"Neptune\\". The album was re-released in its original format on 5 June 2006. This was due to getting the rights for \\"Overgrown Eden\\" from the now defunct record label Music for Nations. Due to the demise of MFN, this was the first and last album released by InMe on this record label.  - Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a rock music genre that infuses heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal.

Question: Information:  - Pong is one of the earliest arcade video games and the very first sports arcade video game. It is a table tennis sports game featuring simple two-dimensional graphics. While other arcade video games such as \\"Computer Space\\" came before it, \\"Pong\\" was one of the first video games to reach mainstream popularity. The aim is to defeat an opponent in a simulated table-tennis game by earning a higher score. The game was originally manufactured by Atari, which released it in 1972. Allan Alcorn created \\"Pong\\" as a training exercise assigned to him by Atari co-founder Nolan Bushnell. Bushnell based the idea on an electronic ping-pong game included in the Magnavox Odyssey, which later resulted in a lawsuit against Atari. Surprised by the quality of Alcorn's work, Bushnell and Atari co-founder Ted Dabney decided to manufacture the game.  - Atari, SA (ASA) is an international French holding company headquartered in Paris, France. It was originally called Infogrames Entertainment, SA (IESA). Its subsidiaries include Atari London Studio, Atari Interactive and Atari, Inc.. Because of continuing pressures upon the company, and difficulty finding investors, it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well. All three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy, and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign.  - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming.  - Ted Dabney is the co-founder of Syzygy and Atari. While working at Ampex Dabney met Nolan Bushnell and the two jointly created Syzygy with their first product being \\"Computer Space\\", which was manufactured and sold by Nutting Associates. Following Computer Space, Ted Dabney's video circuit that was created for Computer Space was used by Al Alcorn to create \\"Pong\\", with assistance from Dabney and Bushnell. Dabney remained out of the public eye after departing Atari and his role in creating the first commercially produced coin-op video game as well as Syzygy and Atari was often omitted or marginalized with several myths attached. Dabney appeared on the RetroGaming Roundup podcast in October 2010 and told his story in a two-hour interview.  - IMAGE (from Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration), or Explorer 78, was a NASA MIDEX mission that studied the global response of the Earth's magnetosphere to changes in the solar wind.

Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit.  - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial.  - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. medium  B. illness  C. throwing up  D. heartburn  E. sleepiness Answer:","output":"D. Heartburn If you consume spicy food, you may experience heartburn as a consequence. Heartburn, or acid reflux, occurs when stomach acid travels back up into the esophagus, causing a burning sensation in the chest or throat. This phenomenon can be triggered by various factors, such as consuming a large portion of spicy food, overeating, or lying down soon after a meal. Spicy foods often contain capsaicin, a compound responsible for the heat sensation associated with chili peppers. Capsaicin has the potential to irritate the lining of the esophagus, which can exacerbate the symptoms of heartburn. Moreover, spicy foods can stimulate the production of stomach acid, making it more likely for acid reflux to occur. It is important to note that not everyone will experience heartburn after eating spicy food. People with a higher tolerance for spicy cuisine may not experience any discomfort at all, while others, particularly those with pre-existing gastrointestinal issues, such as gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), are more susceptible to heartburn. In addition to heartburn, consuming spicy food can lead to other temporary side effects, such as increased sweating, runny nose, and a general feeling of warmth. These reactions are the body's way of trying to cool itself down and are not typically associated with any long-term negative health consequences. However, if heartburn becomes a frequent occurrence or does not respond to over-the-counter antacids, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional, as it may indicate a more serious underlying condition. Lifestyle modifications, such as avoiding trigger foods, eating smaller meals, and not lying down immediately after eating, may help alleviate symptoms. In more severe cases, prescription medications or other treatments may be recommended. In conclusion, consuming spicy food is most likely to result in heartburn, or acid reflux, due to the irritation and stimulation of stomach acid production caused by capsaicin. The severity and frequency of heartburn vary from person to person and can depend on factors such as individual spice tolerance and pre-existing gastrointestinal conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved. You may wonder how it can be conserved if something is now missing? Assume you had measured the mass of the wood before you burned it. Assume you had also trapped the gases released by the burning wood and measured their mass and the mass of the ashes. What would you find? The ashes and gases combined have the same mass as the wood you started with. This example illustrates the law of conservation of mass.

The paragraph states that by the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes.

Movie title: Tenebrae Movie plot: Peter Neal (Anthony Franciosa) is an American writer of violent horror novels whose books are tremendously popular in Europe. In Italy to promote his latest work, entitled Tenebrae, he is accompanied by his literary agent Bullmer (John Saxon) and his adoring assistant Anne (Daria Nicolodi). He is unaware that he is also being followed by his embittered ex-wife Jane (Veronica Lario). Immediately prior to Neals arrival in Rome, a beautiful young shoplifter (Ania Pieroni) is brutally razor-slashed to death by an unseen killer. The murderer sends Neal a letter informing him that his books have inspired him to go on a killing spree. Neal immediately contacts the police, who put Detective Giermani (Giuliano Gemma) in charge of the investigation, along with the detectives female partner Inspector Altieri (Carola Stagnaro).More killings occur. Tilde (Mirella D'Angelo), a beautiful lesbian journalist, is murdered at her home along with her lover. Later, Maria (Lara Wendel), the young daughter of Neal's landlord, is bloodily hacked to death with an axe after stumbling into the killer's lair.Neal notices that TV interviewer Christiano Berti (John Steiner) appears to have an unusually intense interest in the novelist's work. At night, Neal and his second assistant Gianni (Christiano Borromeo) watch Bertis house for suspicious activity. Neal decides to separate from Gianni in order to get a better view. Alone, Gianni watches in horror as an axe-carrying assailant brutally hacks Berti to death. But he is unable to see the murderer's face. Gianni finds Neal unconscious on the lawn, having been knocked out from behind.Giermani's investigation reveals that Berti was unhealthily obsessed with Neal's novels, and now that he is dead it is believed that the killings will cease. However, Bullmer, who is having an affair with Jane, is stabbed to death while waiting for his lover in a public square. Gianni is haunted by the thought that he had seen, but did not recognize, something important at Bertis house during the night of the... Answer:","output":"Elsa, a character from the movie \\"Tenebrae,\\" does not seem to be mentioned in the provided plot summary. Therefore, determining her cause of death cannot be accurately answered based on the given information. However, the movie \\"Tenebrae\\" is a 1982 Italian horror film directed by Dario Argento. It features a series of brutal murders inspired by the protagonist Peter Neal's violent horror novels. From the plot description, we can infer that the unidentified killer, inspired by Neal's books, commits the murders through vicious means, like razor-slashing, axe-hacking, and stabbing. Given this pattern, it is logical to assume that if Elsa was a character in the movie, her death would also have been the result of a violent attack, possibly involving one of the aforementioned weapons or methods. To determine whether it's worth investing in the film proposal, there are several factors to consider: 1. Genre: \\"Tenebrae\\" falls under the giallo subgenre, a type of Italian horror-thriller that primarily focuses on gruesome murders and psychological suspense. Determine if this genre aligns with your personal interests or the target audience you want to cater to. 2. Director: Dario Argento is a renowned filmmaker known for his distinctive visual style and innovative approach to the horror genre. This association could make the film more attractive for fans of Argento's previous works, especially within the horror community. 3. Market appeal: Assess the current market trends and audience preferences within the film industry, paying particular attention to the performance of similar films in recent years. This information will give an indication of the potential demand for a film like \\"Tenebrae.\\" 4. Financial aspects: Evaluate the proposed budget, estimated revenue projections, distribution channels, and potential collaborators for the movie, such as producers and actors. By analyzing these factors, you can determine the film's feasibility and potential for financial success. 5. Risks and challenges: Understand the foreseeable risks and challenges associated with the production, such as unforeseen expenses, audience reception, and competition with other films within the same genre or released during the same period. This understanding will help you identify if any risks outweigh the potential benefits of investing in the proposal. By taking all these factors into account, you can make a well-informed decision on whether it would be a worthwhile investment to support the film proposal for \\"Tenebrae.\\" It is essential to conduct thorough research and weigh the potential risks against the expected returns to ensure that your investment aligns with both your financial objectives and your passion for the project's content and vision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What city is home to the only library larger than the library located at Egypt's oldest degree-granting university? Answer:","output":"The city home to the only library larger than the library located at Egypt's oldest degree-granting university, which is Al-Azhar University in Cairo, is Washington, D.C. This city boasts the Library of Congress, the largest library in the world in terms of shelf space and number of books. Established in 1800, the Library of Congress is the research library serving the United States Congress and the de facto national library of the United States. With approximately 170 million items on its shelves, which is more than double the number of items housed in Al-Azhar University's library, it surpasses other vast libraries around the world. The Library of Congress holds an extensive collection comprising not only books and manuscripts but also photographs, maps, sheet music, sound recordings, films, prints, and drawings. Its impressive collection growth can be attributed to Congress's early recognition of the importance of acquiring and preserving knowledge beyond their legislative work. Furthermore, the Library of Congress has evolved into a hub for knowledge, providing services like research assistance, educational activities, and public exhibitions to scholars, researchers, and the general public from all over the world. Al-Azhar University in Cairo, founded in 970 AD, is one of the oldest and most esteemed Islamic institutions globally, playing a critical role in disseminating Islamic knowledge. Its library holds an exceptional collection of manuscripts, many of which are invaluable and rare, contributing to the Islamic world's educational and religious needs. However, the size of Al-Azhar University's library does not match that of the Library of Congress. The distinction in the scope and mission of both establishments is noteworthy. While both play critical roles in knowledge preservation, dissemination, and research, their focus and impact differ due to their unique historical evolution, geographical location, and the communities they primarily serve. In conclusion, Washington, D.C.'s Library of Congress holds the honor of being home to the only library larger than the library located at Egypt's oldest degree-granting university, Al-Azhar University in Cairo. The significant difference in size and the services they provide showcase the diversity and importance of knowledge and learning in our world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: From age eight to eleven, I studied at a small school in Bath, England. It was a small school of four classes, with about twenty-five children in each class according to age. For the most part, one teacher had to teach all subjects. However, sometimes the headteacher , Mr. Ronald Broaches would come in and spend an hour or so. He was a large man with a very happy nature. He had a sense of humor and would be glad in telling the children small stories which make us laugh. I found that he took great interest in me and he quickly found that I enjoyed puzzles. He would stop me as I was going to class and take a piece of paper out of his pocket, often with a puzzle on it. As time went on, they slowly gave me an interest in math and problem -solving that stays with me to this day. To this day, I can remember Mr. Broaches' cheerful cry of \\"Well done!\\" whenever I got a problem right. I shall always be thankful that our  paths crossed. Mr. Bruoaches died just two weeks after I won the 1993 Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine. Unfortunately, I had no chance to speak to him before he died. I learnt late that he had heard of my success and I will always hope that he knew the deep influence he had made on my life. Question: The writer's success shows us   _  . Answer: A:","output":"The writer's success shows us the significant impact a passionate and dedicated teacher can have on a student's life, inspiring them to develop essential skills and interests that can lead to remarkable achievements.

Tony lives at home with his overbearing and abusive, uneducated, working-class parents (Val Bisoglio and Julie Bovasso), and works a dead-end job in a small hardware store by day since graduating from high school.

Tony has four close friends that he goes out with to the disco: Joey (Joseph Cali); Double J (Paul Pape); Gus (Bruce Ornstein); and the diminutive Bobby C. (Barry Miller). Another informal member of their group is Annette (Donna Pescow), a neighborhood girl who longs for a more permanent and physical relationship with Tony.One plot device in the story is the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, which connects from Long Island to Staten Island, on which the friends ritually stop to clown around, but is particularly symbolic to Tony as an escape to a better life on the other side, in more suburban Staten Island.One day, Tony agrees to be Annette's partner in an upcoming dance contest at 2001 Odyssey, but her happiness is short-lived when Tony becomes infatuated with another girl dancing at the club, an older woman named Stephanie Mangano (Karen Lynn Gorney). Stephanie coldly rejects Tony's advances, but eventually agrees to be his partner in the competition, nothing more.Elsewhere, Tony's older brother, Frank Jr. (Martin Shakar), who was the pride of the family since becoming a priest in the Catholic Church, brings despair to their parents when he quits the priesthood.

Question: \\"What kind of treaties involved the President's approval?\\"  Context: \\"In the United States, the term \\"treaty\\" has a different, more restricted legal sense than exists in international law. United States law distinguishes what it calls treaties from executive agreement, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements. All four classes are equally treaties under international law; they are distinct only from the perspective of internal American law. The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval. Whereas treaties require advice and consent by two-thirds of the Senators present, sole executive agreements may be executed by the President acting alone. Some treaties grant the President the authority to fill in the gaps with executive agreements, rather than additional treaties or protocols. And finally, congressional-executive agreements require majority approval by both the House and the Senate, either before or after the treaty is signed by the President.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"In the context of the United States, several types of treaties involve the President's approval. These treaties, while all considered legally binding under international law, are treated differently in the context of American domestic law. U.S. law distinguishes between treaties, executive agreements, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements based on their methods of approval. 1. Treaties: These are formal, legally binding agreements between nations that require approval by two-thirds of the Senate. The President's role is to negotiate, sign, and submit the treaty to the Senate for advice and consent. Once the Senate approves the treaty, the President must ratify it to make it officially valid. The U.S. Constitution vests the President with the authority to make treaties with the advice and consent of the Senate. 2. Executive Agreements: These types of agreements, while still binding in international law, do not require the same level of approval as formal treaties. Executive agreements are entered into by the President and another nation and can cover various topics, including security, trade, and diplomatic relations. They do not need the consent of the Senate, but they are generally submitted to Congress for review and may require implementing legislation. 3. Congressional-Executive Agreements: Congressional-executive agreements require the majority approval of both the House of Representatives and the Senate, either before or after the President signs the treaty. These agreements often address trade and economic relations between the United States and other countries. The President's role in this type of treaty is to negotiate and sign the agreement, while Congress approves it through legislation, such as an act or resolution. 4. Sole Executive Agreements: Sole executive agreements are executed by the President acting alone and don't require consent from the Senate or approval of Congress. The President may enter into sole executive agreements based on their constitutional authority or in cases where a treaty or previous statute grants them the authority to do so. These agreements can cover various issues, such as military security arrangements, recognition of foreign governments, or humanitarian aid. In conclusion, while all of these types of treaties are considered legally-binding agreements in international law, they differ regarding the required level of the President's approval and involvement in their ratification and implementation. Treaties involve a higher degree of scrutiny and approval from the Senate, while executive agreements, congressional-executive agreements, and sole executive agreements offer more flexibility in the approval process. Overall, the President plays a crucial role in negotiating, signing, and implementing treaties and agreements on behalf of the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both \\"pit\\" and \\"cavity\\" can represent a hole or hollow space; they belong to the same semantic class of holes. Therefore, there is a COORD relationship.

Part #3: Determine if the given pair of words (X and Y) has a RANDOM relationship. Usage: X = pit, Y = cavity.

If a person works hard how is their situation improved? - compliments acknowledgment - better life - american dream - complimented - headache  The best answer is Answer:","output":"When a person works hard, they often experience significant improvements in various aspects of their life. Hard work enables an individual to achieve their goals, gain recognition, and ultimately enhance their overall quality of life. This concept is deeply ingrained in many cultures, particularly the American Dream, which emphasizes the opportunity for accomplishments through perseverance and dedication.  One way in which a person's situation is improved through hard work is the acknowledgment and compliments they receive from others. When an individual puts in the effort and demonstrates determination, their abilities and successes are often recognized by their peers, supervisors, or mentors. This recognition goes hand-in-hand with compliments, which can boost self-esteem and strengthen personal relationships. Additionally, a strong work ethic and self-discipline can lead to increased confidence and independence, further contributing to personal growth and development. Another key aspect of working hard is the attainment of a better life. By putting in the time, effort, and dedication to their work, an individual can earn a stable income and progress in their career. This, in turn, creates a solid foundation for financial stability and security, which allows for a comfortable lifestyle with opportunities for personal and professional growth. Moreover, financial stability is often complemented by better housing, healthcare, and education opportunities, all contributing factors to an individual's improved situation. The American Dream is a fundamental part of how hard work can lead to an improved situation. It is rooted in the belief that everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of their social, economic, or cultural background. Through hard work and determination, individuals can climb the social and economic ladder, achieving personal and financial success. This concept has inspired and motivated countless people to strive for a better life, believing that their efforts will ultimately be rewarded. Being complimented on one's hard work not only serves to affirm the value of their effort but also offers a source of motivation and encouragement to continue pushing boundaries. Compliments help validate personal achievements and reinforce the importance of the individual's contribution to a task or project. This recognition can lead to a sense of satisfaction and allows the individual to feel appreciated, ultimately empowering them to continue working hard and aiming high. However, hard work can sometimes come with its downsides, such as stress and headache. Working tirelessly on a project or task without sufficient breaks or relaxation can take a toll on one's mental and physical well-being. It is crucial to find a balance between the desire to succeed and self-care, ensuring that hard work does not sacrifice one's health and well-being in the long run.

Please answer the following question: SINGAPORE — In an agreement signed Tuesday in Singapore, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “reaffirmed his firm and unwavering commitment to complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula,” while U.S. President Donald Trump “committed to provide security guarantees” to North Korea. The document also calls for the two countries to jointly work on efforts to build a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, to establish new U.S.-North Korea relations and to recover the remains of prisoners of war and military members missing in action. The two sides also promised to hold follow-up negotiations. “We’re going to denuke North Korea,” Trump told VOA contributor Greta Van Susteren. He also said neither side issued ultimatums and that the agreement Tuesday was the result of months of negotiations. “You know that could have ended in a war, that could have ended with many millions of people — you know North Korea very well, Seoul has 28 million people, that could have ended with millions of people dead but we ended with a deal,” he said. Trump also told VOA that U.S. troops stationed in South Korea will remain in place, but announced one concession long-sought by North Korea. \\"We are going to get out of the war games that cost so much money,\\" he said. Trump said at later news conference that existing U.S. sanctions will remain in place until North Korean nuclear weapons \\"are no longer a factor.\\" As for verification, Trump said he and Kim discussed the issue and that monitoring denuclearization efforts would be achieved “by having a lot of people there.” He also predicted Kim would begin work right away to “live up to” the agreement. Asked if the talks included specifics on the size of North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, Trump said “what they have is substantial.” On human rights, Trump said Tuesday’s meetings only very briefly touched on the topic, but that the two sides would discuss it more in the future. When asked about thousands of people imprisoned in labor camps, Trump said he thinks he has helped them because things... Question: When is the next meeting between Trump and Un taking place?

Q:Information:  - \`\` Der gute Kamerad '' ( \`\` The good Comrade '' ) , also known by its incipit as Ich hatt ' einen Kameraden ( \`\` I had a comrade '' ) is a traditional lament of the German Armed Forces . The text was written by German poet Ludwig Uhland in 1809 . Its immediate inspiration was the deployment of Badener troops against the Tyrolean Rebellion . In 1825 , the composer Friedrich Silcher set it to music , based on the tune of a Swiss folk song . The song is about the immediate experience of a soldier losing a comrade in battle , detached from all political or national ideology ; as a result , its use was never limited to one particular faction and was sung or cited by representatives of all political backgrounds throughout the 19th and 20th centuries , and was translated for use in numerous fighting forces , French , Dutch , Spanish , Japanese and others . \`\` The Good Comrade '' still plays an important ceremonial role in the German Armed Forces and is an integral part of a military funeral , continuing a tradition started at some point around 1871 . The song has also become traditional in obsequies of the Military of Austria , the Austrian firebrigades and the highly prussianized Chilean Army . It is also used to some degree in the French Army , particularly in the Foreign Legion . When the song is played , soldiers are to salute , an honour otherwise reserved for national anthems only . Occasionally the song is played at civil ceremonies , most often when the deceased had been affiliated with the military . It is also commonly sung at the funerals of members of a Studentenverbindung . Finally , the song is often played on Volkstrauertag , the German Remembrance Day , at memorials for the fallen . The above text is Uhland 's original version . Various variants have been recorded over the years . Heyman Steinthal in an 1880 article in Zeitschrift für Völkerpsychologie noted a variant he heard sung by a housemaid , Die Kugel kam geflogen / Gilt sie mir ? Gilt sie dir ? ( i.e. \`\` the bullet came flying '' instead of...  - Grief is a multifaceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died, to which a bond or affection was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, cultural, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, \\"bereavement\\" refers to the state of loss, and \\"grief\\" is the reaction to that loss.  - Mourning is, in the simplest sense, grief over someone's death. The word is also used to describe a cultural complex of behaviours in which the bereaved participate or are expected to participate. Customs vary between cultures and evolve over time, though many core behaviors remain constant.  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.  - Crying is the shedding of tears in response to an emotional state. The act of crying has been defined as \\"a complex secretomotor phenomenon characterized by the shedding of tears from the lacrimal apparatus, without any irritation of the ocular structures\\". A related medical term is lacrimation, which also refers to non-emotional shedding of tears. Crying is also known as \\"weeping\\", \\"wailing\\", \\"whimpering\\", and \\"bawling\\".  - A lament or lamentation is a passionate expression of grief, often in music, poetry, or song form. The grief is most often born of regret, or mourning. Laments can also be expressed in a verbal manner, where the participant would lament about something they regret or someone they've lost, usually accompanied by wailing, moaning and/or crying. Laments constitute some of the oldest forms of writing and examples are present across human cultures.   - Johann Ludwig Uhland (26 April 1787  13 November 1862), was a German poet, philologist and literary historian.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.

Frizz is often caused by dryness, so it's important to restore moisture to your hair in the shower. Always use a sulfate-free shampoo. Hypothesis: Using a shampoo that contains sulfates is not recommended to fix frizzy hair.","output":"Upon assessing the given paragraph, it is evident that the hypothesis is true. According to the information provided, frizzy hair is often caused by dryness, which can be resolved by washing it with a moisturizing shampoo. The paragraph advises that a sulfate-free shampoo should be used for this purpose. Sulfates are common ingredients in many shampoos, and they are primarily used as a cleaning and foaming agent. Generally, they help remove dirt, oil, and other impurities from the hair. However, they can be quite harsh and may strip away the hair's natural oils, leading to dryness, which is a primary factor causing frizzy hair. The use of a shampoo that contains sulfates may exacerbate the dryness and frizziness of the hair, defeating the primary objective of restoring moisture and reducing frizz. Consequently, using a sulfate-free and moisturizing shampoo is preferable for improving the hair's overall health and appearance. In summary, the hypothesis that using a shampoo containing sulfates is not recommended for fixing frizzy hair stands true, as it is supported by the provided information. Opting for a sulfate-free and moisturizing shampoo is a more suitable alternative for individuals dealing with frizzy hair, helping them maintain and restore the natural moisture balance of their hair and, in turn, reducing frizziness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement \\"The kids are examining the photo holders\\" is open to interpretation, as it does not specify whether the children are holding the photo holders, also known as picture frames, up to their faces or merely looking at them in their hands or on a table. The two premises are similar and interconnected, but they are not explicitly the same. The initial premise, \\"Several children are holding up picture frames to their faces,\\" describes a situation where children are physically holding the picture frames to their faces, perhaps as a playful activity or to see how a photo might look when placed in a particular frame. This premise has a clear visual image and provides a specific detail about how the children are interacting with the picture frames. In contrast, the statement \\"The kids are examining the photo holders\\" is less specific regarding the manner in which the children interact with the picture frames. They could be just holding the frames in their hands, looking closely at the details of the frame's design, or trying to understand how to place a photo inside the frame. Given the lack of clarity in the second statement, we cannot definitively determine whether it supports or contradicts the initial premise. Thus, the correct answer is b).

Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers. Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours. Thanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools. If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, \\"Will home schools really work for my children?\\" Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.) Collectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college. One study found that of the home schooled students, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons. For more home schooling information, call us today toll free at (1800)542-8668.

The tweet reads: \\"@alperdotr i got bored lunch time?\\" 1. Addressing another user: The tweet begins with the username \\"@alperdotr\\" which indicates that the user is addressing their message to another Twitter user. This suggests that the sentiment is conversational and is meant for a specific recipient. The conversation may be ongoing or a response to a previous statement made by the recipient. 2. Emotional state: The tweeter proceeds to mention that they \\"got bored.\\" This expression suggests feelings of restlessness and dissatisfaction, indicating a negative sentiment. The user may be feeling weary due to a lack of engaging stimuli or activity. This feeling of boredom could also mean that the tweeter is seeking something new or different to rekindle their interest and motivation. 3. Lunch time suggestion: The message continues with the question \\"lunch time?\\". This proposition implies that the user is considering the potential of using lunchtime as a means to alleviate their boredom. There are a few possible interpretations of the overall sentiment behind this suggestion:     a. Casual conversation: The tweeter might be looking for a casual social interaction, such as sharing a meal, to alleviate their boredom. In this case, the sentiment would be neutral with a hint of openness and desire for social engagement.          b. Seeking a change of pace: The question may signify that the user is looking for a break from their current activity and believes that engaging in a different activity, like eating lunch, could provide a momentary escape from boredom.

In Colombia, the drug-financed guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include M-19, which Castro has clearly backed. Robert Merkel, a former U.S. attorney handling drug indictments in Florida, doesn't think for a minute that Castro's much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the Medellin drug cartel. \\"If the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the Colombian authorities into negotiations, the cartel will be in control and Fidel can exploit his past relationships with them,\\" he told the Journal's David Asman recently. The struggle against the drug lords in Colombia will be a near thing. This week, the government arrested Jose Abello Silva, said to be the fourth-ranking cartel leader. He will probably be extradited to the U.S. for trial under an extradition treaty President Virgilia Barco has revived. Later, another high-ranking trafficker, Leonidas Vargas, was arrested and 1,000 pounds of dynamite seized. Mr. Barco has refused U.S. troops or advisers but has accepted U.S. military aid. President Bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with Mr. Barco, President Alan Garcia of Peru and President Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia to discuss the drug problem. It might not be a bad idea to do that sooner, rather than later. After the Panama fiasco, they will need some reassurance. Certainly, the Colombian press is much in need of that.

Help as much as you can. I have a new situation: An archipelago in the Indian ocean included two very different islands. Snake island was a reptile paradise, inhabited by many species of reptiles. Bird island had few reptiles on it, but had various birds inhabiting it.  But I can use this background: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...  What is an answer for this question: Which island was inhabited by fewer turtles? A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Snake Island was inhabited primarily by reptiles, while Bird Island had fewer reptiles. Since turtles are a type of reptile, we can conclude that Bird Island was inhabited by fewer turtles. So, the answer is: A: Bird Island."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Others are beings with extraordinary powers who have been hiding among us for centuries, but the balance between the two factions is on the verge of collapse. For years, The Others have been oppressed and hunted by the government, in fear their powers could overthrow the established order. The protagonist, Alex Kane, a kind-hearted teenager, discovers she has extraordinary abilities, able of manipulating electricity. Feeling scared and confused, she stumbles across an underground movement called \\"The Awakening,\\" an organization that aims to unite The Others. Its leaders, Jon, a wise and stoic telepath, and Lila, a fierce and skilled strategist with the power of pyrokinesis, are determined to bring together The Others and negotiate peace with the government. As Alex starts to explore her powers, she meets Cyrus, a charming, enigmatic morpher, and develops a romantic connection. Together, they train with other powerful individuals to hone their skills and build a powerful force. Their abilities range from telekinesis, healing, to even the power of control over nature itself. However, the government launches a counter-attack, led by General Harding, who funds a program to create a group of soldiers, called \\"The Hunters,\\" augmented with abilities artificially extracted from captured and imprisoned Others. Throughout their journey, Alex and the group face fearsome encounters with these Hunters, as well as internal discord among The Others. While some want to use their powers to fight for control, others genuinely wish to find a common ground and live peacefully among the humans. As the conflict escalates, tough choices are made, and great sacrifices are required from all sides, testing Alex's beliefs and resolve. In a final confrontation, General Harding reveals that he is also one of The Others – a traitor who has sided with the government in exchange for power. Alex's electrokinetic powers, combined with the abilities of the Awakening members, manage to overthrow the General – but at a significant cost, with the tragic death of Lila. Despite the heavy losses, a sense of hope emerged from the darkness. The government, now aware that many of its own members have hidden abilities, comes to the realization that they cannot win this war and that collaboration is the only way forward. The movie ends with a tentative truce between The Humans and The Others, as the two sides come together to rebuild a society that accepts and celebrates their differences. The Awakening of The Others leaves its audience in awe, showing that the true power lies within unity and understanding – as Alex and her friends learn to embrace their unique abilities and work together towards a brighter future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - Tripoli (; Berber: \\"rables\\") is the capital city and the largest city of Libya. Tripoli, with its metropolitan area, has a population of about 1.1 million people. The city is located in the northwestern part of Libya on the edge of the desert, on a point of rocky land projecting into the Mediterranean and forming a bay. Tripoli includes the Port of Tripoli and the country's largest commercial and manufacturing centre. It is also the site of the University of Tripoli. The vast Bab al-Azizia barracks, which includes the former family estate of Muammar Gaddafi, is also located in the city. Colonel Gaddafi largely ruled the country from his residence in this barracks.  - A militia is generally an army or some other type of fighting unit that is composed of non-professional fighters, citizens of a nation or subjects of a state or government who can be called upon to enter a combat situation, as opposed to a professional force of regular, full-time military personnel, or historically, members of the warrior nobility class (e.g., knights or samurai). Unable to hold their own against properly trained and equipped professional forces, it is common for militias to engage in guerrilla warfare or defense instead of being used in open attacks and offensive actions.  - The Battle of Plattsburgh, also known as the Battle of Lake Champlain, ended the final invasion of the northern states of the United States during the War of 1812. A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. Downie's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb's defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake.  - Thomas Macdonough , Jr. ( December 21 , 1783 -- November 10 , 1825 ) was an early - 19th - century American naval officer noted for his roles in the first Barbary War and the War of 1812 . He was the son of a revolutionary officer , Thomas Macdonough , Sr. who lived near Middletown , Delaware . He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside . He entered naval life at an early age , receiving a midshipman 's commission at the age of sixteen . Serving with Stephen Decatur at Tripoli , he was a member of \`\` Preble 's Boys '' , a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of Commodore Preble during the First Barbary War . Macdonough achieved fame during the War of 1812 , commanding the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain , part of the larger Battle of Plattsburgh , which helped lead to an end to that war .  - Colonel (abbreviated Col., Col or COL and pronounced , similar to \\"kernel\\") is a senior military officer rank below the general officer ranks. However, in some small military forces, such as those of Iceland or the Vatican, colonel is the highest rank. It is also used in some police forces and paramilitary organizations.  - Lieutenant-General Sir George Prévost, 1st Baronet (19 May 1767  5 January 1816) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. Prévost wrongfully became known as the \\"defender of Canada\\" for his alleged leadership during the War of 1812. See \\"Letters of Veritas\\" as written by various high ranking officials of the time. Born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the eldest son of Swiss French Augustine Prévost, he joined the British Army as a youth and became a captain in 1784. Prévost served in the West Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and was commander of St. Vincent from 1794 to 1796. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia from 1798 to 1802 and Governor of Dominica from 1802 to 1805. He is best known to history for serving as both the civilian Governor General and the military Commander in Chief in British North America (now part of Canada) during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States of America. See letters of Veritas by Sewell take note of allegations of treason around p 84. Many concrete examples of questionnable activities, and described as a coward with no honor on p.120. Comments were made in writing by multiple high ranking military personnel  - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes.  - Officer Cadet is a rank held by military cadets during their training to become commissioned officers. In the United Kingdom, the rank is also used by members of University Royal Naval Units, University Officer Training Corps and University Air Squadron.  - George Downie (19 January 1778  11 September 1814) was a Scottish officer of the British Royal Navy who, during the War of 1812, commanded a British squadron which fought an American squadron on Lake Champlain in the Battle of Plattsburgh, during which he was killed.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A midshipman is an officer cadet or a commissioned officer candidate of the junior-most rank, in the Royal Navy, United States Navy, and many Commonwealth navies. Commonwealth countries which use the rank include Canada, Australia, Bangladesh, Namibia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Pakistan, Singapore, Sri Lanka, and Kenya.   - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare.   - Muammar Mohammed Abu Minyar Gaddafi (20 October 2011), commonly known as Colonel Gaddafi, was a Libyan revolutionary, politician, and political theorist. He governed Libya as Revolutionary Chairman of the Libyan Arab Republic from 1969 to 1977 and then as the \\"Brotherly Leader\\" of the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya from 1977 to 2011. He was initially ideologically committed to Arab nationalism and Arab socialism, but he came to rule according to his own Third International Theory before embracing Pan-Africanism. Born near Sirte, Gaddafi was the son of an impoverished Bedouin goat herder. He became involved in politics while at school in Sabha, later enrolling in the Royal Military Academy, Benghazi. He founded a revolutionary cell within the military; in 1969, they seized power from the monarchy of King Idris in a bloodless coup. Gaddafi became Chairman of the governing Revolutionary Command Council (RCC); he then abolished the monarchy and proclaimed the Republic, ruling by decree. He implemented measures to remove what he viewed as foreign imperialist influence from Libya, and strengthened ties to Arab nationalist governments, particularly Gamal Abdel Nasser's Egypt. He was intent on pushing Libya towards \\"Islamic socialism\\", introducing \\"sharia\\" as the basis for the legal system and nationalising the oil industry, using the increased revenues to bolster the military, implement social programs, and fund revolutionary militants across the world. In 1973, he initiated a \\"Popular Revolution\\" with the formation of General People's Committees (GPCs), purported to be a system of direct democracy, but retained personal control over major decisions. He outlined his Third International Theory that year, publishing these ideas in \\"The Green Book\\". In 1977, Gaddafi dissolved the Republic and created a new socialist state called the \\"Jamahiriya\\" (\\"state of the masses\\"), officially adopting a symbolic role in governance. He retained power as military commander-in-chief and head of the Revolutionary...    What is the relationship between 'thomas macdonough' and 'colonel'? A:","output":"Thomas Macdonough was an early 19th-century American naval officer who gained fame during the War of 1812. He held the rank of Master Commandant, which is a naval rank equivalent to the rank of 'Lieutenant Colonel' in the land-based armed forces. Macdonough commanded the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain, which was part of the larger Battle of Plattsburgh.

Dimorphic fungi, like Histoplasma capsulatum you mentioned, can shift between a mycelium form (that looks like a mass of threads) at cooler temperatures around 25°C to a yeast form (single, round cells) at body temperature around 37°C. This ability to morph based on temperature (thermal dimorphism) is a defining characteristic of dimorphic fungi. On the other hand, regular fungi, which Max investigated, may not display this particular dimorphism trait - the ability to change their physical structure based on environmental conditions. Therefore, it can be inferred that Max learned less about fungi that can change their shape compared to Red."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While her choices may sometimes seem unconventional, they ultimately showcase her willingness to defy stereotypes and embrace her own path. In a world where women with high-profile partners are often expected to remain in the background, Sally Bercow's determination to make her own waves and maintain her independence is, in its own way, a powerful statement. It challenges the notions of traditional gender roles and presents an alternative perspective on being a partner, mother, and public figure.

Tom had hypertension and the doc told him to change his diet.  and a hint : Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure.

Answer:","output":"Tom had to start drinking skim milk. As mentioned earlier, Tom had hypertension, and his doctor advised him to change his diet. Since hypertension is a condition characterized by consistently high blood pressure, it's crucial for Tom to adopt a healthier lifestyle and make dietary changes to manage his condition effectively. Introducing skim milk into his diet is one such change, as it is a food considered to lower blood pressure. Skim milk is a good source of calcium and vitamin D, which both play a role in maintaining healthy blood pressure levels. Other foods that can help lower blood pressure include spinach, beans, bananas, and dark chocolate. In addition to modifying his diet, Tom should also engage in regular exercise and follow any prescribed medication regimen to further manage his hypertension. It is essential for Tom to monitor his blood pressure regularly and follow his doctor's advice to minimize the risk of developing serious cardiovascular diseases, stroke, or other complications associated with hypertension.

Article: My father's reaction to the bank building at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York city was immediate and definite: \\"You won't catch me putting my money in there!\\" he declared, \\"Not in that glass box!\\" Of course, my father is a gentleman of the old school, a member of the generation to whom a good deal of modern architecture is upsetting, but I am convinced that his negative response was not so much to the architecture as to a violation of his concept of the nature of money. In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity   that could be carried, or stolen. Consequently, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to affirm the fact, however untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building's design made it appear impenetrable , the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol reflected people's prevailing attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Excepting pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a has largely been replaced by credit. A deficit   economy, accompanied by huge expansion, has led us to think of money as product of the creative imagination. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable element is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture boasts of imaginative powers.

Q: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it.

As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers.

Here is a goal: How to glue your saw blade attachment together? How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of gluing a saw blade attachment together, please follow these steps: Step 1: Gather materials Gather the broken pieces of the saw blade attachment, a strong adhesive suitable for metal (such as epoxy resin or a metal bonding glue), gloves, a clean cloth or paper towel, and sandpaper or a steel brush. Step 2: Assess the damage Examine the broken pieces of the saw blade attachment to determine whether they can be glued back together effectively. If the damage is too severe or the pieces are missing, it may be more effective and safer to replace the attachment. Step 3: Clean and prep the damaged areas Put on gloves, and use the clean cloth or paper towel to remove any dirt, grease, or debris from the broken surfaces. Then, use the sandpaper or a steel brush to roughen the surfaces to help the adhesive bond more effectively. Step 4: Mix the adhesive Following the instructions on the adhesive's packaging, mix the adhesive as directed. For epoxy-based adhesives, it's usually a 1:1 ratio, but be sure to check the manufacturer's specifications. Step 5: Apply the adhesive Carefully apply a thin layer of adhesive to the broken surfaces, ensuring that the adhesive covers the entire area that will be joined. Step 6: Attach the pieces Press the broken pieces together firmly, and hold them in place for a few seconds to allow the adhesive to begin bonding. Step 7: Secure the attachment while the adhesive cures To ensure a strong bond, find a way to keep the pieces securely in place while the adhesive cures (this may take several hours, depending on the adhesive used). You can use clamps, rubber bands, or tape, but ensure you don't apply pressure directly on the glued surfaces to avoid misplacement. Step 8: Wait for the adhesive to cure Let the adhesive cure for the recommended time listed on the adhesive's packaging (usually 24 hours). Avoid using the saw blade attachment during this time to prevent any strain on the glued area. Step 9: Test the repair After the adhesive has fully cured, remove the clamps, rubber bands, or tape and test the saw blade attachment for any signs of weakness or improper bonding. If the repair is successful and the attachment is securely in place, you can consider the task completed. Note: Keep in mind that depending on the damage, gluing a saw blade attachment may not be the safest or most effective solution. Always evaluate the situation and consider replacing the attachment if it poses a risk during operation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed by an American bomber, Rachel manages to escape the area thanks to a local man, Rob, and visits a lawyer named Smaal, who provides her with some of her father's money so that she can flee, helped by a man named Van Gein. Rachel and Rob are reunited with her family and try to flee by boat through the Biesbosch with other Jews from the Nazi-occupied part of the Netherlands to the liberated southern part of the country. However, it turns out to be a trap. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German SS, who kill them and rob the bodies of their cash and other valuables. Rachel alone survives, but she does not manage to escape from occupied territory. Using a non-Jewish alias, Ellis de Vries, Rachel becomes involved with a Dutch resistance group in the Hague, under the leadership of Gerben Kuipers and working closely with a doctor in the Resistance, Hans Akkermans. Smaal is in touch with this Resistance cell. When Kuipers' son and other members of the Resistance are captured, Ellis agrees to help by seducing local SD commander HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer Ludwig MÃ¼ntze, bleaching all of her hair blonde.

From 1911 to 2013, Seattle's nine city councillors were elected at large, rather than by geographic subdivisions. For the 2015 election, this changed to a hybrid system of seven district members and two at-large members as a result of a ballot measure passed on November 5, 2013. The only other elected offices are the city attorney and Municipal Court judges. All city offices are officially non-partisan.Like some other parts of the United States, government and laws are also run by a series of ballot initiatives (allowing citizens to pass or reject laws), referenda (allowing citizens to approve or reject legislation already passed), and propositions (allowing specific government agencies to propose new laws or tax increases directly to the people). Jenny Durkan was elected as mayor in the 2017 mayoral election and took office on November 28, 2017. The mayor's office also includes two deputy mayors, appointed to advise the mayor on policies; As of 2017, the city's deputy mayors are Michael Fong and Shefali Ranganathan.Seattle's political culture is very liberal and progressive for the United States, with over 80% of the population voting for the Democratic Party.

To understand this better, let us analyze the two statements. In the first statement - \\"So as I said, the story of the baby-sitting co-op helps me remain hopeful in times of depression,\\" it is clear that the individual finds a sense of hope, motivation, and positivity from the baby-sitting co-op story when faced with challenging situations like depression. The story could possibly inspire the individual with the valuable lessons of cooperation, shared responsibility, and the ability to overcome obstacles by working together. This suggests that the story serves as a reminder that better times are possible with combined effort and mutual support. On the other hand, the second statement - \\"The story of the co-op of babysitting makes me feel sad\\" - contradicts the positive sentiments expressed in the first statement. This would imply that the baby-sitting co-op story evokes feelings of sadness and is not as inspiring as initially stated. Perhaps the story is bittersweet, or it might have elements that resonate negatively with the individual. However, based on the information provided, it appears that the first statement is more reflective of the individual's true feelings towards the baby-sitting co-op story. As such, we cannot conclude that \\"The story of the co-op of babysitting makes me feel sad\\" without further clarification or context. It is essential to understand the specific aspects of the baby-sitting co-op story that the individual finds hopeful or sad; this will help us better distinguish their emotions and evaluate the role of the story in their emotional state.

Road to Perdition, a movie undeservedly overlooked at that year Oscars is the second work of Sam Mendes (and in my opinion his best work), a director who three years before won Oscar for his widely acclaimed but controversial American Beauty. This is a terrific movie, and at the same time ultimately poignant and sad. It's a story of a relatively wealthy and happy family from outward appearance during difficult times of Depression when the, Michael Sullivan, a father of two children, played by great Tom Hanks (I'm not his admirer but ought to say that) is a hit-man for local mafia boss, played by Paul Newman. His eldest son, a thirteen years boy Michael Sullivan Jr., perfectly played by young Tyler Hoechlin, after years of blissful ignorance finds out what is his father job and on what money their family live. Prompted by his curiosity and his aspiration to know truth he accidentally becomes a witness of a murder, committed by John Rooney, son of his father boss. Such discovery strikes an innocent soul and it caused numerous events that changed his life forever. The atmosphere of the period, all the backgrounds and decorations are perfectly created, editing and cinematography are almost flawless while the story is well written. But the main line of the movie, the most important moments and points of the movie and the key factor of the movie success are difficult father-son relations in bad times. They are shown so deeply, strong and believable. Tom Hanks does excellent and has one of the best performances of his career in a quite unusual role for him and all acting across the board is superb. Finally worth to mention a very nice score by Paul Newman and in the result we get an outstanding work of all people involved in making this beautiful (but one more time sad) masterpiece.

These web-based forums for discussing ideas, experiences or opinions allow students to discuss publicly what they are studying with other students and experts outside their own university. \\"I really encourage them to put their personal opinion in there, provided they are informed and backed up with evidence.\\" Bartlett-Bragg says because a lot of academics in her field of electronic or e-learning now have their own blogs, students can engage directly with them. She says one of the most powerful facilities in weblogs is pinging, which involves a person positing a comment about someone else's work on their own blog. They use the \\"Trackback\\" tool to notify the author when they have published the comment, basically inviting them to discuss it. \\"They get such a buzz when they make a comment on another person outside the boundaries of the institution and that person responds, or even gives them some further reading.\\" she says. \\"They are getting new perspectives that I can't give them in a normal lecture.\\" Question: What Bartlett-Bragg likes most is that blogs can help students to   _  . - think for themselves - have stronger sense of responsibility - know more about the world outside - finish an essay assignment easily A:","output":"think for themselves Step-by-step justification: 1.

I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab. I would not have pretended it wasn’t happening, or “not that bad” or other form of denial. As is, I lived through this hell for two years, and a part of me will never forgive for how it all came about. Probably TMI, sorry.

A new survey suggests these clubs are the only way many students can get a meal before lessons. About 54% of the 552 school staff questioned by the Association of Teachers and Lecturers(ATL)said their school provides a breakfast club for pupils. The biggest reason for them to attend these clubs is that their parents or carer goes to work early, cited by 76.8% of those questioned. About 22.6% said children attended due to lack of money at home because parents or carers are unemployed and 15.2% said lack of money at home due to changes or cuts to benefits. About 17.6% said pupils mainly attend breakfast clubs to socialize. The survey found that teachers believe that offering breakfast to pupils often helps improve their concentration and ability to learn. One primary school teacher said: \\"Although there is a charge for our breakfast club, we have accessed funding for those pupils on free school meals and the breakfast club had an effect on their attendance, concentration and being in school for the start of lessons. ATL general secretary Dr Roper said a nutritious meal at the start of the day has a huge impact on pupils' ability to learn. \\"Many schools do everything they can to ensure children eat well during school term-time.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: The Illyrians (Ancient Greek: Illurioi, Illyrioi; Latin: Illyrii or Illyri) were a group of Indo-European tribes in antiquity, who inhabited part of the western Balkans.  The territory the Illyrians inhabited came to be known as Illyria to Greek and Roman authors, who identified a territory that corresponds to Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, Montenegro, part of Serbia and most of central and northern Albania, between the Adriatic Sea in the west, the Drava river in the north, the Morava river in the east and the mouth of the Aoos river in the south. The first account of Illyrian peoples comes from the Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax, an ancient Greek text of the middle of the 4th century BC that describes coastal passages in the Mediterranean. The name \\"Illyrians\\", as applied by the ancient Greeks to their northern neighbors, may have referred to a broad, ill-defined group of peoples, and it is today unclear to what extent they were linguistically and culturally homogeneous. Illyria appears in Greco-Roman historiography from the 4th century BC. The Illyrians formed several kingdoms in the central Balkans, and the first known Illyrian king was Bardyllis. Illyrian kingdoms were often at war with ancient Macedonia, and the Illyrian pirates were also a significant danger to neighbouring peoples. At the Neretva Delta, there was a strong Hellenistic influence on the Illyrian tribe of Daors. Their capital was Daorson located in Osanici near Stolac in Herzegovina, which became the main center of classical Illyrian culture. Daorson, during the 4th century BC, was surrounded by megalithic, 5 meter high stonewalls, composed out of large trapeze stones blocks. Daors also made unique bronze coins and sculptures. The Illyrians even conquered Greek colonies on the Dalmatian islands. Queen Teuta was famous for having waged wars against the Romans.  After Philip II of Macedon defeated Bardylis (358 BC), the Grabaei under Grabos became the strongest state in Illyria. Philip II killed 7,000 Illyrians in a great victory and annexed the territory up to Lake Ohrid. Next, Philip II reduced the Grabaei, and then went for the Ardiaei, defeated the Triballi (339 BC), and fought with Pleurias (337 BC).  In the Illyrian Wars of 229 BC, 219 BC and 168 BC Rome overran the Illyrian settlements and suppressed the piracy that had made the Adriatic unsafe for Italian commerce. There were three campaigns, the first against Teuta the second against Demetrius of Pharos and the third against Gentius. The initial campaign in 229 BC marks the first time that the Roman Navy crossed the Adriatic Sea to launch an invasion.  The Roman Republic subdued the Illyrians during the 2nd century BC. An Illyrian revolt was crushed under Augustus, resulting in the division of Illyria in the provinces of Pannonia in the north and Dalmatia in the south. Were they peaceful or warlike?","output":"The Illyrians were a group of tribes that lived long ago in the western Balkans, which is now a part of countries like Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Slovenia. They were not always peaceful. In fact, they often fought wars with other kingdoms, like ancient Macedonia. They also had pirates who were dangerous to their neighbors. So, while they might have had some peaceful times, they were often involved in wars and battles."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which of these benefits does recycling provide to Maryland?","output":"Recycling in Maryland provides many benefits, such as: 1. Saving natural resources: Recycling helps save important materials like trees, water, and minerals. When we recycle, we can use those materials again and again instead of taking more from the Earth. 2. Reducing pollution: Making new things from old materials creates less pollution than making new things from new materials. For example, recycling paper means we don't have to cut down as many trees, which helps keep the air clean. 3. Saving energy: Recycling usually uses less energy than making products from new materials. That means we don't need to use as much electricity, which can help save our environment. 4. Helping wildlife: Recycling helps protect the homes of animals and plants, because we use fewer natural resources. This means there's less disruption to their habitats. 5. Creating jobs: Recycling centers often provide jobs for people in Maryland, so more people can have work to support their families. 6. Saving landfill space: Landfills are places where we put our trash. By recycling, we don't need to put as much trash into landfills. This helps save space for other things, like parks or buildings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When should sportspeople consider taking protein supplements? Options: - When they are fasting - When they are traveling - not enough information - When they are eating a high protein meal Answer:","output":"When they are traveling"},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Based on the premise \\"On the mosque floor rests a huge ancient slab, the Rock itself, on which Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac (but was given a last-minute reprieve by an angel) and from which the prophet Mohammed roseto Heaven during his dream-visit to Jeru?γalem.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The rock on which Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son now resides on the floor of the mosque.\\" is true?","output":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"The rock on which Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son now resides on the floor of the mosque,\\" we must first examine the given premise, which states that \\"On the mosque floor rests a huge ancient slab, the Rock itself, on which Abraham prepared to sacrifice his son Isaac (but was given a last-minute reprieve by an angel) and from which the prophet Mohammed rose to Heaven during his dream-visit to Jerusalem.\\" The mosque in question is most likely the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which is an important religious site for both Jews and Muslims. The Rock referred to in the premise is called the Foundation Stone and is deeply entrenched in the religious history of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. According to the sacred texts of these faiths, the Foundation Stone is believed to be the point from which the world was created and a place where significant religious events have taken place. In Judaism, the Foundation Stone is considered the place where creation began and holds significant importance as the site where Abraham almost sacrificed his son, Isaac. While Christians believe that the Foundation Stone lies inside the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the Islamic tradition points to the stone being located in the Dome of the Rock, a shrine that sits on the Temple Mount alongside the Al-Aqsa Mosque. In Islamic tradition, the Foundation Stone is significant for two main reasons. Firstly, it is believed to be the location where Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham in Islamic tradition) was ordered to sacrifice his son Ismail (Ishmael), not Isaac as stated in the premise. However, the story of the sacrifice is similar in both religions, where God commanded Abraham to sacrifice his son and then stopped him at the last moment as a test of his faith. Secondly, the Foundation Stone is also associated with Prophet Muhammad's Night Journey, known as Al-Isra' and Al-Miraj, during which he led prayers with the previous prophets and then ascended to the heavens to meet Allah. Based on the information provided, the hypothesis – \\"The rock on which Abraham was ordered to sacrifice his son now resides on the floor of the mosque\\" – can be considered as true within the context of the Islamic religious tradition. In this context, the rock, known as the Foundation Stone, is believed to be situated on the floor of the Dome of the Rock on the Temple Mount, adjacent to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem. It holds deep religious significance in Islamic, Jewish, and Christian traditions and symbolizes the site where significant religious events have occurred, including Abraham's sacrifice and Prophet Muhammad's ascension to the heavens. However, it is important to note that the differing interpretations of this sacred stone across religious traditions mean that this hypothesis's validity may be subjective and vary according to each individual's belief system."},{"instruction":"Some scientists have suggested that it might in some cases be ethically  acceptable to clone existing people. One possibility is generating replacement for a dying  . All such possibilities, however, raise the concern that the clone would be treated as less than a complete individual, because he or she would likely suffer from limitations and expectations based on the family's knowledge of the genetic \\"twin.\\" Those expectations might be false, because human personality is only partly determined by genes. The clone of an extrovert  could have a quite different way of behavior. Clones of athletes, movie stars, or scientists might well choose different careers because of chance events in early life.        Some people have also put forward the belief that couples in which one member is infertile  might choose to make a copy of one or the other partner. But society ought to be concerned that a couple might not treat naturally a child who is a copy of just one of them. Because other methods are available for the treatment of all known types of infertility, the traditional choice seems more appropriate. None of the suggested uses of cloning for making copies of existing people is ethically acceptable to my way of thinking, because they are not in the interests of the resulting child. It should go without saying that I am strongly opposed to allowing cloned human embryos  to develop so that they can be tissue donors.

For the product ((x^2 + 1)(y^2 + 1)) to be a prime number, one of the factors must be 1 because a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. 3. Therefore, we need either (x^2 + 1 = 1) or (y^2 + 1 = 1):    - If (x^2 + 1 = 1), then (x^2 = 0) which implies (x = 0).    - If (y^2 + 1 = 1), then (y^2 = 0) which implies (y = 0). 4.

The LCM of 45 and 60 is 180. 2. LCM of 100 and 200: Since 200 is a multiple of 100, the LCM of 100 and 200 is 200. 3.

It was found that both at 17:00 and 18:00, the BMW was twice as far from the intersection as the Audi. At what time could the Audi have crossed the intersection?","output":"To determine the time at which the \\"Audi\\" might have crossed the intersection, we start by defining some variables and clarifying the problem statement.  1. Let A denote the \\"Audi\\" and B denote the BMW.  2. Let P be the intersection point. 3. Suppose at 17:00, A was at distance x from P, and B was at distance 2x from P. Both are moving with a constant speed of v. 4. We are informed that at both 17:00 and 18:00, the BMW is twice as far from the intersection as the Audi. From these points, we set up the problem using the conditions provided: 5. **Assumption Analysis**:     - If at 17:00 A and B had already crossed P, then by 18:00, they would be at distances x + v and 2x + v respectively. The ratio frac{2(x + v)}{x + v} equals 2 only if x=0 or v=0, which is not our case.     - Similarly, it is impossible for both A and B to move towards P and maintain the 2:1 distance ratio under similar logic. 6. **Hypothesis on Crossing P:**     - Therefore, it suggests either A or B must have crossed the intersection P between 17:00 and 18:00. Let's assume it is A that crosses P. 7. If A crosses P between these times:     - At 18:00, A would be at a distance v - x from P (crossing at some time and continuing to move further).     - BMW B would be either moving towards or away from P and must be consistent with being twice the distance of A at 18:00. We validate the two potential conditions based on their directions: 8. **Case Analysis**:     - **Case if A crosses P exactly at t = 17:30:**         - At 17:45, A is at v/2 distance away from P.         - BMW B, as per the conditions, must be at 2(v/2) = v distance away at 17:45.            - **General Case if A crosses before or after t=17:30:**         - Let A cross at t=17:45, this gives:             - At 18:00, A is 15 minutes worth of journey (v/4) further away. So at distance v/4. BMW should be at v, which does not maintain the 2:1 ratio.         - Resolving multiple scenarios:             - General case condition verification, supposing related variable distances and their proportion maintaining GOG would lead up with established valid times of potential crossover tallying as exact variables match geometric harmonic progression of actual travel facts physics equations. 9. **General Case Cancellation Confirmation**:     - Aggregate all minutes analysis results would tally more powerful consistent periodic arithmetic or harmonic comparisons validate direct conclusions with minor iterative variable actuals consistently linearly run physical constants travel metrics.

Therefore, the total face value for five quarters is (5 times 0.25 = 1.25) dollars. 3. **Total Amount Bryden Will Receive**:    - Since the payment is 25 times the face value, Bryden will receive (25 times 1.25) dollars for his five quarters.    - That calculation yields: (25 times 1.25 = 31.25) dollars.

The vertex of this parabola is at (2,0), making x=2 the axis of symmetry. Step 2: Determine the relative positions of points A, B, and C with respect to the axis of symmetry.

Next, let's take (a = n) and (b = 1). We obtain:    [    f(f(n) + f(1)) = n + 1    ]    Similarly, for (a = n + 1) and (b = 0), we have:    [    f(f(n + 1) + c) = n + 1    ]    By injectivity of (f), we equate the arguments:    [    f(n) + f(1) = f(n + 1) + c    ] 6. Rearranging gives us a recurrence relation:    [    f(n + 1) = f(n) + f(1) - c    ] 7. Let us denote (f(1) = b). The recurrence relation becomes:    [    f(n + 1) = f(n) + b - c    ] 8. We now solve the recurrence relation. Setting (f(0) = c) and iterating, we get:    [    f(n) = c + n(b - c)    ] 9. To achieve (f) being an injective and surjective function on (mathbb{N}), and substitute this solution back into the original equation (f(f(a) + f(b)) = a + b), we find:    [    f(n) = n    ]    Substituting (f(n) = n) in the functional equation:    [    f(f(a) + f(b)) = f(a + b) = a + b    ]    confirms (a = 0) and (b = 1). 10.

The line segments may share points. This continues until all vertices are used. After this, if the first player can choose a direction for each connecting line segment such that the sum of all resulting vectors is a zero vector, the first player wins. Otherwise, the second player wins. Determine which player has a winning strategy with optimal play.","output":"To determine who has a winning strategy in this game, we analyze the underlying mechanics and use logical reasoning. 1. **Initial Assumption & Setup**:      - We assume that the rectangle (denoted by R) has one of its long sides parallel to the O x-axis and one of its short sides parallel to the O y-axis. The bottom-left corner coincides with the origin of the coordinate system.     - This setup helps us analyze operations at integral points more easily. 2. **Insight 1**:     - We assert that after all the operations are completed, regardless of how the directions are chosen, the sum of the vectors' projections on both the O x-axis and the O y-axis will be an even number.     - **Proof**: Consider the projection of the vectors on the O x-axis.         - For each vector, depending on its direction, the coordinates of its endpoints on the O x-axis either add up with a positive or negative sign.         - There are (50) points with x-coordinate 0, (50) points with x-coordinate 1,... up to 69.          - Out of these coordinates, there will always be an even number of odd coordinates and an even number of even coordinates, ensuring that their sum is even.          - The same argument follows for the projections on the O y-axis.     - Therefore, the vectors' total projection lengths on both axes will be even. This completes the proof of Insight 1. 3. **Insight 2**:     - For the rectangle (R) with a size (49 times 69), any finite number of line segments could be chosen such that after choosing appropriate directions for each line segment, the sum of the resultant vectors' projections on the (O x)-axis is less than 140 and on the (O y)-axis is less than 100.     - **Proof**:         - We classify line segments into four sets:              1. Lines parallel to the O x-axis (Group Lambda),             2. Lines parallel to the O y-axis (Group B),             3. Lines with right endpoints higher than the left (Group C),             4. Lines with right endpoints lower than the left (Group D).         - Actions performed on these groups ensure the auxiliary vector sum lengths remain below limits:             - Each line segment, after appropriate direction choice, will have its vector sum projection on the (O x)-axis and (O y)-axis not exceeding 69 and 49, respectively.             - If these auxiliary vectors met and reduced to zero, the total lengths achieved are precisely covered under 140 (for (O x)) and under 100 (for (O y)) projections. This completes the proof of Insight 2. 4. **Return to the Original Problem Solution**:     - Given Insights 1 and 2, we derive the first player's strategy.     - The player ensures to create 140 horizontal and 100 vertical unit-length line segments appropriately. We call these 'good' segments.     - **Actual Strategy**:         - Divide (R) into smaller 2 times 2 square units, where each unit shares common vertices with other units, with the left bottom corner shifts from (2i, 2j), for (i=0,..,34) and (j=0,..,24).         - The (25 cdot 35 = 875) such squares provide ample lines for the first player to select all required good line segments over 240 moves.     - Conclusively, in each move, the first player chooses one edge from the (2 times 2) squares that are not yet used, ensuring they can form 140 horizontal and 100 vertical lines within these conditions. Conclusively, fitting these conditioners, the first player establishes winning condition by creating required line segments within bounds as proven by used insights.

Compare fleft(frac{1}{2}right) and f(2) to determine the smaller value:    [    frac{fleft(frac{1}{2}right)}{f(2)} = frac{sqrt{e}}{e} times frac{e^2}{4} = sqrt{frac{e^3}{16}} > 1,    ]    indicating fleft(frac{1}{2}right) > f(2). 3. Therefore, the maximum value of f(x) on the interval [frac{1}{2},2] is at x=1, which is boxed{frac{2}{e}}, and the minimum value is at x=2, which is boxed{frac{4}{e^2}}."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = sqrt{mx^2 + mx + 1}, the domain of this function is all real numbers.

Let's consider 10 bus routes represented by 10 distinct lines in a plane. These lines are constructed so that each pair of lines intersect at a unique point, forming a set of intersection points.     To ensure that every pair of lines intersects at a unique point, we can use the fact that for ( n ) lines, the number of intersection points formed is ( binom{n}{2} ). Hence, for 10 lines, we have:     [     text{Number of intersection points} = binom{10}{2} = frac{10 times (10 - 1)}{2} = 45     ]     Consequently, we have 45 distinct points of intersection. 2. These intersection points will serve as bus stops. Each line (bus route) will go through exactly 9 stops (intersection points with the other 9 lines). 3. We need to prove that any set of 9 routes (lines) will cover all these 45 stops, and any set of 8 routes will miss at least one stop. 4. Consider selecting any 9 out of the 10 lines. Each of these 9 lines intersects with the remaining lines at 8 points, for a total of:    [    9 times 8 = 72    ]    However, since each intersection is counted twice (once for each line), the total number of distinct points covered by these 9 lines is:    [    frac{72}{2} = 36    ]    These 36 points correspond exactly to all the intersection points of the 9 chosen lines, plus 9 additional points where each of the chosen 9 lines intersects with the 10th line. 5. Thus, each of the original lines (routes) contributes exactly to covering all the 45 unique points, ensuring that each point is covered by at least one of the lines in any chosen set of 9 lines. This ensures that any chosen set of 9 routes passes through every bus stop. 6. Now consider any set of 8 routes (lines). In this set, each route intersects with 7 others, forming:    [    8 times (8 - 1) = 8 times 7 = 56    ]    Again, each intersection is counted twice, so:    [    frac{56}{2} = 28    ]    The 8 routes cover 28 unique intersection points. Thus, there are some intersection points (those involving the 2 remaining routes) that are not covered by the chosen set of 8 lines.      Hence, there will always be at least one stop (intersection point) that is not on any of the chosen 8 routes. This means that any set of 8 routes does not cover all the stops. # Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to establish 10 bus routes in such a manner that any 9 of these routes pass through all bus stops, and any 8 of these routes miss at least one stop.

Given its negative coefficient, the graph will reside in the second and fourth quadrants. This is because for x > 0, y will be negative, placing the graph in the fourth quadrant, and for x < 0, y will be positive, placing the graph in the second quadrant. 2. **Behavior of y with Respect to x**: In the second and fourth quadrants, as x increases, the absolute value of y decreases since y is inversely proportional to x. However, since y is negative in the fourth quadrant and positive in the second, an increase in x (moving from left to right on the x-axis) will actually result in an increase in y's value (moving upwards on the y-axis in the fourth quadrant and downwards in the second quadrant, but since y is negative in the fourth quadrant, its value is increasing towards zero). 3. **Applying to Points A and B**: For points A(x_{1}, y_{1}) and B(x_{2}, y_{2}), where x_{1} > x_{2} > 0, both points lie in the fourth quadrant because x_{1} and x_{2} are positive and the function yields negative y values.

Next, we calculate the number of people who ordered mint ice cream. We know that 15% of the total orders were for mint ice cream: 0.15 * 280 = 42 people ordered mint ice cream. To ensure we have accounted for all the orders, let's add up the number of people who ordered each flavor and see if it equals the total number of orders (280): Vanilla: 56 people Chocolate: 28 people Strawberry: 70 people Mint: 42 people 56 + 28 + 70 + 42 = 196 people It seems we have not accounted for all the orders because the sum (196) does not equal the total number of orders (280).

Since we have a semicircle, we will take half of the circumference of the full circle and add the diameter (which is the flat side of the semicircle). The radius ( r ) of the semicircle is given as 10. So, the circumference of the full circle is ( 2pi(10) = 20pi ). Half of this circumference (for the semicircle) is ( 10pi ). The diameter of the semicircle is ( 2r = 20 ). Therefore, the perimeter of the semicircle is ( 10pi + 20 ). Next, we need to find the length of the remaining two sides of the equilateral triangle. Since the triangle is equilateral, all sides are equal in length. The base of the triangle is equal to the diameter of the semicircle, which is 20.

According to the problem, Pat charged twice as much time as Kate, so Pat charged 2K hours. It's also given that Pat charged 1/3 as much time as Mark, so if Pat charged 2K hours, then Mark charged 3 times that amount, which is 3 * 2K = 6K hours. The total hours charged to the project by Pat, Kate, and Mark is 135 hours. So we can write the equation: Kate's hours + Pat's hours + Mark's hours = Total hours K + 2K + 6K = 135 9K = 135 Now we solve for K: K = 135 / 9 K = 15 So, Kate charged 15 hours to the project.

To find out how many more hours Mark charged to the project than Kate, we subtract Kate's hours from Mark's hours: Mark's hours - Kate's hours = 90 - 15 = 75 hours.

Suppose point P lies on the circumference of the circle and denote alpha as the angle angle ACP.     2. **Express Distances in Terms of sin and cos**:    The distances AP and CP from point P to points A and C can be expressed as:    [    AP = d sin alpha    ]    [    CP = d cos alpha    ]    where d is the distance from the center of the circle to each vertex of the square, i.e., the radius of the circle. Since the diameter of the circle is 4 units, the radius (d) is:    [    d = frac{4}{2} = 2    ] 3. **Distances from P to Other Vertices**:    We now consider the distance from point P to the other vertices of the square. Specifically, we'll look at the distance BP which involves the angles angle PDB and angle ADB.     4. **Using Angle Sum Identity**:    From the geometry of the inscribed square, we have:    [    angle ADB = 45^circ    ]    Thus the angle (angle PDB) can be written using the sum of angles as:    [    angle PDB = angle ADB + angle ADP = 45^circ + alpha    ]    Consequently, we can express the distance BP as:    [    BP = d sin (angle PDB) = d sin (45^circ + alpha)    ] 5. **Expand Using Angle Sum Formula**:    By the angle addition formula in trigonometry:    [    sin(45^circ + alpha) = sin 45^circ cos alpha + cos 45^circ sin alpha    ]    Given that:    [    sin 45^circ = cos 45^circ = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}    ]    it follows:    [    sin(45^circ + alpha) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cos alpha + frac{sqrt{2}}{2} sin alpha = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin alpha + cos alpha)    ] 6. **Substitute Back into BP**:    Therefore, the distance BP is:    [    BP = d sin (45^circ + alpha)    ]    [    = 2 cdot frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (sin alpha + cos alpha)    ]    [    = sqrt{2}(sin alpha + cos alpha)    ]    [    = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} (AP + CP)    ] 7. **Rationality Argument**:    If AP and CP are both rational, then AP + CP would also be rational. However, multiplying by frac{sqrt{2}}{2} turns this sum into a non-rational number (since sqrt{2} is irrational). # **Conclusion**: Thus, it is impossible for all four distances from point P to the vertices of the square to be simultaneously rational.

Find the volume of the solid formed by the union of the cone and the sphere if the total surface area of this solid is ( S ).  To solve this problem, we need to calculate the volume of the solid formed by the union of the truncated cone and the sphere.  Let's break down the problem step by step: 1. **Geometry and Surface Area:**    Given:    - Sphere radius = ( R )    - Total surface area of the union of the cone and sphere = ( S )    The surface area, ( S ), comprises:    - The lateral surface area of the truncated cone    - The base areas of the truncated cone    - The area from the shared surface (part of the sphere inside the cone) 2. **Surface Area Calculation:**    - The sphere is tangentially touching one base of the truncated cone and forms another circular surface tangent on the other base.    - Given these constraints, the entire lateral surface of the sphere effectively merges with part of the lateral surface of the truncated cone and one of its bases.        Let’s denote:    - Lateral surface area of the cone = ( S_{text{cone, lateral}} )    - Area of one base of the cone ( = S_{text{cone, base}} )    Now, the lateral surface area of the cone, ( S_{text{cone, lateral}} ), adjusted for the tangential circle, becomes:    ( S_{text{cone, total}} = S - 2 pi R^2 + pi R^2 - pi R^2 = S - pi R^2 )        We observe that the overall ( S ) already consumes the shared surface at each base once and the lateral part once removed. 3. **Volume Calculation:**    The volume, ( V ), of the solid formed by the union of the cone and the sphere can be calculated by:        - Sphere Volume ( V_{text{sphere}} = frac{4}{3} pi R^3 )    - Truncated Cone's Volume: The effective height ( h ) is varied at the lower and upper coinciding base radius equal to  (R), volume ( V_{text{cone}} ).

This allows you to structure your data in a way that makes sense for your business and reduces data redundancy. 2. **Relationships:** Use relationships (lookup, master-detail) to link your objects together. This allows you to create reports that include data from related objects. 3. **Report Types:** Create custom report types to define which objects and fields are available in your reports. This allows you to include data from multiple objects in a single report, even if those objects are not directly related. 4. **Formulas and Roll-up Summary Fields:** Use formulas to calculate values based on the data in your fields, and roll-up summary fields to aggregate data from related records. This allows you to include calculated and aggregated data in your reports. 5. **Joined Reports:** Use joined reports to create reports that include data from multiple report types. This allows you to include data from unrelated objects in a single report. 6. **External Objects:** If you have data stored outside of Salesforce, you can use external objects to access that data in Salesforce. This allows you to include external data in your reports. Remember, the key to a successful data model in Salesforce is planning.

Identify the Areas: The Wheel of Life typically includes areas such as career, finances, health, friends and family, romance, personal growth, fun and recreation, and physical environment. You can customize these areas to suit your lifestyle. 2. Rate Your Satisfaction: For each area, rate your level of satisfaction on a scale of 1 to 10, with 1 being least satisfied and 10 being most satisfied. Be honest with yourself during this process. 3. Analyze Your Wheel: Once you've rated each area, look at your Wheel of Life. The areas with the lowest scores are likely the ones you've been neglecting. 4. Reflect: Ask yourself why these areas are lacking. Is it due to lack of time, resources, or attention? Reflecting on these questions can help you understand what's missing. 5. Set Goals: Once you've identified the neglected areas, set realistic and achievable goals to improve them. Make sure these goals are specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART). 6. Take Action: Start working towards your goals. This could involve learning new skills, changing old habits, or seeking help from others. 7.

The tokenizer splits the input text into individual tokens (words or subwords), which are then converted into numerical representations (token IDs) that the model can understand. Here's a simplified version of the process: 1. **Tokenization**: The tokenizer breaks down the sentence into individual tokens. Depending on the specific tokenizer used, these tokens could be words, subwords, or even individual characters. For example, the sentence \\"I love AI\\" might be tokenized into [\\"I\\", \\"love\\", \\"AI\\"]. 2. **Adding Special Tokens**: Some transformer models require special tokens to be added to the input. For instance, BERT uses [CLS] at the beginning of the sentence and [SEP] at the end. So, our example might become [\\"[CLS]\\", \\"I\\", \\"love\\", \\"AI\\", \\"[SEP]\\"]. 3. **Conversion to IDs**: Each token is then mapped to a unique ID from the model's vocabulary. For instance, \\"I\\" might become 101, \\"love\\" might become 7592, and \\"AI\\" might become 9817. The special tokens also have their own unique IDs. 4. **Padding & Truncation**: If the model requires all inputs to be the same length, the tokenized sentence may be padded with special tokens (usually [PAD]) to reach the required length, or truncated if it's too long. 5. **Attention Mask**: An attention mask is created to differentiate the actual tokens from the padding tokens. This mask ensures that the model doesn't pay attention to the padding when processing the input. The specific details of this process can vary depending on the exact transformer model and tokenizer used. For example, some models might use Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) or SentencePiece for tokenization, which can split words into subwords or even individual characters."},{"instruction":"N: Sept 5th ; IM SUCH A FUCKING DICKHEAD ! ffs .

The sentence to be modified is \\"The girl put on a pink dress.\\"","output":"The sentence you provided is: \\"The girl put on a pink dress.\\"  This sentence is grammatically correct and does not require a comma. Commas are typically used to separate independent clauses, items in a list, or nonessential information. In this case, there are no independent clauses, no list, and no nonessential information.  However, if we were to add more information to the sentence, a comma might be necessary. For example: \\"The girl, who was very excited about the party, put on a pink dress.\\" In this case, the phrase \\"who was very excited about the party\\" is a nonessential clause, so it is set off by commas. As for the frequency of comma usage in different time periods, I'm sorry, but I don't have the ability to generate a table with that information. However, it's generally accepted that comma usage has become less frequent over time. In the 1800s, it was common to use commas to indicate pauses in speech, which often resulted in sentences with many commas. In the 1900s, the trend moved towards using fewer commas, and this has continued into the 2000s. This is likely due to changes in writing styles and standards, as well as the influence of digital communication, which often favors shorter, simpler sentences. The sentence translated into Spanish is: \\"La niña se puso un vestido rosa.\\"  In Spanish, as in English, commas are used to separate independent clauses, items in a list, or nonessential information.

The backstitch is often used for seams that require strength and durability. This is because the backstitch involves sewing forward, then backward over the same stitches, creating a continuous line of thread with no gaps. This makes it stronger and less likely to unravel, which is particularly useful for areas of a garment that will experience a lot of wear and tear, like the crotch of pants or the underarm of a shirt. On the other hand, the running stitch, which is a simple stitch made by running the thread over and under the fabric, is quicker and easier to do but it's not as strong. It's often used for basting, which is temporary stitching used to hold pieces together before final sewing, or for decorative purposes. So, in terms of strength and durability, a backstitch is generally better than a running stitch. However, the best stitch to use really depends on the specific requirements of your sewing project."},{"instruction":"short sentence, define me what is digital transformation in companies","output":"Digital transformation in companies refers to the integration of digital technologies into all areas of a business, resulting in fundamental changes to how the company operates and delivers value to its customers.

In other words, \`==\` checks for reference equality, while \`.equals()\` checks for value equality. Here are some key differences between the two operators: 1. Reference equality: \`==\` checks if the two operands are the same object in memory. It checks if the two references point to the same object. On the other hand, \`.equals()\` checks if the two objects are equal in value, without considering whether they are the same object in memory. 2. Object comparison: \`==\` can only be used to compare objects of the same type. For example, you can't compare an \`Integer\` object with a \`String\` object using \`==\`. However, \`.equals()\` can be used to compare objects of different types, as long as they implement the \`equals()\` method. 3. Null safety: \`==\` can throw a \`NullPointerException\` if either operand is null. In contrast, \`.equals()\` method handles null values gracefully and returns false if either operand is null. 4. Performance: In general, using \`==\` is faster than using \`.equals()\`, because it doesn't involve method calls. However, in some cases, using \`.equals()\` may be more efficient, especially when comparing objects that have a complex equality logic. When to use \`==\` and when to use \`.equals()\`? Use \`==\` when: * You want to check if two references point to the same object in memory. * You are comparing objects of the same type. * Performance is critical, and you don't need to handle null values. Use \`.equals()\` when: * You want to check if two objects have the same value, regardless of whether they are the same object in memory. * You are comparing objects of different types. * You need to handle null values gracefully. In summary, \`==\` is used to check reference equality, while \`.equals()\` is used to check value equality. Both operators have their place in Java programming, and choosing the right operator depends on the specific use case."},{"instruction":"short words, what is the best US political party: Democratics or Republicans?","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't have personal opinions or preferences.

This is for beginning ESL students.","output":"Teacher-centered and student-centered classes are two different approaches to teaching that can have a significant impact on the learning experience of students. In a teacher-centered class, the teacher is the main authority and the focus of the class is on the teacher's lecture or presentation. The teacher is responsible for providing all the information and the students are expected to listen attentively and take notes. The teacher may also be the only one who initiates discussions and asks questions. In contrast, a student-centered class is focused on the students' learning and engagement. The teacher acts as a facilitator, providing guidance and support to help the students discover and construct their own knowledge. The students are encouraged to ask questions, participate in discussions, and take an active role in their learning. The teacher may also provide opportunities for students to work collaboratively in groups and engage in hands-on activities. In the context of ESL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) classes, a student-centered approach can be particularly beneficial for beginning students who may struggle with understanding and expressing themselves in English. By providing opportunities for students to practice speaking and listening in a supportive and collaborative environment, a student-centered approach can help build their confidence and fluency in the language."},{"instruction":"mple terms, explain to me how language models like this work?","output":"A language model (LM) is a computer program that can generate human-like text based on the input it receives. It does this by using a mathematical function to determine the likelihood of a given sequence of words in a given context, and then selecting the most likely word to output based on that probability. LM training typically involves providing the program with a large amount of text data and teaching it to generate text based on different patterns and themes. The program learns to recognize patterns in the data and generate text that is similar to the text it was trained on. As the program continues to train, it becomes more and more accurate at generating text and can even produce text that is similar to the text produced by human writers. This is because the program is learning to use patterns in the data to generate text, rather than simply trying to predict the next word in a given sequence. Currently, the most widely-used type of language model is a transformer model, which uses self-attention and recurrent neural networks to process the input text and generate the output text. These models have been shown to be highly effective in a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and text classification."},{"instruction":"mple words, explain WHAT a GPU isand the difference between it and a CPU, and why you usually use GPUs instead of CPUs for AI model training","output":"A GPU, or Graphics Processing Unit, is a specialized electronic circuit that is designed to handle and accelerate the processing of graphics and visual data. It is commonly used in computers and gaming consoles to render high-quality graphics and images. The main difference between a GPU and a CPU, or Central Processing Unit, lies in their design and purpose. A CPU is a general-purpose processor that is responsible for executing a wide range of tasks, including running operating systems, managing applications, and performing calculations. It is optimized for handling a variety of tasks efficiently. On the other hand, a GPU is specifically designed to handle parallel processing tasks, making it highly efficient at performing multiple calculations simultaneously. It consists of thousands of smaller processing units called cores, which work together to process data in parallel. This parallel processing capability makes GPUs well-suited for tasks that require heavy computational power, such as graphics rendering, scientific simulations, and artificial intelligence (AI) model training. When it comes to AI model training, GPUs are often preferred over CPUs due to their ability to handle large amounts of data and perform computations in parallel. AI models typically involve complex mathematical calculations and require processing large datasets. GPUs can process these calculations much faster than CPUs, resulting in significantly reduced training times for AI models. In summary, GPUs are specialized processors designed for parallel processing, while CPUs are general-purpose processors. GPUs are commonly used for AI model training due to their ability to handle large datasets and perform computations in parallel, resulting in faster training times."},{"instruction":"situations where forgiveness is not possible or safe (e.g. cases of abuse, violence, etc.), what are some alternatives to seeking forgiveness and moving on from the hurt and harm caused?","output":"In situations where forgiveness is not possible or safe, there are several alternatives that can help individuals move forward from the hurt and harm caused: 1. Seeking Justice: Instead of forgiveness, victims may aim to seek justice. This includes reporting the incident or seeking a legal course. This course of action can provide a sense of closure, empowerment, and a way to prevent a similar situation from happening to others. 2. Reframing the Situation: Reframing the situation can help shift the perspective and help individuals understand that what happened wasn't their fault. This can be particularly helpful in cases of abuse or violence where the victim may feel that they are to blame. 3. Healing and Self-care: Focusing on healing and self-care is a crucial part of moving forward. This may involve seeking professional help like therapy, counseling or trauma recovery programs. It's also important to engage in self-care activities such as exercise, mindfulness, meditation, or hobbies. 4. Creating Boundaries: It's essential to create boundaries that protect oneself from further harm. This could mean distancing oneself from the person who caused the harm, limiting contact or enlisting the help of friends, family, or the support of a community. 5. Seeking Support: Connecting with others who have experienced similar situations can be incredibly beneficial. Support groups provide a safe and empathetic environment to share experiences, learn from each other, and grow healing friendships. 6. Advocacy: Global organizations such as RAINN, Survivors of Sexual Abuse, and the National Domestic Violence Hotline provide resources for individuals who have experienced abuse. Participating in advocacy and awareness campaigns can be a powerful way to recover and prevent similar situations from happening to others. 7. Reflecting and Remembering: Reflecting on the experience can be beneficial for healing but it isn't necessary step for everyone. It's important to understand that healing can occur without understanding all the details of what happened. Remember, the process of healing from abuse and violence is complex and unique to each individual. It's important to respect what feels right and necessary for the individual's well-being."},{"instruction":"slacks API endpoints, when retrieving a message by it's ID can I tell if the message has been read yet or not?","output":"Yes, you can use the \`read\` endpoint in the Slacks API to determine if a message has been read or not.
