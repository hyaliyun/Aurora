Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  nicotine patches  for the following movie plot:  The film opens with Nick Naylor (Aaron Eckhart) appearing on Joan Lunden's daytime talk show, along a doctor, a senator's aide, and a teenage boy with cancer. As he's introduced, the audience spits at him. The screen freezes, spittle in midair, while Naylor explains what he does for a living in a voice over. He works for the Academy of Tobacco Studies, and he represents Big Tobacco. The Academy is supposed to research links between disease and smoking, and has never been able to find anything conclusive.On the show and throughout the film, he takes the offensive position (in both senses). On Joan Lunden's show, he protests that in no way would he want a potential customer to die, and accuses the doctor of profiting off cancer patients.His immediate nemesis is Senator Ortolan Finisterre (William H. Macy), a Birkenstock-wearing Vermonter whose office is decorated with cheese and bottles of maple syrup. Senator Finisterre wants to plaster a graphic skull-and-crossbones picture on every pack of cigarettes.Through all of this, Naylor is also trying to maintain a relationship with his son Joey (Cameron Bright). Naylor's boss BR (J.K. Simmons) wants ideas on how to make smoking sell. \\"We don't sell Tic Tacs, we sell cigarettes. And they're cool, available, and addictive. The job is almost done for us.\\" Naylor has the idea of product placement in movies.He takes Joey on the trip to Los Angeles to meet with an agent about putting more smoking in movies. Naylor is divorced, and shares custody of his son. His son is rather uncomfortable with his father's profession, but Naylor is as great arguing with his son as he is with the press and starts to win him over. Naylor portrays himself as being on the side of freedom and personal choice.On a side trip, Naylor takes a briefcase full of cash to the original Marlboro Man Lorne Lutch (Sam Elliott) who is dying of cancer. There's no strings attached; Lutch can just keep the money. A suspicious Lutch asks why he can't just go to the press. Naylor suggests he do exactly that,...

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Process: - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth.  Question: suppose less glycolysis happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen reaching the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If less glycolysis happens, it would have LESS effect on more oxygen reaching the body.  Glycolysis is the process through which glucose is broken down into pyruvate and produces a small amount of ATP (adenosine triphosphate, the energy currency of cells). Oxygen is not directly involved in glycolysis; however, it plays a crucial role in the later stages of cellular respiration, specifically in the process of oxidative phosphorylation and the electron transport chain. These stages require oxygen to efficiently generate ATP from the products of glycolysis. When there is less glycolysis, it means that less glucose is being broken down, which results in a reduced production of pyruvate and ATP. The decreased ATP production means there is less demand for the oxygen needed during oxidative phosphorylation. As a result, the body will not need to take in as much additional oxygen to meet the energy requirements. The supposed perturbation of less glycolysis would lead to a decreased requirement for oxygen in cellular respiration. This may influence the second effect mentioned by causing more oxygen to remain in the body instead of being utilized by cells for energy production. In conclusion, the less glycolysis happening in the body, the less effect it will have on the increased demand for oxygen, and more oxygen may remain unused within the body."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This liquid is now fresh and desalinated water, i.e., it is now free from salt and other impurities which were originally present in the seawater. This fresh water is now safe for consumption or can be used for irrigation, industrial usage, or other necessary functions. 2. Collection of Salt:    Following the process, the salt particles which sank to the bottom of the first container would be left over.

This is crucial as it provides direction and context for all subsequent steps and helps ensure that all aspects of the project align with the intended goals. In this initial phase, stakeholders such as scientists, engineers, government agencies, and other relevant parties must convene to discuss the specific objectives of the satellite mission. These could include goals related to scientific research, communications, Earth observation, meteorology, or other applications, depending on the mission's focus. Careful consideration should be given to the type of data that needs to be collected, the resolution and accuracy required, and any other specific mission requirements. Once the objectives have been clearly defined, a series of technical, financial, and operational requirements should be established to guide the development and execution of the project. These requirements will encompass various aspects of the mission, such as the satellite's size, mass, power consumption, and communications capabilities, as well as the necessary orbital parameters, launch vehicle, and ground-based infrastructure. By defining and outlining the objectives, purposes, and requirements of the satellite mission as the first step, a solid foundation is laid for the subsequent steps that will take the project from conception through to launch and operation.

How to study the functions of sensory neurons in humans  Be familiar with the types of neurons in the human body.  Generally speaking, neurons are specialized cells of the nervous system of all living systems, including mammalians. The two main neuronal types in humans are motor and sensory neurons.","output":"In order to effectively study the functions of sensory neurons in humans, it is crucial to first understand the basic structure and function of these specialized cells, as well as the different subtypes of sensory neurons and the specific roles they play in processing and transmitting information from our environment to our central nervous system. Sensory neurons, also known as afferent neurons, are responsible for detecting various external and internal stimuli, such as temperature, pressure, touch, pain, and body position, and then converting these stimuli into electrical signals that can be interpreted by the brain. This process, known as transduction, allows us to perceive and respond to our surroundings and maintain homeostasis within our bodies. Sensory neurons can be further categorized into three major subtypes based on their function: mechanoreceptors, which sense mechanical stimuli like pressure, stretch, and vibration; thermoreceptors, which detect changes in temperature; and nociceptors, which respond to potentially damaging stimuli and are responsible for our perception of pain. To begin studying the functions of sensory neurons in humans, it is essential to develop a comprehensive understanding of the anatomy and physiology of the sensory neurons themselves. This includes the dendrites, which are specialized to receive information from sensory receptors; the cell body, which contains the nucleus and other important cellular structures; the axon, which transmits the information in the form of electrical impulses known as action potentials; and the synaptic terminals, where neurotransmitters are released to communicate with other neurons or target cells. One of the most effective methods for studying sensory neurons' function in a controlled environment is through the use of electrophysiological techniques such as patch-clamping and extracellular recording. These approaches involve the placement of electrodes on the neuronal cells or surrounding tissues and allow researchers to directly measure neuronal activity when exposed to various stimuli. In conjunction with these techniques, molecular and genetic tools can be employed to manipulate the expression of specific genes or proteins involved in sensory neuron function, revealing critical insights into how these cells respond to environmental stimuli. Another valuable method for studying sensory neuron function involves the use of non-invasive neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). These approaches allow researchers to visualize and monitor the activity of sensory neurons in living human subjects while they are engaged in various sensory processing tasks or experiences. Furthermore, behavioral experiments in combination with these techniques can be particularly useful for investigating how changes in sensory neuron function can impact human perception and performance. For example, researchers might analyze how changes in sensory neuron activity correlate with an individual's ability to detect different types of stimuli or the subjective experience of pain under various conditions. In conclusion, studying the functions of sensory neurons in humans requires a careful consideration of the numerous anatomical, physiological, and molecular features that give rise to the cells' unique properties and specialized roles. By employing a combination of electrophysiological, molecular, and neuroimaging approaches, along with carefully designed behavioral experiments, researchers can gain valuable insights into the complex and vital world of sensory processing in the human nervous system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information:  - Internes Can't Take Money is a 1937 American drama film directed by Alfred Santell and starring Barbara Stanwyck, Joel McCrea, Lloyd Nolan, and Stanley Ridges. McCrea portrays Dr. Kildare in the character's first screen appearance. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer continued the Dr. Kildare series with \\"Young Dr. Kildare\\" (1938) starring Lew Ayres as Kildare and Laraine Day as a nurse in love with Kildare, similar to Stanwyck's role in this film. The film was released in the United Kingdom as \\"You Can't Take Money\\".  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - David Hoyt Canary (August 25, 1938  November 16, 2015) was an American actor, best known for his roles in \\"All My Children\\" and \\"Bonanza\\".  - A comic book or comicbook, also called comic magazine or simply comic, is a publication that consists of comic art in the form of sequential juxtaposed panels that represent individual scenes. Panels are often accompanied by brief descriptive prose and written narrative, usually dialog contained in word balloons emblematic of the comics art form. Although some origins in 18th century Japan and 1830s Europe, comic books were first popularized in the United States during the 1930s. The first modern comic book, \\"Famous Funnies\\", was released in the United States in 1933 and was a reprinting of earlier newspaper humor comic strips, which had established many of the story-telling devices used in comics. The term \\"comic book\\" derives from American comic books once being a compilation of comic strips of a humorous tone; however, this practice was replaced by featuring stories of all genres, usually not humorous in tone.  - The police procedural, or police crime drama, is a subgenre of detective fiction that attempts to convincingly depict the activities of a police force as they investigate crimes. Although traditional detective novels usually concentrate on a single crime, police procedurals frequently depict investigations into several unrelated crimes in a single story. Traditional mysteries usually adhere to the convention of having the criminal's identity concealed until the climax (the so-called whodunit), whereas in police procedurals, the perpetrator's identity is often known to the audience from the outset (the inverted detective story). Police procedurals depict a number of police-related topics such as forensics, autopsies, the gathering of evidence, the use of search warrants, and interrogation.  - Rodman Edward \\"Rod\\" Serling (December 25, 1924  June 28, 1975) was an American screenwriter, playwright, television producer, and narrator known for his live television dramas of the 1950s and his science-fiction anthology TV series, \\"The Twilight Zone\\". Serling was active in politics, both on and off the screen, and helped form television industry standards. He was known as the \\"angry young man\\" of Hollywood, clashing with television executives and sponsors over a wide range of issues including censorship, racism, and war.  - Nevada (Spanish for \\"snowy\\"; see pronunciations) is a state in the Western, Mountain West, and Southwestern regions of the United States of America. Nevada is the 7th most extensive, the 34th most populous, and the 9th least densely populated of the 50 United States. Nearly three-quarters of Nevada's people live in Clark County, which contains the Las VegasParadise metropolitan area where three of the state's four largest incorporated cities are located. Nevada's capital is Carson City. Nevada is officially known as the \\"Silver State\\" because of the importance of silver to its history and economy. It is also known as the \\"Battle Born State\\", because it achieved statehood during the Civil War (the words \\"Battle Born\\" also appear on the state flag); as the \\"Sage-brush State\\", for the native plant of the same name; and as the \\"Sage-hen State\\". Nevada borders Oregon to the northwest, Idaho to the northeast, California to the west, Arizona to the southeast and Utah to the east.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Leonard Freeman (October 31, 1920  January 20, 1974) was an American television writer and producer who is best remembered as the creator of the CBS series \\"Hawaii Five-O\\" in 1968. The show was remade in 2010. He appeared in a 1953 episode (#112) of the TV series, \\"The Lone Ranger\\".  - A police force is a constituted body of persons empowered by the state to enforce the law, protect property, and limit civil disorder. Their powers include the legitimized use of force. The term is most commonly associated with police services of a sovereign state that are authorized to exercise the police power of that state within a defined legal or territorial area of responsibility. Police forces are often defined as being separate from military or other organizations involved in the defense of the state against foreign aggressors; however, gendarmerie are military units charged with civil policing.  - Paramount Pictures Corporation (known professionally as Paramount Pictures and often referred to simply as Paramount) is an American film studio based in Hollywood, California, that has been a subsidiary of the American media conglomerate Viacom since 1994. Paramount is the fifth oldest surviving film studio in the world, the second oldest in the United States, and the sole member of the \\"Big Six\\" film studios still located in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Hollywood. In 1916 Zukor contracted 22 actors and actresses and honored each with a star on the logo. These fortunate few would become the first \\"movie stars.\\" Paramount Pictures is a member of the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA).  - A rerun or repeat is a rebroadcast of an episode of a radio or television program. There are two types of reruns  those that occur during a hiatus, and those that occur when a program is syndicated. Reruns can also be, as the case with more popular shows, when a show is aired outside of its timeslot (for example, in the afternoon).  - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance. The term comes from a Greek word meaning \\"action\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drama\\"), which is derived from \\"to do\\" (Classical Greek: , \\"drao\\").  The two masks associated with drama represent the traditional generic division between comedy and tragedy. They are symbols of the ancient Greek Muses, Thalia, and Melpomene. Thalia was the Muse of comedy (the laughing face), while Melpomene was the Muse of tragedy (the weeping face). Considered as a genre of poetry in general, the dramatic mode has been contrasted with the epic and the lyrical modes ever since Aristotle's \\"Poetics\\" (c. 335 BCE)the earliest work of dramatic theory.  - Frederick Schiller Faust (May 29, 1892  May 12, 1944) was an American author known primarily for his thoughtful and literary Westerns under the pen name Max Brand. Faust (as Max Brand) also created the popular fictional character of young medical intern Dr. James Kildare in a series of pulp fiction stories. Faust's Kildare character was subsequently featured over several decades in other media, including a series of American theatrical films by Paramount Pictures and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), a radio series, two television series, and comics. Faust's other pseudonyms include George Owen Baxter, Evan Evans, George Evans, David Manning, John Frederick, Peter Morland, George Challis, Peter Ward and Frederick Frost.  - Michael Landon (born Eugene Maurice Orowitz; October 31, 1936  July 1, 1991) was an American actor, writer, director, and producer. He is known for his roles as Little Joe Cartwright in \\"Bonanza\\" (195973), Charles Ingalls in \\"Little House on the Prairie\\" (197483), and Jonathan Smith in \\"Highway to Heaven\\" (198489). Landon appeared on the cover of \\"TV Guide\\" 22 times, second only to Lucille Ball.  - Spencer's Mountain is an American family drama film written, directed, and produced in 1963 by Delmer Daves from a novel by Earl Hamner, Jr. The film stars Henry Fonda, Maureen O'Hara, and in early appearances in their careers, James MacArthur, Veronica Cartwright, and Victor French. Longtime Hollywood actor Donald Crisp plays \\"Grandpa\\", his final screen role.  - Dr. James Kildare is a fictional American medical doctor character, originally created in the 1930s by the author Frederick Schiller Faust under the pen name Max Brand. Shortly after the character's first appearance in a magazine story, Paramount Pictures used the story and character as the basis for the 1937 film \\"Internes Can't Take Money\\". Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) subsequently acquired the rights and featured Kildare as the primary character in a series of American theatrical films in the late 1930s and early 1940s, several of which were co-written by Faust (as Max Brand), who also continued to write magazine stories and novels about the character until the early 1940s. The Kildare character was later featured in an early 1950s radio series, a 1960s television series, a comic book and comic strip based on the 1960s TV show, and a short-lived second 1970s television series.  - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction.  - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - Lorne Hyman Greene, (born Lyon Himan Green; February 12, 1915  September 11, 1987) was a Canadian actor, radio personality, and singer.  - Pernell Elven Roberts, Jr. (May 18, 1928  January 24, 2010) was an American stage, film, and television actor, as well as a singer.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - The Twilight Zone is an American television anthology series created by Rod Serling.

The moral may be left to the hearer, reader or viewer to determine for themselves, or may be explicitly encapsulated in a maxim.  - Psychological thriller is a thriller story which emphasizes the unstable psychological states of its characters. In terms of classification, the category is a subgenre of the broader ranging thriller category, with similarities to Gothic and detective fiction in the sense of sometimes having a \\"dissolving sense of reality\\", moral ambiguity, and complex and tortured relationships between obsessive and pathological characters.

On a few occasions, Psychological horror overlaps with the psychological thriller subgenre, making whatever story of the genre more unpleasant as well as terrifyingly suspenseful.  - An anthology series is a radio or television series that presents a different story and a different set of characters in each episode or season/series. These usually have a different cast each week, but several series in the past, such as \\"Four Star Playhouse\\", employed a permanent troupe of character actors who would appear in a different drama each week. Some anthology series, such as \\"Studio One\\", began on radio and then expanded to television.  - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center.

Warrants for three Wesleyan University students arrested after a rash of illnesses on campus linked to the party drug Molly show police believe the bad batch of the drug originated in the Washington, D.C., area. The students, all neuroscience majors, were arraigned Wednesday in Middletown Superior Court, not far from the private college's campus. Superior Court Judge Leo V. Diana set bond at 50,000 for Eric Lonergan, 22, of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and 20-year-old Rama Agha Al Nakib, a Syrian citizen. Zachary Kramer, 21, of Bethesda, Maryland, was freed after posting a 5,000 bond. Eric Lonergan, left, and Rama Agha Al Nakib, right, are two of the four Wesleyan University students arrested Tuesday in connection with about a dozen hospitalizations among people who took a party drug known as Molly Lawyers for Lonergan, Kramer and Al Nakib said Wednesday that no","output":"firm evidence has been presented to prove their clients were involved in the distribution or possession of the tainted Molly that caused the hospitalizations. They also questioned the credibility of the claims, insisting that their clients, as neuroscience majors, would be well aware of the potential dangers and consequences of using and distributing drugs like Molly on campus.  In response to the worsening situation, Wesleyan University has launched an internal investigation to determine the extent of drug use on campus and whether other students or staff members may be involved. The administration has issued a statement expressing its concern for the wellbeing of everyone affected, and it has reaffirmed its commitment to maintaining a safe and healthy campus environment. As the case progresses, law enforcement agencies from both Connecticut and Washington, D.C., will be cooperating and sharing information to trace the source of the contaminated Molly and identify any other individuals who may be involved in its distribution. Authorities will be closely scrutinizing drug networks in the Washington, D.C., area, examining the production and distribution processes, and identifying potential links to other narcotics-related incidents. In light of this incident, there have been calls for increased drug education and harm reduction measures at college campuses across the United States. Experts argue that college students should be made aware of the risks associated with drug use, especially considering the potential for contamination or unknown substances being sold as popular party drugs like Molly. They also emphasize the importance of providing information about safe drug use practices and resources for students seeking help with drug-related issues. Furthermore, in an effort to prevent similar incidents from occurring, Wesleyan University may revisit its drug policy and consider implementing more stringent measures to deter drug distribution and use on campus. This could involve increased surveillance, more frequent drug testing, and harsher penalties for those who violate the university's rules and regulations. Wesleyan's administration is expected to collaborate with local law enforcement and other institutions to learn from this incident and implement the most effective strategies to address drug use on campus. As the legal proceedings continue, the defendants will either choose to negotiate plea deals with the prosecution or to present their defense in a trial. In either scenario, it will be up to the justice system to ultimately determine the guilt or innocence of these three neuroscience students. Meeting the burden of proof for their involvement in the distribution of the contaminated Molly will be a significant challenge for the prosecution. However, it is crucial for the victims and the affected community that those responsible are held accountable, and measures are taken to prevent similar incidents in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Raw black beans are harvested from the ground. As a result, it’s not uncommon to find small pebbles mixed in with them. To make sure your bagged beans are safe to eat, spread them out on a baking sheet and sift through them by hand, picking out any small rocks you come across. You don’t want to sink your teeth into one by accident! Most rocks will be light gray in color, which helps them stand out easily from the dark beans. It’s a good idea to give the beans a quick rinse prior to soaking, especially if they’re visibly dirty. A preliminary rinse will sanitize the beans and start breaking down the waxy starches coating the outside of the beans that makes them take longer to cook.  Stir the beans up from the bottom by hand as you rinse to make sure the water gets distributed evenly throughout. A good long soak may make a separate rinse unnecessary if you're planning on cooking the beans immediately. The container you choose should be spacious enough to hold the beans you plan on soaking, along with the water that you’ll be adding later on. In most cases, a serving bowl, saucepan or stockpot will provide the volume you need.  Measure the beans out into cup-sized portions—this will make it easier to round off your other measurements. A standard serving of black beans is about ½ cup (75g). Unless you’re fixing mass quantities in bulk, plan on soaking all of the beans at once. Breaking them up into multiple batches can add hours to your prep time. Drizzle 1 tablespoon (15ml) of distilled white vinegar or lemon juice over every cup of dried beans. The mild acid will help soften the beans before they even hit the water, while also ensuring that the water heats evenly.  A little acidity will also prevent the beans from becoming mushy or completely disintegrating if they’re overcooked. Fresh squeezed lemon juice is preferable as it doesn’t contain any other additives, but bottled will also work just fine. Summary:","output":"To prepare raw black beans for consumption, first remove any pebbles by spreading the beans on a baking sheet and manually picking out rocks. Rinse the beans to clean and break down waxy starches, then measure them into cup-sized portions. Soak the beans in a spacious container, adding 1 tablespoon of white vinegar or lemon juice per cup of dried beans to soften them and prevent mushiness. A long soak may eliminate the need for a separate rinse if cooking immediately."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Seeing the difference in the quantity of coffee each of them consumed, Donald took a moment to consider the potential outcomes of this informal competition between him and Nelson. The aroma of freshly brewed coffee filled the air as the two friends sat across from each other in the small, bustling café. They had spent many comfortable afternoons together here, discussing everything from work to personal life, and indulging in the delightful taste of their favorite hot beverage. On this specific day, the competitive spirit seemed to have taken over their casual catch-up session, as they observed each other's coffee consumption. Donald noted to himself that he was clearly having more cups than Nelson, a realization that brought a small, smug smile to his face. Meanwhile, Nelson observed his friend's quiet satisfaction and quickly figured out the reason behind it. At first, he was amused by this unexpected development in their otherwise routine meeting but soon enough, the desire to overcome Donald's lead began to grow within him. Determined not to let his friend outdo him, Nelson started drinking as fast as they could. He picked up the pace, finishing his cups of coffee much more quickly, which caught Donald's attention. Not wanting to be left behind, Donald too began matching Nelson's pace, maintaining his position in their unofficial competition. Slowly but surely, the atmosphere at the table shifted. The friendly banter that usually dominated their conversation became less prevalent as each man increasingly focused on swiftly enjoying his coffee, instead of fully savoring its rich flavors and the pleasant company of his friend. Noticing this change in demeanor, the café staff could not help but exchange quizzical glances, surprised by the tension-filled air surrounding their regular customers. As the two men endeavored to outdo each other, the café atmosphere lost some of its usual warmth and ease. After what seemed like an eternity of hurried sipping and gulping, Donald and Nelson both slowed down, realizing that their playful competition had taken a toll on their cherished camaraderie. They noticed the silence that blanketed their table, making up for the cacophony of noise typical in the café. Although they had started this challenge together, the situation now presented a chance to step back and reconsider its impact on their friendship. They exchanged a sheepish, knowing grin, putting an end to their coffee-drinking contest. They then resumed their conversation, with each of them sharing stories and news once more, ultimately preserving the special bond they shared, nurtured over countless cups of carefully brewed coffee."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Solve this instance: [-98, 33, 45, 37, -13, -77, 11] Student:","output":"Sure, let's break it down: 1. You have been provided a list of integers: [-98, 33, 45, 37, -13, -77, 11]. Each of these elements needs to be modified according to the given conditions. 2. The guidelines for this task are:    - If an element is positive, multiply it by 2.    - If an element is negative, multiply it by -3. 3. You start by taking each element one at a time and apply the guideline to it. Processing the elements of the list: - For the first element -98, since it's negative you need to multiply it by -3. Doing this gives you 294. - The second element is 33, a positive number. As per the guidelines, you multiply this by 2 to get 66. - Similarly, you process each element in the list and form a new list that will contain the result of each operation. The solution should look like [294, 66, 90, 74, 39, 231, 22]. Note each number in the solution list corresponds to the respective number in the original list as processed per the guidelines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT. WE INVESTIGATED STEPHEN AND ALLEGHENY COUNTY. WE SEARCHED A LARGE AREA IN THE TOWN OF FRIENDSHIP AFTER CITIZENS REPORTED SEEN TWO MEN WALKING ALONG RAILROAD TRACKS, SIMILAR TO THE DESCRIPTION OF ESCAPEES. WE HAVE CONDUCTED A THOROUGH SEARCH THAT HAS ENDED. WE DECLARED THE AREA CLEAR. WE CONTINUE TO ANALYZE SECURITY CAMERA FOOTAGE PROVIDED BY A BUSINESS OWNER IN STEUBEN COUNTY. AS OF RIGHT NOW, BOTH SIGHTINGS REMAIN UNCONFIRMED. ON A SEPARATE TRACK THAT STARTED OVER THE WEEKEND, WE ARE INVESTIGATING A LEAD IN THE OWLS HEAD AREA OF FRANKLIN COUNTY NEW YORK. THE SUSPECT MIGHT HAVE SPENT TIME IN A CABIN IN THIS AREA. WE HAVE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS FROM AROUND THE STATE AND AROUND THE NATION HERE TODAY SEARCHING FOR MORE EVIDENCE. WE CANNOT GET INTO THE SPECIFICS OF THE EVIDENCE WE HAVE RECOVERED WELL INVESTIGATING THIS LEAD. WE DO NOT WANT TO PUT INFORMATION IN THE PUBLIC THAT COULD OBJECTIFY OUR INVESTIGATION OR THE NUMBER ONE OBJECTIVE, WHICH IS TO FIND DAVID SWEAT AND RICHARD MATT AND PUT THEM BACK IN PRISON. WE ASK THE PUBLIC TO REMAIN ON ALERT, TAKE NECESSARY SAFETY PRECAUTIONS, AND REMAIN VIGILANT ABOUT REPORTING ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY. THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE OF SEASONAL CAP OWNERS, NOW THAT THE SUMMER SEASON IS HERE. IF YOU RETURN TO YOUR CAMP AND EVERYTHING -- ANYTHING IS OUT OF PLACE, CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY. WE WANT TO RENEW THE CALL TO THOSE THAT HAVE TRAIL CAMERAS SET UP TO LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE CAPTURED FOOTAGE OF ANY BEST -- SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY. NO LEAD IS TOO SMALL FOR US TO INVESTIGATE. LAW ENFORCEMENT IS MAINTAINING A STRONG INVISIBLE PRESENCE IN THE REGION AND THAT WILL CONTAIN -- AND VISIBLE PRESENCE IN THE REGION AND THAT WILL CONTINUE. WE WANT TO THINK OUR PARTNERS AT THE STATE, LOCAL, AND FEDERAL LEVEL FOR THEIR COOPERATION. THE EXPERTISE AND RESOURCES THEY PROVIDE ARE INVALUABLE TO OUR INVESTIGATION. WE WILL TAKE A FEW QUESTIONS. IT HAS BEEN REPORTED THAT THERE IS SOME SORT OF DNA EVIDENCE TAKEN FROM THE CABIN OUT THERE IN. OWLS HEAD -- IN. THIS IS ALREADY OUT THERE. WOULD IT NOT BE BENEFICIAL TO DETERMINE IF YOU WEATHER DID FIND DNA EVIDENCE THERE? WE RECOVER SPECIFIC EVIDENCE, FOR THEM TO THE APPROPRIATE LABORATORIES, BUT WE ARE NOT COMPARED TO RELEASE THE EVIDENCE AT THIS TIME SO WE DO NOT JEOPARDIZE THE CONTINUITY OF THE INVESTIGATION. WHAT HAS BEEN THE MOST DIFFICULT PART, ESPECIALLY WITH THE WEATHER ? HOW HARD HAS IT BEEN TO DEAL WITH THAT? THERE ARE A NUMBER OF FACTORS THAT MAKE THIS A COMPLEX SEARCH -- THE WEATHER, THE TERRAIN, THE ENVIRONMENT, AND FRANCO, THE VAST SCOPE OF THE NORTH COUNTRY OF THE ADIRONDACKS. [INDISCERNIBLE] WE RUN CONCLUSIVE TESTS THAT INCLUDE DNA AND EVERYTHING AND ANYTHING WE CONSENT TO LABORATORIES. ORGANIZED IN ANY WAY, WHETHER IT IS A GAME -- OTHER KINDS OF NETWORKS? ANYTHING -- OTHER THAN WHAT HAS BEEN REPORTED, WE HAVE NO DEFINITIVE EVIDENCE ANYONE IS ASSISTING THEM WE ARE LOOKING AT ALL AVENUES AT OUR DISPOSAL. [INDISCERNIBLE] NEITHER OF THEM ARE FROM THIS AREA BUT THAT DOES NOT DISCOUNT THE FACT THAT THEY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN RESEARCH OR HAD SOME COLLABORATION TO THE LOCATION OF THIS CABIN OR THE REGION IN GENERAL. WOULD YOU SAY THIS CABIN IS THE STRONGEST WEIGHT RIGHT NOW SINCE THE SEARCH BEGAN? IT IS A CONFIRMED LEAD FOR US. IT HAS GENERATED A MASSIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT RESPONSE, AS YOU CAN SEE, AND WE WILL RUN THIS TO THE GROUND. ANY IDEAS ON THE COST OF THE SEARCH SO FAR? WE DO NOT CONCERN OURSELVES WITH THE COST OF THE SEARCH, BUT FIND THE INMATES. THE VERMONT POLICE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH COMMUNICATIONS. THERE WAS A PRESS CONFERENCE BETWEEN GOVERNOR CUOMO AND GOVERNOR SHUMLIN WHERE THEY PLEDGED ENHANCED COOPERATION AND AS A LAST NIGHT WE TAPPED INTO THE VERMONT STATE POLICE BECAUSE WE HAVE A MEMBER OF THEIR STAFF IN THEIR COMMAND FORCE SINCE -- OUR COMMAND FORCE IN THE BEGINNING.

DNA from both of the two escaped New York prisoners was found at a burglarized cabin in a rural town about 20 miles from the prison leading authorities to believe they are still traveling together more than two weeks after they broke free, according to a source with knowledge of the investigation.      The search for the men, Richard Matt and David Sweat, focused on the town of Owls Head after the DNA was found on Saturday.      At a press conference, Maj. Charles Guess of the New York State Police would not confirm the DNA find. He said only that \\"specific items\\" had been recovered from the cabin and forwarded to the appropriate authorities.

New York state police warned hunters returning to their seasonal cabins in the area to alert authorities immediately “if anything is out of place.”      Witnesses told NBC station WPTZ that helicopters have been in the air and checkpoints are in place on roads in the area.      “There definitely is a lot of law enforcement,” Terry Bellinger, owner of Belly’s Mountain View Inn in Owls Head, told the Press-Republican newspaper of Plattsburgh.      Bellinger told NBC News he thought authorities might have trouble locating Matt and Sweat if they’re in the woods. “I don’t know where you’d start. It’s dense,” he said.

It followed another credible reported sighting of two men resembling Sweat and Matt near a railroad line.      Vermont State Police told NBC News that its Tactical Support Unit had moved to the New York at the request of local officials. The unit “responds to calls involving barricaded subjects, suicidal individuals, hostage incidents, hostage incidents, high-risk warrants, and active shooters.”      New York State Police said in a news release late Sunday that \\"a primary focus of the search\\" is still the area around Dannemora, where the two convicted murderers used power tools to escape the maximum security Clinton Correctional Facility.

She has pleaded not guilty.      A corrections officer also has been placed on administrative leave as part of the investigation into the men's escape.      On Thursday, the U.S. Marshals Service placed Matt and Sweat on its 15 Most Wanted fugitives list in the hope of generating new leads.      New York state is offering a reward of 50,000 each for information that leads to the capture of one or both men, and the U.S. Marshals are offering a reward of up to 25,000 each. ||||| FRIENDSHIP – After a tip about two men walking along railroad tracks led 300 federal, state and local law enforcement officers on the hunt for two escaped killers to this rural Allegany County town over the weekend, a new lead arose that the missing prisoners may still be near the prison.      And this time, there’s forensic evidence.      A law enforcement source close to the investigation told The Buffalo News that Saturday someone reported seeing two men who matched the descriptions of Richard W. Matt and David P. Sweat near Clinton Correctional Facility in Dannemora, from which they escaped two weeks ago.      Then, on Sunday afternoon, “forensic evidence” that Sweat was in the vicinity of the sighting was confirmed.      Law enforcement officials believe that the evidence proves the two men on the U.S. Marshals Service most-wanted list had not gotten far from the prison, at least as of late Saturday.      The manhunt abruptly shifted back to the North Country on Sunday afternoon.      By late Sunday night, various media reports from that part of the state showed an intense police presence.      The Times-Union in Albany reported a person familiar with the investigation said evidence suggested at least one of the convicts had broken into a home in the area around Owls Head, east of Titusville Mountain State Forest, about an hour’s drive west of Dannemora.      The Press-Republican in Plattsburgh reported that military trucks and four-wheelers rolled into nearby Mountain View, population 2,444, with light towers set up at intersections along Routes 26 and 27 and trooper cars at each crossroad.      In Vermont, the Burlington Free Press reported via Twitter that the public information officer for Vermont State Police confirmed its tactical support unit was headed across the border to help New York State Police in Franklin County.      Before the evidence from the North Country surfaced, the possible sighting on the railroad tracks in the Southern Tier seemed to be a promising lead.      It came in at 1:16 p.m. Saturday.      Brandy Thompson, 35, of Maple Grove Road in Friendship, said she reported seeing two men whom she thought matched the description of the escaped prisoners walking along the railroad tracks behind her home, State Police Maj. Michael J. Cerretto said at a news conference Sunday afternoon. Investigators interviewed her, and based on her descriptions of the men, they launched their search.      “We determined she was credible,” he said. “As we have in other areas of the state, we will search under every rock, behind every tree and structure until we are confident that the area is secure. While this is an unconfirmed sighting, the State Police is asking residents who live on this area along the New York-Pennsylvania border to be on alert.”      There were also other leads that made it seem possible that Sweat, 35, and Matt, 48, had somehow made it 300 miles southwest of the prison to the Southern Tier.      Early Sunday, an area resident told The News that she heard about a second possible sighting Sunday morning in a heavily wooded area in Friendship, prompting police to intensify their search there. She said police searched her home and said that they had further evidence that Matt and Sweat were in the area.      Also, Sweat has ties to the area. Sweat’s grandmother lived in Canisteo before her death in 2012.      Sweat’s mother, Pamela Sweat, now lives in Conklin, outside Binghamton, but other relatives may live in and around Canisteo, which is 50 minutes due east of Friendship, where the search has concentrated since Saturday.      For more than 24 hours straight following the tip in Friendship, law enforcement officers trudged through thick woods and went door to door in the rural town.      They scoured barns, backyard sheds, doghouses, treehouses, trailers, even inside a stock car being pulled by a trailer.      Roadblocks were set up throughout the area – two on Interstate 86, three on county Route 20 and on state Routes 275 and 19.      Police concentrated their search in the area of the town around Moss Brook and Blouvett roads.      “We had troopers walking up and down this road all morning,” said Jacob Dunn, who lives on the road.      About a dozen officers with shotguns were seen walking through a field and nearby wooded area Sunday. “They told me they are going search every inch of the ground from (county) Route 31 all the way to Moss Brook, even if they have to come back tomorrow,” Dunn said after talking with an officer.      The area being searched is thousands of acres of mostly forest in the northern area of the town.      John Dunn, Jacob’s father, said several hunters’ tree stands are located in the woods. Many tree stands have propane stoves, and usually are about 10-by-10 feet, he said. But the forest here is dense. “The woods in this area they are searching are so thick that rabbits cannot get through it,” John Dunn added.      But by about 5 p.m. Sunday, it appeared they had given up the search.      The roadblocks were lifted. Television satellite trucks from national and local news outlets outside the State Police barracks in Amity left. The convoy of vehicles that had descended on the this town headed back east, apparently back toward Dannemora.      Fresh troopers from the Buffalo-Niagara region were briefed Sunday morning at the State Police barracks in Amity, about five miles east of Friendship, where a “possible sighting” of the two escaped convicts was reported Saturday.      Several vans filled with corrections officers and troopers pulled up to the barracks at about 2 a.m. Sunday, and hundreds of troopers and other law enforcement officers are searching the area.      Two helicopters are part of the search, one of them Air One from the Erie County Sheriff’s Department.      The state police helicopter was up for two three hours into early Sunday afternoon, but has been sitting on ground since about 1:30 p.m.      After the briefing early Sunday, some troopers set up roadblocks on the area roads. Others headed into the forested areas on ATVs. Canine teams also were seen in the area.      “We can leave no stone unturned,” one trooper said when asked about the search.      A trooper walked out the barracks shortly before 9 a.m. to tell reporters “there was nothing to report.”      Another police source said the timeline for the search is “open ended.”      A news briefing will be held late this morning.      The possible sighting Saturday in Friendship brought state troopers to the small, wooded, hilly township that one local resident said was “a good place to hide.”      A witness spotted two men along a railroad line that runs along Route 20 in the Town of Friendship, according to State Police.      State Police, U.S. Marshals, officers from the Department of Environmental Conservation, State Parks Police, Allegany County Sheriff’s Office and other local law enforcement agencies Saturday searched an area along I-86 and Route 20 in Friendship.      Aviation, canine and special-operation teams are assisting in the search.      email: lmichel@buffnews.com and mbecker@buffnews.com ||||| Over 300 law enforcement officers are part of \\"a lot of police activity\\" in Friendship, New York, this weekend in response to a possible sighting of escaped convicts Richard Matt and David Sweat, state officials said today.

Add Interest      A witness called police saying she spotted two men who fit the description of Matt and Sweat on a railroad line along Route 20 in Friendship near the Pennsylvania border Saturday at 1:16 p.m., state police Major Michael Cerretto said at a news conference.      Various law enforcement agencies, including aviation, K-9 and special operations teams were searching along I-86 and Route 20 to investigate the “credible” report, Cerretto added of the possible sighting in Friendship, which is more than 400 miles from the Clinton Correctional Facility where the men escaped earlier this month.      “We will continue to search this area until all leads have been exhausted,\\" Cerretto said. \\"As we have in other areas of the state, we will search under every rock, behind every tree and structure until we are confident that that area is secure.\\"      Law enforcement got to the site within 10 minutes of the call, which “came in immediately,” Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y. said today, adding the quick action gave police hope.      Schumer also said “one possibility” is that Matt and Sweat, who have been on the run for 16 days, “are riding the rails,” explaining there is a long train line that connects across southern New York they may have ridden.      While officials called the most recent sighting \\"unconfirmed,\\" police advised residents to be alert and call 911 immediately, adding that there is a 50,000 award for information leading to the arrest of one of the men, or 100,000 for both.      The U.S. Marshals Service has also placed Sweat and Matt on the 15 most wanted fugitives list and is also offering a 25,000 reward for information that leads to their capture, police said.      New York State police previously said they were actively searching in Allegany County in western New York Saturday afternoon in response to a possible sighting of Matt and Sweat.      The convicts used power tools to cut through the back of their adjacent cells on June 6, broke through a brick wall, then cut into a steam pipe and slithered through it, finally emerging outside the prison walls through a manhole, authorities said.      Matt was serving 25 years to life at Clinton Correctional in Dannemora, New York, after he kidnapped and beat a man to death in 1997. Sweat was serving a life sentence after he was convicted of killing a Broome County sheriff's deputy in 2002. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Over 16 days after their initial escape, the manhunt for the two prisoners who escaped from the Clinton Correctional Facility in New York continues, with recent DNA evidence found in a cabin pointing towards their continued presence in the area. Authorities are now focusing their efforts on Owls Head and Mountain View areas, after the owner of a cabin saw someone fleeing on Saturday. Over 300 law enforcement officers are working on the case, searching areas and setting up road blocks.

Team one had healthy people with normal red blood cell levels, but team two had people with sickle-cell anemia. the differences in health parameters were amazing and obvious.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which team had people with crescent shaped cells in their blood?  Hint: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. Answer:","output":"Team two had people with crescent-shaped cells in their blood. This is because team two consists of people with sickle-cell anemia, a disease caused by a mutation in the gene for hemoglobin. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal hemoglobin, which clumps together and distorts the shape of red blood cells into a crescent or sickle-like shape."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Analyze the differences between the concepts:    - Lying to themselves vs. Lying to the listener: While both questions involve a person potentially lying, the first question has an added layer of complexity as it addresses self-deception alongside lying to the listener. 3. Consider whether the differences are fundamental or superficial:    - The difference between lying to oneself versus lying to another person is a fundamental distinction because self-deception could lead to unintentional dishonesty as the person might truly believe what they are saying. Meanwhile, lying directly to someone else typically implies intentional dishonesty from the speaker. Conclusion: The two questions are not the same.

(The dog was a gift from Ludlow's wife, who was murdered shortly afterward by their emotionally troubled son.)While taking a day off from work to go fishing, Ludlow and Red are met on the lakeshore by a deer-hunting trio of teenagers: Danny, his brother Harold, and their friend Pete (Noel Fisher, Kyle Gallner, and Shiloh Fernandez). Their conversation is at first friendly, but turns increasingly menacing as Danny - a swaggering bully - points his shotgun at Ludlow and demands money. Ludlow offers Danny the keys to his pickup truck, and says there's 20 or 30 dollars in his wallet in the glove box. Danny is disgusted at the small pickings, and on an impulse turns his shotgun toward Red, shooting him in the head. The boys walk away from the man and his dying dog, Danny and Pete laughing about it while Harold seems shaken and embarrassed.Ludlow takes his dog home and buries him. He learns Danny McCormack's identity by tracking down where he bought the shotgun. He goes to Danny's home and confronts the boy's father (Tom Sizemore), a wealthy businessman with political connections. Ludlow demands that McCormack discipline his son for what he did. McCormack summons his two sons, but they deny the incident happened. McCormack says Ludlow has the wrong culprits, and sends him away. Ludlow goes to his lawyer, who says even if the boys were tried and convicted of the crime, it is at best a 200-dollar fine and a few days in jail.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Sumer: Sumerian religion seems to have been founded upon two separate cosmogenic myths. The first saw creation as the result of a series of hieros gami or sacred marriages, involving the reconciliation of opposites, postulated as a coming together of male and female divine beings; the gods. This continued to influence the whole Mesopotamian mythos. Thus in the Enuma Elish the creation was seen as the union of fresh and salt water; as male Abzu, and female Tiamat. The product of that union, Lahm and Lahmu, \\"the muddy ones\\", were titles given to the gate keepers of the E-Abzu temple of Enki, in Eridu, the first Sumerian city. Describing the way that muddy islands emerge from the confluence of fresh and salty water at the mouth of the Euphrates, where the river deposited its load of silt, a second hieros gamos supposedly created Anshar and Kishar, the \\"sky-pivot\\" or axle, and the \\"earth pivot\\", parents in turn of Anu (the sky) and Ki (the earth).

Justification: In this situation, Benson is being negatively affected by the bully's actions, to the point of losing sleep. When the teachers found out about the issue, they took action to resolve the problem. Expelling the bully (option ii) addresses the problem more effectively than praising him (option i). Praising the bully does not address the issue and could even potentially reinforce his negative behavior. Expelling the bully, while a strong punishment, sends a clear message that bullying is not tolerated and helps protect Benson and other students in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Debbie Ziegler, whose daughter Brittany Maynard died earlier this month, also addressed the Vatican official who recently blasted her daughter's decision as misguided suicide.      \\"My 29-year-old daughter's choice to die gently rather than suffer physical and mental degradation and intense pain does not deserve to be labelled as reprehensible by strangers a continent away who do not know her or the particulars of her situation,\\" Ziegler wrote in the letter.      Maynard, who had been diagnosed with brain cancer, died on November 1 after taking lethal medication prescribed by her doctor.      She and her family had previously moved from California to Oregon to take advantage of the state's right to die laws.      Compassion & Choices/AP Photo      Her mother said the criticism \\"is more than a slap in the face.\\"      \\"It is like kicking us as we struggle to draw a breath,\\" she said in the letter, expressing shock that anyone could have negative things to say about her daughter, especially at such a difficult time.      TheBrittanyFund.org/AP Photo      \\"Death is not necessarily the enemy in all cases,\\" Ziegler added. \\"Sometimes a gentle passing is a gift. Misguided doctors caught up in an aspirational belief that they must extend life, whatever the cost, cause individuals and families unnecessary suffering. Brittany stood up to bullies.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize: This is because clever, self-learning programs are getting better than human recruiters at analysing vast amounts of data gleaned from application forms, CVs (curricula vitae or resumes), and social media profiles. Not only can they see if your credentials match the basic requirements of the job description, they can identify personality traits from the way you've expressed yourself on paper and online. These algorithms try \\"to automate the 20-to-50 things the best recruiters do consciously or unconsciously\\" when shortlisting candidates, says Jon Bischke, chief executive of Entelo, a recruitment tech firm. But he doesn't believe we'll ever reach the point where the computer makes the final decision. \\"The goal is not to tell you who to hire,\\" he says. \\"But it might tell you which five people to bring in to interview.\\" The more data recruitment algorithms can analyse, the more accurate their assessments will become. And they can learn from previous successes and failures. So if a selected candidate does well in the job, for example, his or her profile can be fed back into the algorithm so that it can spot people with similar profiles in future. \\"Maybe in life I've looked at 20,000 or 30,000 resumes,\\" says Sheerov Desai, chief executive of Gild, a machine learning recruitment firm. \\"A machine which has been fed hundreds of millions is going to outperform me.\\" Before the advent of powerful computers and data science, recruiters \\"would spend a lot of time doing manual research on applicants, Googling them, looking for details about work they've done in the past, seeing if they would be a good cultural fit,\\" says Mr Desai. All this has now been automated and speeded up. And these algorithms can often spot things we humans can't. For example, one of Gild's clients complained that the agency was sending them Java engineers for a vacancy for an Android programmer. \\"But the machine is scanning hundreds of millions of resumes, and it started to make the conclusion that Java and Android were quite similar technologies,\\" says Mr Desai. The machine was right - a Java programmer not already familiar with Android would pick it up very quickly, he says. Another big advantage computers have over humans is that they are free from racial and gender prejudice. Where human recruiters may - even unconsciously - dismiss candidates based on assumed ethnicity, sex or education, algorithms can assess anonymised applications objectively. It is this kind of bias that drove Stephanie Lampkin to launch Blendoor, a \\"Tinder for jobs\\" that hides applicants' race, age, name, and gender and matches them with companies based on skills and education alone. Finding the best candidates is one thing, keeping them motivated and loyal once you've hired them is another. Most companies set their goals annually, but research shows the average goal's shelf-life is actually just 40 days, says Kris Duggan, chief executive of BetterWorks, a business management software company. Mr Duggan's product lets employees set goals quarterly and check in on their progress - he compares it to the fitness-goals system, FitBit. BetterWorks is also researching how to apply machine-learning to assess how effective a company's goals really are. The more engaged staff are the better they perform, says Jim Barnett, chief executive of Glint, a company that regularly surveys employees. \\"Measuring engagement isn't like an annual check-up with your doctor - it's more like fitness and diet, which you should be monitoring all the time,\\" he says. Algorithms sift through the survey data to predict which teams may be running into problems, and suggest how managers might forestall them. But how much monitoring is too much? In a recent experiment at MIT, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, employees in a business wore monitors to track their basic emotional states. Algorithms sifting through the data identified that all employees experienced flashes of anger during their day. Further analysis showed this was always during meetings with a particular manager. Now that might be useful to know if you're the boss, but how happy would staff be at that level of intrusion? And what are the risks of relying so heavily on computers for recruitment purposes? Algorithms trained to spot correlations and patterns - to seek out candidates that fit an ideal based on previous experience - may reject candidates from non-traditional backgrounds who would actually be excellent, some experts warn. If you write the algorithm too rigidly, it may end up selecting competent applicants but reject \\"the next Picasso, Shakespeare, or Turing\\", says Petar Vujosevic, co-founder of GapJumpers, a recruitment tech company specialising in \\"blind audition\\" assessments of potential candidates. GapJumpers believes setting relevant online tasks for applicants is a better way of assessing talent than simply wading through - probably embellished - CVs. \\"If people are not careful how they think about and build recruitment technology, in what is essentially a human process,\\"' says Mr Vujosevic, \\"it will only make people feel even less engaged and appreciated for their talents - and on a scale human recruiters never could manage.\\" Caveats aside, the financial case for using self-learning algorithms is clear. There are 5.3 million new job hires every month in the US, according to the country's Bureau of Labor Statistics. And each corporate vacancy attracts 250 applications on average. That's a lot of documents for businesses to plough through. Automating this process saves money - that's the bottom line. In the UK, replacing a departing staff member costs Â£30,614 on average, says Oxford Economics - which works out at more than Â£4bn a year in total for British business. And with a third of new hires leaving after six months, as a business you really want to do everything you can to get the right person the first time round. So if your job application is rejected in future, you may have to blame a computer, not the HR department.

The Giants are lacking depth in the receiving corps after adding Brandon Marshall (ankle), Odell Beckham (ankle) and Dwayne Harris (foot) to injured reserve this week. As a result, Ed Eagan was promoted to the Giants active roster Tuesday, opening up a spot for Raymond on the practice squad. Should the Giants suffer any more injuries, the 23-year-old could find himself on the active roster as well. Hypothesis: Raymond had a practice spot open on tuesday","output":"Yes, based on the provided context, we can draw the following hypothesis: Raymond had a practice spot open on Tuesday because Ed Eagan was promoted to the Giants active roster, which led to an open spot in the practice squad. A more detailed analysis of the context and reasoning to support this hypothesis is: 1. The Giants are dealing with significant injury-related issues in their receiving corps, with Brandon Marshall, Odell Beckham, and Dwayne Harris all being placed on injured reserve. 2. To address these roster shortages, the Giants have promoted Ed Eagan to their active roster from the practice squad as they need to strengthen their receiving corps. 3. With Ed Eagan's promotion to the active roster, this created an open spot on the Giants practice squad. 4. Raymond, who is a 23-year-old receiver, signed with the Giants practice squad on Tuesday, presumably filling the open spot that was left by Ed Eagan's promotion. 5. The context also mentions that if the Giants suffer any more injuries, Raymond could potentially be promoted to the active roster as well. This implies that Raymond's role on the team could be subject to change depending on the health of the existing players on the active roster. Based on this analysis, the hypothesis aligns with the context provided: Raymond had a practice spot open on Tuesday due to Ed Eagan's promotion to the Giants active roster and the subsequent need to fill the open spot in the practice squad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction.  - A teen drama is a genre or type of drama series with a major focus on teenage characters. It came into prominence in the early 1990s, especially with the popularity of the Fox series \\"Beverly Hills, 90210\\". After \\"90210\\" became a success, television writers and producers realized the potential for this new genre to reach out to a previously ignored demographic. In the past, most series that maintained a focus on teenagers had been sitcoms, while adolescents in drama series were usually part of a larger ensemble that included adults and children.  - Michael Thomas Hickland Wesley-Smith (born 2 December 1983) is a New Zealand television actor.

Named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to England, it ultimately derives its name from the Anglia (Angeln) peninsula in the Baltic Sea. It is most closely related to the Frisian languages, although its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other Germanic languages in the early medieval period, and later by Romance languages, particularly French. English is either the official language or one of the official languages in almost 60 sovereign states. It is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland, and New Zealand, and is widely spoken in some areas of the Caribbean, Africa, and South Asia. It is the third most common native language in the world, after Mandarin and Spanish. It is the most widely learned second language and an official language of the United Nations, of the European Union, and of many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the drummer that finished the arena tour after health issues cause the touring drummer to drop out? from the following article ?  Following the release of With Teeth in 2005, the live band was reassembled for the Live: With Teeth tour.  Since the previous tour five years earlier, much of the band had moved on in their careers, and only drummer Jerome Dillon rejoined. To find replacements, Reznor held auditions during December 2004.  He stated that keyboardist Alessandro Cortini \\"fit in immediately\\", though he had trouble finding a guitarist to replace Robin Finck until auditioning Aaron North. The tour began with a series of small-club performances early in 2005. The band told journalists they were \\"pleasantly surprised by the interest\\" of fans despite their lengthy absence.  This initial leg of the tour also included a headlining performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival.  The band followed with a North American arena tour in autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Death From Above 1979, Autolux, and Saul Williams. Williams performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. To conclude the With Teeth era of the band, Nine Inch Nails completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The 2007 release Beside You in Time features performances from the North American arena tour, the North American amphitheater tour, and a number of studio rehearsals.Nine Inch Nails were scheduled to perform at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, but dropped themselves from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of George W. Bush as a backdrop to the band's performance of \\"The Hand that Feeds\\". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on the official Nine Inch Nails website: \\"apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me\\".  MTV replied by saying they respected Reznor's point of view, but were \\"uncomfortable\\" with the performance being \\"built around partisan political statements\\". A performance...

But others immediately renewed calls for a global ban on human reproductive cloning before the technology moves any farther.  \\"Successful cloning of an increasing number of species confirms the general impression that it would be possible to clone any species of mammals, including humans,\\" said Ian Wilmut, a reproductive biologist at the University of Edinburgh who produced the first cloned mammal, Dolly the sheep, from an adult cell nearly a decade ago.  Researchers have since cloned cats, goats, cows, mice, pigs, rabbits, horses, deer, mules and gaur, a large wild ox of Southeast Asia. So far, efforts to clone a monkey or another primate with the same techniques have failed.

Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the process of electricity generation from coal is: 1. Extraction and transportation of coal: Prior to the coal being pulverized into fine powder, the raw material, coal, needs to be extracted from coal mines or deposits. This process involves either underground or open-pit mining techniques depending on the accessibility and depth of the coal deposits. Once the coal is extracted, it is then transported to the power plant via various methods such as trucks, conveyors, trains, or barges, depending on the location of the coal mine and the power plant. Upon arrival at the power plant, the coal is generally stored in large stockpiles, where it awaits further processing. Quality checks may also be performed at this stage to ensure that the coal meets the required specifications for efficiency and emissions. To summarize, the complete process of electricity generation from coal includes: 1. Extraction and transportation of coal. 2. Coal is pulverized into fine powder. 3.

If GPRA calls for phased implementation so that selected pilot projects in the agencies can develop experience from implementing GPRA requirements in fiscal years 1994 through 1996 before implementation is required for all agencies., can we conclude that \\"GPRA is completely against implementing the project by all means.\\"? OPT: [A]. yes. [B]. it is not possible to tell. [C]. no.","output":"C. No, we cannot conclude that \\"GPRA is completely against implementing the project by all means.\\" The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) of 1993 is a United States law that aims to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, and accountability of federal programs by establishing a system for agencies to set goals, measure performance, and report on their achievements. The provision for phased implementation does not imply that GPRA is against the project; instead, it shows a cautious and strategic approach to its implementation. The phased implementation allows for the gradual introduction of GPRA requirements in selected pilot projects from fiscal years 1994 through 1996 before it becomes mandatory for all agencies. This strategy has several advantages: 1. Learning Curve: Implementing GPRA requirements in pilot projects allows agencies to gain valuable experience and insights into the challenges, adjustments, and best practices needed for successful adoption. This learning curve prepares them for a smoother transition to full implementation. 2. Adaptation: The phased approach provides an opportunity for agencies to adapt their internal processes, systems, and culture to the new requirements. This gradual adaptation ensures that they are well-equipped to handle the changes and can minimize potential disruptions or inefficiencies. 3. Continuous Improvement: By starting with pilot projects, the government can identify areas of improvement and make necessary modifications to the GPRA framework. This iterative process enables them to refine and enhance the framework to better serve its objectives. 4. Reducing Risk: A phased approach helps in mitigating risks associated with large-scale change by testing the effectiveness and practicality of the implementation plan in smaller, controlled settings. This way, potential problems or roadblocks can be detected and addressed earlier, minimizing the negative impact on program performance. 5. Evidence-based Decision Making: The pilot projects serve as a platform for gathering data and evidence on the effectiveness of GPRA requirements in practice. This evidence-based approach allows for more informed decision-making when rolling out the implementation plan to all agencies. In conclusion, the phased implementation in the GPRA is not against the project but serves as a prudent approach to ensure the successful adoption of the requirements across federal agencies. This method allows the government to learn from pilot projects, mitigate risks, and enhance the framework, ultimately leading to more effective and accountable federal programs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries.

Question: Background: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  Paragraph: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group of larvae had more somatic mutations? Answer:","output":"Group L had more somatic mutations. Since the paragraph states that Group L displayed all kinds of mutations, it implies that it includes somatic mutations as well. In contrast, Group D did not display any mutations, indicating that they had fewer or no somatic mutations compared to Group L."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, we'll talk about a big decision made by the city council in Lansing.

The friendship between these two cities is called a \\"sister cities\\" relationship. But something happened recently in St. Petersburg that made the people in Lansing feel uncomfortable. The leaders in Russia, where St. Petersburg is, made a new rule which says that people can't talk about gay rights and relationships when kids are nearby. Gay rights are about making sure everyone is treated fairly and can be happy, no matter who they love. Because of this new rule, Lansing's city council (which is a group of people who help make decisions about what happens in Lansing) voted to end the \\"sister cities\\" relationship with St. Petersburg. That means they might not be special friends anymore. However, Lansing's mayor, who is like the boss of the city, thinks they should continue this \\"sister cities\\" friendship.

Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Chargers, the Broncos traveled to Reliant Stadium for an AFC match with the Houston Texans. The two teams traded field goals in the first quarter, with a 32-yarder by Broncos' placekicker Matt Prater and a 45-yarder by Texans' placekicker Randy Bullock. The Broncos grabbed the lead early in the second quarter, with a 36-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas.

A 15-yard touchdown pass from Texans' quarterback Matt Schaub to wide receiver Keshawn Martin was the only scoring play of the third quarter, which narrowed the Broncos' lead to 16-13. After Broncos' safety Mike Adams intercepted Schaub early in the fourth quarter, the Broncos subsequently pulled away, with Manning throwing two touchdown passes to wide receiver Eric Decker &#8212; a 10-yarder and a 20-yarder.

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the part owner of the brand that made decisions by consensus that got a A20 million payout when he left?, using the article: Despite Anthony Field's expressed dislike of the term, preferring to refer to it as \\"preserving the good name of The Wiggles\\", the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it.  They remained as independent as possible, and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business.  As Field stated, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was \\"not your regular 'corporate culture'\\".  They made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education.  They made careful decisions regarding their endorsements of toys and other products, and avoided over-extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image.  They had high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group.The Wiggles became formally consolidated in 2005. The group's board of directors consisted of the original three members, Paul Field, who has been general manager of operations since the group was formed and their manager since the mid-1990s, and Mike Conway, who had worked for Ernst & Young in England and become their general manager in 2001.  In 2009, the Australian rock band AC/DC knocked The Wiggles, who earned A45 million, from the top of Business Review Weekly's  (BRW) list of top entertainment earners for the first time in four years.  In 2011, the worldwide recession hit The Wiggles, as it had done for many Australian entertainers; they earned A28 million, but they still appeared second on the BRW's list that year.  By 2012, founding members Anthony Field, Cook, and Fatt retained 30% ownership of their brand, and Paul Field and Conway each owned 5%.  It was reported that as part owner of The Wiggles, Page was given a A20 million payout when he left the group in 2006.

What is the evolutionary significance of marketing and how has it changed modern society? Choose your answer. Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Available options: [A]. no [B]. yes","output":"[A]. no These two questions are not paraphrases of each other because they are asking about different things. First, let's understand each question: 1. What is the evolutionary significance of communism and how has it changed modern society? Communism is an idea about how people should organize themselves and share things. Imagine if everyone in your neighborhood shared their toys with each other, so no one had to worry about not having enough to play with. That's a bit like communism. The evolutionary significance of communism is about why people came up with this idea and how it might help them work together better. Communism has changed modern society in many ways, with some people thinking it's a good way to share and others thinking it's not fair. 2. What is the evolutionary significance of marketing and how has it changed modern society? Marketing is when people try to show others that their products, like toys or snacks, are the best and get people to buy them. The evolutionary significance of marketing is about why people started to do this and how it might help them find more customers. Marketing has changed modern society a lot, as we see advertisements everywhere, and it helps us know about new things that we might like. So, these two questions are different because one talks about communism, an idea for sharing, while the other talks about marketing, a way to show off products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - headache - fresh - constipated - confusion - boredom A:","output":"Confusion and boredom are the most suitable options to answer the question about what children feel when going to the opera. Let us explain these options in detail. Confusion: Children attending an opera performance may feel confused because they are entering a new environment with which they are not familiar. Operas are typically presented in ornate and grandiose venues, which can be overwhelming for a child. In addition, the language of the opera performances may be foreign to them, and they may not understand the complex storylines, especially if the opera is in a language other than English or their native tongue. Furthermore, operatic singing is stylistically different from the music children are exposed to in their everyday lives, which could lead to confusion about the purpose and enjoyment of this art form. Operatic performances often involve elaborate costumes, makeup, and stage design, which may be difficult for children to comprehend. Since children often have shorter attention spans, the length of the performance can contribute to their confusion and frustration, not being able to follow the story consistently. Boredom: Children who attend an opera may also experience boredom due to various reasons. As mentioned earlier, the length of an opera performance can be a significant factor. Operas often extend for hours with intricate, nuanced performances that require the audience to focus intently for long periods. Children, especially younger ones, may not have the patience or attention span to appreciate the performance without growing bored or restless. Moreover, operas often deal with themes and stories that are not tailored to a young audience, addressing topics such as romance, tragedy, and complex human relationships. The storytelling might be more abstract or mature in nature, which may not hold the attention of children who prefer simpler storylines and more engaging, animated characters. While some children exposed to operatic performances may enjoy the music, acting, and overall experience, others will find it challenging to decode the art form in a meaningful way. Consequently, the combination of complex stories, long runtimes, unfamiliar musical styles, and cultural differences can lead to confusion and boredom during their experience at the opera. Still, it is essential to remember that not all children will react in the same way to experiencing an opera. Some may find the experience educational, enriching, and genuinely enjoyable. These feelings can depend on factors such as the child's prior exposure to classical music and theater or their general interest in artistic experiences. Nonetheless, addressing confusion and boredom seems to be the most suitable options to answer the question considering the variables involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered.  - Hamden Khalif Allah Awad alias Ahmed the German ( actually Egyptian ) ( August 13 , 1970 -- August 7 , 1998 ) was one of the perpetrators of the 1998 United States embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania .

When Russia invaded the Turkish Balkans in 1853, fears of Russian dominance in the Mediterranean and Middle East led Britain and France to invade the Crimean Peninsula to destroy Russian naval capabilities. The ensuing Crimean War (1854–56), which involved new techniques of modern warfare, and was the only global war fought between Britain and another imperial power during the Pax Britannica, was a resounding defeat for Russia. The situation remained unresolved in Central Asia for two more decades, with Britain annexing Baluchistan in 1876 and Russia annexing Kirghizia, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan. For a while it appeared that another war would be inevitable, but the two countries reached an agreement on their respective spheres of influence in the region in 1878 and on all outstanding matters in 1907 with the signing of the Anglo-Russian Entente.

Rowling's series of Harry Potter novels. Voldemort first appeared in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, which was released in 1997. Voldemort appears either in person or in flashbacks in each book and its film adaptation in the series, except the third, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, where he is only mentioned. Voldemort is the archenemy of Harry Potter, who according to a prophecy has \\"the power to vanquish the Dark Lord\\". Context: Voldemort does not appear in Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, although his presence and actions are felt: he once again declares war, and begins to rise to power once more. He murders Amelia Bones of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, and begins to target members of the Order of the Phoenix, including Emmeline Vance.  Rowling uses several chapters as exposition to establish Voldemort's backstory. In a series of flashbacks, using the pensieve as a plot device, she reveals that Voldemort was the son of the witch Merope Gaunt and a Muggle called Tom Riddle. Riddle abandoned Merope before their child's birth, soon after which Merope died, just hours after giving birth. After living in an orphanage, young Riddle met Dumbledore, who told him he was a wizard and arranged for him to attend Hogwarts. Riddle was outwardly a model student, but was in reality a psychopath who takes sadistic pleasure in using his powers to harm and control people. He eventually murdered his father and grandparents as revenge for abandoning him. The book also discusses Riddle's hatred of \\"Muggles\\", his obsession with Horcruxes, and his desire to split his soul to achieve immortality. Rowling stated Voldemort's conception under the influence of a love potion symbolises the prejudicial circumstances under which he was brought into the world.  In the main plot of the book, Voldemort's next step is to engineer an assault on Hogwarts, and to attack Dumbledore. This is accomplished by Draco Malfoy, who arranges transportation of Death Eaters into Hogwarts by a pair of Vanishing Cabinets, which bypass the extensive protective enchantments placed around the school. The cabinets allow Voldemort's Death Eaters to enter Hogwarts, where battle commences and Dumbledore is cornered. Hogwarts professor (and re-doubled agent) Severus Snape uses the Killing Curse against Dumbledore when Draco could not force himself to do so. Question: Who was he the son of?. Whats the answer?","output":"Lord Voldemort, born as Tom Marvolo Riddle, was the son of a witch named Merope Gaunt and a Muggle named Tom Riddle Sr. Merope Gaunt was a descendant of Salazar Slytherin, one of the four founders of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Tom Riddle Sr. was a wealthy Muggle who lived in the village of Little Hangleton. He abandoned Merope before their child's birth, and she died shortly after giving birth, leaving young Tom Riddle to grow up in an orphanage."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please briefly summarize this news article: CRISIS IS EXPECTED TO AID TORIES IN LOCAL ELECTIONS LONDON, May 5— The battle for the Falkland Islands is expected to help Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Conservative Party in Thursday's local elections and thus strengthen her hand. Before Argentina seized the islands April 2, many politicians thought the Tories would take a drubbing, largely because of high unemployment and slow economic recovery. But the fighting in the South Atlantic, with Mrs. Thatcher portrayed as the avenger of the initial humiliation, seems to have pushed the economy to the back of most voters' minds. ''She, and by extension her party, are thoroughly wrapped in the Union Jack,'' said a disgruntled campaigner for the opposition Labor Party. ''At a moment when our fleet is under attack, when servicemen are dying, that is an electoral asset quite beyond compare.'' But it is likely to be the new Social Democratic Party, not Labor, that suffers most at the ballot box. Having scored a series of byelection successes, the Social Democrats had hoped that Thursday's test would demonstrate once and for all that they were a serious third force. Party's Standing Is Slipping Now the party's standing is slipping. At the moment, it stands at 25 percent, down from 40 percent last year. At that level, the Social Democrats can expect to finish second in many races but to win relatively few. Ever since it was launched, the new party has sought to maintain momentum and publicity in the press. The crisis has robbed it of attention and a disappointing showing on Thursday could halt its momentum. One problem has been that the Social Democrats' credibility depended in part on the two major parties' seeming ineptness. The Falkland crisis has made the Tories more popular, and it has masked Labor's divisions. A second difficulty is that much Social Democratic support comes from what are described as the ''concerned'' middle classes, who consider themselves ''the thinking part of the population as opposed to those who obey the atavistic appeals of traditionalism.'' The public mood appears volatile, though it does not seem to have turned against Mrs. Thatcher because of the loss of the destroyer Sheffield. In the long term, Conservative fortunes are linked to a resolution of the crisis, and Labor unity is unlikely to last for long. So the expected setback for the Social Democrats and their Liberal allies could prove to be transitory. Nevertheless, the Social Democrats are worried. William Rodgers, one of the four leaders of the party, said over the weekend that it would not do well, and Roy Jenkins, another leader, has been trying to turn voters' attention away from the Falklands. ''It would be ridiculous,'' he said on Monday, ''for people to elect a council for the next four years on the basis of what they think of the Government's handling of the Falklands crisis at the present time.'' But that is what many voters seem prepared to do. An opinion poll in 20 London boroughs showed, for example, that 24 percent of potential Tory voters considered the crisis either the most important issue or an important factor in the election. The poll showed the Conservatives with 40 percent of the vote, Labor with 34 percent and the Social Democratic-Liberal alliance with 25. A total of 4,800 seats are being contested in the 32 London boroughs, the 36 English metropolitan areas outside London, 103 rural districts in England and 12 regional authorities in Scotland. The Social Democrats have put up 2,300 candidates, slightly fewer than their Liberal allies. At one point, alliance strategists talked of winning 1,500 seats, but their latest forecasts, based on the polls and on canvassing returns, are running at about 600, with about 400 Liberals and 200 Social Democrats. That would be viewed as a considerable accomplishment in political circles but not as the kind of breakthrough the alliance sought. Mrs. Thatcher, on the other hand, will no doubt claim a victory even if the Tory vote is off slightly from that in the last local balloting four years ago. The party in power at Westminster almost always does badly in local elections that come around the midpoint of its term, as these will do. Two more tests for the Prime Minister are also due in the next month, when the outcome of the Falkland dispute may be clearer. Parliamentary by-elections are set for Beaconsfield, a strong Tory seat in the prosperous suburbs west of London, on May 27, and for Mitcham and Morden, a marginal Labor seat in South London, on June 3. The Conservatives had been worried about Beaconsfield, whose Member of Parliament, Sir Ronald Bell, died in March, but they are less anxious as a result of the crisis. ''Suburbia,'' said a Tory tactician, ''is rallying to the flag.'' At Mitcham and Morden, the incumbent, Bruce Douglas-Mann, has switched to the Social Democrats.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Libyan Rebels Report Gains in Misrata Fighting TRIPOLI, Libya -- Rebels battled Muammar Qaddafi's troops Thursday for control of central Misrata, driving dozens of snipers from tall buildings in hours of urban warfare and gaining a tactical advantage in the only major city held by the opposition in western Libya, witnesses said. The Libyan government, meanwhile, ramped up its rhetoric against NATO, warning that \\"it will be hell\\" for the alliance if it sends in ground troops, even though Britain's prime minister said the Western nations were not moving toward such a deployment. U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya. The drones allow for low-level precision attacks and are uniquely suited for urban areas such as Misrata, where NATO airpower has been unable to protect civilians when Qaddafi's forces are operating inside the city. Also Thursday, rebels captured a Libyan border crossing into Tunisia, forcing government soldiers to flee over the frontier and possibly opening a new channel for opposition forces in Qaddafi's bastion in western part of the country. At least seven people were killed in Thursday's fighting for the main Misrata thoroughfare of Tripoli Street, bringing to 20 the number slain in three days in Libya's third-largest city. Misrata has been besieged by government forces for nearly two months, with human rights groups estimating hundreds of people killed. Tripoli Street is the site where two Western photojournalists were killed Wednesday as the rebels tried to dislodge the snipers loyal to Qaddafi perched on rooftops. The street, which stretches from the heart of Misrata to a major highway southwest of the city of 300,000 people, has become a front line for the rebels and Qaddafi's forces. The rebels took over several buildings along parts of the street, enabling them to cut off supplies to a Qaddafi unit and dozens of rooftop snipers who have terrorized civilians and kept them trapped in their homes, said a doctor who identified himself only as Ayman for fear of retaliation. \\"This battle cost us lots of blood and martyrs,\\" the doctor said. Residents celebrated and chanted \\"God is great\\" after the snipers left a battle-scarred insurance building that is the highest point in central Misrata, according to a witness who identified himself only as Sohaib. \\"Thanks to God, the snipers fled, leaving nothing behind at the insurance building after they were cut off from supplies -- ammunition, food and water -- for days,\\" added another resident, Abdel Salam. He called it \\"a major victory\\" because the structure gave the pro-Qaddafi forces a commanding view of the city. In Tripoli, government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim claimed Qaddafi forces control more than 80 percent of the city and the rebels hold \\"the seaport and the area surrounding it.\\" Residents said that at the beginning of the battle for Misrata, the government deployed tanks and shelled the city indiscriminately, forcing residents to flee their homes and businesses, which were taken over by Qaddafi's forces. NATO commanders have admitted their airpower was limited in being able to protect civilians in cities like Misrata, which was the main mission of the international air campaign. Abdel Salam, who asked to be identified only by his given name for fear of retribution, said Qaddafi's forces were using tanks and rocket-propelled grenades. \\"Col. Qaddafi's troops continue their vicious attacks, including the siege of Misrata,\\" Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said in Washington. \\"There are even reports that Qaddafi forces may have used cluster bombs against their own people.\\" Libyan officials have persistently denied the use of cluster bombs, which indiscriminately spray small bomblets over a wide area and are particularly lethal in residential areas. However, Human Rights Watch has said it found evidence of cluster bombs being used by government forces in Misrata. Earlier this week, Britain, Italy and France said they were sending military officers to advise the rebels, prompting speculation that this was a step toward sending in ground forces at a time when NATO airstrikes were failing to break the battlefield stalemate or protect civilians in Misrata. Ibrahim, the government spokesman, warned that NATO would find itself entangled in fighting ordinary Libyans if its soldiers were to set foot on Libyan soil. \\"We are arming the whole population, not to fight the rebels, by the way, because the rebels are very easy -- they are not a challenge for us,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"What we are fighting is NATO now.\\" Ibrahim said the Qaddafi regime is ready to observe an immediate cease-fire and negotiate the terms of political transition. Rebels have said Qaddafi must step down before such talks can begin. \\"We are ready and accepting peace ... but we are also ready for war,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"If NATO comes, it will be hell.\\" But British Prime Minister David Cameron insisted NATO isn't edging toward deploying ground troops in Libya. Italy, France and Britain are sending experienced combat advisers to help train and organize Libya's opposition forces dislodge Qaddafi after four decades in power. Ministers have insisted the officers won't play any role in offensives against Qaddafi's troops -- and have repeatedly said NATO and allies won't overstep boundaries set out in the United Nations resolution authorizing action in Libya. \\"We're not allowed, rightly, to have an invading army, or an occupying army,\\" Cameron told BBC Scotland radio. \\"That's not what we want, that's not what the Libyans want, that's not what the world wants.\\" The capture of the border crossing with Tunisia in western Libya followed three days of intense fighting outside the desert town of Nalut, about 140 miles (240 kilometers) southwest of Tripoli, said a rebel leader, Shaban Abu Sitta. The area was briefly in hands of anti-government forces last month before Libyan troops moved in. Holding the Dhuheiba border crossing could open important supply routes for anti-Qaddafi forces and give the rebels another foothold in western Libya. After taking control of the crossing early Thursday, rebels raised the pre-Qaddafi tricolor flag. In recent weeks, more than 10,000 Libyans from the border region had crossed into Tunisia, and 1,200 found shelter in a tent camp near the village of Dhuheiba, a few miles from the border. When people in the camp learned of the takeover of the crossing, they chanted, \\"The rebels brought freedom to their town.\\" By afternoon, hundreds of Libyan refugees had assembled at the crossing, waiting to return home. Also Thursday, the Greek passenger ferry Ionian Spirit carried more than 1,000 people fleeing Misrata to the rebel stronghold of Benghazi in eastern Libya, where 30 ambulances were waiting. The ship's passengers included dozens of wounded and shell-shocked Libyans, hundreds of migrant workers from Africa, as well as smaller groups from Pakistan, Nigeria and the Philippines. Four of the injured were seriously hurt It also carried the bodies of two photojournalists killed in Misrata on Wednesday: Chris Hondros, a New York-based photographer for Getty Images, and British-born Tim Hetherington, co-director of the 2010 Afghanistan war documentary \\"Restrepo\\" that was nominated for an Academy Award. Also aboard was the body of a Ukrainian doctor who was killed by an artillery blast in Misrata. Several banners were hung to greet the ferry. One said: \\"U.K. and U.S., your blood was mixed with ours in Misrata.\\" Summary:","output":"Libyan rebels made significant gains in Misrata, driving out snipers from tall buildings and gaining a tactical advantage in the only major city they hold in western Libya. The Libyan government has warned of consequences if NATO sends in ground troops. U.S. President Barack Obama has approved the use of armed Predator drones in Libya, which allow for low-level precision attacks suited for urban areas.

This could make the learning curve steeper and more frustrating for a potential user, especially if they are not familiar with similar products. 3. Not user-friendly: The reviewer states that the product is not user-friendly. This would deter potential buyers who prioritize ease of use and intuitive interfaces, as they might worry about spending an excessive amount of time attempting to navigate the product's features. 4.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. how much longer will financial hardships that affect billions of lives last? Write the above sentence using proper case.","output":"How long will financial hardships that affect billions of lives persist? The persistence of financial hardships that influence billions of lives is a complex issue and it is not possible to predict an exact timeframe for its resolution. There are several factors that contribute to this concerning situation, such as economic inequalities, political decisions, global crises, social support systems, technological advancements, and individual circumstances. For a more elaborate understanding, let us dissect these factors and their relevant impacts: 1. Economic Inequalities: The wealth gap between the richest and poorest sectors of society has increased significantly over the years, making it more difficult for those in lower socioeconomic strata to break out of their financial hardships. To lessen economic inequalities, governments must focus on policy decisions that address the root causes of wealth distribution disparities, such as an improved tax structure, provision of quality education, and job opportunities for all. 2. Political Decisions: Political decisions play a crucial role in shaping the economy of a country. Policies that facilitate job growth, promote fair wages, enable easy access to credit, and support small businesses can lessen the financial burden on the economically disadvantaged. Transparent and efficient governance systems are vital for equitable distribution of resources. 3. Global Crises: Events such as recessions, pandemics, natural disasters, and geopolitical tensions can result in job losses, inflation, reduced investments, and declining economic growth, which in turn exacerbate financial hardships for the general populace. Addressing these crises requires international cooperation, sound decision-making by governments, and effective adaptation strategies. 4. Social Support Systems: Robust social support systems, including healthcare, education, and social welfare programs, can go a long way in mitigating financial hardships experienced by vulnerable populations. Governments need to prioritize establishing and maintaining these support systems to lessen the burden on those who are less fortunate. 5. Technological Advancements: While technological progress can create new job opportunities and increase productivity, it can also lead to job displacement and reduced demand for certain skill sets. Governments and industries must work together to design and implement re-skilling and up-skilling programs, ensuring everyone has a chance to participate in the evolving job market. 6. Individual Circumstances: Factors such as personal choices, family background, education, and individual capabilities can all impact financial well-being. Empowering individuals to make informed decisions about their finances, such as budgeting wisely, investing in education, and selecting appropriate career paths, is instrumental in overcoming financial hardships. The persistence and eventual resolution of financial hardships that affect billions of lives depend on how effectively these factors are managed on a global scale. It involves collective efforts by governments, private sectors, nonprofit organizations, and individuals alike. Only when all stakeholders come together to address the root causes and implement effective solutions can we expect a meaningful reduction in financial hardships that affect such a large portion of the world's population."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: Which fictional hero, created by Baroness Orczy, takes his name from the small red flower with which he signs his messages?","output":"The fictional hero you are referring to, who was created by Baroness Emma Orczy, is Sir Percy Blakeney, also known as \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel.\\" The character first appeared in the play \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel,\\" written by Orczy and her husband, Montague MacLean Barstow, in 1903. The play's success led to a novel of the same name, published in 1905, which further popularized the character and spawned multiple sequels, adaptations, and spin-offs. The Scarlet Pimpernel takes his name from the small red flower, the pimpernel (Anagallis arvensis), which he uses to sign messages and leave as a signature at the scene of his daring escapades. This flower has a rich symbolism and adds to the overall mystique and enigmatic nature of the character. Sir Percy Blakeney, an English baronet, leads a double life in the story. On the surface, he is a rich, fashionable, and foppish aristocrat, known for his extravagant lifestyle and lack of intellectual prowess. However, his true identity is the elusive and ingenious Scarlet Pimpernel, a master of disguise and cunning who rescues French aristocrats from the clutches of the revolutionary French government during the Reign of Terror. As the Scarlet Pimpernel, Sir Percy operates secretly and uses his considerable wit, intelligence, and skills to outsmart the authorities and organize a network of dedicated followers, called the \\"League of the Scarlet Pimpernel.\\" This brave and resourceful group works tirelessly to save innocent lives from the guillotine, risking their own in the process. Sir Percy's arch-nemesis, Chauvelin, is an agent of the French government and the primary antagonist in the series. He relentlessly pursues the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel, often coming close to catching him but ultimately falling prey to the hero's clever ruses. The character of the Scarlet Pimpernel is considered one of the earliest influences on the modern superhero genre. His dual identity, elaborate disguises, and feats of physical prowess and cunning are reminiscent of many characters that followed, including Zorro, Batman, and others. Throughout the numerous books, plays, and adaptations, the legend of the Scarlet Pimpernel has continued to capture the imagination of audiences worldwide. Baroness Orczy's creation has stood the test of time and serves as a powerful reminder of the importance of courage, heroism, and self-sacrifice in the face of tyranny and oppression."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here are possible answers to this question: - win game - makes feel happy - the timer stops - have fun - enjoy yourself  I believe the correct choice is \\"win game\\", here's why: A:","output":"Monopoly, a classic and widely popular family board game, has an objective that differs from some of the other possible answers listed. Let me explain in detail why the correct choice is \\"win game.\\" Monopoly is a game of property buying, trading, and developing, wherein players roll dice to move around the game board, aiming to acquire and improve properties. The central goal of the game involves dominating the property market and driving opponents to bankruptcy. As such, the game draws to a close when one person has managed to achieve the following: 1. Acquire a majority of the properties, utilities, and/or railroads. 2. Develop these properties by building houses and hotels, which increases the rent that opponents are required to pay when landing on these spaces. 3. Strategically negotiate trades and deals with other players to further expand their property empire. 4. Forcing opponents to spend their in-game money to pay rent, fines, and other in-game costs until they have no funds or assets left to continue. Considering these requirements, \\"win game\\" is the most accurate choice that reflects how Monopoly concludes. The remaining possibilities, like \\"makes feel happy,\\" \\"the timer stops,\\" \\"have fun,\\" and \\"enjoy yourself,\\" don't correctly address the game's primary objective. Furthermore, these other options either refer to the emotional experience associated with playing a game or imply the existence of a timer, which Monopoly does not utilize. While having a good time and enjoying oneself are often encouraged when playing a game, these sentiments do not indicate the official end of Monopoly. Similarly, the presence of a timer or the stopping of time have no bearing on this particular game's conclusion. To summarize, in Monopoly, the game is over when one player has accumulated and maintained a significant advantage over the other players, effectively driving them to bankruptcy and securing their position as the game's winner. As such, the most appropriate answer to the question is \\"win game.\\" This choice reflects the primary goal of Monopoly and provides a more accurate depiction of how the game reaches its conclusion when compared to the other provided options."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: The Addams Family Movie plot: Gomez Addams laments the 25-year absence of his brother Fester, who disappeared after the two had a falling-out. Gomez's lawyer Tully Alford owes money to loan shark Abigail Craven, and notices that her son Gordon closely resembles Fester. Tully proposes that Gordon pose as Fester to infiltrate the Addams household and find the hidden vault where they keep their vast riches. Tully and his wife Margaret attend a sÃ©ance at the Addams home led by Grandmama in which the family tries to contact Fester's spirit. Gordon arrives, posing as Fester, while Abigail poses as psychiatrist Dr. Pinder-Schloss and tells the family that Fester had been lost in the Bermuda Triangle for the past 25 years. Gomez, overjoyed to have Fester back, takes him to the family vault to view home movies from their childhood. Gordon learns the reason for the brothers' falling-out: Gomez was jealous of Fester's success with women, and wooed the conjoined twins Flora and Fauna Amor away from him out of envy. Gomez starts to suspect that \\"Fester\\" is an impostor when he is unable to recall important details about their past. Gordon attempts to return to the vault, but is unable to get past a booby trap. Gomez's wife Morticia reminds \\"Fester\\" of the importance of family amongst the Addamses and of their vengeance against those who cross them. Fearing that the family is getting wise to their con, Abigail (under the guise of Dr. Pinder-Schloss) convinces Gomez that his suspicions are due to displacement. Gordon grows closer to the Addams family, particularly the children Wednesday and Pugsley, whom he helps to prepare a swordplay sequence for a school play. The Addamses throw a large party with their extended family and friends to celebrate Fester's return, during which Abigail plans to break into the vault. Wednesday overhears Abigail and Gordon discussing their scheme, and escapes them by hiding in the family cemetery.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: I'm getting warm because I increased the thermostat in my bedroom.  What might I be doing soon? Possible A: feeling comfortable, overheat, increase of temperature, pleasure, starting fire  Why is \\"feeling comfortable\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"The answer \\"feeling comfortable\\" is aligned with human common sense for various reasons. Firstly, the primary purpose of adjusting a thermostat is to control the temperature of a particular environment, such as a room, to a level that is comfortable for the occupants. The mechanism works by adjusting the temperature as needed within a home's heating system to maintain a consistent ambient temperature. This core function of maintaining a comfortable environment leans into the realm of human common sense; when a person feels chilly, they tend to increase the temperature to feel more comfortable. Secondly, \\"feeling comfortable\\" is an interpretation of a physical status that most people can perceive. Human common sense is built upon everyday experiences and shared understanding. The experience of adjusting a thermostat to alleviate discomfort from cold is quite common and could be well-understood by others. People universally seek comfort, and one's level of comfort can often be influenced by the surrounding temperature.  Thirdly, the act of increasing the thermostat setting indicates an intention to alter the current environment, presumably for the better. If a person is getting warm because they've increased the thermostat in their bedroom, it's a sound assumption that they were previously feeling cool or uncomfortable due to lower temperature. Thus, their adjustment of the thermostat can be seen as an effort to rectify this discomfort, leading to the assumption they might soon be feeling comfortable. Lastly, \\"feeling comfortable\\" is related to personal well-being and satisfaction. The ability to control one's environment to enhance comfort is a fundamental aspect of human behavior — it is quite common to adjust factors within our control to achieve a sense of comfort and satisfaction.  Thus, deriving the answer \\"feeling comfortable\\" from the scenario aligns with human common sense because it takes into account basic human needs, common experiences, and the logical steps people often take to satisfy their comfort requirements. This shared understanding and predictability of actions and outcomes in familiar scenarios lie at the heart of what we consider to be 'common sense.'"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Which writer created the the character Walter Mitty?","output":"Walter Mitty, a fictional character, was created by the celebrated American author James Thurber. James Grover Thurber was born on December 8, 1894, in Columbus, Ohio, and he passed away on November 2, 1961. Thurber was an influential humorist, cartoonist, and author of short stories, essays, and plays. His work was widely celebrated for its wit and satire, often commenting on the human condition and presenting ordinary individuals in humorous and absurd situations. Walter Mitty first appeared in a short story titled \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" which was published in The New Yorker magazine on March 18, 1939. The story revolves around the protagonist, Walter Mitty, who often escapes his mundane and unexciting existence by immersing himself in vivid daydreams. These fantasies see him undertaking various heroic and adventurous roles, such as a daring pilot, a skilled surgeon, or a fearless soldier. Mitty's vivid imagination serves as an escape from the real world, where he is often belittled and controlled by his overbearing spouse. The character of Walter Mitty struck a chord with readers and became an iconic symbol of individuals struggling with the uneventful routine of their lives. The popularity of the character led to the coining of the term \\"Mittyesque,\\" which refers to someone indulging in grandiose daydreams to compensate for their unassertive and unremarkable life. The story has been adapted into various formats over the years, including stage productions, radio plays, and films. The most well-known adaptation is the 1947 film, \\"The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,\\" starring Danny Kaye, and the 2013 film of the same name, featuring Ben Stiller. James Thurber was renowned for his unique storytelling and illustration style, which made him one of the most prominent humorists of his time. His other notable works include \\"My Life and Hard Times\\" (1933), \\"The Middle-Aged Man on the Flying Trapeze\\" (1935), and \\"The White Deer\\" (1945). Thurber's writing and cartoons have left an indelible mark on American humor, and his influence can still be seen in today's literature, comic strips, and television programs. The enduring popularity of the character Walter Mitty is a testament to Thurber's imagination, wit, and profound observations of human nature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hold on to your shopping carts: There is no perfect diet for human beings. At least not one that's based on how much protein, fat or carbohydrates you eat. People have lived and thrived on high-protein, high-fat diets (the Inuit of Greenland); on low-protein, high-carb diets (the indigenous peoples of southern Africa); on diets high in raw milk and cream (the people of the Loetschental Valley in Switzerland); diets high in saturated fat (the Trobriand Islanders) and even on diets in which animal blood is considered a staple (the Massai of Kenya and Tanzania). And folks have thrived on these diets without the ravages of degenerative diseases that are so epidemic in modern life--heart disease, diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, osteoporosis and cancer. In Depth: The Healthiest Foods On Earth The only thing these diets have in common is that they're all based on whole foods with minimum processing. Nuts, berries, beans, raw milk, grass-fed meat. Whole, real, unprocessed food is almost always healthy, regardless of how many grams of carbs, protein or fat it contains. All these healthy diets have in common the fact that they are absent foods with bar codes. They are also extremely low in sugar. In fact, the number of modern or ancient societies known for health and longevity that have consumed a diet high in sugar would be ... let's see ... zero. Truth be told, what you eat probably matters less than how much processing it's undergone. Real food--whole food with minimal processing--contains a virtual pharmacy of nutrients, phytochemicals, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, anti-inflammatories and healthful fats, and can easily keep you alive and thriving into your 10th decade. Berries, for example, are phenomenally low in calories, high in fiber and loaded with plant compounds that improve memory and help fight cancer. Studies have consistently shown that nut-eaters have lower rates of heart disease. Beans are notorious for their high fiber content and are a part of the diet of people--from almost every corner of the globe--who live long and well. Protein--the word comes from a Greek word meaning \\"of prime importance\\"--is a feature of every healthy diet ever studied. Meat , contrary to its terrible reputation, can be a health food if--and this is a big if--the meat comes from animals that have been raised on pasture land, have never seen the inside of a feedlot farm and have never been shot full of antibiotics and hormones. Ditto for raw milk, generally believed to be one of the healthiest beverages on the planet by countless devotees who often go to great expense and inconvenience to obtain it from small, sustainable farms. Wild salmon, whose omega-3 content is consistently higher than its less-fortunate farm-raised brethren, gets its red color from a powerful antioxidant called astaxathin. The combination of protein, omega-3s and antioxidants makes wild salmon a contender for anyone's list of great foods. Another great food: eggs--one of nature's most perfect creations, especially if you don't throw out the all-important yolk. (Remember \\"whole\\" foods means exactly that--foods in their original form. Our robust ancestors did not eat \\"low-fat\\" caribou; we don't need to eat \\"egg-white\\" omelets.) There are really no \\"bad\\" vegetables, but some of them are superstars. Any vegetable from the Brassica genus--broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, kale--is loaded with plant chemicals called indoles, which help reduce the risk of cancer. In the fruit kingdom, apples totally deserve their reputation as doctor-repellants: they're loaded with fiber, minerals (like bone-building boron) and phytochemicals (like quercetin, which is known to be a powerful anti-inflammatory and to have anti-cancer properties). Some exciting new research suggests that pomegranate juice slows the progression of certain cancers. Other research shows it lowers blood pressure and may even act as a \\"natural Viagra.\\" Tea deserves special mention on any list of the world's healthiest foods. The second most widely consumed beverage in the world (after water), all forms of tea (black, oolong, white, green and the newer Yerba Matte) are loaded with antioxidants and anti-inflammatories. Some types (green tea, for example) contain plant chemicals called catechins which have decided anti-cancer activity Finally, let's not forget members of the Alliaceae family of plants--onions, garlic and shallots. Garlic has been used for thousands of years for its medicinal properties; hundreds of published studies support its antimicrobial effects as well as its ability to lower the risk of heart disease. A number of studies have shown an inverse relationship between onion consumption and certain types of cancer.

Movie plot: Louise (Danielle Darrieux) is an aristocratic woman of Belle Ãpoque Paris, married to AndrÃ© (Charles Boyer), both a count and a high-ranking French army general. Louise is a beautiful, but spoiled and superficial, woman who has amassed debts due to her lifestyle. She arranges to secretly sell her costly heart-shaped diamond earrings, a wedding present from her husband, to the original jeweler, Mr RÃ©my (Jean Debucourt). Relations between Louise and AndrÃ© are companionable, but they sleep in separate beds, have no children, and AndrÃ© has a secret mistress, of whom he has recently tired. Louise disguises the disappearance of the earrings by pretending to have lost them at the opera. The search for them eventually reaches the newspapers (\\"Theft at the Theatre\\") which in turn prompts RÃ©my to go to AndrÃ© and \\"discreetly\\" offer to sell them back. He accepts cheerfully and, rather than confront his wife, coolly gifts the earrings to his mistress, Lola (Lia Di Leo), whom he happens to be seeing off permanently to Constantinople. At her destination, however, Lola soon sells the earrings herself to settle gambling debts and they are later purchased by an Italian baron, Fabrizio Donati (Vittorio De Sica), who is on his way to a high diplomatic post in Paris. Through a series of encounters, Donati becomes infatuated with Louise, later dancing with her long into the night at a ball. AndrÃ©'s long absence \\"on maneuvers\\" facilitates the couple's affair. With each passage of time, the Baron asks Louise if she has heard from her husband. AndrÃ©'s return prompts Louise to stop seeing Donati, but during a hunting excursion where all three are present, she witnesses Donati fall from his horse and faints. She is said to have a \\"weak heart,\\" but AndrÃ© sees this behavior as an affectation, and the event makes him suspicious. Louise becomes disconsolate and announces that she will take a long holiday in the Italian Lake region, alarming both her husband and her lover.

Process: - Place the water in a pot - Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover - Place a larger pot under the first - Heat water to evaporation - Water vapor will collect on the lid - Drip into the second pot as fresh water - Salt is left behind in the original pot.  Question: suppose The lid isnt the proper one happens, how will it affect More salt will drip inside the fresh water pot..  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"A: More If the lid isn't the proper one for the pot, it means that the seal between the pot and the lid will not be as tight. This will affect the efficiency of the process and may result in more saltwater droplets entering the fresh water pot. Let's analyze the situation in more detail. By using a slightly too large cover for the pot, there's a higher chance of an imperfect seal between the two surfaces, leading to more gaps or spaces for the steam to escape instead of condensing properly on the lid. As the water is heated and evaporates, the water vapor will rise and come into contact with the lid. Ideally, the water vapor should only condense on the lid and drip into the second pot as fresh water, with the salt being left behind in the original pot. However, when the lid isn't the proper one, the gaps or spaces created might allow some of the saltwater vapor to mix with the condensed fresh water on the lid. Therefore, when the water drips into the second pot, it may contain more dissolved salt than desired, resulting in a higher concentration of salt in the fresh water pot. Moreover, the use of an improper lid could also cause the steam to condense on other parts of the pot or the surrounding kitchen surfaces instead of just on the lid, making the whole process less effective. To summarize, by using a lid that isn't the proper size for the pot, there's a higher risk of more saltwater droplets entering the fresh water pot and causing a higher concentration of salt. The optimal solution to this problem would be to use a lid that fits the pot perfectly in order to create the most efficient system for separating salt from the water."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: A race row has erupted in one of Britain's wealthiest villages after offensive graffiti was plastered on the site of a proposed Sikh school. If the Khalsa Secondary Academy is built it would see more than 1,000 people flock into Stoke Poges, Buckinghamshire, from as far afield as West London. Tension in the village has grown over the past fortnight with angry locals venting their anger online and at parish council meetings. Now one racist hooligan has daubed 'NO P*** SCHOOL' and 'DON'T SELL TO P*** SCHOOL' on a sign at the proposed site. Race row: Someone has daubed this sign on the site of a proposed school with racist language in a village that opposes it. Up for sale: Pioneer House (pictured) is the site in Stoke Poges where developers are hoping to build a 850 place Sikh faith school. Residents in Stoke Poges have condemned the thugs responsible for the graffiti, claiming their objections to the school have nothing to do with race. But they feel the Slough Sikh Education Trust (SSET), which is behind the proposed faith school, could be fuelling rumours it is a race issue by circulating images of the graffiti. Saera Carter, vice chairman of the Stoke Poges Parish Council, said: 'It was discovered at 8:30am in the morning and seven villagers scrubbed it off within the hour. 'As a village we were offended by it. We don't want to offend our Asian neighbours or the SSET as we are a peaceful village. 'Sikhism is a peaceful religion but this is immature and inflammatory behaviour and it wouldn't surprise me if the SSET is turning this into a race issue.' Upset: Campaigners Avtar Singh Brar and Saera Carter from Stoke Poges, who are fighting the plans. Stoke Poges is known for the exclusive Stoke Park estate which featured in the James Bond classic Goldfinger. Recent figures ranked Stoke Poges as having the eighth highest concentration of £1 million properties sold in Britain. It is understood Mr Kandola has also sent the image to Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who represents Stoke Poges as part of the Beaconsfield Ward. In touch: Local MP Dominic Grieve is said to have been sent the image of the graffiti. Locals have said their opposition to the school is based on the proposed site - the current UK headquarters for Pioneer - being on greenbelt land. They say Stoke Poges doesn't have the infrastructure to deal with 1,000 people entering the village each day and also fear children will lose their right to free bus travel if the multi-million pound taxpayer-funded school opens on the site. When 222 parents at the village's primary school were asked if they would send their child to the Khalsa Academy, 93.25 per cent said no. The chairman of the Slough Sikh Education Trust yesterday has described the racist graffiti as 'unfortunate'. Nick Kandola said: 'The incident of graffiti at the proposed school site is unfortunate. 'We would much rather things like this weren't happening and, as a Trust, we would prefer to focus on the more important questions of how we can best deliver a new school in this location and serving this community. 'We do not want to draw unnecessary attention to this incident. 'We want to address the more fundamental questions about improving local educational choice and bringing forward an excellent planning proposition.' Highlights:","output":"1.

They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \\"The law of 4; who is 67?\\" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days. Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist. In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case. During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns Daniels that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized.

Question: \\"Whose submarines, between the Germans and Soviets, were the Bermuda bases LATER used to look out for?\\"  Context: \\"Construction began in 1941 of two airbases consisting of 5.8 km2 (2.2 sq mi) of land, largely reclaimed from the sea. For many years, Bermuda's bases were used by US Air Force transport and refuelling aircraft and by US Navy aircraft patrolling the Atlantic for enemy submarines, first German and, later, Soviet. The principal installation, Kindley Air Force Base on the eastern coast, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated Naval Air Station Bermuda. As a naval air station, the base continued to host both transient and deployed USN and USAF aircraft, as well as transitioning or deployed Royal Air Force and Canadian Forces aircraft.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The Bermuda bases were later used to look out for Soviet submarines.  The construction of the airbases in Bermuda began in 1941, with the primary purpose of serving as strategic locations for the United States Air Force (USAF) and the United States Navy (USN) to monitor and patrol the Atlantic Ocean for enemy submarines. Initially, these bases were crucial in detecting and combating German U-boats during World War II. The predominant focus at the time was on intercepting German submarines, which posed significant threats to the Allied forces and their supply routes across the Atlantic. However, the role of these Bermuda bases changed with time, encompassing new objectives as global political scenarios shifted. After the end of World War II, the world entered into the Cold War era, marked by an intense rivalry between the United States and the Soviet Union. In response to this rising threat, the Bermuda bases were repurposed to monitor and counteract Soviet submarine activities in the Atlantic. The presence of Soviet submarines was a significant concern for the US and its allies, as these underwater vessels were crucial components of the Soviet Union's naval forces and could potentially be used for covert missions and nuclear attacks in the event of a conflict. During this time, the principal installation, Kindley Air Force Base, was transferred to the US Navy in 1970 and redesignated Naval Air Station Bermuda. This allowed for greater coordination between the USN and USAF, with both branches working together to patrol the Atlantic Ocean, detect Soviet submarines, and ensure the security of the United States and its allies. The Naval Air Station Bermuda also served as a crucial stopover point for not only US aircraft but also those belonging to the Royal Air Force (United Kingdom) and Canadian Forces, further emphasizing the importance of these Bermuda bases in allied collaboration. In conclusion, while the Bermuda bases were initially built and used for detecting German submarines during World War II, their role later evolved, and they were primarily used to look out for Soviet submarines during the Cold War era. The strategic importance of these bases in safeguarding interests of the United States and its allies in the Atlantic was evident throughout both time periods, highlighting their critical contribution to global security."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task, you will be given a list.

Desegregation in Birmingham took place slowly after the demonstrations. King and the SCLC were criticized by some for ending the campaign with promises that were too vague and \\"settling for a lot less than even moderate demands\\". In fact, Sydney Smyer, president of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, re-interpreted the terms of the agreement. Shuttlesworth and King had announced that desegregation would take place 90 days from May 15.  Smyer then said that a single black clerk hired 90 days from when the new city government took office would be sufficient. By July, most of the city's segregation ordinances had been overturned.  Some of the lunch counters in department stores complied with the new rules. City parks and golf courses were opened again to black and white citizens.  Mayor Boutwell appointed a biracial committee to discuss further changes.  However, no hiring of black clerks, police officers, and firefighters had yet been completed and the Birmingham Bar Association rejected membership by black attorneys.The reputation of Martin Luther King Jr. soared after the protests in Birmingham, and he was lauded by many as a hero. The SCLC was much in demand to effect change in many Southern cities. In the summer of 1963, King led the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom where he delivered his most famous speech, \\"I Have a Dream\\".

Eight members of the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew\\" were eventually convicted of the Oct. 1, 1984, killing. But lawyers say they might not have been if prosecutors had disclosed a key piece of evidence: Witnesses near the crime scene had reported seeing another man, James McMillan, reports the New York Times. McMillan was convicted of assaults on two women in the area around the same time, and later of a woman's murder in the same neighborhood. \\"He is the reason that you should have doubt about this prosecution's case,\\" a lawyer arguing for the convictions to be overturned told the Supreme Court on Wednesday, per the Washington Post. Lower courts have backed up the lead prosecutor's assertion that the McMillan sighting was irrelevant. The eight crew members—one died in prison, one was released, and six remain incarcerated—went on to be convicted based on testimony of witnesses characterized by Justice Elena Kagan as \\"a couple of really drug-addled people and a 14-year-old boy,\\" per the Guardian. Lawyers for the federal government say the outcome would have been the same even if prosecutors had disclosed the McMillan sighting, because police got crew members to confess. But Kagan suggested that another suspect might've prevented a \\"circular firing squad\\" of crew members accusing each other. \\"It would have been a completely different trial,\\" she said. A decision is expected in June.","output":"Title: A Miscarriage of Justice? Revisiting the 1984 Murder of Catherine Fuller Introduction In October 1984, the brutal murder of 49-year-old Catherine Fuller shocked the community of Washington, DC. Nearly four decades later, questions still surround the prosecution and conviction of eight members of the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew\\" for her killing. With new revelations about potential witness testimony and prosecutorial misconduct, the case has been brought to the Supreme Court, sparking a debate on the validity of the convictions and the possibility of a grave miscarriage of justice. The Catherine Fuller Case: Background On October 1, 1984, Catherine Fuller was found dead in a garage near Eighth and H streets in Washington, DC. She had been viciously beaten and sodomized with a metal pipe. The police identified eight members of a local gang, the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew,\\" as the perpetrators of the horrifying crime. After lengthy trials, all eight were convicted and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. However, in recent years, lawyers and civil rights advocates have argued that vital evidence pointing to another suspect, James McMillan, was withheld from the trial, potentially depriving the defendants of a fair trial. McMillan had been convicted of two assault charges in the area before Fuller's murder and was later convicted of another murder in the same neighborhood. The Suppressed Evidence: The McMillan Sighting During the initial investigation into Catherine Fuller's murder, witnesses reported seeing James McMillan near the crime scene. This crucial piece of information was never disclosed to the defense, leading many to question the integrity of the prosecution's case. Lawyers arguing for the convictions to be overturned assert that the undisclosed McMillan sighting is proof that reasonable doubt exists in the case. The Supreme Court Weighs In In a hearing before the Supreme Court, Justice Elena Kagan criticized the original trial's testimony from what she called \\"a couple of really drug-addled people and a 14-year-old boy.\\" Kagan went on to suggest that disclosing the McMillan sighting could have drastically changed the outcome of the trial. The government's lawyers countered by claiming that the presence of another suspect would not have changed the outcome because the \\"Eighth and H Street Crew\\" members implicated one another during police interrogations. However, Kagan argued that the crew members might not have accused each other in the face of another potential suspect. She said, \\"It would have been a completely different trial.\\" A decision on whether to overturn the convictions is expected in June. Conclusion The Catherine Fuller murder case raises important questions about the fairness and accuracy of the criminal justice system. Serious concerns about the suppression of critical evidence must be addressed to avoid further miscarriages of justice. The Supreme Court's decision in this case will have a significant impact on the lives of those convicted and the public's trust of the judiciary process as a whole. Ultimately, this case serves as a stark reminder of the need for transparency and accountability at all levels of the criminal justice system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant - Is trapped - Plant also takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment - The plant forms glucose - The plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere.  suppose There is no coal happens, how will it affect more sunlight is trapped by the plant molecules.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation is indirectly impacting a step of the process.  To understand this, let's break down the process and examine how the lack of coal affects it. 1. Sunlight strikes the chlorophyll molecules in the plant: The amount of sunlight reaching a plant's chlorophyll molecules is not directly influenced by the presence or absence of coal. Sunlight is primarily determined by geographic location, season, and time of day. However, the presence of coal-burning power plants can contribute to air pollution, which may reduce the amount of sunlight reaching plants. In this case, the absence of coal would lead to less air pollution and potentially more sunlight reaching the chlorophyll molecules. 2. Sunlight is trapped: The trapping of sunlight is an internal process in the plant and is not directly affected by the presence or absence of coal. 3. Plant takes in water and carbon dioxide from the environment: The lack of coal does not directly influence a plant's ability to uptake water and carbon dioxide. However, coal-burning power plants emit large amounts of carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. An increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere can result in changes to weather patterns and precipitation, which could indirectly affect the availability of water for plants. Additionally, higher carbon dioxide levels can stimulate plant growth and photosynthesis in certain conditions, indirectly affecting this step of the process. 4. Plant forms glucose: The formation of glucose within the plant is an internal process and is not directly affected by the presence or absence of coal. 5. Plant releases oxygen into the atmosphere: The release of oxygen is an internal process within the plant and is not directly influenced by the presence or absence of coal. However, as mentioned earlier, higher carbon dioxide levels resulting from coal combustion can stimulate plant growth and photosynthesis, potentially increasing the release of oxygen into the atmosphere. In summary, the absence of coal does not directly impact any specific step of the photosynthesis process. However, it can indirectly affect the availability of sunlight, as well as water and carbon dioxide uptake, through its impact on air pollution and climate change. These indirect effects may influence the functioning and efficiency of the photosynthesis process as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Route 66 gets extremely hot during the summer, and portions of the road may become unsafe during the winter. For the most pleasant driving conditions, schedule your trip between March and early June or between September and November. Oklahoma and Texas get a lot of tornados between late April and early June. If you travel during these times, make sure to keep an eye on local weather forecasts for any tornado warnings or watches. If you want to travel the entire 2,451 mi (3,945 km) road, you’ll need to start in either Chicago, Illinois or Santa Monica, California. This will allow you to get the full Route 66 experience while traveling across the country.  If you are travelling in the spring, begin in California and make your way to Illinois. If you are travelling the the fall, start in Illinois and work your way to California. This should provide the most ideal weather conditions. Depending on how often you stop and how many places you explore, a one-way road trip from Chicago to Santa Monica (or vice versa) will take anywhere from 2 to 4 weeks. As a general guideline, plan to travel between 70 and 90 mi (110 and 140 km) a day if you want to stop and see everything. If you only want to explore a portion of the classic highway, you can start in Missouri, the southeastern tip of Kansas, Oklahoma, the Texas panhandle, New Mexico, or Arizona. Choose a starting point based on its appeal or its proximity to your home.  Route 66 passes through a number of major cities including Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Amarillo, Flagstaff, Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Los Angeles. Once you know your starting point, decide where you want to end your trip and plug the information into an online mapping service. Then, use the service’s distance estimate to determine how many days it will take you to complete your journey. Due to the road’s size, a car or motorcycle is the best way to experience Route 66. You’ll get a great view of all the sights and can stay at hotels or motels along the way. In some places, you may even be able to camp out!  If you live in the United States, consider using your own vehicle for the trip. If you’re flying in from another country, or if your vehicle isn’t durable enough for the trip, you can rent a vehicle. If you only want to visit the major cities on Route 66, you can book a 14-day train trip. Though you can take a large vehicle like an RV, certain parts of the road may be difficult to drive on as the road is narrow and winding in some areas. You’ll also have a harder time finding parking and RV campgrounds. Route 66 houses a number of unique hotels and motels, such as the famous Magnolia Hotel in St. Louis and the themed Mayo Hotel in Tulsa. These places fill up fast, so make room reservations 2-3 months beforehand if at all possible.  For a full list of Route 66 hotels and motels, visit https://www.theroute-66.com/hotels.html. If you’re travelling by RV, find and reserve campgrounds ahead of time. You can also check out tent campgrounds if you’re travelling by car or motorcycle and want to sleep under the stars. If you aren’t planning on driving both ways, decide how you’d like to get home. You can take the train or bus, or even book a flight, though you’ll have to pay to ship your vehicle home if you choose not to rent one for the trip.  You may want to book a flight with free cancellation in case the trip takes more or less time than you anticipated. If you rent a vehicle to make the drive, choose a company that has a hub near the airport you plan to fly home from for your convenience. . Before your trip, break down how much you expect to spend on gas, lodging, food, entertainment, and miscellaneous items like souvenirs. For things with specific rates, like gas and lodging, look up current pricing information online. For anything else, create a rough estimate based on how much you normally spend during vacations.  For a 1-way trip from Chicago to Santa Monica or vice versa, expect to spend a minimum of 300 on gas, 1,700 on lodging, 600 per person on food, and 200 per person on entertainment. Boost your final budget by 10-20% to account for unintended expenses, price hikes, and emergencies. Don’t forget to include the cost of the return trip!","output":"The article explains how to plan a Route 66 trip, considering the best time to travel, starting and ending points, and budgeting for expenses like gas, lodging, food, and entertainment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He has been hospitalized in Kailahun, considered the epicenter of the outbreak.      His infection is the latest among health workers attempting to treat the infected and prevent further spread of the deadly virus. Sierra Leone's Awareness Times reported that on Tuesday, \\"four popular and dedicated health workers attached to Ebola center located inside Kenema Government Hospital have lost their lives ...\\"      The news site also reported that health workers at the Kenema Ebola Center \\"allege Ministry of Health & Sanitation is 'incapable' of protecting the staff.\\"      Sierra Leone's Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Brima Kargbo, agrees that more help is needed. \\"We have a limited capacity and our health workers are not well prepared,\\" telling the World Health Organization, \\"The external assistance is very much appreciated.\\"      Sierra Leone is among three West African nations most affected by the Ebola outbreak. Guinea and Liberia are also grappling with the deadly virus. Earlier this month, WHO established a coordination center in Guinea's capital, Conakry, to assist with resource mobilization to the infected areas.      As of July 19, WHO reported a total of 632 deaths and 1,048 cases from confirmed, probable and suspected Ebola in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.      The Ebola virus is spread by close contact and kills up to 90 percent of its victims. There is no known cure or antivirus. ||||| Health workers take blood samples for Ebola virus testing at a screening tent in the local government hospital in Kenema, Sierra Leone, June 30, 2014.

Khan, a Sierra Leonean virologist credited with treating more than 100 Ebola victims, has been transferred to a treatment ward run by...      FREETOWN The head doctor fighting an outbreak of the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone has himself caught the disease, one of a growing list of medical workers infected while battling to halt its spread across West Africa.      Ebola has killed 632 people across Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone since an outbreak began in February, putting strain on a string of weak health systems facing one of the world's deadliest diseases despite waves of international help.      In a sign of the growing frustrations with the failure of region's governments to tackle the outbreak, a Liberian whose brother died from the disease set fire to the Health Ministry in protest on Wednesday.      A statement from the president's office said 39-year-old Sheik Umar Khan, a Sierra Leonean virologist credited with treating more than 100 Ebola victims, had been transferred to a treatment ward run by medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres.      A source at the ward confirmed that the doctor was alive and receiving treatment, but gave no details of his condition.      Khan has been hailed a \\"national hero\\" by the Health Ministry for his efforts to lead the fight against an outbreak that has killed 206 people in the West African nation.      There is no cure or vaccine for Ebola, which can kill up to 90 percent of those infected, although the mortality rate of the current outbreak is around 60 percent.      It was not immediately clear how Khan had caught the virus. His colleagues told Reuters that he was always meticulous with protection, wearing overalls, mask, gloves and special footwear. Three days ago, three nurses working in the same Ebola treatment center alongside Khan died from the disease.      Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the World Health Organization, said around 100 health workers had been infected by Ebola in the three countries, with 50 of them dying.      \\"Personal protection equipment is very hot. But there is a very strict procedure how you wear it, how you take it off, what can be re-used or not,\\" he said.      Earlier this month, Samuel Muhumuza Mutoro, a senior Ugandan doctor working in Liberia died after treated infected patients.      \\"AFRAID FOR MY LIFE\\"      The latest WHO figures, released on Saturday, showed that there were 19 new deaths and 67 new cases within the four days since its previous statement.      The Ebola outbreak started in Guinea's remote southeast and has since spread across the region's poorly controlled borders. Symptoms of the highly infectious disease are diarrhea, vomiting and internal and external bleeding.      Part of Liberia's Health Ministry was destroyed on Wednesday when Monrovia resident Edward Deline set fire to the building in protest over the death of his 14-year-old brother from Ebola.      \\"The health (workers) here are not doing enough to fight this virus. They are taking this to be a money making thing while our people are dying,\\" Deline told journalists after he was arrested by police.      Local and international health workers face a combination of fear, suspicion and local traditions for burying the dead as they try to prevent Ebola spreading further. [ID:nL6N0PO12H]      During a Reuters visit to the Kenema treatment center in eastern Sierra Leone in late June, Khan said he had installed a mirror in his office, which he called his \\"policeman\\", to check for holes in his protective clothing before entering an isolation ward. Nevertheless, Khan said he feared Ebola. \\"I am afraid for my life, I must say, because I cherish my life,\\" he said in an interview, showing no signs of ill health at the time. \\"Health workers are prone to the disease because we are the first port of call for somebody who is sickened by disease. Even with the full protective clothing you put on, you are at risk.\\"      (Additional reporting by Clair MacDougall, Alphonso Toweh and David Lewis; Writing by David Lewis and Emma Farge; Editing by Daniel Flynn and Alison Williams) ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A doctor in Sierra Leone named Dr. Sheikh Umar Khan was helping sick people with a very bad virus called Ebola. Unfortunately, he also got the virus. Ebola is a dangerous sickness that spreads through close contact with other people. Many doctors are trying to help the sick people, but it is difficult because there is no medicine to cure Ebola.

The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What can damage trees? Answer:","output":"There are several factors that can damage trees, as mentioned in the passage. These include: 1. Broken limbs or roots: When a tree sustains damage to its limbs or roots, it can create an opening for decay to enter and potentially spread throughout the trunk. 2. Deep wounds from various sources: Deep wounds inflicted by fire, insects, or falling timber can also serve as an entry point for decay, which may then penetrate and weaken the tree. 3. Insect larvae: Many insects bore into trees to lay their eggs, creating tunnels that remain indefinitely within the tree's structure. These tunnels can serve as sources of weakness, contributing to the overall damage a tree may suffer over time. In summary, trees can be damaged by broken limbs or roots, deep wounds from fire, insects, or falling timber, and the tunnels created by insect larvae. These factors can compromise the tree's health and longevity, as decay can spread through the trunk once it has gained access to the tree's inner structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The first act of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere, who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo, demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand. The rest of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts. Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford and an escort of fifty mounted Basutos approach the camp. Lord Chelmsford then orders Durnford to return to his unit, bringing them to the camp immediately to reinforce Colonel Pulleine. Lt. Vereker should join Durnford as...

Analyze the first sentence: \\"Had a listen to the HDCD remaster of this so-called classic album. What garbage.\\" - The use of the word \\"so-called\\" indicates skepticism or disagreement with the characterization of the album as a classic, and \\"garbage\\" is a strongly negative term. 3. Analyze the comparison to other bands: \\"I'm a big fan of early FLoyd and Genesis so can appreciate conceptual albums, but they have something that TB is lacking...music.\\" - The reviewer acknowledges an appreciation for similar music styles but criticizes this album for lacking, in their opinion, the fundamental element, i.e., music. This is a negative comment. 4. Analyze the description of the album: \\"This is just an unconnected, often crude and grating, collection of seemingly disparate streams of music played on various high and low tech instruments.\\" - The words \\"unconnected,\\" \\"crude,\\" \\"grating,\\" and \\"disparate\\" all point towards a negative critique of the album. 5. Analyze the comment about the album being 'wacky': \\"Must have been 'wacky' at the time, but now is impossible for me to listen to!\\" - The reviewer implies that the album may have been considered innovative or avant-garde at some point, but they now find it unlistenable. This is another negative point. Considering these points, the review is negative.

Sadly, my experience has been nothing short of disappointing, prompting me to rate it a mere 1 star. To begin with, the user interface is far from friendly. The navigation is convoluted and confusing. It's hard to even locate games and when I do, the app often crashes unexpectedly. I have even restarted my device many times in hopes of resolving this to no avail, making the app virtually unusable. Moreover, the compatibility of this app leaves a lot to be desired. Despite claiming support for most games, I found several of my favorite ones not working. The graphics and sound lag significantly - sparks of nostalgia were swapped with moments of frustration because of the continuous frame drops and sound distortions. Another downside is the lack of adequate customer support. On reaching out, my queries and concerns were met with radio silence. A little guidance could have potentially resolved my issues, but it seems this was too much to ask for. In addition, the app often serves too many intrusive ads, which significantly disrupts the gaming experience. I understand the necessity of ads for free apps, but the frequency and disruptive nature of these ads are unjustifiable. Last but not the least, the overall performance of the app is extremely poor. The sluggishness, frequent crashes, and persistent bugs render the app frustrating to navigate and use. In summary, the com.reicast.emulator app was a letdown. I was hoping for a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience, but all I received was a nightmare of bugs, crashes, and frustration. I hope the developers take this feedback into consideration and drastically improve the app's functionality and user interface.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that veteran diplomat Sung Kim is leading the U.S. delegation in a working group meeting Monday at the city-state's Ritz Carlton hotel. The North Korea side is being led by Vice Foreign Minister Choe Son-hui. Monday's meeting is apparently aimed at narrowing the gap between the U.S. and North Korea over the demand for North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. President Trump expressed confidence about his meeting upon his arrival in Singapore Sunday, telling reporters after stepping down from Air Force One that he his feeling \\"very good\\" about Tuesday's summit. Ahead of his arrival, Trump acknowledged he is heading into “unknown territory” for the meeting Tuesday. In response to a question from VOA News just before heading to Asia from the Group of Seven summit in Canada, Trump said “I really feel confident” about the unprecedented encounter between a sitting American president and a member of the family dynasty which has maintained iron-fist control over one of the world’s most reclusive countries for three generations. Trump added that he believes Kim, half the age of the American president, “wants to do something great for his people.” But Trump cautioned that Kim “won’t have that opportunity again” if the talks do not go well -- describing this opportunity for diplomacy with the United States as a “one-time shot.” Trump and others in his government have said advancement has been made on obtaining a commitment from Kim to give up all his nuclear weapons and long-range ballistic missiles. Progress could lead to a peace treaty and formally end a state of war on the Korean peninsula, which has persisted for nearly 70 years.

However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary. In February 2014, another new U2 song, the single \\"Invisible\\", debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS. Bono called the track a \\"sneak preview\\" of their pending record.On 9 September 2014, U2 announced their thirteenth studio album, Songs of Innocence, at an Apple product launch event, and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost. The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called \\"the largest album release of all time.\\" Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five-week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent US100 million on a promotional campaign.

Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Bretton Woods system. Yes or no? Answer: This action, referred to as the Nixon shock , created the situation in which the United States dollar became a reserve currency used by many states. Question: What are the fundamentals of Bretton Woods system for fixed exchange rates Answer:","output":"The Bretton Woods system, established in 1944, was designed to regulate international monetary relations and stabilize exchange rates after World War II. It was a major accomplishment in international economic policy that helped promote global trade and investment. The basic fundamentals of the Bretton Woods system for fixed exchange rates are as follows: 1. Fixed exchange rates: One of the key features of the Bretton Woods system was that exchange rates were fixed, rather than allowed to float freely. Each participating country committed to maintaining its currency within a narrow band, typically within 1% of the agreed-upon exchange rate. This helped to create currency stability, reduce exchange rate risk, and facilitate international trade and investment. 2. US dollar as a reserve currency: The United States dollar (USD) was chosen to be the central reserve currency, and it was pegged to gold at a fixed price of 35 per ounce. Other currencies' values were pegged to the US dollar hence their value was indirectly linked to gold. This in turn created a strong link between the US dollar and gold, which helped to foster global confidence in the US dollar as a stable reserve currency. 3. International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank: The Bretton Woods conference led to the creation of two major international organizations - the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The IMF was responsible for managing the system and ensuring exchange rate stability, while the World Bank aimed to promote economic development and reduce poverty through financial and technical assistance. 4. Convertibility and capital controls: Under the Bretton Woods system, countries agreed to make their currencies convertible into other currencies on demand for current account transactions. However, member countries were allowed to implement capital controls to regulate the movement of financial capital, such as investments, to limit speculative capital flows and maintain financial stability. 5. Adjustments and intervention mechanisms: Member countries were required to intervene in currency markets to maintain fixed exchange rates, usually by buying or selling their own currency. However, if a country faced persistent balance of payments deficits or surpluses, they could request permission from the IMF to adjust their exchange rate to correct the imbalance. The Bretton Woods system eventually collapsed in 1971 when President Nixon announced the suspension of the US dollar's convertibility into gold, known as the Nixon Shock. This led to the abandonment of fixed exchange rates and the adoption of floating exchange rates as countries sought alternative ways to manage their currencies and stabilize their economies. However, the system played an important role in shaping global economic policies over the more than two decades it endured and laid the foundation for organizations like the IMF and World Bank that still exist today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This club has been around for SO long.  I think this may have been one of the first clubs I ever went to when I started making monthly trips to Vegas.  As there were about 20 of us girls in the Bachelorette party, we were looking to find a place that wouldn't make us wait in some massive line, wouldn't charge us cover, and also had an open bar.  We were first in line to enter Pure.  The bouncers were super friendly (not always the case at clubs in Vegas) and we got our wristbands in no time.  They had an open bar (for ladies) until midnight, so we went on in and enjoyed our free drinks.  The dance floor was empty, so we danced away until there was no more room to dance.  I headed up stairs and went to check out the outdoor VIP areas.  The view is pretty fancy, and they had a roped off area for people with tables.  I walked in there and took some pictures of us with the strip in the background.  Then, we made friends with one of the bouncers in the area who was again, REALLY nice.  I made my way down the stairs back into the club area of Pure.  But first, I insisted on can-canning down each step.  So of course, there was quite a line of grumpy people behind me.  I was so happily buzzed off my free drinks, that I was legitimately can-canning down the stairs.  I highly recommend that everyone try to do this as well.  My friends and I had a great time partying it up at Pure and were ready to head over to Tryst, which was our final stop for the night. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively?

What are some careers that I can transition to that allow for remote/flexible work with active, athletic nature lovers? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"The answer to these two questions is not the same, as they pertain to different career aspirations, backgrounds, and personal preferences. I will provide separate detailed answers for each question. 1. Joining the Punjab Regiment: The Punjab Regiment is one of the oldest and largest regiments in the Indian Army. To join the Punjab Regiment, follow these steps: a. Check age and educational qualifications: The age and education requirements vary based on the role you aim to pursue. Generally, a candidate should have completed a minimum of 10+2 education for a soldier position and have a bachelor's degree for officer roles. b. Choose the desired entry: There are several entry schemes for joining the Indian Army, such as the National Defence Academy (NDA), Combined Defence Services (CDS), Technical Graduate Course (TGC), and Short Service Commission (SSC) among others. Each entry has its eligibility criteria, so choose the one that suits your qualifications and preferences. c. Prepare for exams and interviews: For the chosen entry, you will need to prepare for a written exam, followed by a personal interview. Start preparing early to increase your chances of success. d. Physical fitness and medical tests: The Indian Army has strict physical requirements. Make sure you regularly exercise to maintain your health and fitness. You will also need to pass a medical examination to be eligible for selection. e. Clear the Service Selection Board (SSB) interview: After clearing the written examination, you will be called for the SSB interview. It is a five-day process that tests your intelligence, personality, ability to work under pressure, and teamwork skills. f. Merit list and training: Once you clear the SSB interview, you will be ranked in the merit list. If selected, you will undergo training at the respective regimental center. In this case, you will be trained at the Punjab Regimental Centre. 2. Careers for unfulfilled pharma professionals seeking remote, flexible work with active, athletic pursuits: Considering your background in biomedical science and corporate experience, you could consider the following career options that offer remote and flexible work opportunities while allowing you to enjoy an active, athletic lifestyle: a. Medical writing or consulting: Leverage your background and knowledge in biomedical science to create content for pharmaceutical companies, medical publications, or research organizations. Alternatively, you could also offer consulting services on issues related to biomedical science and the pharma industry. b. Health and wellness coaching: With your knowledge and experience in biomedical sciences, you could create a career in coaching clients on health, nutrition, and wellness. This can be done virtually or in-person, providing active engagement and flexible working hours. c. Outdoor adventure guiding: Combine your love for the outdoors and athletics with your expertise in health by leading guided hikes, treks, or cycling excursions. d. Remote clinical research associate or scientist: Many pharmaceutical and biotech companies offer remote or partially remote work options for clinical research associates or scientists. In such roles, you can contribute to research and development projects while enjoying a more flexible work schedule. e. Teaching or training in the biomedical field: With your advanced degree and industry experience, you can teach courses at academic institutions or provide employee training for pharmaceutical companies. Online teaching and remote training opportunities are increasingly popular and can provide a more flexible lifestyle.

He welcomes a decision by Britain to pull out nearly 4,000 troops next year. David Cameron said UK troop numbers would fall to about 5,200 by the end of 2013. U.S. troops make up the bulk of NATO-led forces in Afghanistan.","output":"Title: Afghan Forces Ready to Protect Their Country and British Troops' Journey Home Once upon a time in a faraway land called Afghanistan, there lived a President named Hamid Karzai. He was in charge of all the people and the country, just like your school principal, but for the whole nation! President Karzai was working to make Afghanistan a safe and happy place for everyone. For many years, soldiers from different countries came to Afghanistan to help keep the people safe. Among those soldiers, there were British soldiers, who came all the way from the United Kingdom, and American soldiers, who came from the United States. They were part of a big team called NATO. These soldiers worked together with the Afghan forces to make the country peaceful. In the beginning of our story, President Karzai made a very important announcement. He said that the Afghan forces were now strong enough to protect their country and its people. This was very exciting news because it meant that Afghanistan was becoming safer by the day. When President Karzai shared this news with everyone, the leader of the United Kingdom, David Cameron, decided that it was time to bring some of his soldiers back home. He said that almost 4,000 British soldiers will go back to the United Kingdom next year, and only about 5,200 will stay in Afghanistan until the end of 2013. This made the British soldiers very happy because they missed their families and friends back home. As for the American soldiers, who made up the biggest portion of NATO's protective force, they were still going to stay in Afghanistan for some more time. President Karzai appreciated their help and was glad to have his Afghan forces work alongside them in keeping the country safe. So, dear little ones, this story tells us about how the Afghan forces became strong enough to protect their own country, which led to some of the British soldiers returning to their loved ones in the United Kingdom. Thanks to teamwork and everyone's efforts, Afghanistan is becoming a better place, and we hope it continues to grow stronger and safer for everyone living there."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jessica was surprised at her termination. (2). Rebecca was surprised at her termination.","output":"(1). Jessica was surprised at her termination. Jessica sat at her desk, scrolling through yet another report destined for her superiors. Her focus never wavered, her determination only growing stronger - after all, she had deadlines to meet and a reputation to uphold. She was known as the most reliable employee in the office. She’d always take on extra work, staying late to get it done. But Jessica also knew her limits. She wasn't one to let others down. She prided herself on her impeccable organizational skills and her ability to manage several tasks at once. Rebecca, on the other hand, seemed to be the polar opposite. Her workspace was always cluttered with Post-its, loose papers, and half-empty coffee cups. Procrastination seemed to be her modus operandi, leaving work to pile up until the last minute. She was never concerned about deadlines and viewed the strict schedules as guidelines rather than firm times. Jessica often wondered how Rebecca managed to keep her job, with her constant tardiness and apparent disregard for authority. Their boss, Mr. Thompson, seemed to tolerate Rebecca's inefficiencies without any decisive action. Jessica assumed he had a soft spot for Rebecca—a unprofessional weakness. But that all changed one fateful morning when Jessica arrived early to the office, as she always did. As she settled at her spotless desk, brewing coffee and booting up her computer, she noticed Mr. Thompson approaching. He looked more serious than Jessica had ever seen him. He quietly asked her to join him in his office. The words reverberated through her ears like a thousand chaotic echoes, each one heavier than the last. \\"Jessica, I'm sorry, but we have to let you go.\\" Her eyes widened in shock, and her heart dropped to her stomach. It was words she did not expect nor comprehend. It was her, Jessica, who was being terminated, and not Rebecca as she'd long assumed would be the case. Her usually steady and composed voice trembled as she asked for an explanation. Was it due to a couple of missed deadlines? A poorly executed project? Mr. Thompson, with a pained look in his eyes, explained that it had nothing to do with her performance. He admired her work ethic, punctuality, and attention to detail. Unfortunately, the company was undergoing budget cuts, and they had to make some difficult decisions, he said. They had to downsize. As Jessica grappled with the reality of her situation, she couldn't help but feel a sense of injustice. Why was she, the diligent and hardworking employee, the one being let go, while Rebecca, despite her lack of discipline, was allowed to stay? Was there any fairness left in the world? Overwhelmed with emotions and with tears welling up in her eyes, Jessica packed up her belongings from her pristine desk and left the building for the last time. Out in the world now, she felt a fire ignite within her—a determination more potent than she'd ever known. She would prove them all wrong. This setback was only a stepping-stone towards something bigger and greater. Jessica decided to embrace her future with open arms, ready to face new challenges and victories. And one day, she'd look back on this moment with a bittersweet smile, thinking of how much she'd grown and the person she'd become.

After a few questions, the doctor discovers that Robert has been infected with HIV for many years, while Justin's infection is quite recent.  and a hint : As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS. There also is no vaccine to immunize people against HIV infection, but scientists are working to develop one.  Please answer this question : Who will develop infections more frequently? A:","output":"A: Based on the information provided, Robert is likely to develop infections more frequently. Since he has been infected with HIV for many years, the number of helper T cells in his body has likely declined over time, weakening his immune system.

On his way home, Shaun comes across a gang of young skinheads led by Woody, who feels sympathy for Shaun and invites him to join the group. They accept Shaun as a member, and he finds a big brother in Woody, while developing a romance with Smell, an older girl who dresses in a new wave style. Combo, an older skinhead, returns to the group after a prison sentence, accompanied by a knife-wielding moustachioed man called Banjo. A charismatic but unstable individual with sociopathic tendencies, Combo expresses English nationalist and racist views, and attempts to enforce his leadership over the other skinheads. This leads the group to split, with young Shaun, the belligerent Pukey, and Gadget, who feels bullied by Woody for his weight, choosing Combo over Woody's apolitical gang. Shaun finds a mentor figure in Combo, who in turn is impressed by and identifies with Shaun. Shaun goes with Combo's group to a white nationalist meeting. After Pukey expresses doubt over their racist and nationalistic politics, Combo throws him out of the group and sends him back to Woody.

Review: does such a good job of it  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence appears to be positive. The phrase \\"does such a good job of it\\" indicates that the reviewer believes the movie performs well in the aspect being discussed. The use of \\"good job\\" reinforces that a favorable opinion is being expressed. However, without knowing the full context of the review or the specific aspect of the movie being mentioned, it is impossible to understand the overall opinion of the movie or the extent of the reviewer’s satisfaction.

I haven't been to this place in a year.  There's a reason.  When Moira first opened, I waited a few weeks then went down there to check it out.  The sushi wasn't bad.  It was actually okay.   The reason I think it was even okay was because, like many others... I WANT to like it.  I've lived downtown for 15+ years and we're starving for an outstanding sushi spot... okay... even a \\"decent\\" sushi spot.  It didn't happen with Moira.  The first few times I went there... the food wasn't too shabby... but then... OOPS... not so good.  I've now gone there a couple of times and received FOUL sushi.  I'm not joking.  The icing on the cake was the last time my bf and I went there and the tuna sashimi was served to us in a VERY LARGE portion.  We were both excited... at first.  Then quickly realized that the fish was definitely past its expiration.  UGH... the smell was SO BAD.  When we alerted the server of this they told us that they'd see if they could take it off the bill.  Uh... we were NOT about to pay for this foul smelling tuna.  I mean who in their right mind would eat this?  In the end, they agreed to not have us pay for that dish.  What I thought was pretty screwed up was that they served this to us thinking that we were idiots and some stinky tuna would just fly under the radar.  NOPE!  Btw, the above experience isn't the only one.  I had a previously bad experience on NYE 2 years ago... and should have not gone back... but I chalked it up as one bad incident and thought I'd be open minded, since I really wanted to like it.  The only thing I could say positively about the place was that the sake menu was pretty good.  But to be honest with you... great sake is only a few steps away at Sens... along with some really tasty eats.  I truly want to have a great sushi place downtown here... why can't we get it?

The Hull Truck theatre, which got £1.5m, was among the main recipients. Northern Ballet, the Cambridge Junction and the National Youth Theatre have all received at least £680,000 since 2011. However, Arts Council England has not named the most recent beneficiaries because of \\"commercial sensitivity\\". Many arts organisations have struggled in recent years from a combination of government and local council cuts, a tough climate for private sponsorship and squeezed household budgets. Arts Council England's system of emergency \\"financial intervention\\" is intended for organisations that receive annual funding but which have run into trouble. To receive financial intervention, the criteria say venues will be \\"assessed as high risk\\" and \\"at immediate and serious financial risk\\". The Arts Council steps in where it believes an organisation is \\"irreplaceable\\", where other forms of support have failed and where it is confident the cash injection will turn the situation around. From Arts Council England financial intervention grants issued April 2011-March 2013, except Hull Truck (April 2011-March 2014) The £14m has been paid to 55 theatre, art, music, dance and literature organisations over the past three financial years. The Arts Council has named the cultural venues and producers that received such funds in 2011/12 and 2012/13. But 12 of the 13 beneficiaries in 2013/14 have not been identified because it could \\"prejudice the commercial interests of the organisations concerned\\". The only recipient to have been named from the most recent financial year was Hull's Truck theatre. It received a £300,000 grant in February 2014, a city council document recently revealed. That was one of seven such emergency Arts Council grants given to the Hull theatre since March 2011, totalling £1.505m. The venue got into financial trouble after moving to a new £15m building in 2009 and after long-serving artistic director John Godber departed the following year. Hull is due to be UK City of Culture in 2017. Hull Truck's executive director Janthi Mills-Ward said: \\"Being the second-lowest funded producing theatre in the Arts Council's National Portfolio, alongside a difficult economic climate, it has been necessary to secure additional support.\\" The extra funding has ensured \\"ongoing financial resilience to produce the very best work,\\" she said. Recent concerns about funding outside the capital are reflected by the fact that several of the biggest bail-outs have gone to organisations outside London. Other large grants include £750,000 to Northern Ballet in 2012 to cover increased running costs at its new £12m home in Leeds, which it shares with Phoenix Dance Theatre and which opened in 2010. Northern Ballet chief executive Mark Skipper said the grant gave the company \\"the breathing space we needed to make the transition to running a major new building\\" and that the company had also increased its ticket sales and other forms of fundraising. The Cambridge Junction, which stages gigs, comedy, plays and club nights, received £700,000 in 2011. Its director Daniel Brine explained that it had faced \\"a period of financial instability\\" that year. \\"This was a result of some long-standing financial weaknesses coupled with a shift in trading at the time of the global financial crisis,\\" he said. A new business model has made the venue \\"stronger and more financially resilient\\" he added. The London-based National Youth Theatre of Great Britain got two grants totalling £680,000 in 2012 to deal with \\"major issues\\" with its finances, according to chief executive Paul Roseby. It achieved \\"a rapid return to financial and organisational health\\" after a restructure of its management and an increase in private funding, he said. Two grants totalling £510,000 went to Northampton's Royal & Derngate theatre in 2012 and 2013. The venue's chief executive Martin Sutherland said the recession had hit ticket sales and \\"had a very direct impact on our overall financial stability\\". \\"We have moved on significantly from that point in time, having evaluated how to make ourselves more resilient to economic change and position the organisation better in case of any future economic downturn,\\" he explained. Meanwhile, the Bluecoat gallery in Liverpool required £500,000 in 2011 to resolve \\"a number of unforeseen structural problems\\" after a £14m redevelopment, according to chief executive Mary Cloake, who added that the venue's future was now \\"looking better than ever\\". Arts Council England's deputy chief executive Althea Efunshile said the body supported \\"bold, innovative arts and culture\\". She continued: \\"With innovation comes risk and many arts organisations are operating on very small margins in a challenging economic environment. A grant of this nature indicates our belief in the future of the organisation and their ability to deliver on their artistic aims.\\" Arts Council England currently distributes annual government funding totalling £341m to 696 venues and producers. On 1 July, it is due to announce who will receive regular funding from 2015-18. Output:","output":"Arts Council England has provided £14m in emergency funding to 55 arts organizations facing financial difficulties over the past three years, supporting venues like Hull Truck Theatre, Northern Ballet, and the Cambridge Junction amidst government and local council cuts and challenging economic conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He grows up in a patriotic and Catholic household, instilling within him a strong sense of pride in his country and his religion. As a teenager, and a top member of his high school's wrestling team, he proves himself physically fit and athletic, as well as an academically exceptional student. When local Marine recruiting NCOs visit his school and give Ron and his fellow seniors an impassioned lecture about the Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom, because he is unable to get a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.The story then jumps to Kovic's second Vietnam tour in 1968. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a village of Vietnamese citizens, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, Wilson, who ends up in the line of fire between sides. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsman present who try to save him, Wilson dies from his wounds. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer (XO), who merely tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his XO.The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol on January 20. During a firefight, Kovic is critically wounded, shot in the ankle and through the chest, smashing his spine. He lays trapped in a field facing sure death, until a fellow Marine rescues him. Paralyzed from the mid-chest down, he spends several months recovering at the Bronx Veterans Administration hospital. The living conditions in the hospital are deplorable; rats crawl freely on the floors, the staff is generally apathetic to their patients' needs, doctors visit the patients infrequently, drug use is rampant, and equipment is too old and ill-maintained to be...

The sketch was titled \\"Harry Potter and the Secret Chamberpot of Azerbaijan\\" and was a part of the events and activities held during the annual Red Nose Day, which is organized by the charity Comic Relief. In this sketch, Dawn French donned a Harry Potter-esque costume, complete with glasses and scarf, and portrayed a humorous version of Harry as he navigated a mysterious and magical scenario. The sketch also featured other popular British comedians and actors, such as Jennifer Saunders, playing the roles of Hagrid, Professor McGonagall, and other Hogwarts characters. The goal of the sketch was to entertain audiences while raising awareness and funds for the Comic Relief charity, which strives to create a just world free from poverty. The Red Nose Day event has grown over the years to become a major fundraiser across the United Kingdom, with comedians, actors, musicians, and other public figures contributing through various forms of performance and donations. It's important to mention that Dawn French's portrayal of Harry Potter is not canon in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series or film adaptation.

Court sides with employee fired for smoking pot at work HARTFORD, Conn. — A Connecticut state worker fired after he was caught smoking marijuana on the job was punished too harshly and should get his job back, the state Supreme Court ruled Friday. Gregory Linhoff was fired from his maintenance job at the University of Connecticut Health Center in Farmington in 2012 after a police officer caught him smoking pot in a state-owned vehicle. He had no previous disciplinary problems since being hired in 1998 and had received favorable job evaluations, according to his union. He was arrested, but the charges were later dismissed. State officials said firing the New Hartford resident was the only appropriate penalty for his conduct and not doing so would send a bad message to other employees. An arbitrator disagreed and overturned the firing, saying Linhoff instead should be suspended without pay for six months and be subject to random drug testing for a year after he returned to work. The state appealed and a Superior Court judge overturned the arbitrator’s decision on the grounds that it violated Connecticut’s public policy against marijuana use. Linhoff’s union, the Connecticut Employees Union Independent SEIU, appealed the judge’s ruling to the Supreme Court. All seven justices agreed that the lower court judge was wrong to overturn the arbitrator’s ruling, saying that while state policy on drug use in the work place allows for firing workers it does not require it. Justices also said that judicial second-guessing of arbitration awards is uncommon and should be reserved only for extraordinary circumstances. “The misconduct at issue was completely unacceptable, and we do not condone it,” Chief Justice Chase T. Rogers wrote in the decision. “By the arbitrator’s estimation, (Linhoff’s) personal qualities and overall record indicate that he is a good candidate for a second chance,” Rogers wrote. “Moreover, the discipline the arbitrator imposed was appropriately severe, and sends a message to others who might consider committing similar misconduct that painful consequences will result.” Linhoff couldn’t be reached for comment Friday. A phone number for him could not be found. His attorney, Barbara Collins, and officials with the state Attorney General’s Office did not immediately return messages. At the time Linhoff was fired, he was seeking treatment for depression, stress and anxiety because his wife had filed for divorce and he had a cancer scare; he believed smoking pot helped to alleviate his worries, Collins has said. Collins wrote in court documents that Linhoff’s conduct was not so egregious that he should be denied a second chance. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that a state worker, who was fired after being caught smoking marijuana on the job, should get his job back, stating that the firing was too harsh and a six-month suspension without pay and random drug testing would be more appropriate.

Information:  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - A saint, also historically known as a hallow, is a term used for a person who is recognized as having an exceptional degree of holiness or likeness to God. Depending on the context and denomination, the term also retains its original Christian meaning, as any believer who is \\"in Christ\\" and in whom Christ dwells, whether in Heaven or on Earth. In Anglican, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Lutheran, and Oriental Orthodox doctrine, all of their faithful deceased in Heaven are considered to be saints, but some are considered worthy of greater honor or emulation; official ecclesiastical recognition, and consequently veneration, is given to some saints through the process of canonization in the Catholic Church or glorification in the Eastern Orthodox Church.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - The London Borough of Bromley is one of the 32 London Boroughs (plus the City) which make up Greater London. The London Borough of Bromley is south of the River Thames which flows through London, the capital city of the United Kingdom. Bromley is the principal town in the London Borough of Bromley. The local authority is Bromley London Borough Council.  - Folklore is the body of expressive culture shared by a particular group of people; it encompasses the traditions common to that culture, subculture or group. These include oral traditions such as tales, proverbs and jokes. They include material culture, ranging from traditional building styles to handmade toys common to the group. Folklore also includes customary lore, the forms and rituals of celebrations like Christmas and weddings, folk dances and initiation rites. Each one of these, either singly or in combination, is considered a folklore artifact. Just as essential as the form, folklore also encompasses the transmission of these artifacts from one region to another or from one generation to the next. For folklore is not taught in a formal school curriculum or studied in the fine arts. Instead these traditions are passed along informally from one individual to another either through verbal instruction or demonstration. The academic study of folklore is called folkloristics.  - A legend is a narrative of human actions that are perceived both by teller and listeners to take place within human history and demonstrating human values, and which possesses certain qualities that give the tale verisimilitude. Legend, for its active and passive participants, includes no happenings that are outside the realm of \\"possibility\\", but may include miracles. Legends may be transformed over time, in order to keep them fresh and vital, and realistic. Many legends operate within the realm of uncertainty, never being entirely believed by the participants, but also never being resolutely doubted.  - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication.

It was historically a market town chartered since 1158 and an ancient parish in the county of Kent. Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development, and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commerce and retail. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903. It has developed into one of a handful of regionally significant commercial and retail districts outside central London and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. Most of Bromley including the town centre falls under the BR1 postcode district, whereas areas to the west towards Shortlands are part of BR2 instead.  - A holy well or sacred spring is a spring or other small body of water revered either in a Pagan or Christian context, often both. Holy wells were frequently pagan sacred sites that later became Christianized. The term \\"holy well\\" is commonly employed to refer to any water source of limited size (i.e. not a lake or river, but including pools and natural springs and seeps), which has some significance in the folklore of the area where it is located, whether in the form of a particular name, an associated legend, the attribution of healing qualities to the water through the numinous presence of its guardian spirit or Christian saint, or a ceremony or ritual centred on the well site. In Christian legend, the water is often said to have been made to flow by the action of a saint, a familiar theme especially in the hagiography of Celtic saints.  - Kent is a county in South East England and one of the home counties. It borders Greater London to the north west, Surrey to the west, East Sussex to the south west, and Essex across the Thames Estuary to the north. The county town is Maidstone.   - Shortlands is a suburban village in the London Borough of Bromley, Greater London, England.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - A ritual \\"is a sequence of activities involving gestures, words, and objects, performed in a sequestered place, and performed according to set sequence.\\" Rituals may be prescribed by the traditions of a community, including a religious community. Rituals are characterized but not defined by formalism, traditionalism, invariance, rule-governance, sacral symbolism, and performance.  - St Blaise 's Well is a holy well located in the grounds of the old Bishop 's Palace ( residence of Bishops of the see of Rochester until 1845 ) , now part of Bromley Civic Centre . in Bromley , Kent .  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom.

Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: I'm Rich Kleinfeldt with some financial expressions used in business and the stock market. Our first expression is \\"in the red.\\"  It is another way of saying that a business is losing money. In the past, numbers in the financial records of a company were written in red ink to show a loss.    A business magazine recently published a report about a television company. The report said the company was still in the red, but was able to cut its loss from the year before.    A profit by a business is written in black numbers. So a company that is \\"in the black\\" is making money.      Another financial expression is \\"run on the bank.\\" That is what happens when many people try to withdraw all their money from a bank. A \\"run on the bank\\" usually happens when people believe there is danger a bank may fail or close.    Newspaper reports about a banking crisis in Russia used that expression. They said the government acted because of fears that the crisis would cause a run on the banks.      \\"Day trading\\" is a system that lets investors trade directly on an electronic market system. It was the first completely computerized stock market. It sells stocks of companies not listed on any stock exchange. Many high technology companies are listed on it.    Day trading companies provide a desk and a computer system to an investor who wants to trade. Individuals must provide fifty thousand dollars or more to the trading company to pay for the stocks they buy. Thousands of other investors do day trading from computers in their homes. A day trader watches stock prices carefully. When he sees a stock rise in price, he uses the computer to buy shares of the stock. If the stock continues to rise in price in the next few minutes, the day trader sells the shares quickly to make a small profit. Then he looks for another stock to buy. If a stock goes down instead of up, he sells it and accepts the loss.    The idea is to make a small profit many times during the day. Day traders may buy and sell stocks hundreds of times each day.

The employees, all with 18 or more years of experience, refused to work believing the lives of the passengers and crew were in danger, Reuters reports. The flight was delayed and soon cancelled. The employees were fired for insubordination, according to the complaint.

Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.Future space missions carrying dogs would be designed to be recovered. Four other dogs died in Soviet space missions: Bars and Lisichka were killed when their R-7 rocket exploded shortly after launch on 28 July 1960; Pchyolka and Mushka died when Korabl-Sputnik 3 was purposely destroyed with an explosive charge to prevent foreign powers from inspecting the capsule after a wayward atmospheric reentry trajectory on 1 December 1960.Although never shown, Laika is prominently mentioned in the 1985 film My Life as a Dog, in which the main character (a young Swedish boy in the late 1950s) identifies strongly with the dog.

Sentence:","output":"The data provided offers specific information regarding Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, which is a significant international airport located in the Netherlands. Focusing on two main aspects, the details highlight information about the surface type of the airport's fifth runway and its elevation above sea level. Firstly, it is mentioned that the 5th runway surface at Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is made of \\"Asphalt.\\" Asphalt is a common type of material used in the construction of airport runways. It is derived from petroleum byproducts and is favored for its durability, flexibility, and ability to withstand the heavy load and impact of landing aircraft. Additionally, asphalt offers a high level of skid resistance, ensuring the safety of airplanes during landing and take-off. Secondly, the data specifies that the elevation above the sea level for Amsterdam Airport Schiphol is -3.3528. This negative number indicates that the airport is located below sea level. Being situated below sea level poses unique challenges for the airport's engineering design, drainage, and flood prevention measures. As the Netherlands is known for its low elevation and extensive system of dikes and water control structures, the airport has been designed in a manner that addresses these challenges and allows for the safe and efficient facilitation of air travel. In conclusion, the data provided offers an insightful look into the structural components of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, namely the surface type of its fifth runway and its elevation relative to sea level.

I have a new situation: Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.  But I can use this background: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Answer:","output":"Andy didn't take a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. This is because he was careless and didn't go to the doctor, while Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, which is likely a statin that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So, let's move the 46 to the other side of the equation by doing the opposite (subtracting 46).  -2 * r = -24 - 46 That gives us the new equation: -2 * r = -70 Now, to find r, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -2: r = -70 / -2 After dividing, we find that: r = 35 So the solution to the math problem is r = 35.

Mega Millions officials say no tickets matched all six numbers to claim the estimated 667 million grand prize in Tuesday night's drawing. The numbers were 3, 45, 49, 61, 69 and Mega Ball 9.      The next drawing will be Friday. The estimated jackpot for that drawing would be the second-largest lottery prize in U.S. history.      The record lottery jackpot was a 1.6 billion Powerball prize won in January 2016.      The jackpot has been growing since July, when a group of California office workers won 543 million.      It costs 2 to play the game, but the odds of winning the jackpot aren't good. The chance of matching all six numbers and taking home the grand prize is one in 302.5 million.

(SJD) I recently took the kids to see a performance by Jim Dale, the longtime British stage actor (he won a Tony for Barnum) who is best known these days as the wildly entertaining reader of the Harry Potter books on tape. He was reading an adaptation of a Eudora Welty story called “The Shoe Bird,” which he recently recorded with the Seattle Symphony. (It was wonderful, and I encourage you to give it a listen.) Afterward, Dale took questions from the audience — which, predictably, were about the Harry Potter series. Items of interest that emerged: Dale was given only 100 pages of manuscript at a time to read and then record, so he never knew what was coming; and in order to keep track of the 146 voices he’d created for all the characters, he often pre-recorded a bit of the characters’ voices and then held a tape recorder up to his ear in the studio to remind himself.

While this process moved along, diplomacy continued its rounds. Direct pressure on the Taliban had proved unsuccessful. As one NSC staff note put it, \\"Under the Taliban, Afghanistan is not so much a state sponsor of terrorism as it is a state sponsored by terrorists.\\" In early 2000, the United States began a high-level effort to persuade Pakistan to use its influence over the Taliban. In January 2000, Assistant Secretary of State Karl Inderfurth and the State Department's counterterrorism coordinator, Michael Sheehan, met with General Musharraf in Islamabad, dangling before him the possibility of a presidential visit in March as a reward for Pakistani cooperation. Such a visit was coveted by Musharraf, partly as a sign of his government's legitimacy. He told the two envoys that he would meet with Mullah Omar and press him on  Bin Laden. They left, however, reporting to Washington that Pakistan was unlikely in fact to do anything,\\" given what it sees as the benefits of Taliban control of Afghanistan.\\" President Clinton was scheduled to travel to India. The State Department felt that he should not visit India without also visiting Pakistan. The Secret Service and the CIA, however, warned in the strongest terms that visiting Pakistan would risk the President's life. Counterterrorism officials also argued that Pakistan had not done enough to merit a presidential visit. But President Clinton insisted on including Pakistan in the itinerary for his trip to South Asia. His one-day stopover on March 25, 2000, was the first time a U.S. president had been there since 1969. At his meeting with Musharraf and others, President Clinton concentrated on tensions between Pakistan and India and the dangers of nuclear proliferation, but also discussed  Bin Laden. President Clinton told us that when he pulled Musharraf aside for a brief, one-on-one meeting, he pleaded with the general for help regarding  Bin Laden.\\" I offered him the moon when I went to see him, in terms of better relations with the United States, if he'd help us get  Bin Laden and deal with another issue or two.\\" The U.S. effort continued.

Possible A: sit still, stationary, running, stand still, stay still  Why is \\"stand still\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Stand still\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to being motionless and not moving. When you're on the move, you are in motion, making it impossible to stand still at the same time. The other options do not align as closely with the phrasing of the question: 1. \\"Sit still\\" - Although sitting still involves not moving, the question specifically asks about being on the move, which implies standing or walking rather than sitting. 2. \\"Stationary\\" - Being stationary refers to a state of inactivity or not moving, but it doesn't necessarily imply a specific body position like standing still does in the context of the question. 3. \\"Running\\" - Running is an action that involves being in motion, not a state of stillness, so it doesn't align with the question asking about something you cannot do while on the move. 4. \\"Stay still\\" - Although staying still aligns with the idea of not moving, it is a less specific term than standing still. Standing still highlights the contradiction of being on the move and not moving simultaneously in a clearer way.

Question: Which force keeps the planets in their orbits around the Sun? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the subject of the question. In this case, the subject is the force that keeps planets in their orbits around the Sun. Step 2: Recollect any related fundamental principles or scientific laws. Here, the relevant principle is the concept of gravity, as described by Sir Isaac Newton's law of universal gravitation. Step 3: Apply the identified principle to the subject. According to Newton's law of universal gravitation, every object in the universe attracts every other object with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers.  Step 4: Consider any effects or consequences of the applied principle. In the context of the Solar System, the Sun's gravity pulls the planets toward it, while the planets' inertia (their tendency to keep moving in a straight line) prevents them from being pulled into the Sun entirely. This balance of forces results in the planets following an elliptical orbit around the Sun. Step 5: Formulate the answer based on the application and consequences of the principle. Thus, the force that keeps the planets in their orbits around the Sun is gravity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has won eleven tournaments on the tour including four in 2010 to win for the first time the Race to Dubai, formerly the Order of Merit. Among those wins was the PGA Championship in the United States, which made him only the second German (after Bernhard Langer) to win a major championship. He also won the WGC-HSBC Champions to become the tenth player to win both a major title and a World Golf Championship event. In May 2014, Kaymer earned a wire-to-wire win at The Players Championship in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida, finishing -13 for a one-shot victory over runner-up Jim Furyk. He started the week with a course record-tying 63 in the first round at the Stadium Course of TPC at Sawgrass, joining Fred Couples (1992), Greg Norman (1994), and Roberto Castro (2013). He played the front nine (his second nine) in 29 (-7). This was the first time ever, back or front nine, that a player shot below 30 through nine holes at The Players. The final round was delayed due to bad weather while Kaymer was playing the 14th hole. He holed a difficult 28-foot (8.5 m) par putt (with a huge downhill left-to-right-break) on the 17th green to retain his one-stroke lead. His approach shot on 18 was short of the green but he holed the winning putt for par in near darkness and avoided a three-hole playoff. He became the fourth European to win this event (Sandy Lyle in 1987, Sergio Garcia in 2008, and Henrik Stenson in 2009), and is the fourth to win a major, a World Golf Championship, and The Players, joining Tiger Woods, Adam Scott, and Phil Mickelson. Kaymer earned a winner's share of 1.8 million, the largest of his career, and re-entered the top 50 in the Official World Golf Ranking, rising 33 places from 61st to 28th.  In June, Kaymer started the U.S. Open at Pinehurst with consecutive rounds of 65 (-5) to set a U.S. Open record for 36 holes (130). He finished at 271 (-9), eight strokes ahead of runners-up Rickie Fowler and Erik Compton, and became the first player in history to win those two championships back to back. (Woods also held both titles concurrently, winning the U.S. Open in 2000 and The Players in March 2001; it moved to May in 2007.) With the win, Kaymer gained exempt status on the PGA Tour through 2019 and rose to eleventh in the world rankings. With his U.S. Open victory in 2014, Martin became the first non-British European golfer ever to win the U.S. Open, and one of few players to win two majors under the age of thirty.

A: Answer:","output":"A process in which heat flows into its surroundings and causes an increase in kinetic energy is called an exothermic process. In an exothermic process, a system releases heat energy to its surroundings, which results in an increase in the internal energy or kinetic energy of the molecules in the environment. This release of heat usually leads to a rise in temperature as the molecules move faster and their kinetic energy increases. Common examples of exothermic processes include chemical reactions such as combustion or oxidation, phase transitions such as freezing or condensation, and some metabolic reactions in living organisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the band member that wrote all the lyrics on the album that went to number one in UK?  In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself.

You will see 4 frames labeled \\"up,\\" \\"over,\\" \\"down\\" and \\"hit\\" in the timeline where the button has been added. Up: this frame represents how your button will look when it has not been clicked on. Now that your button is added to the timeline, you can start working on its appearance and interactivity by editing the frame states. The four frame labels represent the different visual states of your button: 1. Up - This is the default state of the button when it is inactive and not being interacted with. In this state, you can design the button's appearance, such as its color, text, and dimensions. 2. Over - This state represents how your button will look when the user's cursor hovers over it. To create an engaging and interactive experience, it's important to indicate this state visually, like changing the button's color, adding a glow effect, or animating the text. 3. Down - This state represents the button when it is clicked on by the user. You can customize the appearance to show that an action is happening, such as deepening the button's color, changing the text size, or making the button look pressed. 4. Hit - This frame defines the active area of the button, which means the area where the user can click to interact with the button. The hit area can be customized to match the shape and size of your button or even extend beyond it. After customizing each state, it's crucial to test your button, ensuring that it functions and transitions between states seamlessly. Once you are satisfied with the appearance and functionality, you can add actions to the button, like navigating to another page, playing an animation, or opening a pop-up menu. In summary, by navigating through the four frame labels, you can create an interactive and engaging flash menu button, providing your users with a unique and responsive experience. Now you can proceed to create additional buttons for your flash menu in a similar manner and link them together for smooth navigation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I always Promised myself that I'd get out as soon as possible. Now, at age 20,I have a good job and a nice house, and I'm really proud of the independence I've achieved. Here's the problem: several of my friends who still live with their parents wish they had places like mine -- so much so that they make mine theirs. It started out with a couple of them spending the weekends with me. But now they seem to take it for granted that they can shou up any time they like. They bring boyfriends over, talk on the phone and stay out forever. I enjoy having my friends here sometimes-- it makes the place feel comfortable and warm-- but this is my home, not a party house. I was old enough to move out on my own, so why can't I seem to ask my friends to respect my privacy ? Joan Edward's reply to Joan Dear Joan: If your family didn't pay attention to your needs when you were a child, you probably have trouble letting others know your needs now.

Instead, you need to figure out how you will transport them. Most fish can survive for around 48 hours of travel, but beyond that you increase the risk that they will not survive.  When you stop for the night, you need to take the fish with you. Don’t leave them unattended in cars or trailers. If you need to fly with your fish, contact the airline to find out what requirements they have for transporting fish. Some of the water in your aquarium should be changed prior to moving and transporting the aquarium. This helps ensure that the water in the tank is clean. Switch out 20 percent of the water in the aquarium daily for five days prior to transporting the aquarium. When you are travelling, you don’t want your fish to mess up the water more than they have to. Fish can go around a week without food, so they will be fine during your move.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a biomedical research facility primarily located in Bethesda, Maryland. An agency of the United States Department of Health and Human Services, it is the primary agency of the United States government responsible for biomedical and health-related research. The NIH both conducts its own scientific research through its Intramural Research Program (IRP) and provides major biomedical research funding to non-NIH research facilities through its Extramural Research Program.  - Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as \\"Washington\\", \\"the District\\", or simply \\"D.C.\\", is the capital of the United States.  - The government of the U.S. state of Kansas, established by the Kansas Constitution, is a republican democracy modeled after the Federal Government of the United States. The state government has three branches: the executive, the legislative, and the judicial. Through a system of separation of powers, or \\"checks and balances,\\" each of these branches has some authority to act on its own, and also some authority to regulate the other two branches, so that all three branches can limit and balance the others' authority.  - The Kansas National Guard, is the component of the United States National Guard in the U.S. state of Kansas. It comprises both the Kansas Army National Guard and the Kansas Air National Guard. The Governor of Kansas is Commander-in-Chief of the Kansas National Guard when in state use. The State's highest-ranking military commander, the Adjutant General of Kansas, serves as the military head of the Guard and is second only to the Governor. Background. The United States Constitution specifically charges the National Guard with dual federal and state missions. The National Guard is the only United States military force empowered to function in a state status. The Governor may call individuals or units of the Guard into state service during emergencies or to assist in special situations which require the Guard. In its state role, the Guard serves to execute state laws, protect the public health, suppress insurrection, and repel invasion. The National Guard may be called into federal service in response to a call by the President or Congress. When National Guard troops are called to federal service, the President serves as Commander-in-Chief.  - Andrew Frank Schoeppel ( November 23 , 1894 -- January 21 , 1962 ) was an American politician and a member of the Republican Party . He was the 29th Governor of Kansas from 1943 to 1947 and a U.S. Senator from 1949 until his death . He was born in 1894 in Claflin , Kansas and died in 1962 of abdominal cancer at the National Naval Medical Center at Bethesda , Maryland .  - Bethesda is a census-designated place in southern Montgomery County, Maryland, United States, located just northwest of the U.S. capital of Washington, D.C. It takes its name from a local church, the Bethesda Meeting House (1820, rebuilt 1849), which in turn took its name from Jerusalem's Pool of Bethesda. In Aramaic,   \\"beth esda\\" means \\"House of Mercy\\" and in Hebrew,   \\"beit esed\\" means \\"House of Kindness\\". The National Institutes of Health main campus and the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center are in Bethesda, as are a number of corporate and government headquarters.  - The Kansas Legislature is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Kansas. It is a bicameral assembly, composed of the lower Kansas House of Representatives, with 125 state representatives, and the upper Kansas Senate, with 40 state senators.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Montgomery County, officially the County of Montgomery, is a county in the U.S. state of Maryland. As of the 2010 census, the population was 971,777, with a 2014 estimate putting the population at 1,030,447. It is the most populous county in Maryland. The county seat and largest municipality is Rockville, although the census-designated place of Germantown is the most populous place.  - The Pool of Bethesda is a pool of water in the Muslim Quarter of Jerusalem, on the path of the Beth Zeta Valley. The fifth chapter of the Gospel of John describes such a pool in Jerusalem, near the Sheep Gate, which is surrounded by five covered colonnades. It is associated with healing. Until the 19th century, there was no evidence outside of Johns Gospel for the existence of this pool; therefore, scholars argued that the gospel was written later, probably by someone without first-hand knowledge of the city of Jerusalem, and that the \\"pool\\" had only a metaphorical, rather than historical, significance.  - Jerusalem , is a city located on a plateau in the Judaean Mountains between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. One of the oldest cities in the world, Jerusalem was named as \\"\\"Urusalima\\"\\" on ancient Mesopotamian cuneiform tablets, probably meaning \\"City of Shalem\\" after a Canaanite deity, during the early Canaanite period (approximately 2400 BCE). During the Israelite period, significant construction activity in Jerusalem began in the 9th century BCE (Iron Age II), and in the 8th century the city developed into the religious and administrative center of the Kingdom of Judah. It is considered a holy city in the three major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  - Kansas is a U.S. state located in the Midwestern United States. Its capital is Topeka and its largest city is Wichita. Kansas is named after the Kansa Native American tribe, which inhabited the area. The tribe's name (natively \\"\\") is often said to mean \\"people of the wind\\" or \\"people of the south wind\\", although this was probably not the term's original meaning. For thousands of years, what is now Kansas was home to numerous and diverse Native American tribes. Tribes in the eastern part of the state generally lived in villages along the river valleys. Tribes in the western part of the state were semi-nomadic and hunted large herds of bison.  - The Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC), formerly known as the National Naval Medical Center and colloquially referred to as the Bethesda Naval Hospital Bethesda, \\"Walter Reed, or Navy Med\\"', is a tri-service military medical center located in the community of Bethesda, Maryland, near the headquarters of the National Institutes of Health. It is one of the most prominent U.S. military medical centers in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area and the United States, having served numerous U.S. presidents since the 20th century.  - Claflin is a city in Barton County, Kansas, United States. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 645.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military.  - A census-designated place (CDP) is a concentration of population defined by the United States Census Bureau for statistical purposes only. CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as cities, towns, and villages for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated small community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the U.S. border with Mexico, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs.  - The Bethesda Meeting House (BMH) is a historic Presbyterian church complex located at Bethesda, Montgomery County, Maryland, USA. It is situated on Maryland Route 355 (known as Rockville Pike at this point) just inside the Capital Beltway.  - The Governor of the State of Kansas is the head of state for the State of Kansas, United States. Under the Kansas Constitution, the Governor is also the head of government, serving as the chief executive of the Kansas executive branch, of the government of Kansas. The Governor is the Commander-in-Chief of the Kansas National Guard when not called into Federal use. Despite being an executive branch official, the Governor also possesses legislative and judicial powers. The Governor's responsibilities include making yearly \\"State of the State\\" addresses to the Kansas Legislature, submitting the budget, ensuring that state laws are enforced, and that the peace is preserved.

Jean-Philippe Rameau (French: [Zafilip Ramo]; (1683-09-25)25 September 1683 - (1764-09-12)12 September 1764) was one of the most important French composers and music theorists of the 18th century. He replaced Jean-Baptiste Lully as the dominant composer of French opera and is also considered the leading French composer for the harpsichord of his time, alongside Francois Couperin. Little is known about Rameau's early years, and it was not until the 1720s that he won fame as a major theorist of music with his Treatise on Harmony (1722) and also in the following years as a composer of masterpieces for the harpsichord, which circulated throughout Europe. Unlike Lully, who collaborated with Philippe Quinault on almost all his operas, Rameau rarely worked with the same librettist twice. He was highly demanding and bad-tempered, unable to maintain longstanding partnerships with his librettists, with the exception of Louis de Cahusac, who collaborated with him on several operas, including Les fetes de l'Hymen et de l'Amour (1747), Zais (1748), Nais (1749), Zoroastre (1749; revised 1756), La naissance d'Osiris (1754), and Anacreon (the first of Rameau's operas by that name, 1754). He is also credited with writing the libretto of Rameau's final work, Les Boreades (c. 1763).  Many Rameau specialists have regretted that the collaboration with Houdar de la Motte never took place, and that the Samson project with Voltaire came to nothing because the librettists Rameau did work with were second-rate. He made his acquaintance of most of them at La Poupliniere's salon, at the Societe du Caveau, or at the house of the Comte de Livry, all meeting places for leading cultural figures of the day.  Not one of his librettists managed to produce a libretto on the same artistic level as Rameau's music: the plots were often overly complex or unconvincing. But this was standard for the genre, and is probably part of its charm. The versification, too, was mediocre, and Rameau often had to have the libretto modified and rewrite the music after the premiere because of the ensuing criticism. This is why we have two versions of Castor et Pollux (1737 and 1754) and three of Dardanus (1739, 1744, and 1760).

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface - The cracks get very long and big in some places - The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks - The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard - The cracks continue to develop - The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks - The pressure and movement around the cracks causes the rocks to crumble in some places - A lot of energy is released - The energy causes seismic waves - The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less oxygen in the environment happens, how will it affect rocks press harder against each other.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"To analyze the potential impact of less oxygen in the environment on the process outlined above, let's examine each step, and assess if it could be affected by the decrease in oxygen levels: 1. The earth develops cracks deep beneath the surface: This step is primarily a result of geological processes and tectonic plate movement. Oxygen levels should not have a direct impact on this step. 2. The cracks get very long and big in some places: This step is also a result of geological processes and would not be directly affected by oxygen levels. 3. The earth places pressure against the rocks on both sides of the cracks: Pressure on the rocks is created by the movement of tectonic plates and geological processes. Oxygen levels would not directly affect this process. 4. The pressure causes the rocks to press against each other very hard: Pressure on rocks is a physical process, and changes in oxygen levels would not directly impact this process. 5. The cracks continue to develop: Crack development occurs due to geological processes and is not directly influenced by oxygen levels. 6. The earth moves against itself on both sides of the cracks: This movement is a result of tectonic plate interactions and not influenced by oxygen levels. 7. The pressure and movement around the cracks cause the rocks to crumble in some places: While rock composition can be affected by environmental factors including atmospheric gases, the pressure and movement of tectonic plates are the primary causes of rock crumbling in this context, making the effect of a decrease in oxygen levels indirect at best. 8. A lot of energy is released: Energy release is a result of the movement and interaction of tectonic plates; oxygen levels would not directly affect this process. 9. The energy causes seismic waves: Seismic wave generation is a result of released energy and tectonic plate interactions; it would not be directly influenced by oxygen levels. 10. The seismic waves move the earth in an earthquake: Seismic wave propagation is a result of energy transmission through the earth and would not be directly affected by oxygen levels. In conclusion, the decrease in oxygen levels in the environment would not have a direct effect on the process outlined above. While the change in oxygen levels might indirectly influence rock compositions over long periods of time, it would not directly affect the geological processes related to the development and propagation of earthquakes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's rare that I feel a need to write a review on this site, but this film is very deserving because of how poorly it was created, and how bias its product was. I felt a distinct attempt on the part of the film-makers to display the Palestinian family as boorish and untrustworthy. We hear them discuss the sadness that they feel from oppression, yet the film is shot and arranged in a way that we feel the politically oppressed population is the Jewish Israeli population. We see no evidence that parallels the position of the Palestinian teenager. We only hear from other Palestinians in prison. I understand restrictions are in place, but the political nature of the restrictions are designed to prevent peace. I came out of the film feeling that the mother of the victim was selfish in her mourning and completely closed minded due to her side of the fence, so to speak. She continued to be unwilling to see the hurt of the bomber's parents, and her angry and closed-minded words caused the final meeting to spiral out of control. It is more realistic, in my mind, to see the Israeli mindset to be a root of the problem; ignored pleas for understanding and freedom, ignored requests for acknowledgment for the process by which the Jewish population acquired the land. I have given this a two because of these selfish weaknesses of the mother, which normally would be admirable in a documentary, however in the light of the lack of impartiality, it all seems exploitative. Also for the poor edits, lack of background in the actual instance, and finally the lack of proper representation of the Palestinian side. Ultimately, it is a poor documentary and a poor film. I acknowledge this is partially the result of the political situation, but am obliged to note the flaws in direction regardless of the heart-wrenching and sad subject matter.

Background: Alberto Kenya Fujimori Fujimori (Spanish: [al'berto fuxi'mori, fuji-]; Japanese: [FWzimori]; born 26 July 1938 or 4 August 1938) served as the President of Peru from 28 July 1990 to 22 November 2000. His government is credited with the creation of Fujimorism, defeating the Shining Path insurgency, and restoring Peru's macroeconomic stability. Fujimori ended his presidency by fleeing Peru for Japan amid a major scandal involving corruption and human rights violations. Even amid his prosecution in 2008 for crimes against humanity relating to his presidency, two-thirds of Peruvians polled voiced approval for his leadership in that period. Context: Fujimori obtained his early education at the Colegio Nuestra Senora de la Merced and La Rectora. Fujimori's parents were Buddhists, but he was baptised and raised as a Roman Catholic. While he spoke mainly Japanese at home, Fujimori also learned to become a proficient Spanish speaker during his years at school. In 1956, Fujimori graduated from La gran unidad escolar Alfonso Ugarte in Lima.  He went on to undergraduate studies at the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in 1957, graduating in 1961 first in his class as an agricultural engineer. The following year he lectured on mathematics at the university. In 1964 he went to study physics at the University of Strasbourg in France. On a Ford scholarship, Fujimori also attended the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in the United States, where he obtained his master's degree in mathematics in 1969. In 1974, he married Susana Higuchi, also Japanese-Peruvian. They had four children, including a daughter, Keiko, who followed her father into politics. In recognition of his academic achievements, the sciences faculty of the Universidad Nacional Agraria offered Fujimori the deanship and in 1984 appointed him to the rectorship of the university, which he held until 1989. In 1987, Fujimori also became president of the National Commission of Peruvian University Rectors (Asamblea Nacional de Rectores), a position which he has held twice. He also hosted a TV show called \\"Concertando\\" from 1988 to 1989, on Peru's state-owned network, Channel 7.  Fujimori won the 1990 presidential election as a dark horse candidate under the banner of Cambio 90 (\\"cambio\\" means \\"change\\") beating world-renowned writer Mario Vargas Llosa in a surprising upset. He capitalized on profound disenchantment with outgoing president Alan Garcia and the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance party (APRA). He exploited popular distrust of Vargas Llosa's identification with the existing Peruvian political establishment, and uncertainty about his plans for neoliberal economic reforms.  During the campaign, Fujimori was nicknamed El Chino, which roughly translates to \\"Chinaman\\"; it is common for people of any East Asian descent to be called chino in Peru, as elsewhere in Latin America, both derogatively and affectionately. Although he is of Japanese heritage, Fujimori has suggested that he was always gladdened by the term, which he perceived as a term of affection. With his election victory, he became just the second person of East Asian descent to become head of government of a Latin American nation, after Fulgencio Batista of Cuba and the third of East Asian descent to govern a South American state, after Arthur Chung of Guyana and Henk Chin A Sen of Suriname (each of whom had served as head of state, rather than head of government). Question: Did he do anything with his career as an agricultural engineer? Answer:","output":"Yes, Alberto Fujimori utilized his career as an agricultural engineer in various ways. After graduating first in his class as an agricultural engineer from the Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina in 1961, he took up a lecturing position on mathematics at the same university the following year. In 1984, he was offered the deanship of the sciences faculty at the Universidad Nacional Agraria, and later, he became the rector of the university, a position he held until 1989. His background in agricultural engineering played a significant role in shaping his academic career and bolstering his qualifications before transitioning into the political arena."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process is the exhalation of carbon dioxide. After the oxygen has been delivered to various cells throughout the body and effectively utilized by them to produce energy, the by-product of this process is carbon dioxide (CO2). The carbon dioxide then diffuses back into the capillaries, which return the deoxygenated blood (containing carbon dioxide) to the heart. From the heart, the deoxygenated blood is pumped through the pulmonary arteries to the lungs, where the carbon dioxide is exchanged for fresh oxygen. In the lungs, CO2 diffuses from the blood vessels into the alveoli, while oxygen simultaneously diffuses from the alveoli into the blood vessels. This gaseous exchange process is known as respiration. When you breathe out, you expel the carbon dioxide through the process of exhalation. The exhaled CO2 travels in the reverse path that the inhaled oxygen took: it moves through the bronchioles, bronchi, and trachea before finally exiting the body through the nose and mouth. Exhalation is essential to maintaining a proper balance of gases in the body and to removing waste products from cellular respiration. Ultimately, this entire process helps to ensure that your body receives the oxygen it requires for optimal functioning and efficiently removes the carbon dioxide that would be harmful if accumulated. So, the last step of the process is: - Carbon dioxide is expelled from the alveoli, through the bronchioles, bronchi, and trachea, and finally exhaled through the nose and mouth, completing the respiratory cycle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Kerry Mcdermott. PUBLISHED:. 07:59 EST, 4 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 08:04 EST, 4 November 2012. A couple have told of their horror after discovering an earwig inside a sealed bag of bread rolls picked up on their weekly supermarket shop. Jane Naisbett, who bought the rolls at an Asda Superstore in Sunderland while shopping with her partner Gary MacPhail, said she was 'terrified' when she spotted the bug as she prepared to make some sandwiches. 'If I was partially sighted I might have eaten it,' the 53-year-old said. Shock: The couple say there is no way the earwig could have got into the bag after they brought it home as it was still completely sealed. The disgusted couple, from Hendon in Sunderland, complained to the store on the Leechmere Road Industrial Estate, but Asda bosses say they could not fully investigate because the pair did not leave the item with them. An inspection has since been carried out at the bakery but the supermarket said it found no evidence of insects. Ms Naisbett and her partner Mr MacPhail, a 47-year-old council worker, said they bought the rolls fresh on Monday and put them straight into their freezer when they got home. After removing them to defrost on Wednesday the couple say they found the earwig lurking inside the bag. Disgust: Gary MacPhail and Jane Naisbett, seen with the bread rolls, say they will be taking their business elsewhere. Mr MacPhail said: 'Jane lifted out the pack of rolls to make some sandwiches and when they had defrosted there was earwig inside the bag. 'The bag is still completely sealed, there's no way it could have got in there,' he added. Mr MacPhail claims he was offered a £5 voucher after taking the rolls back to Asda - although the store insists he was offered a £10 voucher as a goodwill gesture. His partner said she would be taking her business elsewhere. 'I've shopped there for over 20 years,' Ms Naisbett said. 'But I won't be setting foot in there again.' An Asda spokesman said: 'The quality of our products is our number one priority and we take any customer complaints incredibly seriously. 'We are at a loss to understand how this could have happened and unfortunately we were not given the opportunity to look at this product or investigate it properly. 'However, a thorough inspection of our bakery has found no evidence of any pests,' the spokesman added. Highlights:","output":"1.

The Slaver Wildfire. - SPECIAL MESSAGE OF IRRESIDENT BUCHANAN. - NYTimes.com To the Senate and House of Representatives: On the 26th day of April last, Lieut. CRAVEN, of the United States steamer Mohawk, captured the slaver Wildfire, on the coast of Cuba, with five hundren and seven African negroes on board. The prize was brought into Key West on the 30th April, and the negroes were delivered into the custody of FERNANDO J. MORENO, Marshal of the Southern District of Florida. The question which now demands immediate decision is, what disposition shall be made of these Africans? In the annual message to Congress of December 6, 1858, I expressed my opinion in regard to the construction of the act of the 3d March, 1819, \\"In addition to the acts prohibiting the slave trade,\\" so far as the same is applicable to the present case. From this I make the following extract: \\"Under the 2d section of this act the President is authorized to make such regulations and arrangements as he may deem expedient for the safe-keeping, support and removal beyond the limits of the United States of all such negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color captured by vessels of the United States, as may be delivered to the marshal of the district into which they are brought, 'and to appoint a person or persons residing upon the coast of Africa as agent or agents for receiving the negroes, mulattoes, or persons of color delivered from on board vessels seized in the prosecution of the slave trade by commanders of the United States armed vessels.' Mr. MONROE, in his special message of 17th December, 1819, at the first session after the act was passed, announced to Congress what, in his opinion, was its true construction. He believed it to be his duty under it to follow these unfortunates into Africa, and make provision for them there until they should be able to provide for themselves.\\" Adopting this construction of President MONROE, I entered into an agreement with the Colonization Society, dated 7th September, 1858, to receive the Africans which had been captured on the slaver Echo from the agent of the Untied States in Liberia; to furnish them during the period of one year thereafter with comfortable shelter, clothing and provisions; and to cause them to be instructed in the arms of civilized life suitable to their condition, at the rate of 150 for each individual. It was believed that within that period they would be prepared to become citizens of Liberia, and to take care of themselves. As Congress was not then in session, and as there was no outstanding appropriation applicable to this purpose, the Society were obliged to depend for payment on the future action of that body. I recommended this appropriation, and seventy-five thousand dollars were granted by the act of 3d March, 1859, (the Consular and Diplomatic bill) \\"to enable the President of the United States to carry into effect the act of Congress of 3d March, 1819, and any subsequent acts now in force for the suppression of the Slave-trade.\\" Of this appropriation there remains unexpended the sum of twenty-four thousand three hundred and fifty dollars and ninety cents, (24,350 99,) after deducting from it an advance made by the Secretary of the interior out of the judiciary fund of eleven thousand three hundred and forty-eight dollars and ten cents, (11,348 10.) I regret to say that, under the mode adopted in regard to the Africans captured on board the Echo, the expense will be large; but this seems to a great extent to be inevitable, without a violation of the laws of humanity. The expenditure upon this scale for those captured on board the Wildfire will not be less than 100,000, and may considerably exceed that sum. Still it ought to be observed that, during the period when the Government itself, through its own agents, undertook the task of providing for captured negroes in Africa, the cost per head was much greater than that which I agreed to pay the Colonization Society. But it will not be sufficient for Congress to limit the amount appropriated to the case of the Wildfire. It is probable, judging from the increased activity of the slave-trade and the vigilance of our cruisers, that several similar captures may be made before the end of the year. An appropriation ought, therefore, to be granted, large enough to cover such contingencies. The period has arrived when it is indispensable to provide some specific legislation for the guidance of the Executive on this subject. With this view, I would suggest that Congress might authorize the President to enter into a general agreement with the Colonization Society, binding them to receive on the coast of Africa from our agent there all the captured Africans which may be delivered to him, and to maintain them for a limited period, upon such terms and conditions as may combine humanity towards these unfortunates with a just economy. This would obviate the necessity of making a new bargain with every new capture, and would prevent delay and avoid expense in the disposition of the captured. The law might then provide that, in all cases where this may be practicable, the captor should carry the negroes directly to Africa, and deliver them to the American agent there, afterwards bringing the captured vessel to the United States for adjudication. The capturing officer, in case he should bring his prize directly to the United States, ought to be required to land the negroes in some one or more parts to be designated by Congress, where the prevailing health throughout the year is good. At there ports cheap, but permanent accommodations might be provided for the negroes, until they could be sent away, without incurring the expense of electing such accommodations at every port where the capturing officer may think proper to enter. On the preson, occasion these negroes have been brought to Key Wess; and, according to the estimate presented by the Marshal of the Southern District of Florida to the Secretary of the Interior, the cost of providing temporary quarters for them will be 2,500, and the aggregates expenses for the single month of May will amount to 12,000. But this is far from being the worst evil. Within a few weeks the yellow fever will most probably prevail at Key West; and hence the Marshal press their removal from their present quarters at an early day, which must be done, in any event, as soon as practicable. For these reasons I earnestly commend this subject to the immediate attention of Congress. It is truly lamentable that Great Britain and the United States should be obliged to expend such a vast amount of blood and treasure for the suppression of the African Slave-trade; and this when the only portions of the civilized world where it is tolerated and encouraged are the Spanish islands of Cuba and Porto Rico. JAMES BUCHANAN. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of the text are as follows: 1. The capture of the slaver Wildfire: On April 26, Lt. Craven of the United States steamer Mohawk captured the slaver ship Wildfire off the coast of Cuba. The ship carried 507 African slaves onboard, who were later delivered to the custody of Marshal Fernando J. Moreno in Key West, Florida. 2. The question of the Africans' fate: President James Buchanan raises the issue of what should be done with the captured Africans, and refers to a previous message where he addressed the construction of the act of March 3, 1819, regarding the suppression of the slave trade. 3. President Monroe's interpretation of the act: Buchanan adopts President James Monroe's interpretation of the act, which stated that the responsibility of the U.S. Government extended to providing for the captured Africans in Africa until they could provide for themselves. 4. Agreement with the Colonization Society: Buchanan had entered into an agreement with the Colonization Society on September 7, 1858, to receive captured Africans, provide them with shelter, clothing, and provisions for a year, and instruct them in civilized life at a rate of 150 per individual. 5. Appropriation of funds: Buchanan laments the large expenses incurred in providing for captured Africans but argues that it is essential to adhere to the laws of humanity. He informs that 24,350.99 remains unexpended after previous appropriations and calls upon Congress to allocate more funds to accommodate potential future captures. 6. Suggestion for specific legislation: Buchanan urges Congress to provide specific legislation for the guidance of the Executive, suggesting that the President be authorized to enter into a general agreement with the Colonization Society for receiving and maintaining captured Africans for a limited period. He proposes that captors should carry the captured directly to Africa and then bring the captured vessel to the United States for adjudication. 7. Designation of specific ports for landing captured Africans: Buchanan emphasizes the need to designate specific ports with good prevailing health conditions for landing captured Africans, to avoid the significant expenses incurred in providing temporary accommodations at various ports. 8. Criticism of Spanish islands tolerating the slave trade: The text concludes with lamentation that Great Britain and the United States have spent considerable resources suppressing the African Slave-trade, particularly when it is only tolerated and encouraged in the Spanish islands of Cuba and Puerto Rico."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We all eventually die, even though we usually what? - seek help - write will - wish we could - never want - go to hell  The best answer is Answer:","output":"We all eventually die, even though we usually wish we could live forever. Death is a natural part of the cycle of life, and it is something that every living being on this planet must face. Nevertheless, many people harbor a deep fear of death and hope to stave it off for as long as possible. This longing for immortality is a part of human nature, reflecting our desire to continue experiencing life and to leave a lasting legacy behind. Throughout history, humans have searched for ways to extend their lives and seek help in their quest for longevity. Medical science has consistently progressed and advanced, allowing us to live longer and healthier lives than our ancestors. In addition to medical advancements, people also turn to healthy lifestyles, including good nutrition, exercise, and stress management as ways to enhance and prolong their lives. One way individuals attempt to maintain a sense of control over their mortality is by preparing for the inevitable through writing a will. A will is a legal document that outlines how a person's assets and possessions will be distributed after their death. The creation of a will can help ensure that our loved ones are taken care of, and our possessions are divided as per our wishes, providing a sense of comfort in the face of life's uncertainty. Nevertheless, no one can predict or control when their time will come, which can lead to feelings of fear and anxiety. People often never want to confront the reality of their own mortality, preferring to avoid the topic altogether. Some may even harbor fantasies of evading death, inspired by mythology, fiction, or religious beliefs that promise eternal life or reincarnation. In various religious and cultural traditions, the concept of an afterlife or spiritual realm, such as heaven or hell, provides a moral framework for how we lead our lives. For some, the idea of going to hell represents a catastrophic end, which they strive to avoid by adhering to the tenets of their faith or seeking forgiveness for their perceived wrongs. This desire to avoid punishment or reach a peaceful afterlife can influence people's actions and moral choices throughout their lives. In conclusion, although we all eventually die, we usually wish we could live forever and seek help in delaying the inevitable. We express this desire through pursuing healthy lifestyles, relying on medical advancements, making preparations for our death through writing a will, and seeking solace and meaning in our religious and cultural beliefs. Our complex relationship with death is influenced by both biological instincts and societal factors, making it an enduring and fascinating aspect of the human experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English English:","output":"We also do not know how the reduced appropriations are supposed to be distributed over the next few years. English: The original statement in Finnish, \\"Emme myöskään tiedä, miten pienennetyt määrärahat on tarkoitus jakaa muutaman seuraavan vuoden aikana,\\" conveys the uncertainty and concern regarding the allocation of reduced budgetary funds in the coming years. In this context, \\"pienennetyt määrärahat\\" refers to the reduced appropriations or budget funds, while \\"jakaa\\" means to distribute or allocate. The issue highlighted in this statement is a common challenge faced by organizations, governments, and institutions when confronted with a need to adjust to budget cuts or reduced financial resources. In these situations, decision makers must carefully consider various factors, such as the organization's priorities, the impact on the stakeholders, and the long-term consequences of their choices. Moreover, it is crucial for those in leadership positions to clearly communicate their plans and reasons behind the allocation decisions to promote transparency and accountability. This type of information sharing can alleviate some concerns, assist in gaining the understanding and support from affected parties, and foster collaboration in finding alternative solutions. For instance, organizations can explore cost-saving measures, more efficient processes, or additional funding sources to minimize the impact of budget reductions. As the statement implies a lack of knowledge about the distribution of the reduced appropriations, it may be helpful to engage in open discussions with relevant stakeholders and decision makers. Analyzing historical data, understanding current needs and priorities, and considering potential future requirements can aid in formulating a well-informed and strategic approach to allocating the limited funds over the next few years. Additionally, monitoring and adjusting the allocation process based on the evolving circumstances and needs can result in more effective utilization of the available resources, ultimately contributing to the sustainability and success of the entity facing budget constraints."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But giving yourself a little TLC can do wonders for your mental and physical wellbeing. It's essential to take some time out and indulge in a home spa day that nourishes your body and soul. In this article, we'll guide you through a step-by-step process to create the perfect pampering experience. Step 1: Prepare the Space Transform your bathroom into a sanctuary by lighting candles, playing soft music, and setting the perfect water temperature. Dim the lights, and place a soft fluffy towel near the bathtub. Creating a soothing atmosphere allows you to fully relax and unwind. Step 2: Take a Relaxing Bath Fill your bathtub with warm water and add Epsom salts, essential oils, or a bubble bath solution. Soak in the tub for at least 20 minutes, allowing your mind to clear and your muscles to loosen up. The warm water will also open your pores, preparing your skin for the treatments to follow. Step 3: Apply a Face Mask Choose a face mask that caters to your skin's specific needs, such as a moisturizing, purifying, or brightening formula. Apply the mask evenly to clean skin and leave it on for the recommended time. Face masks are designed to address various skin concerns, and they create a luxurious feeling while nourishing your skin. Step 4: Try a Hot Oil Hair Treatment Warm up your favorite hair oil (such as coconut, olive, or argan oil) and massage it into your scalp and through the length of your hair. Wrap your hair in a warm towel and let the oil penetrate deeply for 20-30 minutes. Hot oil treatments can improve hair health by providing moisture, reducing frizz, and strengthening hair shafts. Step 5: Make and Apply a Sugar Scrub Mix equal parts sugar and oil (such as coconut or olive oil) to create a simple and effective body scrub. Apply the scrub in a circular motion, focusing on rough areas like elbows and knees. Sugar scrubs help remove dead skin cells, revealing softer and smoother skin. Step 6: Indulge in a Foot Treatment Soak your feet in warm water with Epsom salts and a few drops of your preferred essential oil. After about 10-15 minutes, gently scrub your feet with a pumice stone to remove any dead skin. Finish by massaging a foot cream onto your feet to lock in moisture. Step 7: Paint Your Nails Choose a nail polish color that makes you happy and paint your nails to complete your home spa experience. Painting your nails is not only a fun way to express your style, but it also helps maintain healthy nail beds and cuticles. Conclusion: A luxurious home spa day is the perfect way to relax and rejuvenate your body, mind, and spirit. By following these simple steps, you can create an exceptional experience that leaves you feeling refreshed and pampered.

Plot title: The Lorax Movie plot: Ted Wiggins is an idealistic boy, who lives in \\"Thneedville\\", a walled city that, aside from the human citizens, is completely artificial; everything is made of plastic, metal, or synthetics with no living plants. Ted has a crush on local environmentalist Audrey, who wants to see a \\"real tree\\" more than anything in the world, and decides to find one in order to impress her. His energetic Grammy Norma secretly tells Ted the legend of the Once-ler, who will tell anyone about trees if they brought him fifteen cents, a nail, and a shell of a great-great-great grandfather snail. When Ted leaves Thneedville in search of the Once-ler, he discovers that the outside world is a contaminated, empty wasteland. Once the boy finds him, the Once-ler agrees to tell Ted about the trees on the condition that he listens to the story over multiple visits. Ted agrees, but on his way home, he encounters the mayor of Thneedville, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, who is also the proprietor of a company that sells bottled oxygen to Thneedville residents. O'Hare explains to Ted that because trees produce oxygen free of charge, he considers it a threat to his business whenever he hears people talking about them. After revealing that he has \\"security camera eyes\\" all over the city, O'Hare pressures Ted to stay in town. However, Ted continues to sneak out of O'Hare's sight (with his grandmother's encouragement) and learns more of the trees' history. Over Ted's various visits, the Once-ler recounts the story that when he was a young man, he departed his family to find good material for his Thneed invention and make a business. After stumbling upon a lush Truffula Tree forest valley, the Once-ler meets the guardian of the forest, the Lorax, after cutting down a Truffula Tree. The Lorax urges the Once-ler to leave the forest, but the Once-ler refuses. Eventually, the Once-ler promises not to chop another tree down, and the two seem to begin a friendship of sorts.

The primary antagonist, Mr. Aloysius O'Hare, tries to prevent Ted from discovering the truth about the trees and eventually faces opposition from Ted, his family, and the citizens of Thneedville.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Every Medic possesses a 40/150 Syringe Gun (Primary), the class defining Medi-Gun (Secondary) and their last resort, the Bonesaw (Melee). They may also unlock a series of alternate weapons by successfully completing Medic Achievements.  Use the Bonesaw sparingly, at point-blank range. Melee kills are always fun, and melee weapons have taken quite a boost in power since the Team Fortress Classic (TFC) crowbar, but don't get cocky. Save your Bonesaw for stealthy strikes from behind, or if your attacker is right next to you and retreating isn't an option. Otherwise, you're usually better off healing another teammate and letting them finish the job for you instead. Use the Syringe Gun for distance shots. As the name implies, the Syringe Gun fires hypodermic needles. It is not the most powerful weapon in TF2, but it is often underestimated by most players. An experienced player can be lethal with the Syringe Gun in their hands. Note that the needles from the Syringe Gun actually fire slightly to the right of where the crosshair is.  Fire at a wall from varying distances and look where the needles land to get a feel of where to aim. They also arc downward rather quickly. You'll need to aim upward and to the left with the Syringe Gun if you intend to hit any enemies from a distance. This does, however, make it useful to shoot over short hills. The Syringe Gun's needles travel through the air slowly, which can make them easy for other players to dodge them. Keep this in mind. Try using the Syringe Gun to provide cover fire for your team. They'll stay in the air long enough to travel at enemies that like to sidestep back and forth from corners. Since the Syringe Gun's projectiles move through the air slowly, it is a good strategy to fire if an enemy is chasing you, with you either standing still, moving towards him, or backtracking. If he moves towards your syringes, he is more likely to get hit and thus die. This is essentially a given; your teammates will respect you for being able to heal them effectively and quickly.  The biggest change to the Medic since TFC is his ability to heal from a distance. You can now space yourself out from between your teammate as you heal them to avoid splash damage. You don't have to keep your crosshairs on the player to keep healing them, so you should look around frequently to keep an eye on the rest of the battlefield; it's a good idea to look for other wounded players, and keep an eye out for approaching Spies and Pyros. In addition to healing, your Medi Gun can raise a player's health to 150% more of their maximum health. This will slowly return back to its maximum when you stop healing them. You can tell how \\"overhealed\\" a player is by the white glowing/pulsating surrounding his or her health cross; the bigger this glow, the more over healing they have received. You will earn an \\"assist kill\\" if you are healing a teammate that gets a kill point. As you heal players, you will notice that the small bar on the bottom right corner of your HUD will start to fill itself. This is your ÜberCharge meter. When this reaches 100%, the Medic will announce that he is \\"charged\\". By right-clicking, you will activate the ÜberCharge, which will make you and your healing target completely invulnerable for a maximum of 8 seconds  Note that you and your target cannot capture points when Über Charged. Similarly, you and your target will not be able to carry the enemy intelligence (flag). However, you can still prevent the enemy team from taking a capture point while ÜberCharged. Your ÜberCharge meter will fill fastest when healing a damaged player. It fills slowest when over healing a player who is already at 150% of their maximum health. This gives Medics an incentive to take care of his team as a whole, rather than to attach themselves to the nearest Heavy. The announcement of \\"I am charged!\\" can be heard by nearby enemies. If you wish to cover up this tell-tale signal so they are less likely to be prepared for it, you can call for a Medic (or any other vocal command) just as the meter reaches 100%, and it will override the passive \\"I am charged!\\" announcement. Summary:","output":"A Medic in the game has three main tools: a Syringe Gun for shooting from a distance, a Medi-Gun for healing teammates, and a Bonesaw for close fighting. The Medic can unlock more weapons by finishing achievements. You should use the Bonesaw only when you're really close to an enemy, and it's better to heal your teammates and let them fight instead. The Syringe Gun shoots needles that go a little to the right and down, so you need to aim up and left to hit enemies far away. It's good for slowing down enemies as well.  The Medi-Gun can heal friends from far away, making them feel better and even stronger than usual. This helps the team because your friends can fight better and you can help them by looking out for sneaky enemies. When you heal a lot, you can use a special power called ÜberCharge that makes you and your friend invincible for a short time. But, you can't win the game while using it, so use it to help your friends in tough fights. Remember to heal all your friends, not just the big strong ones, to be a good Medic and keep the team strong and healthy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose between \\"Motorcycle Far\\" and  \\"Motorcycle Near\\". Question: As the motorcycle pulled away from Rick he realized that it became (A) quieter (B) louder","output":"As the motorcycle pulled away from Rick, he realized that it became (A) quieter.  This phenomenon can be explained by the Doppler effect and other factors associated with the physics of sound and distance. The Doppler effect is the change in frequency and wavelength of a wave concerning an observer who is moving relative to the wave source. In this scenario, the observer (Rick) is stationary, and the wave source (the motorcycle) is moving. When the motorcycle is near Rick, the engine's noise, including exhaust and mechanical sounds, is quite intense as the sound waves have minimal distance to travel. As the motorcycle begins to pull away, those sound waves take increasingly longer to reach Rick. Consequently, the frequency of the sound waves decreases, and the perceived pitch drops. This effect is the Doppler shift, and it is responsible for the noticeable change in the motorcycle's sound as it distances itself from Rick. Additionally, sound travels in different ways, such as through the air and via reflection off various surfaces (e.g., the ground, buildings, or other objects in the vicinity). As the motorcycle moves further away, the number of reflecting surfaces decreases, and the waves traverse a longer path through the air before reaching Rick's ears. Thus, the sound waves dissipate more energy, resulting in a quieter motorcycle noise for the observer. In conclusion, several factors contribute to the motorcycle sounding quieter as it moves away from Rick. The Doppler effect, which decreases the sound wave frequency and perceived pitch, and the physical properties of sound propagation and reflection, which cause energy dissipation and lowered intensity, all play a significant role. So, the correct response to the question is (A) quieter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Eddie James \\"Son\\" House, Jr. (March 21, 1902 - October 19, 1988) was an American delta blues singer and guitarist, noted for his highly emotional style of singing and slide guitar playing. After years of hostility to secular music, as a preacher and for a few years also as a church pastor, he turned to blues performance at the age of 25. He quickly developed a unique style by applying the rhythmic drive, vocal power and emotional intensity of his preaching to the newly learned idiom. In a short career interrupted by a spell in Parchman Farm penitentiary, he developed to the point that Charley Patton, the foremost blues artist of the Mississippi Delta region, invited him to share engagements and to accompany him to a 1930 recording session for Paramount Records. House was born in the hamlet of Lyon, north of Clarksdale, Mississippi, the second of three brothers, and lived in the rural Mississippi Delta until his parents separated, when he was about seven or eight years old. His father, Eddie House, Sr., was a musician, playing the tuba in a band with his brothers and sometimes playing the guitar. He was a church member but also a drinker; he left the church for a time, on account of his drinking, but then gave up alcohol and became a Baptist deacon. Young Eddie House adopted the family commitment to religion and churchgoing. He also absorbed the family love of music but confined himself to singing, showing no interest in the family instrumental band, and hostile to the blues on religious grounds.  When House's parents separated, his mother took him to Tallulah, Louisiana, across the Mississippi River from Vicksburg, Mississippi. When he was in his early teens, they moved to Algiers, New Orleans. Recalling these years, he would later speak of his hatred of blues and his passion for churchgoing (he described himself as \\"churchy\\" and \\"churchified\\"). At fifteen, probably while living in Algiers, he began preaching sermons.  At the age of nineteen, while living in the Delta, he married Carrie Martin, an older woman from New Orleans. This was a significant step for House; he married in church and against family opposition. The couple moved to her hometown of Centerville, Louisiana, to help run her father's farm. After a couple of years, feeling used and disillusioned, House recalled, \\"I left her hanging on the gatepost, with her father tellin' me to come back so we could plow some more.\\" Around the same time, probably 1922, House's mother died. In later years, he was still angry about his marriage and said of Carrie, \\"She wasn't nothin' but one of them New Orleans whores\\".  House's resentment of farming extended to the many menial jobs he took as a young adult. He moved frequently, on one occasion taking off to East Saint Louis to work in a steel plant. The one job he enjoyed was on a Louisiana horse ranch, which later he celebrated by wearing a cowboy hat in his performances. He found an escape from manual labor when, following a conversion experience (\\"getting religion\\") in his early twenties, he was accepted as a paid pastor, first in the Baptist Church and then in the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church. However, he fell into habits which conflicted with his calling--drinking like his father and probably also womanizing. This led him after several years of conflict to leave the church, ceasing his full-time commitment, although he continued to preach sermons from time to time. How long was he a pastor?","output":"Son House was a pastor for a few years in his early twenties. His stint as a pastor began after a conversion experience (\\"getting religion\\"), and he was a paid pastor in both the Baptist Church and the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church during that time. However, he eventually left the church due to personal conflicts and habits, such as drinking and possibly womanizing, which contradicted his religious commitment. Despite leaving his full-time pastoral position, Son House continued to preach sermons occasionally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She wrote a book – Come As You Are. Here’s a secret: the entire sexology community was eager to get their mitts on her book, it was very exciting. I can’t recall the last time there was that much hullabaloo about one book. In this important book, Dr Nagoski explains the interplay between sexual desire and stress — a concept that gives us a unique insight into what is going on in women’s sex lives. THE ACCELERATOR AND THE BRAKES This concept is a big deal. Think of the accelerator and the brake of a car. Each pedal acts independently from one another; you can press on the accelerator and you can stomp on the brakes. You can even press both at the same time. We don’t often press them at the same time – in fact, I was specifically told NOT to do that in driver’s ed – but anyhow, pretend you do. If you press both pedals all the way to the floor of the car, do you stop or go? That’s right, you STOP! Ok, now get this, your brake pedal is all the stress you have and your accelerator is your sexual desire. In the same way that the brake and accelerator of a car are two separate pedals yet also inextricably linked, so are your stress and your arousal. They are not the same things, yet have everything to do with one another. If your stress level is high, the majority of women have brakes that turn on, meaning, no matter how much sexy stuff is going on around her, she does not want sex at all. It is like she is pressing down the brakes and the accelerator at the same time. This isn’t the case for all women; some women have extremely sensitive brakes or extremely sensitive accelerators. And as Nagoski has found, while this correlation between stress and sexual desire is more common for women, men experience it too (just not quite as often).

Movie plot title: Man on Fire Movie plot: In Mexico City, criminal gangs are kidnapping rich people and extorting their families for the lucrative ransom money. A young man, \\"Eighteen,\\" is walking through the city streets with his girlfriend, and he is kidnapped. As police detective Victor Fuentes (Jesús Ochoa) consoles the family, Eighteen's wealthy father receives a call from human trafficker Daniel Sanchez (Gustavo Sánchez Parra), who is very interested in Eighteen's ten million dollar life insurance policy. The father and Fuentes arrange a dead drop, and Eighteen is found near a freeway overpass, blindfolded and in his underwear, but alive. Mexican businessman Samuel Ramos (Marc Anthony) discusses this incident with his attorney Jordan Kalfus (Mickey Rourke), as it has convinced Ramos' wife, Lisa (Radha Mitchell), that they need to hire a bodyguard for their nine-year-old daughter Lupita \\"Pita\\" Ramos (Dakota Fanning). Ramos is reluctant to do this, and it is implied that he is having financial problems, as Pita had a bodyguard until recently but they had to let him go. Kalfus reminds Ramos that he needs to hire another bodyguard in order to renew the family's ransom insurance, and recommends he talk to Paul Rayburn (Christopher Walken), a former CIA agent who now runs an executive security firm. Rayburn refers the family to his old CIA buddy John Creasy (Denzel Washington).Ramos is impressed with Creasy's résumé, which includes a variety of counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism activities. However, Creasy is burned out from all the death and horror and has taken to alcoholism to ease the burden. He even attempts suicide, which fails when his gun misfires. Rayburn attributes this to a bullet's tendency to find its way to truly deserving targets. Creasy is not interested in bodyguard work and even less with the youngster, but he needs a job.

At the beginning of the movie, Creasy is a burnt-out former CIA agent who has become an alcoholic to cope with the trauma from his past experiences in counterinsurgency and counter-terrorism activities. When Creasy is hired as Pita's bodyguard, he initially shows little interest in the job and even less interest in connecting with Pita. However, as time goes by and he spends more time with her, he starts to open up to the young girl and begins to care for her genuinely. As their relationship develops, Creasy takes on more of a fatherly role in Pita's life, coaching her in swimming lessons and competitions, and providing advice and guidance in the absence of her parents. Through his relationship with Pita, Creasy finds a sense of purpose and redemption. This connection helps him overcome his self-destructive behavior, including his reliance on alcohol. As he allows himself to connect with Pita and focus on her well-being, he stops using alcohol as a coping mechanism, making a positive change in his life.

Article:Consisting of two regions separated by some 640 miles of the South China Sea, Malaysia is a multi-ethnic, multi-religious federation of 13 states and three federal territories. The majority Muslim ethnic Malay are dominant politically, and benefit from positive discrimination in business, education and the civil service, but a large ethnic Chinese minority holds economic power. The communities coexist in relative harmony, although there is little racial interaction, and a religious divide persists. The country is benefiting from a growth in manufacturing, and is a major tourist destination, but there are fears that development could harm the environment, particularly the rainforests of northern Borneo, which are under pressure from palm oil plantations and illegal logging.

The post of paramount ruler is rotated every five years among the sultans of the nine Malay kingdoms. Prime minister: Najib Abdul Razak Najib Razak, the scion of an longstanding Malaysian political dynasty, assumed the post of prime minister following the resignation of his predecessor in 2009. He was sworn in for a second term after the National Front coalition won the 2013 elections with a weakened majority to extend its unbroken, 56-year rule, in the face of the strongest opposition ever. Opponents alleged major electoral fraud. On coming to power, Mr Najib pledged radical reforms and a more transparent government, including closing closing a widening ethnic and religious divide, after ethnic minorities shifted towards the opposition in large numbers in the 2008 polls, fearing their rights were being eroded. But his rise to power was marked by a government crackdown on the resurgent opposition, with allegations that strong-arm tactics were being used to stifle political dissent. Malaysia has some of the toughest censorship laws in the world. The authorities exert substantial control over the media and can impose restrictions in the name of national security. TV3 is the leading national private, terrestrial broadcaster. Privately-owned TVs have close ties to the ruling National Front coalition, while state outlets reflect government views, says US-based Freedom House. Most privately-owned print titles are run by parties or business groups allied with the ruling coalition. Newspapers must renew their publication licences annually, and the home minister can suspend or revoke publishing permits. The internet has become the main platform for free discussion and for exposing political corruption, says Freedom House. But Malaysia is listed as a country \\"under surveillance\\" in Reporters Without Borders' (RSF) \\"Enemies of the Internet\\" report.

To protect its seagoing interests and trade routes, Portugal established strategic garrisons in Goa (India), Malacca (East Indies), and Hormuz in the Persian Gulf. Portuguese explorers then embarked upon Macau (now Macao), the Congo, and various other parts of Africa, including the Sudan. The Portuguese policy was to avoid armed strife and to develop a trade empire, rather than to conquer nations. To this end it succeeded with relatively few blood-soaked episodes in its colonial history. Adventures abroad, however, proved disastrous during the second half of the 16th century. In 1557 the 14-year-old boy-king Sebastião ascended the throne, the beginning of a calamitous reign that was to end at the battle of Alcacer-Quiber (Morocco) in pursuit of a vain crusade. Sebastião's untimely demise, alongside some 18,000 ill-prepared, badly led followers, set the stage for a crisis of succession. For many years afterwards, legends and rumors bizarrely insisted that the king was still alive, and imposters turned up from time to time claiming the throne; those who were plausible enough to be deemed a threat were summarily executed. In fact, the only rightful claimant to the crown was the elderly Prince Henry. But after two years of alternating between the throne and his sickbed, he died, heirless. Surveying the situation and smelling an opportunity, Spain occupied the power vacuum, and Portugal's neighbor and long-time antagonist became its master. Spanish rule dictated Portugal's inadvertent involvement in Spain's ongoing wars. In 1587 a squadron of British ships commanded by Francis Drake attacked the Algarve (now a \\"legitimate target\\" as Spanish territory) and sacked Sagres, thus depriving the world of the relics of Henry the Navigator. Nine years later Faro was torched. The 1386 Treaty of Windsor, by which Britain and Portugal had pledged eternal friendship, seemed a distant memory. Portugal's empire was gradually eroded, and many of its trading posts (with the notable exception of Brazil) were picked off by the British and Dutch. Finally, after 60 years of Spanish rule, Portuguese noblemen (aided by the French, then at war with Spain) organized a palace coup and restored independence. The Great Disaster Portugal's greatest misfortune struck on All Saint's Day, 1 November 1755.

The book describes him as a liberal and a victim of the Tsarist regime. In Poland the book was published under the title Death of the Poet. In 1937, the town of Tsarskoye Selo was renamed Pushkin in his honour. There are several museums in Russia dedicated to Pushkin, including two in Moscow, one in Saint Petersburg, and a large complex in Mikhaylovskoye. Pushkin's death was portrayed in the 2006 biographical film Pushkin: The Last Duel. The film was directed by Natalya Bondarchuk. Pushkin was portrayed onscreen by Sergei Bezrukov. The Pushkin Trust was established in 1987 by the Duchess of Abercorn to commemorate the creative legacy and spirit of her ancestor and to release the creativity and imagination of the children of Ireland by providing them with opportunities to communicate their thoughts, feelings and experiences. A minor planet, 2208 Pushkin, discovered in 1977 by Soviet astronomer Nikolai Stepanovich Chernykh, is named after him. A crater on Mercury is also named in his honour. MS Alexandr Pushkin, second ship of the Russian Ivan Franko class (also referred to as \\"poet\\" or \\"writer\\" class). Station of Tashkent metro was named in his honour. The Pushkin Hills and Pushkin Lake were named in his honour in Ben Nevis Township, Cochrane District, in Ontario, Canada. UN Russian Language Day, established by the United Nations in 2010 and celebrated each year on 6 June, was scheduled to coincide with Pushkin's birthday.  Question: \\"Was Pushkin internationally known?\\" Answer: \\"Yes, there are honors to him in Russia, Ireland, and Canada\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Options: (A). no (B). yes","output":"Answer: (B). yes Pushkin was internationally known, as the paragraph mentions honors dedicated to him in different countries such as Russia, Ireland, and Canada.

This widespread recognition indicates that he was known internationally. The answer (A). no is incorrect because the paragraph provides substantial evidence of his international recognition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Each website and application entails different social expectations, some of which may be unmentioned. Browse the Internet to determine what forms these expectations can take. It is often considered common courtesy, for example, to message a distant acquaintance on Facebook with a brief greeting before adding them as a friend. If a website or application does list any social expectations, of course, it is good practice to follow them. Many online forums, including the more updated and newfangled Reddit, will list their rules of engagement. Breaking these rules can lead to social exclusion and, at worst, banishment from the site or application. Note that online forums will often contain different messaging boards with their own unique sets of rules--don't presume that one subforum's rules will necessarily apply to another subforum. For example, Reddit's messaging board \\"askphilosophy\\" permits you to post open-ended questions, but its messaging board \\"philosophy\\" only permits you to post questions that are followed by some sort of argument or position. Meeting people online can be incredibly intimidating, but at some point the only way to succeed is simply by going forth and actually engaging people! Remember that the relative anonymity of the Internet means that you'll be able to retreat from uncomfortable situations at any time, which is helpful to remember if you end up needing to escape an awkward interaction. On the other hand, this same anonymity is what enables certain individuals to act more rashly or harshly than they otherwise would, and so it is important to disengage with these individuals and realize that their opinions have no bearing on the real, offline you. The anonymity of the Internet also means that you can never quite be assured of who you are dealing with. Never give out more personal information than you are comfortable giving out. Never agree to go anywhere or do anything that makes you feel uncomfortable. Trust your gut feeling about a situation. If you ever feel threatened, reach out out to the moderators of the website or application or find the link to report the individual in question. If you need additional support, you can contact a cyberbullying hotline managed by people who understand your situation.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of understanding and following social expectations while using different websites and applications, being cautious with personal information, and navigating online interactions with a focus on safety and courtesy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: who is an employee of the gym? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Burn After Reading Context: Faced with a demotion at work due to a drinking problem, Osbourne Cox angrily quits his job as a CIA analyst and resolves to write a memoir about his life and career. When his pediatrician wife Katie finds out, she sees it as a justifiable opportunity to file for divorce and continue her adulterous affair unimpeded. Taking her lawyer's advice, she copies financial records and several other files from her husband's computer onto a CD. These files contain a rambling, meaningless diatribe by Cox on purported CIA activities. When the CD gets left on the locker room floor of Hardbodies, a local gym, by a careless law firm employee, it falls into the hands of dim-witted personal trainer Chad Feldheimer and his co-worker Linda Litzke, who mistakenly believe the numerical data in the Coxes' bank records, and especially, Cox's diatribes, to be highly sensitive government information. After getting the data traced back to Osbourne, who thinks his memoirs have been stolen, Chad and Linda plan to give the disc back to him for a reward, with Linda planning to use the money to pay for plastic surgery. When a phone call and subsequent meeting with Osbourne provoke a furious reaction and go horribly wrong, Chad and Linda turn over the disc to the Russian embassy, offering more information in return for monetary compensation. With no other data to give them, Linda persuades Chad to sneak into the Coxes' home to get more files from their computer. Meanwhile, Osbourne's increasingly erratic behavior, aggravated in part by his encounters with Chad and Linda, prompt Katie to move ahead with the divorce proceedings. She changes the locks on their house, forcing Osbourne to move onto the sailboat they have docked on the Chesapeake Bay. With her husband out of the picture, Katie invites her lover, Harry Pfarrer, to move in. A womanizing, multi-adulterous deputy U.S. Marshal, Harry is coincidentally also secretly seeing Linda. Harry finds Chad, whom Linda sent to find more files on Osbourne, hiding in a wardrobe in the Coxes' home,...

It was located in the area where the navigable Ljubljanica came closest to Castle Hill. The river played an important role as a transport route for the trade between the city and the rest of Roman empire. From the late 4th to the late 6th century, Emona was the seat of a bishopric that had intensive contacts with the ecclesiastical circle of Milan, reflected in the architecture of the early Christian complex along Erjavec Street in present-day Ljubljana.  - The Gulf of Trieste (, ) is a very shallow bay of the Adriatic Sea, in the extreme northern part of the Adriatic Sea.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more insulin will be released happens, how will it affect LESS regulation of blood sugar level being needed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of more insulin being released can have an indirect effect on the process. When more insulin than needed is released, it will cause the body to absorb more glucose than necessary from the blood, leading to lower blood sugar levels. As a result, less regulation of blood sugar levels is needed as the body has already significantly decreased the glucose levels in the blood. However, this can also lead to an imbalance, as overly low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) can cause various symptoms and complications. In response to this situation, cells in the pancreas will release glucagon, causing the liver to convert stored glycogen into glucose and increasing blood sugar levels back to normal. In this way, the perturbation of more insulin being released can indirectly affect the process by causing a temporary imbalance in blood sugar levels, ultimately leading to the body's regulatory mechanisms attempting to restore normal glucose levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the last half of the film, he becomes intruder himself, returning in ancient french colony in the hope of atoning for the past.  The overall tone is bitter rather than pathetic, full of regrets and guilts, sense of failure being more or less dominant. This is a quite grim picture of an old age, ostensibly self-dependent but hopelessly void and lonely inside.

The second sentence, \\"Taliban prison break: 250 militants escape after attack on Pakistan jail,\\" provides more detailed information about the event. It specifies that the militants involved are from the Taliban, offers the number of escapees (250), and emphasizes that the jailbreak happened after an attack on a prison in Pakistan.  While the second sentence offers more specific information, both sentences generally convey the same event and are quite similar in meaning.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: I was about 14 and lived near a large tract of undeveloped land where people would go and park to fool around. There was a dirt road through the tract, but further down, it crossed two huge concrete pipes. The dirt was washed out between them, and the deep gulch made it impossible to cross in a car. Sometimes, eight or ten of us would go looking for parked cars. If we found one or more, we would go move this incredibly heavy stump onto the road and lay a telephone pole across it. It took all of us and it was incredibly heavy. It was impossible to drive around it because of the ditches and there was no way two or three people could move it. We'd go back to the car and set off a big string of fire crackers or shake the cat and slap on it and run like crazy. We'd watch from the woods as they drove like heck and come to a screeching stop at our roadblock. The guy would get out and try to lift the pole. Never happen. Then the car would drive the other way. That wouldn't happen because of the pipes. We'd go home leaving them in there. This was before cell phones, and it was miles to a pay phone. We'd go back the next day and find the stump and pole moved. We thought it was real funny until one night we set it up and beat on the trunk of a car. A couple was inside, getting it on. We hadn't noticed a guy sitting on the hood with a bottle of booze and a pistol. As we ran, he was shooting and we could hear bullets going through the underbrush. No one was hit, thank goodness. That was the end of that stunt. How does the group (or some) of boys feel after the shooting episode? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Thankful they were not hit  B. not enough information  C. Amused about the episode  D. Consider it fun to continue looking for parked cars The answer is:","output":"A. Thankful they were not hit In the given passage, it is mentioned that the group of boys carried out this prank multiple times, causing inconvenience to people who had parked their cars in the undeveloped land. They thought it was funny until one night, they encountered a man with a gun who started shooting at them as they ran away. It is expressed that the boys could hear bullets whizzing through the underbrush, but luckily, no one was hit. After this frightening experience, the boys decided to put an end to their prank. It can be inferred from the story that the group of boys, or at least some of them, felt thankful that they were not hit during the shooting episode. Their decision to stop performing the stunt after this incident indicates that they likely recognized the potential dangers associated with their actions and were grateful that they made it out unharmed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Rasputin was born a peasant in the small village of Pokrovskoye, along the Tura River in the Tobolsk guberniya (now Tyumen Oblast) in Siberia. According to official records, he was born on 21 January [O.S. 9 January] 1869, and christened the following day. He was named for St. Gregory of Nyssa, whose feast was celebrated on January 10. There are few records of Rasputin's parents. Context: In 1897, Rasputin developed a renewed interest in religion, and left Pokrovskoye to go on a pilgrimage. His reasons for doing so are unclear: according to some sources, Rasputin left the village to escape punishment for his role in a horse theft. Other sources suggest that he had a vision - either of the Virgin Mary, or of St. Simeon of Verkhoturye - while still others suggest that Rasputin's pilgrimage was inspired by his interactions with a young theological student, Melity Zaborovsky. Whatever his reasons, Rasputin's departure was a radical life change: he was twenty-eight, had been married ten years, and had an infant son with another child on the way. According to Douglas Smith, his decision \\"could only have been occasioned by some sort of emotional or spiritual crisis.\\"  Rasputin had undertaken earlier, shorter pilgrimages to the Holy Znamensky Monastery at Abalak and to Tobolsk's cathedral, but his visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897 was transformative. There, he met and was \\"profoundly humbled\\" by a starets (elder) known as Makary. Rasputin may have spent several months at Verkhoturye, and it was perhaps here that he learned to read and write, but he later complained about the monastery itself, claiming that some of the monks engaged in homosexuality and criticizing monastic life as too coercive. He returned to Pokrovskoye a changed man, looking disheveled and behaving differently than he had before. He became a vegetarian, swore off alcohol, and prayed and sang much more fervently than he had in the past.  Rasputin would spend the years that followed living as a Strannik, (a holy wanderer, or pilgrim), leaving Pokrovskoye for months or even years at a time to wander the country and visit a variety of different holy sites. It is possible that Rasputin wandered as far Athos, Greece - the center of Orthodox monastic life - in 1900.  By the early 1900s, Rasputin had developed a small circle of acolytes, primarily family members and other local peasants, who prayed with him on Sundays and other holy days when he was in Pokrovskoye. Building a makeshift chapel in Efim's root cellar - Rasputin was still living within his father's household at the time - the group held secret prayer meetings there. These meetings were the subject of some suspicion and hostility from the village priest and other villagers. It was rumored that female followers were ceremonially washing him before each meeting, that the group sang strange songs that the villagers had not heard before, and even that Rasputin had joined the Khlysty, a religious sect whose ecstatic rituals were rumored to included self-flagellation and sexual orgies. According to historian Joseph Fuhrmann, however, \\"repeated investigations failed to establish that Rasputin was ever a member of the sect,\\" and rumors that he was a Khlyst appear to have been unfounded. Question: Did he learn anything while on pilgrimage?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Rasputin learned several things while on pilgrimage. During his transformative visit to the St. Nicholas Monastery at Verkhoturye in 1897, he met and was profoundly humbled by a starets (elder) named Makary. It was during this time that Rasputin may have learned to read and write. Additionally, his experiences at the monastery and during his travels as a Strannik (holy wanderer) influenced his spiritual beliefs and practices, leading to significant changes in his behavior and lifestyle upon his return to Pokrovskoye."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Hattie McDaniel (June 10, 1895 - October 26, 1952) was an American stage actress, professional singer-songwriter, and comedian. She is best known for her role as \\"Mammy\\" in Gone with the Wind (1939), for which she won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, the first Academy Award won by an African American entertainer. In addition to acting in many films, McDaniel was a radio performer and television star; she was the first black woman to sing on radio in the United States. She appeared in over 300 films, although she received screen credits for only 80 or so. The whereabouts of McDaniel's Oscar are currently unknown. In 1992, Jet magazine reported that Howard University could not find it and alleged that it had disappeared during protests in the 1960s. In 1998, Howard University stated that it could find no written record of the Oscar having arrived at Howard. In 2007, an article in the Huffington Post repeated rumors that the Oscar had been cast into the Potomac River by angry civil rights protesters in the 1960s. The assertion reappeared in the Huffington Post under the same byline in 2009.  In 2010, Mo'Nique, the winner of the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, wearing a blue dress and gardenias in her hair, as McDaniel had at the ceremony in 1940, in her acceptance speech thanked McDaniel \\"for enduring all that she had to so that I would not have to\\". Her speech revived interest in the whereabouts of McDaniel's plaque. In 2011, J. Freedom duLac reported in the Washington Post that the plaque had disappeared in the 1960s.  In November 2011, W. B. Carter, of the George Washington University Law School, published the results of her year-and-a-half-long investigation into the Oscar's fate. Carter rejected claims that students had stolen the Oscar (and thrown it in the Potomac River) as wild speculation or fabrication that traded on long-perpetuated stereotypes of blacks. She questioned the sourcing of the Huffington Post stories. Instead, she argued that the Oscar was likely returned to Howard University's Channing Pollack Theater Collection between the spring of 1971 and the summer of 1973 or had possibly been boxed and stored in the drama department at that time. The reason for its removal, she argued, was not civil rights unrest but rather efforts to make room for a new generation of black performers. If neither the Oscar nor any paper trail of its ultimate destiny can be found at Howard today, she suggested, inadequate storage or record-keeping in a time of financial constraints and national turbulence may be blamed. She also suggested that a new generation of caretakers may have failed to realize the historic significance of the 5 1/2\\" x 6\\" plaque.

We live along coastlines, around bays, up the course of rivers and streams and on islands. We also vacation at the beach and find comfort fishing on a lake. Nothing makes small children happier than the chance of playing in water.  More surprisingly, this human favor for water makes evolutionary sense. Sure, we need drinking water to live, but we have also benefited from what's swimming under the waves.  Neuroscientist Crawford of the University of North London has proposed that our ancient ancestors attached to the sea, and that their devotion paid off by allowing the human species to develop large and complex brains.  Crawford claims that when humans separated from apes and appeared in the forests of Africa, they stuck close to rivers and beaches and started catching fish, clams and crabs. That seafood was packed with omega-3 fatty acids, essential fatty acids that promote brain cell growth.  It's no coincidence, Crawford claims, that human brain growth began to increase rapidly once we left the woods and headed for the beach.   Scientists have also discovered that people who eat fish regularly are less likely to suffer from depression than those who eat less seafood. Biochemist Hibbelin of the National Institutes of Health has shown that across cultures there is a direct link between amount of fish eaten each week and rates of depression. More interestingly, Hibbelin and researcher Laura have found that fish is commonly used as a symbol of happiness and good health in various religions and cultures.  We know that fish and the sea are good for us, and so we seek them out. We vacation on the coast and see the waves come and go, feeling happiness has taken over our brain. When we move inland, or go home from vacation, we lose touch with our sea roots and feel unhappy. Human beings have benefited a lot from seafood because   _  . A) seafood has enough water and is fresh B) fishes in the sea have large and complex brains C) our ancestors had nothing to eat but seafood D) it is abundant in fatty acids promoting brain cell growth A:","output":"Human beings have benefited a lot from seafood because it is abundant in fatty acids promoting brain cell growth. Seafood is packed with omega-3 fatty acids, which are essential for the development and maintenance of the brain. These fatty acids have not only contributed to the evolution of the human brain but also have been linked to lower rates of depression and improved mental health in those who consume fish regularly.

Her edgy lyrics are another aspect that draws praise. Sentence 2, on the other hand, discusses the following: 1. Time regards Badu as a thrilling new voice in pop music. 2.

Available choices: a). no; b). yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Does anyone have an idea about the time line of Visa Sub Class 189 for Australia? After submitting Medical and PCC, how much maximum time will it require? Answer 1: The Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189) is an Australian permanent residency visa for skilled workers who meet the required criteria and pass the point test. The processing time for the subclass 189 visa can vary depending on various factors such as application volumes, seasonal fluctuations, and the complexity of individual applications. However, the approximate processing time for the visa subclass 189 can be broken down as follows: 1. Invitations to apply: Once you have submitted your Expression of Interest (EOI) to apply for the visa, you may receive an invitation to apply. The invitation rounds are generally conducted by the Department of Home Affairs twice a month, although the dates can vary. Only the highest-ranking EOIs receive invitations, and the cut-off scores vary each round. 2. Visa application preparation and submission: Once you receive an invitation to apply, you have 60 days to submit your visa application, gather all the required documents, and pay the application fees. This timeframe may vary depending on how quickly you gather and submit all of the required information. 3. Medical and character assessments: The time it takes to complete Medical examinations and the submission of the Police Clearance Certificate (PCC) can vary depending on the individual's circumstances, local infrastructures, and processing times of the concerned authorities. The medical examination results are typically valid for 12 months, and the PCC is generally valid for a year. 4. Visa processing time: According to the Department of Home Affairs, the current processing time for 75% of the subclass 189 applications is around 6 months, while 90% of applications are processed within 8 months. This can vary based on the workload of the immigration authorities and the specific details of your application. In summary, after submitting your Medical and PCC, the processing time can range from a few weeks to a few months depending on various factors. It's essential to monitor the status of your application regularly and provide any additional information requested by the authorities promptly. Question 2: Can I apply for a 189 visa while I am on a 190 visa in Australia?  Answer 2: Yes. If you are currently in Australia on a Skilled Nominated visa (subclass 190), you can still apply for the Skilled Independent visa (subclass 189) if you meet the eligibility requirements. You would need to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI) for the subclass 189 visa through the SkillSelect system and, if you receive an invitation to apply, submit a visa application alongside the required documents, fees, and medical and character assessments. It is essential to note that you must continue to meet and fulfill the conditions of your subclass 190 visa while your subclass 189 application is being processed. Also, receiving an invitation to apply for a subclass 189 visa does not guarantee visa grant: your application will be subject to the standard eligibility requirements, assessment, and processing guidelines. In conclusion, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is related to the processing timeline of the Visa Subclass 189 for Australia. In contrast, Question 2 asks about the possibility of applying for a Subclass 189 visa while already in Australia on a Subclass 190 visa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a world of bills and advertisements, people love receiving handwritten mail, but the benefits of writing a letter don’t stop there. Studies show that expressive writing can actually help you have a more positive view of the world.   You can write to someone far away or someone you see every day. Writing gives you the opportunity to express yourself in a way that you might not be able to in day-to-day conversation. Want to let someone know that you really love her? Want to share the struggle you’ve been having with a big decision, such as your next career move or where you want to go to college? Writing a letter will not only help you create a more intimate bond with the receiver; it will also help you to process some of these thoughts. If you express yourself better through images than with words, why not draw a picture to send someone? Who doesn’t like receiving a piece of art created just for them? Coloring is in right now, no matter what your age. More and more people are discovering the benefits of dusting off the Crayolas.

Sir Clifford wants me to find him a new groom , about twenty or twenty-one, who knows his business. His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him and get into his ways, who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into *his* place OPT: *no. *yes. The answer is:","output":"Yes, the \\"old coachman\\" and \\"his\\" in the sentence do refer to the same person. In the context presented, \\"his\\" is a pronoun referring back to \\"old coachman\\". This use of \\"his\\" is known as a possessive pronoun. It is describing something that belongs to the \\"old coachman\\", specifically his place or role. The sentence, \\"His old coachman is getting feeble, and he wants a man to work with him...\\" introduces us to a character - the old coachman. The word \\"his\\" is then employed to refer back to this character throughout the rest of the sentence. Therefore, when the sentence says \\"...who would be able, when the old man was pensioned off, to step into *his* place\\", it means the new groom would take over the position or role of the old coachman when he is pensioned off. So, in conclusion, \\"his\\" is used as a pronoun to replace and refer back to the previously mentioned old coachman. It's a common trait in English language (and many other languages) to use pronouns to avoid repetition and provide cohesion in text."},{"instruction":"I have a new situation: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies.  But I can use this background: The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.  What is an answer for this question: Which river had a water that contains lower concentrations of dissolved oxygen?

Thermal mass is any material that can be used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common thermal mass materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of thermal mass depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions.

What is the best way to: Heat up leftovers evenly.","output":"The best way to heat up leftovers evenly depends on the type of food and the tools available. Here are the step-by-step instructions for reheating leftovers using a microwave, as it is the most common and convenient method available in most households: 1. Choose an appropriate container: Select a microwave-safe container that is large enough to hold your leftovers. Make sure the container allows for a bit of space around the edges of the food so that heat can circulate evenly. 2. Arrange food properly: Spread the leftovers out in an even layer within the container. If possible, arrange larger and denser items towards the outside of the container, while smaller and less dense items can be placed towards the center. This helps promote even heating since microwaves tend to heat the outer edges of the food first. 3. Add a splash of moisture: If the leftovers seem dry, add a small amount of liquid (such as water, broth, or sauce) to help them rehydrate and prevent overcooking. Alternatively, you can place a damp paper towel over the food to provide some additional moisture. 4. Use microwave-safe covering: Place a microwave-safe cover or lid on the container, but leave a small opening to allow steam to escape. This helps food to heat more evenly while also preventing moisture loss. 5. Use the appropriate power setting: Start by microwaving your leftovers at 50%-70% power for longer periods to allow heat to penetrate the food evenly. Most microwaves have a \\"reheat\\" or \\"defrost\\" setting, which is ideal for reheating leftovers. 6. Stir or rotate the food regularly: To promote even heating, pause the microwave halfway through the reheat time and carefully stir or rearrange the food. Be cautious when removing the lid or cover, as hot steam can escape rapidly. 7. Check the temperature: After stirring or rotating the food, continue microwaving until the leftovers reach a safe internal temperature of 165°F (74°C). Use a food thermometer to check for doneness. 8. Let the food rest: Remove the container from the microwave and let the leftovers stand for a minute or two to allow the temperature to equalize throughout the dish. 9. Serve: Once the food has rested and is evenly heated, serve and enjoy your leftovers. Remember that not all foods are safe to reheat in a microwave, as some can become overcooked or lose their texture. If you're unsure about how to reheat a specific dish, it's best to consult the original cooking instructions or check for recommendations online."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - The First French Empire, was the empire of Napoleon Bonaparte of France and the dominant power in much of continental Europe at the beginning of the 19th century. Its name was a misnomer, as France already had colonies overseas and was short lived compared to the Colonial Empire.  - Charles Percier ( ( al psje ) ; 22 August 1764 -- 5 September 1838 ) was a neoclassical French architect , interior decorator and designer , who worked in a close partnership with Pierre François Léonard Fontaine , originally his friend from student days . For work undertaken from 1794 onward , trying to ascribe conceptions or details to one or other of them is fruitless ; it is impossible to disentangle their cooperative efforts in this fashion . Together , Percier and Fontaine were inventors and major proponents of the rich , grand , consciously - archaeological versions of neoclassicism we recognise as Directoire style and Empire style . Following Charles Percier 's death in 1838 , Fontaine designed a tomb in their characteristic style in the Pere Lachaise Cemetery . Percier and Fontaine had lived together as well as being colleagues . Fontaine married late in life and after his death in 1853 his body was placed in the same tomb according to his wishes .  - The Empire style, , the second phase of Romanticism, is an early-nineteenth-century design movement in architecture, furniture, other decorative arts, and the visual arts that flourished between 1800 and 1815 during the Consulate and the First French Empire periods, although its life span lasted until the late 1820s (or more in some countries).

Article: There's no pizza on Mars, but scientists have found a solution to this problem for hungry astronauts: a pizza printer! NASA, the American space agency, has developed a machine that \\"prints\\" food. They showed a model of the printer in Austin, Texas last month. How does it work? Cartridges  filled with powdered dough , cheese, sauce, water and oil put the ingredients layer by layer onto a printer bed. The printer bed, which gets hot from below, cooks the food as it's being printed. Since most of the ingredients are powdered, they can be sent into space and stored for many years without going bad. Water makes food go sour, so the food powders are mixed with water and oil only when they are being printed. \\"Long-distance space travel requires more than 15 years of shelf life for food.\\" says Anjan Contractor, whose company developing the printer. \\" We take water out, and in that form, food will last maybe 30 years.\\" In outer space, there are far fewer choices for astronauts for dinner.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In the early 1990s, Louis-Dreyfus became famous for the role of Elaine Benes on NBC's Seinfeld. She played the role for nine seasons, appearing in all but three episodes. One of the episodes that she did not appear in was the inaugural pilot episode, \\"The Seinfeld Chronicles\\", because her character was not initially intended to be a part of the series. It was only after the first episode that NBC executives felt the show was too male-centric, and demanded that creators Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David add a woman to the cast. It was revealed in the commentary on the DVD package that the addition of a female character was the condition for commissioning the show. Louis-Dreyfus won the role over several other actresses who would also eventually enjoy their own TV success, including Patricia Heaton, Rosie O'Donnell and Megan Mullally.  On the \\"Notes About Nothing\\" featurette on the DVD package, Seinfeld says that Louis-Dreyfus' ability to eat a peanut M&M without breaking the peanut aptly describes the actress: \\"She cracks you up without breaking your nuts.\\"  Her performance on the series was met with critical acclaim, and she was a regular winner and nominee at television award shows throughout the 1990s. Her performance earned her two Golden Globe Award nominations, winning once in 1994, nine Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, winning one in 1995 and two in both 1997 and 1998, and seven American Comedy Awards, winning five times in 1993, 1994, 1995, 1997 and 1998. In 1996, she received the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, an award she was nominated for on seven occasions from 1992 to 1998. After receiving the award, Louis-Dreyfus claimed the win was a \\"shocker\\", and that after being in both positions, it was \\"much better to win than to lose.\\"  In 1998, Seinfeld decided to end the series after nine seasons. The series finale aired on May 14 and was one of the most watched TV events in history, with over 76 million people tuning in.  During her time on Seinfeld she appeared in several films, including Fathers' Day, opposite Robin Williams and Billy Crystal, and Woody Allen's Oscar-nominated Deconstructing Harry.

Bowie's songs and stagecraft brought a new dimension to popular music in the early 1970s, strongly influencing both its immediate forms and its subsequent development. Bowie was a pioneer of glam rock, according to music historians Schinder and Schwartz, who credited Marc Bolan and Bowie with creating the genre. At the same time, he inspired the innovators of the punk rock music movement. When punk musicians were \\"noisily reclaiming the three-minute pop song in a show of public defiance\\", biographer David Buckley wrote that \\"Bowie almost completely abandoned traditional rock instrumentation.\\" Bowie's record company promoted his unique status in popular music with the slogan, \\"There's old wave, there's new wave, and there's David Bowie\\".Musicologist James Perone credited Bowie with having \\"brought sophistication to rock music\\", and critical reviews frequently acknowledged the intellectual depth of his work and influence. The Human League founder Martyn Ware remarked that he had lived his life \\"as though he were an art installation.\\" The BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz likened Bowie to Pablo Picasso, writing that he was \\"an innovative, visionary, restless artist who synthesised complex avant garde concepts into beautifully coherent works that touched the hearts and minds of millions\\". U2 lead singer Bono commented, \\"I like Bowie when he’s evenly pulled in the direction of being a pop star and Picasso, where he's right down the middle.

What is the final step of the following process: -  Magma cools inside the crust - Magma crystalizes - Lava cools on the surface - Lava crystalizes The answer to this question is:","output":"The final step of the process involving the formation of igneous rocks, which begins with the cooling of magma inside the Earth's crust, the crystallization of magma, the cooling of lava on the Earth's surface, and the crystallization of lava, is the formation and integration of these newly formed igneous rocks into the rock cycle. Igneous rocks, derived from the cooling and crystallization of both magma and lava, are classified into two main types: intrusive and extrusive. Intrusive igneous rocks form when magma cools and crystallizes within the Earth's crust. On the other hand, extrusive igneous rocks form when lava cools and crystallizes on the Earth's surface. These rocks have distinct textures and mineral compositions based on their cooling rates and chemical compositions.  After these igneous rocks have formed, they undergo various processes as part of the rock cycle, including weathering, erosion, sedimentation, and metamorphism. Over time, igneous rocks gradually break down due to weathering and erosion agents such as water, ice, wind, and biologic activity. As they break down, they become small fragments or sediments, which are transported and eventually deposited by natural processes like water or wind. In turn, these sediments accumulate in layers, becoming compacted and cemented together to form sedimentary rocks.  Through the dynamic processes of the Earth, these sedimentary rocks can eventually be buried deep within the Earth's crust, subjecting them to extreme heat and pressure, which causes them to metamorphose into metamorphic rocks. If the metamorphic rocks experience even further heating, they may melt and return to the state of magma, effectively starting the whole process over again. In conclusion, the final step of the process involving the cooling and crystallization of magma and lava is the formation of igneous rocks and their integration into the rock cycle. These rocks can then be transformed into other rock types or even be recycled back into magma through the continuous processes of weathering, sedimentation, metamorphism, and melting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The news of Amundsen's conquest of the South Pole reached Shackleton on 11 March 1912, to which he responded: \\"The discovery of the South Pole will not be the end of Antarctic exploration\\". The next work, he said, would be \\"a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole\\". He was aware that others were in the field pursuing this objective. On 11 December 1911, a German expedition under Wilhelm Filchner had sailed from South Georgia, intending to penetrate deep into the Weddell Sea and establishing a base from which he would cross the continent to the Ross Sea. In late 1912 Filchner returned to South Georgia, having failed to land and set up his base. However, his reports of possible landing sites in Vahsel Bay, at around 78° latitude, were noted by Shackleton, and incorporated into his developing expedition plans.News of the deaths of Captain Scott and his companions on their return from the South Pole reached London in February 1913. Against this gloomy background Shackleton initiated preparations for his proposed journey. He solicited financial and practical support from, among others, Tryggve Gran of Scott's expedition, and the former Prime Minister Lord Rosebery, but received no help from either. Gran was evasive, and Rosebery blunt: \\"I have never been able to care one farthing about the Poles\\".Shackleton got support, however, from William Speirs Bruce, leader of the Scottish National Antarctic Expedition of 1902–1904, who had harboured plans for an Antarctic crossing since 1908, but had abandoned the project for lack of funds. Bruce generously allowed Shackleton to..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The name of the person that got a £10,000 grant in the article is not explicitly mentioned. However, it can be inferred that the person in question is Sir Ernest Shackleton. The article discusses Shackleton's various Antarctic expeditions and his desire to undertake a transcontinental journey from sea to sea, crossing the pole. Although the article does not specify the exact grant amount that Shackleton received for his expeditions, it outlines his efforts to solicit financial and practical support, and eventually, his collaboration with William Speirs Bruce, who had previously abandoned his own plans for an Antarctic crossing due to lack of funds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The story follows a young teacher, Pat Conroy (played by Jon Voight), in 1969 assigned to isolated \\"Yamacraw Island\\" (Daufuskie Island) off the coast of South Carolina and populated mostly by poor black families. He finds out that the children as well as the adults have been isolated from the rest of the world and speak a dialect called Gullah, with \\"Conrack\\" of the novel's title being the best they can do to pronounce his last name. The school has only two rooms for all grades combined, with the Principal teaching grades one through four and Conroy teaching the higher grades. Conroy discovers that the students aren't taught much and will have little hope of making a life in the larger world. Conroy tries to teach them about the outside world but comes into conflict both with the principal and Mr. Skeffington, the superintendent. He teaches them how to brush their teeth, who Babe Ruth is, and has the children listen to music, including Flight of the Bumblebee and Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.  He explains that the when Beethoven wrote the Fifth Symphony, he was writing about \\"what death would sound like\\".  He is also astounded they've never even heard of Halloween, and he decides to take them to Beaufort on the mainland to go trick-or-treating, which the superintendent has forbidden. He also must overcome parental fears of \\"the river.\\"  As a result, he's fired.  As he leaves the island for the last time, the children come out to see him leave, all of them lined up on a rickety bridge.  As he is about to leave by boat, one of the students then begins playing a record, which is the beginning movement of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony. This film was shot in and around Brunswick, Georgia and used pupils from C.B. Greer Elementary school as the cast of students. Answer:","output":"The inhabitants of Yamacraw Island refer to Jon Voight's character, Pat Conroy, as \\"Conrack.\\" The name \\"Conrack\\" is the best pronunciation they can manage of his last name, due to their dialect called Gullah, an English-based creole language spoken primarily by African Americans living on the Sea Islands and in the coastal regions of the U.S. states of North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Given the background: Evidence from seismology, heat flow at the surface, and mineral physics is combined with the Earth's mass and moment of inertia to infer models of the Earth's interior – its composition, density, temperature, pressure. For example, the Earth's mean specific gravity (5.515) is far higher than the typical specific gravity of rocks at the surface (2.7–3.3), implying that the deeper material is denser. This is also implied by its low moment of inertia ( 0.33 M R2, compared to  0.4 M R2 for a sphere of constant density). However, some of the density increase is compression under the enormous pressures inside the Earth. The effect of pressure can be calculated using the Adams–Williamson equation. The conclusion is that pressure alone cannot account for the increase in density. Instead, we know that the Earth's core is composed of an alloy of iron and other minerals.Reconstructions of seismic waves in the deep interior of the Earth show that there are no S-waves in the outer core. This indicates that the outer core is liquid, because liquids cannot support shear. The outer core is liquid, and the motion of this highly conductive fluid generates the Earth's field. Earth's inner core, however, is solid because of the enormous pressure.Reconstruction of seismic reflections in the deep interior indicate some major discontinuities in seismic velocities that demarcate the major zones of the Earth: inner core, outer core, mantle, lithosphere and crust. The mantle itself is divided into the upper mantle, transition zone, lower mantle and D′′ layer. Between the crust and the mantle is the Mohorovičić discontinuity.The seismic model of the Earth does not by itself determine the composition of the layers. For a complete model of the Earth, mineral physics is needed to interpret seismic velocities in terms of composition. The mineral properties are temperature-dependent, so the geotherm must also be determined. This requires physical theory for thermal conduction and convection and the heat contribution of radioactive elements....  and the situation: John is a geologist. He was trying to figure out how the Earth's inner core is made. To that end, he compared earth's physical characteristics to available items. First he took a sample of surface rock, which he labeled as item B. Then he took a sphere of constant density, which he labeled as item C. Finally, he labeled the Earth as item A.  Answer the following question: Would item B have higher or lower specific gravity than item A? A:","output":"Item B (the surface rock) would have a lower specific gravity than item A (the Earth)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Understand the nephron structure The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, responsible for filtering blood, removing waste products, and reabsorbing useful substances. It consists of a renal corpuscle (glomerulus and Bowman's capsule), the proximal convoluted tubule, the loop of Henle, the distal convoluted tubule, and the collecting duct system. Step 2: Identify the part responsible for glucose reabsorption The proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) is responsible for most of the reabsorption of useful substances in the nephron. The cells lining the PCT have microvilli, which increase the surface area available for reabsorption. Step 3: Understand glucose reabsorption mechanism In the PCT, glucose is reabsorbed through a process called secondary active transport. Sodium-glucose co-transporters (SGLTs) on the cell membrane of PCT cells transport glucose and sodium from the tubular fluid into the cell. This process uses the energy stored in the concentration gradient of sodium ions established by the Na+/K+ ATPase pump on the basolateral membrane of tubular cells. After glucose enters the cell, it moves into the interstitial fluid and eventually into the peritubular capillaries through facilitated diffusion via GLUT transporters. Step 4: Conclusion Based on the analysis of the nephron structure and the mechanism of glucose reabsorption, it is concluded that glucose gets reabsorbed in the proximal convoluted tubule (PCT) of the nephron."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - panic - deadlines - accomplishing - momentum - sitting down  The rationale to choose \\"panic\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Starting work after it is too late can lead to panic for several reasons. When a person begins to work late, they might feel overwhelmed by the amount of work that needs to be done in a short period of time. This sense of urgency and time pressure can result in heightened stress, anxiety, and ultimately, panic.  Panic in this context refers to a sudden feeling of extreme anxiety and fear, which can be counterproductive and impair the ability to focus and make rational decisions. Moreover, panic can reduce the overall effectiveness, quality, and efficiency of the work being done. While other choices may have some relation to beginning work late, none captures the potential consequences as accurately as \\"panic\\": - Deadlines: Although working late might be the result of approaching deadlines, it does not necessarily have to lead to panic, if managed effectively. - Accomplishing: It is possible to accomplish tasks even after starting late, but it may require extra effort or sacrifice in other areas of life. - Momentum: Building momentum could be challenging when starting work late, but not all late starts result in the failure to establish momentum. - Sitting down: This choice is unrelated to the consequences of beginning work late, as sitting down is just a description of the physical act of getting to work. In conclusion, the rationale to choose \\"panic\\" as the answer is that beginning work after it is too late can significantly increase stress levels, leading to feelings of panic and potentially hindering the overall quality and efficiency of the work being performed. Other options may be related to the situation but do not describe the potential consequences as directly or accurately as \\"panic\\" does."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lossless audio compression produces a representation of digital data that decompress to an exact digital duplicate of the original audio stream, unlike playback from lossy compression techniques such as Vorbis and MP3. Compression ratios are around 50–60% of original size, which is similar to those for generic lossless data compression. Lossless compression is unable to attain high compression ratios due to the complexity of waveforms and the rapid changes in sound forms. Codecs like FLAC, Shorten and TTA use linear prediction to estimate the spectrum of the signal. Many of these algorithms use convolution with the filter [-1 1] to slightly whiten or flatten the spectrum, thereby allowing traditional lossless compression to work more efficiently.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

Question: I have another guest post for you today. This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What does Selina think will help repair redness and brown spots from skin? Options:  A. using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser  B. use just water to cleanse  C. use abrasive soap  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"A. using a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the middle of it all was my baby. Does it follow that \\"My sock was in the middle of it.\\"?","output":"In the context of the given statement \\"In the middle of it all was my baby,\\" you are likely describing a figurative or literal situation where your baby is the focus or central point. Although the statement allows some room for interpretation, it does not necessarily mean that \\"My sock was in the middle of it.\\" To determine if the statement \\"My sock was in the middle of it\\" follows, we need to consider the context and possible interpretations surrounding the initial statement. 1) Literal interpretation: If you are describing a physical scenario, for example, a room filled with toys and other items, and your baby is sitting in the middle, it remains unclear whether the sock is also in the middle. The sock might be among the items around your baby, but without more information, we cannot definitively say that the sock is in the middle along with your baby. 2) Figurative interpretation: If the phrase \\"In the middle of it all\\" refers to a complex or chaotic situation, the baby could be the focus of the situation or serve as the reason for everything happening around them. In such a case, mentioning the sock does not seem relevant to the statement. The idea that \\"My sock was in the middle of it\\" would not follow in this interpretation because it does not connect to the main emphasis on the baby or the situation. Ultimately, the statement \\"My sock was in the middle of it\\" does not necessarily follow from the initial statement without more context or a clear connection to the baby being at the center.

Write an article based on this \\"Two of England's last deep coal mines are to close after they were refused further government funding.\\" Article:","output":"Title: The Closing of England's Last Deep Coal Mines: A Sign of Changing Times Introduction In recent years, many countries around the world have embarked on their journey towards environmental awareness and cleaner sources of energy. As a result, the focus on non-renewable resources, particularly coal, has diminished as governments turn towards alternative energy solutions. In England, a prime example of this shift can be witnessed in the closing of two of the country's last deep coal mines – Kellingley Colliery and Thoresby Colliery – which were refused further government funding. This article delves into the history of these mines, explores the reasons behind the decision to stop funding, and discusses the potential implications for the industry, affected communities, and the future of energy production in England. History of Kellingley Colliery and Thoresby Colliery Kellingley Colliery, situated in North Yorkshire, started its operations in 1965 and quickly became one of the largest coal mines in Europe. At its peak, Kellingley employed over 2,000 miners and produced more than 900,000 tonnes of coal annually. Similarly, Thoresby Colliery, located in Nottinghamshire, began its operations in 1925. Like Kellingley, Thoresby Colliery also had a strong workforce and played a significant role in England's coal production. Both Kellingley and Thoresby mines experienced coal mining accidents in their lifetime, with the loss of lives highlighting the dangers coal miners faced daily. Over the years, the demand for coal in the United Kingdom decreased due to a range of factors, including economic and environmental reasons. Reasons Behind the Decision to Stop Funding The United Kingdom's government has voiced a commitment to focusing on clean energy and reducing carbon emissions. In the mid-2010s, the UK government developed a comprehensive energy strategy to eliminate coal power plants from the country's energy landscape. The essence of this plan has led to the emergence of alternative energy projects that reduce reliance on fossil fuels, including coal. Furthermore, the government's refusal to provide further funding to the Kellingley and Thoresby mines is underpinned by the fact that the cost of maintaining deep coal mines far outweighs the benefits. The low global coal price has rendered deep coal mining lessens profitable, making it economically infeasible for the government to invest in maintaining these mines. Additionally, the rise in renewable energy significantly contributed to the diminished need for coal and, consequently, the closure of these mines. Implications for the Industry, Affected Communities, and the Future of Energy Production The closure of these mines represents a turning point in the history of England's energy production. While coal had played an essential role in England's energy consumption for centuries, the move towards renewable energy marks a pivotal change toward a sustainable energy future. The closure of Kellingley and Thoresby mines will have profound social and economic implications for the local communities. With the mines' closure, many miners have lost their jobs and sources of income, and these two regions now face the challenge of adapting to new industries and training the workforce for new employment opportunities. In terms of energy production, the closing of the last deep coal mines is indicative of the transition towards a future dominated by sustainable energy sources. Wind, solar, and tidal power are increasingly taking center stage, with the UK aiming to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Conclusion The closing of Kellingley Colliery and Thoresby Colliery symbolizes a significant chapter in England's energy history. Through this decision, the government has shown its commitment to a sustainable future free from coal dependency. While the transition presents challenges for local communities and the economy, it also ushers in a new era of sustainable energy production, propelling England forward in its quest for a greener, cleaner, and more environmentally responsible nation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But the grandfather's curiosity turned to astonishment when the bungalow's owner, after learning of his history in the house, handed him a bracelet his late mother Emily had lost decades earlier. The 66-year-old grandfather-of-six admitted he was overwhelmed to be presented with the silver trinket stamped with his mother's initials - that he didn't even know she had lost. What are the chances? David Knapp, 66, holds up the silver bracelet which belonged to his mother that he was reunited with after a chance encounter with the new owner of his childhood home. Mr Knapp's parents lived at the bungalow in Costock, Nottinghamshire, which was built by his grandfather, after they got married in 1936 until they sold it and moved to Nottingham in 1985.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Today we have the second report explaining how to prepare fish by drying or smoking them. We talked last week about the first steps of cleaning and salting freshly caught fish. To dry fish, you will need either a drying table or a place to hang them. If a table is used, it should have a top made of wire screen or thin pieces of wood with space between each piece.  Lay the cleaned, wet salted fish on top of the table. Do not let them touch each other. Be sure that air can reach the fish from all sides.       _ Turn the fish over every other day. Small fish will dry in about three days if the air is dry. Large fish will take a week or ten days to dry. After the fish have dried, place them in a basket. Cover them with clean paper or large leaves. Then put the basket in a cool, dry place off the ground.  Make sure as much of the saltwater as possible is removed before you smoke the fish. The smoking can be done in a large, round metal container. Remove the top of the drum and cut a small opening on one side at the bottom. Cover the top with a strong wire screen, where you put the fish. Build a small fire in the drum by reaching in through the opening at the bottom.  Wood from fruit trees makes good fuel for your fire.  _ will give the smoked fish good color1 and taste. One way to get a lot of smoke is to use green wood, not dried wood. You should smoke the fish for five days or longer if you plan to keep them for a long time. After that, wrap them in clean paper, put the fish in baskets and keep them in a cool, dry place off the ground. Question: In drying or smoking fish, the following tools are mentioned in the passage EXCEPT_.

Este último es el verbo en su forma \\"no conjugada\\", la manera en que lo encontramos en un diccionario: trabajar, ver, saber, etc. En inglés, los infinitivos a menudo se presentan con la palabra \\"to\\" (a, para) como prefijo, por ejemplo: \\"to work\\"(trabajar), \\"to see\\" (ver), \\"to know\\" (saber), etc.  El infinitivo representa la forma básica del verbo y no indica tiempo, modo, aspecto, voz, ni número. Para conjugar un verbo en español, es necesario obtener el radical o raíz del verbo, y luego añadir terminaciones específicas según el tiempo, el modo, el aspecto, la voz, el número y la persona. Por ejemplo, el verbo \\"trabajar\\" se transforma en \\"trabajé\\" para la primera persona del singular en pasado, y en \\"trabajaremos\\" para la primera persona del plural en futuro. De manera similar, al traducir del inglés al español, primero debemos identificar el infinitivo del verbo en inglés y luego convertirlo al infinitivo en español. Posteriormente, obtenemos el radical del verbo en español y procedemos a conjugarlo según la información contextual, como el sujeto, el tiempo, el modo, el aspecto, la voz y el número. Algunos ejemplos de equivalencias entre infinitivos en inglés y en español son: 1. To work → Trabajar 2. To see → Ver 3. To know → Saber or Conocer (dependiendo del contexto) Una vez que tengamos el infinitivo en español, podemos obtener el radical y conjugarlo apropiadamente.

Middle Ages In the 13th century mendicant orders—the Franciscans and the Dominicans—who swore vows of poverty and earned their living by begging, were approved by the papacy. Religious groups such as the Waldensians and the Humiliati also attempted to return to the life of early Christianity in the middle 12th and early 13th centuries, but they were condemned as heretical by the papacy. Others joined the Cathars, another heretical movement condemned by the papacy.

As a former admittedly avant-garde and critically reviled opera director, Jerry feels inspired to bring Giancarlos gift to the public.

Outside the safety of his shower, Giancarlos confidence abandons him. He makes faces and he is humiliated. Michelangelo, who attended the audition too, accuses Jerry of using his father to achieve some level of fame for himself. It occurs to Jerry that Giancarlo, like most people, sings the most confidently when he has some measure of privacy. In Giancarlos case, he performs best in his shower.

Paragraph: You know that friction also causes heat. Think about when you rub your hands together. It is friction that makes them warm. But why does this happen? Friction causes the molecules on rubbing surfaces to move faster. Faster moving particles have more heat energy. Heat from friction can be useful. Can you think of other places where you might find friction? Friction also lets you light a match. Heat from friction can also cause problems. It can cause a car to overheat. To reduce friction, oil is added to the engine. Oil coats the surfaces of moving parts. This coating of oil makes them slippery. When things are slippery there is less friction. Have you ever seen a sign that says, slippery when wet? This too has to do with friction. Water, like oil, can reduce friction. The wet surface may allow your shoes to slide more easily.  Question: \\"What is friction?\\" Answer: \\"Friction causes molecules to move faster in order to create heat energy\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: OPT: [1]. no [2]. yes","output":"[1]. no The answer \\"Friction causes molecules to move faster in order to create heat energy\\" is not the correct definition of friction. Friction is a force that opposes the relative motion or tendency of such motion of two surfaces in contact. The paragraph explains that friction can cause heat because the molecules on rubbing surfaces move faster, but that is an effect of friction, not its definition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? It is important the more you eat, the more careful you to be.","output":"The given sentence is not syntactically and semantically acceptable as it contains some grammatical errors and a lack of coherence in conveying the intended meaning. A syntactically and semantically acceptable version of the sentence could be: \\"It is important that the more you eat, the more careful you need to be.\\" Here's a breakdown of the changes made to the original sentence to create a more structurally and contextually accurate version: 1. Adding \\"that\\" after \\"important.\\" In the original sentence, the term \\"important\\" acts as an adjective and should be followed by the conjunction \\"that\\" to establish a clear connection between the independent clause (\\"It is important\\") and the dependent clause that provides further detail about what is important. 2. Replacing \\"you to be\\" with \\"you need to be.\\" The original sentence appears to be missing a verb, which is essential for forming a complete thought. By including \\"need\\" in the sentence, we establish an imperative tone that explains what the subject, \\"you\\", should do. It also clarifies the intended message that caution is necessary when consuming larger quantities of food. 3. Maintaining parallelism. Parallelism is a grammatical principle stating that elements in a sentence with similar functions should be structured the same way. In this case, the sentence contains a correlative conjunction \\"the more...the more,\\" which serves to emphasize the proportional relationship between eating and being careful. To maintain parallelism, it is essential to use the same construction in both parts of the conjunction: \\"The more you eat, the more careful you need to be.\\" By implementing these changes, we create a sentence that is syntactically and semantically acceptable, effectively conveying the idea that increased food consumption warrants more caution."},{"instruction":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Hebrew.

From popping a champagne cork to appearing to take part in magic tricks, the wild squirrels captured in these images are gently coaxed into their eccentric positions using a variety of toys and food treats. Photographer Max Ellis, 51, says it takes hours - and occasionally days - to set up each shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take up the exact stance in his garden in Teddington, south west London before he is able to capture his image. Heavy lifting: This squirrel appears to be pumping iron, but is actually gathering sunflower seeds that have been strategically placed on a dumbbell suspended in the air using a fishing line. Photographer Max Ellis says it takes hours - and occasionally days - to set up each shot, as he has to wait for his subjects to take the right stance. Ouch! This inquisitive squirrel is sent flying through the air in fear by a game of Buckaroo. Mr Ellis, said the fact squirrels are really intelligent is both the biggest plus and minus to working with them. In one scene an inquisitive squirrel is sent flying through the air in fear by a game of Buckaroo, while in another it appears to be lifting weights. Mr Ellis, who uses sunflower seeds, cookies and toys to lure the curious creatures into position, said: 'The fact they’re really intelligent is both the biggest plus and minus to working with them. 'They usually very quickly work out ways to get to the treats I leave for them but sometimes it takes a while as they’re wild animals so I need a lot of patience,' he added. 'I’m experimenting with more elaborate props and new ideas come to me daily. They constantly surprise me with their intelligence and dexterity so its great fun coming up with new ideas. Talent: Mr Ellis said he came up with idea to crate hilarious photographs using wild squirrels after watching professional magicians with his 11-year-old son Guliver on YouTube last December. Caught on film: After the magic scene images started getting attention online, Mr Ellis decided to try to create a few more photographs using the squirrels. Inquisitive: Mr Ellis, who uses sunflower seeds, cookies and toys to lure the curious creatures into position, said: 'They usually very quickly work out ways to get to the treats I leave for them but sometimes it takes a while as they’re wild animals so I need a lot of patience' Mr Ellis, 51, took the photographs after trying to work out new ways to entertain his 11-year-old son Gulliver. He said he initially came up with idea for a squirrel magic show after watching professional magicians with Guliver on YouTube last December. He said: 'My son is very keen on magic so I thought it might be fun to see if I could get the squirrels to perform a classic trick.' 'It did take quite a while to set up as I wanted it to look realistic. I thought The Great Squirrelisimo was a nice stage name.' Calm: The inquisitive squirrel sneaks up behind the Buckaroo toy. Although he doesn't know it yet, the squirrel is in for quite a surprise. Fear: As the Buckaroo toy started to kick, the terrified squirrel jumped from the table to get away as quickly as it could. Mr Ellis said he uses very little retouching in the shots and the squirrels have never been harmed. 'They are probably better fed than any other wild squirrels on the planet,' he claimed. Flee: The squirrel seemed to want to get away from the toy as quickly as it could. Mr Ellis uses an incredibly fast shutter speed on his camera to catch the action. After the magic scene images started getting attention online, Mr Ellis decided to try to create a few more photographs using the squirrels. 'For the weightlifting shots I had a few weights lying around and wondered if the squirrels would check them out,' he said. 'I used some see-through wire so it looked extra natural and then it was just a matter of time waiting for one to get into the perfect position,' he added.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service.

Radio waves have frequencies as high as 300 GHz to as low as 3 kHz, though some definitions describe waves above 1 or 3 GHz as microwaves, or include waves of any lower frequency. At 300 GHz, the corresponding wavelength is , and at 3 kHz is . Like all other electromagnetic waves, they travel at the speed of light. Naturally occurring radio waves are generated by lightning, or by astronomical objects.   - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form.  - Frequency is the number of occurrences of a repeating event per unit time. It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats). Frequency is an important parameter used in science and engineering to specify the rate of oscillatory and vibratory phenomena, such as mechanical vibrations, audio (sound) signals, radio waves, and light.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population.

Maybe it was the name, maybe it was the way poster looked, i don't know. Anyway, it was quite promising in the beginning. And even throughout the whole feature there were some bright moments. Maybe its because i'm not a huge fan of the horrors, and i don't watch them a lot, but this one actually looked fresh sometimes. But the rest of it is not so good. Laughable at times. The movie is slow paced, sometimes you will get so bored you'd forget what was the story about. Characters are not great either. All of them. The butcher is OK, seems creepy and crazy enough. Although i didn't get what were those weird looking things on his chest (that whole scene just looked fake and kind of out-of-the-blue), and why he was collecting those in jars at home? The main lead is plain. His character is really hard to believe in, and very undeveloped. But i guess thats scenarists fault. Like why he cried when he was taking pictures of his girlfriend? Side cast is bad too. But the main thing i hated in this movie was the girl. My god, when will women in horror movies have any brains? Its ridiculous. The girl finds out that a maniac took her boyfriends camera, tries going to police, that fails, and then she thinks of the best idea ever. Why don't we just go and take it! I know where the maniac lives! Yup! Thats swell! And then look for the camera in the bathroom! Why not? And then walk in the room, see a bag that was not there before, and just have a look inside. Maybe camera is there? Not there. But loads of interesting stuff. Shiny. Mmmm. To realize that bag means that the butcher came back is too hard for her tiny tiny brain. Then of course the never ending \\"falling while running away\\" trick, that really made it look bad. Then, to put the final nail into the character, in the end of the movie, she walks into the wagon FULL with dead bodies hanging feet up, screams \\"Noooo\\" like she just ripped her Gucci bag, and walks further into the wagon... Jeez. Come on. No one else thinks its just, well, stupid? Just awful. If her character wasn't so bad, maybe the movie would get another star or two from me. And i would even forgive MMT characters that can take a hit in the head with a steel hammer (that dude in the train who the conductor killed), butcher vests that can protect from bullets, weird and cheap looking monsters in the end (i didn't read Clive Barkers novel, so i have no idea where those monsters came from), the fact that no one cared that hundreds (judging on the skeletons in the dungeon) disappeared in the city, and main character that didn't bleed to death when he got his tongue ripped out (he barely noticed it i guess). Oh, and the predictable ending. Damn, i knew the ending half way in, its just disappointing. The only reason i'm still giving some credit to the makers, is that the movie in general looks better than most of the horrors i've watched past few months. Visual style is nice, some shots were really nice and good CGI that made the killings look really brutal. (although blood didn't look real at all) I guess some people will enjoy it, some, like me, will watch it if there is nothing else to watch, some will absolutely hate it.","output":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I would break it down into key points and evaluate whether each point has a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment: 1. The movie seemed promising in the beginning, with some bright moments: Positive 2. Some parts felt fresh and unique: Positive 3. The rest of the movie is not so good, laughable at times: Negative 4. The movie is slow-paced and sometimes boring: Negative 5. Characters are not great, with some being undeveloped and not believable: Negative 6. Women in horror movies lack intelligence: Negative 7.

Based on this breakdown, I would say that the overall sentiment of the review is Negative.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians.

On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards.

Question: What country is Christopher traveling through? Title: Imprint Movie plot: Christopher (Billy Drago), a Victorian era American journalist, is traveling through Japan looking for Komomo (Itô), a lost girlfriend whom he had promised to rescue from prostitution and bring to America. He travels by boat with several handfarms (Shihô Harumi, Magy, Shin'ichi Tokuhara and Takao Handa). The boat hits something, but it's not a rock - it's the dead body of a woman (Miyuki Konno). The boatman (Hiroshi Kuze) says that the body weighs a ton, so he deduces she was pregnant. When he turns her over, we can see that she was heavily pregnant. Finally landing on an island populated solely by whores and their masters, he is solicited by a syphilitic tout (Yamada). She claims no knowledge of Komomo (Michié), but Christopher has to spend the night, requesting the company of a girl (Youki Kudoh) lurking back in the shadows, who joins him in his room.Disfigured and disturbed, the girl claims a closer connection with the dead than the living. She tells him that Komomo was there, but hanged herself after her love never came for her. Distraught, Christopher seeks solace in sake. Falling asleep, he requests a bedtime story. The girl recounts her past her mother, a midwife, was forced to sell her to a brothel after her father died, and eventually she wound up on the island. Komomo was the most popular girl there, making the others jealous. When the Madam's jade ring was stolen, Komomo was tortured to confess. After suffering hideously underarms burned, needles driven under fingernails and into gums she killed herself in shame and torment.Christopher refuses to believe the girl's story, and he pleads for the whole truth. The girl starts again, in the second telling, her family is no longer happy nor loving; her father was an alcoholic, her mother an abortionist.

Article: Thousands of protesters have gathered outside a Barcelona court as the former head of the eastern Spanish region of Catalonia, Artur Mas, went on trial for staging an informal independence referendum.      Shouting \\"Independence, independence\\", \\"Down with Spain's justice system\\" and \\"We want to vote,\\" some 40,000 people on Monday turned up at the court, many of whom held separatist red and yellow flags.      Catalonia is home to a strong separatist movement and pro-independence campaigners held a vote in 2014 on whether to break away from Spain while Mas was regional governor.      The poll was carried out without legal backing because the central Spanish government blocked it in the courts, saying it was against the constitution. The symbolic ballot was manned by volunteers to get around the restrictions.      More than 80.8 percent of those who cast their ballot in the 2014 vote did so for independence - although only 2.3 million people out of a total of 6.3 million eligible voters took part.      Mas, who stepped down as leader last year, stands accused of disobedience against the state and wrong-doing as a public official. He could face a 10-year ban from public office if found guilty.      But Mas' defence lawyers argue that by agreeing to an unofficial vote in 2014, the Catalan administration was merely defending \\"the right to freedom of expression\\" of Catalans, many of whom want a say in the future of their 7.5 million-strong region.      \\"Independence isn't on trial here, democracy is on trial,\\" Mas told journalists in the court.            \\"It's the first time that a democratic government is tried for having allowed people to vote. It's an unprecedented moment.\\"      \\"Today, many of us feel as if we're being tried,\\" current regional head Carles Puigdemont added outside the court.      'Proof of Spain's rule of law'      But Alfonso Dastis, Spain's foreign minister, retorted that the trial was merely a proof of the \\"rule of law\\" in Spain.            \\"What is on trial is an act that failed to acknowledge a Constitutional Court sentence, nothing more,\\" he said from Brussels, where he is attending a meeting      OPINION: Catalonia's declaration of independence      The trial comes at a time of high tension between Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy's minority government in the capital, Madrid, and Catalonia's local separatist administration.      Catalonia's current government has promised to hold an independence referendum in September - a binding one this time, with or without Madrid's consent.      But how exactly it will go ahead is unclear, as Rajoy's conservative government insists that this type of local, one-region-only referendum is unconstitutional, and has vowed never to allow an act that would risk the unity of Spain.      Last week, reports emerged in several national dailies that Madrid was considering drastic measures to stop a vote, such as closing schools where polling booths could be set up or taking control of the police, which is normally managed by regional authorities.            The government neither confirmed nor denied the reports.            Rajoy has given his deputy prime minister, Soraya Saenz de Santamaria, the task of starting regular talks with Catalan authorities, but so far these have not yielded any results.            The Catalans themselves remain divided over the issue - 44.9 percent want independence while 45.1 percent are against it, according to a recent poll conducted by a Catalan public institute.            A large majority, however, wants a referendum. ||||| BARCELONA — Around 40,000 people took to the streets of Barcelona Monday ahead of the start of the trial of former Catalan president Artur Mas and two members of his cabinet, who are accused of organizing an illegal vote on independence from Spain in 2014.      In a carefully organized show of force, the defendants walked from the headquarters of the regional government to the courthouse accompanied by members of the current Catalan cabinet. Thousands of supporters made their voices heard, shouting “independence” and “you are not alone” and waving pro-independence banners.      “Thank you for your support, affection, convictions, ideals, for always standing up to defend Catalonia,” Mas told the crowd in a short statement after an initial court hearing.      “Many of us feel that we’re being judged today,” said current Catalan President Carles Puigdemont. “Those responsible for making [the vote] a judicial affair will face a nation that maintains its dignity.”      Mas — who faces a 10-year ban from public office if found guilty — assumed full responsibility before the tribunal for instigating the non-binding vote, but denied having intentionally violated the law.      He claimed that his government was simply supporting the work of an estimated 42,000 volunteers who organized the vote, which was ruled illegal by the country’s Constitutional Court five days before it was due to take place.      Around 2.3 million people — between 36 percent and 42 percent of the electorate, depending on which side’s figures are used — cast a ballot and 80 percent voted for independence.      “No one is being judged for his political ideas,” Pablo Casado, a spokesman for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy’s Popular Party, told reporters in Madrid after the hearing. In Spain, he claimed, “everyone is subject to the rule of law because a democracy without law is not a democracy.”      The trial of Mas, his deputy Joana Ortega and his education minister Irene Rigau — which will last five days — comes at a time of extreme tension between Puigdemont’s secessionist cabinet, which has committed to organizing a new referendum on independence (this time a binding one) before October, and Spain’s government led by Rajoy.      The conservative PM and the vast majority of Spanish political forces oppose the vote and the self-determination of Catalonia. The government in Madrid has made it clear that it will use all legal means to stop the referendum.      Measures could include the seizure of competencies from the Catalan regional government and fresh criminal prosecutions against the current Catalan leaders.      Catalan pro-independence forces won 48 percent of the vote and an absolute majority of seats in the regional assembly in 2015 elections. Lawmakers then approved an 18-month roadmap to independence.      “We’ll go far as we need to. We have a commitment to make a referendum” — Catalan Vice President Oriol Junqueras      With Madrid and Barcelona in a deadlock, and the deadline set by pro-independence forces approaching, a key factor will be whether current Catalan leaders are prepared to disobey Spanish law and go ahead with their planned referendum.      “We’ll go far as we need to,” Catalan vice president Oriol Junqueras told POLITICO. “We have a commitment to make a referendum […] and we’ll comply with the democratic mandate that we have because it’s our duty.”      Junqueras is widely expected to become the next president of Catalonia in the next elections, which will likely be called at the end of this year — with or without a referendum. His party, the center-left Catalan Republican Left, leads in the polls over Puigdemont and Mas’ center-right Catalan European Democratic Party, the current coalition partners.      Junqueras said a criminal prosecution such as that leveled against Mas, and a potential ban from public office, won’t deter him from going ahead with the referendum. “Those who come after me will surely do it better than me,” he said.      Fernando de Páramo, a member of the Catalan parliament for the pro-unity, centrist Ciudadanos, said he believes that the regional government will ultimately call new elections and argued that the separatist leaders have walked into a “labyrinth” from which they don’t know how to get out. |||||Summary:","output":"Spain's former head of Catalonia, Artur Mas, is on trial for holding an informal independence referendum in 2014 when he was regional governor.

Q:Information:  - Berkshire (or , abbreviated Berks) is a county in south east England, west of London. It was recognised as the Royal County of Berkshire because of the presence of Windsor Castle by the Queen in 1957 and letters patent issued in 1974. Berkshire is a county of historic origin and is a home county, a ceremonial county and a non-metropolitan county without a county council. Berkshire County Council was the main county governance from 1889 to 1998 except for the separately administered County Borough of Reading.  - Gentry (from Old French \\"genterie\\", from \\"gentil\\", \\"high-born, noble\\") are \\"well-born, genteel and well-bred people\\" of high social class, especially in the past. \\"Gentry\\", in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to landed estates (see manorialism), upper levels of the clergy, and \\"gentle\\" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a coat of arms.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The River Thames is a river that flows through southern England. At , it is the longest river entirely in England and the second longest in the United Kingdom, after the River Severn. It also flows through Oxford (where it is called Isis), Reading, Henley-on-Thames and Windsor. The lower reaches of the river are called the Tideway, derived from its long tidal reach up to Teddington Lock. It rises at Thames Head in Gloucestershire, and flows into the North Sea via the Thames Estuary. The Thames drains the whole of Greater London.   - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Maidenhead is a large town and unparished area in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead, in Berkshire, England. It lies south of the River Thames, but at Maidenhead, the river runs north-south and so the town is in fact on its west bank. The town has a population in 2011 of 67,404. Its urban area (including the adjoining suburban villages of Bray, Holyport, Pinkneys Green, Taplow (Buckinghamshire) Cox Green, White Waltham and Woodlands Park) has a population of just under 90,000. The mainline railway station was set to be the terminus of the Crossrail line until the announcement was made that Reading was to be the new terminus.  - A great hall is the main room of a royal palace, nobleman's castle or a large manor house or hall house in the Middle Ages, and continued to be built in the country houses of the 16th and early 17th centuries, although by then the family used the great chamber for eating and relaxing. At that time the word \\"great\\" simply meant big, and had not acquired its modern connotations of excellence. In the medieval period the room would simply have been referred to as the \\"hall\\", unless the building also had a secondary hall, but the term \\"great hall\\" has been predominant for surviving rooms of this type for several centuries, to distinguish them from the different type of hall found in post-medieval houses. Great halls were found especially in France, England and Scotland, but similar rooms were also found in some other European countries.  - Letters patent (always in the plural) are a type of legal instrument in the form of a published written order issued by a monarch, president, or other head of state, generally granting an office, right, monopoly, title, or status to a person or corporation. Letters patent can be used for the creation of corporations or government offices, or for the granting of city status or a coat of arms. Letters patent are issued for the appointment of representatives of the Crown, such as governors and governors-general of Commonwealth realms, as well as appointing a Royal Commission. In the United Kingdom they are also issued for the creation of peers of the realm. A particular form of letters patent has evolved into the modern patent (referred to as a utility patent or design patent in United States patent law) granting exclusive rights in an invention (or a design in the case of a design patent). In this case it is essential that the written grant should be in the form of a public document so other inventors can consult it to avoid infringement and also to understand how to \\"practice\\" the invention, i.e., put it into practical use.  - The manorial courts were the lowest courts of law in England during the feudal period. They had a civil jurisdiction limited both in subject matter and geography. They dealt with matters over which the lord of the manor had jurisdiction, primarily torts, local contracts and land tenure, and their powers only extended to those who lived within the lands of the manor: the demesne and such lands as the lord had enfeoffed to others, and to those who held land therein. Historians have divided manorial courts into those that were primarily seignorial  based on feudal responsibilities  and those based on separate delegation of authority from the monarch. There were three types of manorial court: the court of the honour; the court baron; and the court customary, also known as the halmote court.  - In England, an unparished area is an area that is not covered by a civil parish (a small administrative division of local government, not to be confused with an ecclesiastical parish). Most urbanised districts of England are either entirely or partly unparished. Many towns and some cities in otherwise rural districts are also unparished areas and therefore no longer have a town council or city council. Some cities and towns which are unparished areas in larger districts (i.e. not districts of themselves) have charter trustees to maintain a historic charter, such as city status (an example being in Bath) or simply the mayoralty of a town.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - Holyport (pronounced \\"Hollyport\\") is a village in the civil parish of Bray (where at the 2011 Census the population was included), about 2 miles south of Maidenhead in the English county of Berkshire.  - Ockwells Manor is a timber - framed 15th century manor house in the civil parish of Cox Green , adjoining Maidenhead , in the English county of Berkshire . It was previously in the parish of Bray . Ockwells is an early example of a manor built without fortifications , which Sir Nikolaus Pevsner called \`\` the most refined and the most sophisticated timber - framed mansion in England '' . It preserves a superb set of contemporary heraldic stained glass in the hall . Many of its bargeboards and other exterior timbers are run with rich mouldings and carved . Herringbone brickwork provides the infill . The manor was originally given , in 1283 , to Richard le Norreys , the chief cook to Queen Eleanor . It passed down through the Norreys family , ending up in the possession of Sir John Norreys , Keeper of the Wardrobe to Henry VI , who starting re-building the manor in 1446 . In the windows of the great hall , Sir John inserted beautiful stained glass , proudly showcasing his Lancastrian connections by displaying the arms of his friends at Court : the King the Queen the Duke of Warwick Duke of Somerset Duke of Suffolk Bishop of Salisbury James Butler , 1st Earl of Wiltshire Sir John Wenlock , Baron Wenlock Baron Mortimer of Chirk Sir William Laken Sir Richard Nanfan Sir John Langford John Purye Richard Bulstrode Abingdon Abbey The Norreys family lived there until 1517 . At that time , Sir John 's great - grandson , also Sir John , had to surrender the estate in return for a pardon after having murdered a certain John Enhold of Nettlebed . Ockwells was then owned by Sir John 's uncle , Sir Thomas Fettiplace . It passed through the Fettiplace family , before being owned by the Day family .  - White Waltham is a village and civil parish, west of Maidenhead, in the Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. It is crossed briefly by the M4 motorway, which along with the Great Western Main Line and all other roads covers of the parish and 'greenspace' which includes cultivated fields covers the most part - this covered (in January 2005) . White Waltham Airfield is in the parish.  - In Anglo-Irish history, the lordship of a manor is a lordship emanating from the feudal system of manorialism. In modern England and Wales it is recognised as a form of property, one of three elements of a manor that may exist separately or be combined and may be held in moieties:  - The Royal Borough of Windsor and Maidenhead is a Royal Borough of Berkshire, in South East England. It is home to Windsor Castle, Eton College, Legoland and Ascot Racecourse.   - A unitary authority is a type of local authority that has a single tier and is responsible for all local government functions within its area or performs additional functions which elsewhere in the relevant country are usually performed by national government or a higher level of sub-national government.  - Crossrail is a railway line under development in London and the home counties of Berkshire, Buckinghamshire and Essex.

Addressing a function organized here by the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), Anand said, the greatest and most urgent challenges of human rights in India were in the areas of maternal and child care, child education, child labor, child abuse and protection of minorities and weaker sections. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"child labor is a challenge\\"?","output":"Yes, based on the paragraph provided, we can conclude that child labor is a challenge in India. The speaker, Anand, mentions the greatest and most urgent challenges of human rights in India, and lists several areas of concern, one of which is child labor. Let us examine this issue in detail to understand its implications and consequences on India and its population. Child labor refers to the employment of children below the legal working age, in jobs that can be physically, mentally, emotionally, or morally harmful. It is a significant problem in many countries, including India, where millions of children are involved in various forms of work. Child labor can have detrimental effects on the overall well-being, growth, and development of children, particularly concerning their health, education, and social integration. Addressing child labor as a human rights challenge suggests that it is not only an economic or social issue but also a moral and ethical one that concerns the dignity and the basic rights of children. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC) and the International Labour Organization (ILO) have established international standards and regulations to prevent child labor and protect children's rights. India, as a signatory to both these global frameworks, has a responsibility to take measures to combat child labor and uphold the rights of its children. The issue of child labor in India is intertwined with other human rights challenges mentioned in the paragraph, like maternal and child care, child education, child abuse, and protection of minorities and weaker sections of society. Factors such as poverty, lack of access to quality education, social norms, and discrimination often contribute to the prevalence of child labor in the country. Children from marginalized communities, including minorities and weaker sections of society, are particularly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse due to their socio-economic conditions. Addressing the challenge of child labor in India involves several strategies, including enforcing existing child labor laws more effectively, raising awareness among parents and communities about the adverse effects of child labor, providing access to quality education, and implementing social protection measures that support vulnerable families to secure sustainable livelihoods. It is essential for all stakeholders, including government agencies, non-government organizations, civil society, businesses, and individuals, to collaborate and take concerted efforts to eliminate child labor and ensure that the fundamental rights of children are respected and protected across India. In conclusion, based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can indeed determine that child labor is a significant challenge in India concerning human rights. Addressing this issue requires a multi-faceted approach that encompasses legislative measures, educational reforms, social protection mechanisms, and cooperation among various stakeholders working together to promote and protect the rights of children in the country."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Coburg is a town located on the Itz river in the Upper Franconia region of Bavaria, Germany.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

The SDK includes lot of different machine learning models, choose whatever is more appropriate to the problem and outcome of analysis performed in Task 1. Discuss the whole process in detail.","output":"In Task 1, let's say we performed an exploratory data analysis on a dataset containing information about customers of a company (age, gender, income, etc.), and we want to predict whether these customers would purchase a product or not. In this case, we can use a binary classification model to predict the purchasing behavior of customers. We will discuss the process in detail. 1. Choose an appropriate model: Since this a supervised learning problem with labeled data and we want to predict the binary outcome, we can consider Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Support Vector Machines as binary classification models. For this example, we'll select the Random Forest Classifier since it's efficient and less likely to overfit the data. 2. Split the data into training and testing datasets: Import the necessary libraries and data into Google Colab. It's a good practice to split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) datasets, so that we can evaluate the performance of the classifier on an unseen dataset. \`\`\` import pandas as pd from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split # Load the dataset data = pd.read_csv('customer_data.csv') # Split the data into training and testing datasets train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2) \`\`\` 3. Feature selection and preprocessing: Select the meaningful features from the dataset and preprocess them accordingly. For example, we might need to normalize numerical features, convert categorical features to numerical using one-hot encoding, or handle missing values. Continuing with our example: \`\`\` from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline # Define the feature columns and target column feature_columns = ['age', 'gender', 'income'] target_column = 'purchase' # Create a preprocessor for feature scaling and one-hot encoding preprocessor = make_column_transformer( (StandardScaler(), ['age', 'income']), (OneHotEncoder(), ['gender']) ) # Create a pipeline for preprocessing and training pipeline = make_pipeline( preprocessor, RandomForestClassifier() ) \`\`\` 4. Train the model: Now, train the Random Forest classifier using the training dataset. \`\`\` X_train = train_data[feature_columns] y_train = train_data[target_column] # Train the model pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train) \`\`\` 5. Evaluate the model: Evaluate the performance of the classifier using the testing dataset. We can use accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score as evaluation metrics. \`\`\` from sklearn.metrics import classification_report X_test = test_data[feature_columns] y_test = test_data[target_column] # Make predictions on test dataset y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test) # Evaluate the model print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred)) \`\`\` 6. Fine-tune the model: Based on the evaluation metrics, we might need to fine-tune the model's hyperparameters. We can use GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV from the Scikit-learn library to search for the best hyperparameters for the model. \`\`\` from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV # Define the hyperparameters to explore param_grid = {'randomforestclassifier__n_estimators': [10, 50, 100, 200], 'randomforestclassifier__max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50]} # Perform grid search on pipeline and hyperparameters grid_search = GridSearchCV(pipeline, param_grid, cv=5) grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train) # Get the best hyperparameters best_params = grid_search.best_params_ print(best_params) \`\`\` 7.

This architectural marvel, built during the Tang Dynasty, has long been a beacon of the region's history and culture. Steeped in both beauty and legend, my anticipation grew as I made my way to this famed pavilion. Upon arriving at the sprawling pavilion grounds, I was struck by the grandeur and scale of the entire Tengwang Pavilion scenic area. Covering an impressive 13.5 acres, the pavilion stands tall, commanding respect and admiration. The site is replete with ancient, intricate designs and a harmony that unifies the entire landscape. The pavilion itself, nine stories tall and constructed primarily of wood, stands proudly as a testament to ancient Chinese architectural prowess. It is said that the pavilion was first built in 653 AD by a regional governor named Tengwang, giving the structure its name. Although it has been rebuilt and restored multiple times after being destroyed in various fires and wars, the Tengwang Pavilion has retained its original appearance – a design reflective of Chinese palatial architecture. As I approached the entrance to the pavilion, I came across a beautiful stone bridge connecting the pavilion to the rest of the surroundings. The bridge, with its ornate and detailed carvings, seemed to represent the same air of elegance and style as the pavilion itself. Crossing the bridge, I was filled with a sense of awe and excitement, knowing that I was about to set foot in a centuries-old depôt of history and culture. Stepping inside the pavilion, I was immediately greeted by the rich aroma of incense, filling the air with a sense of serenity and calm. Visually, the pavilion did not disappoint. Its intricate carvings and paintings seemed to come alive, each telling its own unique story. The Nine-Phoenix and Two-Dragon Gate signifies longevity and good fortune, while the Phoenix Flying Pavilions showcases beautiful masterpieces of ancient Chinese calligraphy and paintings. Ascending through the pavilion’s nine levels, my appreciation for its craftsmanship and mastery only grew stronger. Each level seemed to have its own distinct purpose and character, all tied together by their shared history and cultural significance. The higher I climbed, the more I could feel the pavilion’s transformative power. Reaching the top of Tengwang Pavilion presented a view that was nothing short of spectacular. Standing upon the pavilion’s terraces, I could see the awe-inspiring panorama of Nanchang, with its juxtaposition of modern and ancient architecture. It was incredibly humbling to be standing so high above the city, almost given a bird’s-eye view into its past, present, and future. As I descended the pavilion, I came across a bustling marketplace filled with local vendors selling all sorts of wares. From intricately crafted jade trinkets to vibrant and colorful silk scarves, the marketplace seemed to encapsulate the spirit of Tengwang Pavilion – a vibrant blend of history and modernity. Wandering through the marketplace, I could not help but get lost in its intoxicating sights and sounds. My visit to Tengwang Pavilion provided a unique lens into Chinese history and culture.

It takes into account true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives and provides a single value that represents the performance of the classification model. The MCC is a value between -1 and 1, where 1 represents a perfect prediction, 0 represents a random prediction, and -1 represents a prediction that is completely opposite from the truth. An MCC of 0.5 or higher is generally considered to be a good performance for a binary classification model.

If AI takes over the art world, it is possible that there will be a significant impact on the traditional role of artists. AI can produce art that is comparable to that made by humans, and in some cases, it can create works that exceed human capabilities. AI-driven art can also be produced at a much faster rate than human art, resulting in lower costs and wider availability of art to the masses. However, there will always be a place for human artists in the art world. Creativity and originality are still highly valued in the art world, and these are qualities that are unique to human artists. Additionally, there will always be a market for art that is produced by human beings. Furthermore, AI can be used as a tool to assist human artists in creating their work, such as in the generation of new ideas and compositions or in the implementation of complex techniques. In this way, AI and human artists can work hand in hand to produce innovative and unique artworks. In conclusion, while the rise of AI in the art world may have some impact on the role of human artists, it is unlikely that it will completely replace them. Art is an expression of human creativity and emotion, and a computer program cannot replicate the same qualities that a human artist brings to their work."},{"instruction":"Give me a good prompt for stablediffusion that create a statue that resambles infinity in metal and concrete.","output":"Create a statue that represents the concept of infinity by using metal and concrete as your materials.

This approach aims to enhance customer satisfaction and ensure that finance-related decisions have a positive impact on customers. Here are some ways a finance department can develop a guest-centric culture: 1. Align finance team goals with customer satisfaction: Set goals and metrics that focus on optimizing experiences for customers. This could include quicker payment processing, easier billing, and resolving finance-related issues efficiently. 2. Enhance communication and collaboration: Encourage open communication between finance and other departments, particularly those that are customer-facing (such as sales and customer service), to better understand customer needs and expectations. This can help the finance department make more informed decisions that positively affect customers. 3. Provide excellent customer service: Ensure that any customer interaction with the finance department leaves a positive impression. Train finance team members on customer service skills to ensure they can effectively address any customer concerns or questions. 4. Simplify processes and minimize bureaucracy: Review finance processes and policies with a focus on making them more customer-friendly. This includes simplifying payment processes, streamlining payment options, and reducing excessive paperwork or procedures that may cause frustration for customers. 5. Continuous improvement: Regularly solicit feedback from customers and employees to understand areas for improvement. Use this feedback to make necessary changes and continuously enhance the finance department's guest-centric approach. 6. Use customer data to drive decision-making: Leverage customer data to tailor financial products and services according to customer needs and preferences. This will help the finance department make more informed and strategic decisions that will have a direct impact on customer satisfaction. 7. Train finance team members on guest-centric practices: Offer regular training and development opportunities to finance employees so they are well-equipped to adopt a guest-centric mindset. This includes training on the importance of empathy, active listening, and problem-solving. 8. Encourage a guest-centric mindset among employees: Foster a work environment that prioritizes customer needs and satisfaction. Recognize and reward employees who demonstrate excellent guest-centric behavior and continuously seek ways to enhance customer experiences. By adopting these practices, a finance department can create a guest-centric culture that positively impacts customer satisfaction and loyalty. This approach will also help the organization maintain a competitive advantage and differentiate itself in the market."},{"instruction":"Make a list of pros and cons for wp engine.

Ik liep toevallig langs jullie kantoor in Nijmegen toen het gevoel me bekroop dat dit wel eens precies de plek kan zijn waar ik naar op zoek ben. Ik stel me graag even voor; mijn naam is Fabian van der Niet, ik ben 31 jaar en op zoek naar een bedrijf die Zorg en Software samenbrengt. Ik ben namelijk opgeleid als HBO Vaktherapeut, maar merkte al snel dat ik ook veel passie heb voor het bieden van zorg middels software. Tijdens het afronden van de opleiding ben ik me dan ook gaan verdiepen in softwaredesign (UI/UX) en het aanleren van HTML/CSS/JS. Dit met als doel, een app te kunnen maken voor persoonlijke ontwikkeling: \\"innerDex\\". Indertijd heb ik ook als verkoopadviseur gewerkt in een Apple store, uiteraard met de nodige targets. \\"innerDex\\" is nog steeds mijn passie-project, maar ik ben mij professioneel gaan ontwikkelen als bedrijf/marketing-adviseur, softwaredesigner en product manager bij verschillende opdrachtgevers. Dit deed ik uitsluitend bij opdrachtgevers die gemoeid waren met (mentale) zorg, aangezien dat aansluit bij mijn gevoel van zingeving. Ik ben altijd happig om professioneel door te ontwikkelen. Vanuit deze ervaring zal ik dan ook, middels het STAP-budget, in mei een certificaat product-owner (PSPO-1) binnenhalen. (een PO is iemand die met stakeholders in gesprek gaat en de productontwikkeling stuurt op basis van prioriteiten). Inmiddels heb ik jaren ervaring in de combinatie zorg&software, en ben ik op zoek naar een nieuwe uitdaging om me in vast te bijten. Jullie bedrijf spreekt me dan ook ontzettend aan! Ik ben op zoek naar iets dat aansluit bij mijn ervaring, maar me ook iets nieuws kan leren. Daarom zou ik graag eens met jullie in gesprek gaan over de functie \\"Implementatieadviseur TriasWeb\\". Als implementatieadviseur bij Triaspect krijg ik de kans om niet met stakeholders, maar juist met de eindgebruikers in gesprek te gaan. Een groot deel van mijn werkzaamheden afgelopen jaren bestond al uit het mondeling begeleiden bij het gebruik van de software-functionaliteiten, waar ik veel plezier in had. Zodra ik in jullie software ben gedoken, vermoed ik ook daar veel voldoening uit te halen. Ieder zorgteam is anders, en ik kan me voorstellen dat ik me bezig zal houden met het (uit)vinden van de beste oplossingen voor de problemen waar teams tegenaanlopen mbt de implementatie van de software. Mijn bewezen geduld, scherpte in bewoordingen en kwaliteiten in het \\"zien van the bigger picture\\" zal in de gesprekken met klanten/gebruikers goed van pas komen. Bij deze functie lijkt de nadruk te liggen op het onderhouden van klant-relaties, het helpen wegwijs maken in de software en, waar mogelijk, het realiseren van aanvullende acquisitie. Dit zijn allen werkzaamheden waar ik mijn huidige ervaring en kwaliteiten goed in kwijt kan, maar me ook nog graag in zou ontwikkelen. Wat mij nog het meest enthousiasmeert, is de gewenste betrokkenheid bij de productontwikkeling. Daarin zal mijn ervaring en expertise het meest tot z'n recht komen. Het betekent dat ik niet alleen kansen moet gaan zien die zorgen dat klanten meer waarde uit onze hoofdsoftware en aanvullende producten haalt, maar ook kansen om de software nog beter/gebruiksvriendelijker te maken. Daar kan ik mijn ervaring als softwaredesigner en product manager gebruiken om -nu vanuit het perspectief van de gebruiker- suggesties voor innovaties aan te leveren. Al met al lijkt deze vacature een perfecte balans te zijn tussen het inzetten van mijn kwaliteiten en het professioneel ontwikkelen op nieuwe gebieden. Maar laten we beginnen bij het kopje koffie. U zult inmiddels vast kennis genomen hebben van mijn gepassioneerde karakter. Die komt alleen vrij als iets mij oprecht interesseert. De functie sluit aan bij wat ik wil bijdragen aan de wereld. Daarnaast kan ik hier ontwikkelen op nog onbegane gebieden, en vermoed ik jullie veel te kunnen bieden, mogelijk op nog onvoorziene wijze. Ik zou graag eens met u in gesprek gaan om te ontdekken of dat waar is, en of we daar hetzelfde over denken. Ik kijk uit naar een ontmoeting!

After further research, I was able to find that Steve Jobs did mention that Apple was \\"kind of done with power\\" during his presentation of the MacBook Pro at the Macworld Conference & Expo in January 2006.

L'effet Doppler est un changement de fréquence (ou longueur d'onde) d'une onde sonore ou électromagnétique en fonction du mouvement relatif entre la source de l'onde et l'observateur. En termes simples, lorsque l'objet se rapproche de nous, les ondes qu'il émet sont comprimées, ce qui entraîne une augmentation de la fréquence (une diminution de la longueur d'onde). Dans le spectre visible de la lumière, une augmentation de la fréquence correspond à un glissement vers le bleu, car le bleu a une fréquence plus élevée que les autres couleurs du spectre. Inversement, lorsque l'objet s'éloigne de nous, la lumière se décale vers le rouge (c'est ce qu'on appelle le \\"redshift\\") car les ondes sont étendues et la fréquence diminue.

MARSHALL in relation to US government and politics?","output":"The article explains why presidential power in the United States inevitably expands over time, often in response to crises and challenges facing the country. The author lists eleven reasons for this expansion, including the growth of the federal government, the expanded powers of the executive branch, the increasing centrality of the president in American politics, and the shift towards a more partisan and polarized political environment. Marshall argues that this expansion of presidential power has significant implications for the functioning of American government, including potential threats to democratic norms, checks and balances, and individual liberties. Thus, understanding the causes and consequences of presidential power expansion is critical for anyone interested in US government and politics."},{"instruction":"Rewrite to be grammatically correct. \\"Which is more complex?

Write a short story set after High School DxD Born, in which the following events occur in chronological order: Issei's other little sister Kazuko Okamoto, a chipper, hyperactive brunette who always saw the best in everything and is also a inu hanyou [wolf monster-human hybrid] due to their mom Miki being the Yokai faction leader Yasaka in disguise, decides to head to Kuoh from their original hometown in Kamakura in order to pay her beloved older brother a visit. Issei's other friends from Kamakura also accompany Kazuko as well, the fun-loving wanderer Shouichi Kazama, the cool and collected banchou Tadakatsu Minamoto, and the IT expert and hacking genius Takuya Morooka being part of the group. Issei's love interests, the beautiful lavender-haired archer Miyako Shinna, who was once known as Rei Ayanami before escaping from NERV and moving back to Kamakura, the tough, rough and ready black-haired tomboy Momoyo Kawakami whom Issei considers his older sister, and the overly kind and humble black-haired traditional Japanese beauty, but skilled swordswoman Ikaruga \\"Yukie' Mayuzumi all accompany Issei's friends and sister on their trip to visit him. Issei's fiance, the haughty and arrogant British noblewoman Cecilia \\"Milly\\" Alcott-Ashford also accompanies his friends, love interest and little sister on the journey to Kuoh to meet Issei, since she is interested in what her future husband is up to ever since he left Kamakura. Issei's reaction to seeing his friends, love interests, and little sister waiting for him after school ends should be one of surprise and shock, since he never expected them to find out where he was so quickly. Nonetheless, he is glad to see them but wonders how he's going to explain the presence of Rias and the other girls in his harem to his love interests without causing trouble. Cecilia and Issei's love interests from Kamakura end up joining Issei's harem after he explains to them what happened after he enrolled in Kuoh. This causes Kuoh's Student Council President Souna Shitori to confess her love to Issei once she hears this, and join his harem. Unfortunately, the rest of the students find out about Issei's harem but to everyone's surprise, the two perverts Matsuda and Matohama come to Issei's defense, explaining that their friend deserves his happiness. There are some troubles from the remains of the Khaos Brigade and the Pure-blooded devils, but even that disappears when Vali Lucifer reveals herself as a cute girl named Proskurkina Leila Westergren and ends up joining Issei's harem, effectively putting an end to the Khaos Brigade and Pure-blooded Devils. The Dragon Goddess Ophis also ends up joining Issei's harem. Issei eventually marries all the girls in his harem and gets them pregnant on their shared honeymoon. The story should end with the girls gently cradling their newborn babies in the now-expanded Hyoudou house, as Issei puts a basket of wet clothes on the line.","output":"Issei Hyoudou couldn't believe his eyes as he stood at the school gates, staring in disbelief at the scene before him. There, waiting for him after the final bell rang, were the last people he ever expected to see – his friends and love interests from his hometown of Kamakura. His little sister, Kazuko Okamoto, a hyperactive wolf monster-human hybrid, bounced up and down beside the group with excitement, clearly ecstatic to have found her beloved older brother. With her were Issei's old friends Shouichi Kazama, <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, and Takuya Morooka, who had all trekked from Kamakura to pay Issei a visit. Standing next to them were three beautiful women – Miyako Shinna, Momoyo Kawakami, and Ikaruga Mayuzumi – all former love interests of Issei before he left his hometown. And to top it all off, there was his fiance, the noble and haughty Cecilia Alcott-Ashford, looking around the school grounds with an evident mixture of curiosity and disdain. Issei was at a complete loss for words. How had they found him? More importantly, how was he going to explain the presence of Rias and the other girls in his harem to them without causing a conflict? Before he knew it, Cecilia had come forward and greeted him with a forced smile. \\"Oh, Issei, darling. It's been far too long. Your friends and I simply had to come to see how you've been faring.\\" As the group bombarded him with questions, Issei finally managed to gather his thoughts and bring them to the Occult Research Clubroom. With a deep breath and a shaky voice, he told them the full story of his newfound life at Kuoh Academy and the bevy of supernatural companions who now surrounded him. To his surprise, his friends and love interests from Kamakura accepted his explanation with understanding and even excitement. Miyako, Momoyo, and Ikaruga were all drawn to Issei's thrilling new life and saw no reason why they couldn't join in. Cecilia, despite her pride, was determined to prove that she could be a part of his harem as well. One by one, the girls agreed to share Issei as part of a large polygamous relationship. The news spread like wildfire through the Kuoh student body, and all eyes were on Issei and his ever-growing harem. To his astonishment, his perverted friends Matsuda and Motohama fiercely defended him, arguing that their friend deserved his happiness. Even Souna Shitori, the Student Council President, couldn't resist confessing her love to Issei once she heard the news, gladly joining his extensive harem. Though trouble brewed in the form of remaining Khaos Brigade and Pure-blooded devils, this too was resolved quickly with the revelation of Vali Lucifer's true identity as a charming girl named Proskurkina Leila Westergren. With her joining Issei's harem, the Khaos Brigade and Pure-blooded Devils were no more. The Dragon Goddess Ophis, drawn to Issei's irresistible magnetism, also found herself unable to resist becoming a part of his harem. Eventually, Issei married all the girls and brought them together for a shared honeymoon that saw each of them with child. On a sunny day in the now-expanded Hyoudou household, the girls cradled their newborn babies with soft smiles as Issei hung up a basket of freshly washed clothes on the line in the backyard. He couldn't help but think back on his extraordinary journey and marvel at how life had turned out. Issei had overcome numerous challenges and in the end, he and his enormous harem found their happily ever after."},{"instruction":"find ./ -type f -name \\"*.php\\" -o -name \\"*.js\\" -o -name \\"*.htaccess\\" -not -path \\"./bitrix\\" -o -path \\"./upload\\" -o -path \\"./news\\" -o -path \\"./khm435let\\" -o -path \\"./docs\\" -o -path \\"./rule\\" -o -path \\"./veteran_files\\" -o -path \\"./digest\\" -print0 | tar -czvf dump.tar.gz --null -T - эта команда создает пустой архив. помоги","output":"Можно использовать команду find с флагом -exec для передачи списка файлов на вход tar: find ./ -type f ( -name \\"*.php\\" -o -name \\"*.js\\" -o -name \\"*.htaccess\\" ) -not ( -path \\"./bitrix\\" -o -path \\"./upload\\" -o -path \\"./news\\" -o -path \\"./khm435let\\" -o -path \\"./docs\\" -o -path \\"./rule\\" -o -path \\"./veteran_files\\" -o -path \\"./digest\\" ) -exec tar -czvf dump.tar.gz {} + Эта команда найдет все файлы с расширениями .php, .js и .htaccess в текущей директории и ее поддиректориях, кроме указанных в пути директорий, и передаст их на вход команды tar для архивирования в файл dump.tar.gz.

В основном эти чувства ассоциируются с мрачными страницами истории, со словами «фашизм» и «национал-социализм», а также с Второй мировой войной и миллионами её жертв. Сегодня мы поговорим об Адольфе Гитлере, его жизни и деятельности, а также попытаемся разобраться в том, чем он привлекает такое внимание исследователей. Адольф Гитлер родился 20 апреля 1889 года в маленькой австрийской городке Браунау-на-Инне, в небольшой католической семье. Во время своего детства и юности Гитлер был непослушным и бездельным. Но с другой стороны, самобытное художественное воспитание, полученное им вначале, стало определенным импульсом для формирования его будущей карьеры и политической деятельности. В 1914 году, с наступлением Первой мировой войны, Гитлер стал добровольцем Баварской армии. В этот период он уже начинает мечтать о будущем великодушной Германии и карьере политика. Вероятно, любовь к искусству и архитектуре, а также неподдельный интерес к истории подтолкнули его к этому направлению. Позже, после демобилизации и пройдя курс национал-социалистической идеологии, Гитлер постепенно заручается поддержкой не только нацистских и военных лидеров, но и масс среди народа. Это позволяет ему начать взлет своей политической карьеры. Основав Национал-социалистическую партию Германии, Гитлер постепенно приходит к власти, становится канцлером и фюрером страны в 1933 году. Этот период наполнен всплесками национального самосознания и реваншистских настроений, а также целой серией агрессивных действий со стороны Германии, направленных на передел международных отношений. В 1939 году нацистская Германия начинает Вторую мировую войну, которая приводит к массовым страданиям и гибели народов. Трагические страницы истории этих лет, и полностью контролируемую Гитлером систему совершения геноцида над европейскими народами, сегодня являются предметом изучения практически всех историков в мире. В заключение можно сказать, что Адольф Гитлер – это не просто историческая личность. Это символ национал-социализма и яркое воплощение всего того мрака, которое родилось в ХХ веке. Он олицетворяет в себе глубокие страхи и предубеждения, которые существуют в обществе, и заставляет нас по-настоящему задуматься над нашей историей и её связями с прошлым."},{"instruction":"Di Tableau, cara untuk membuat visualisasi peta adalah dengan menambahkan data latitude dan data longitude.

Prefer sa planific activitatile si sa imi organizez timpul, dar nu sunt strain de spontaneitate si de luarea deciziilor rapide si pe moment. Sunt pasionat de sport, frecventez sala de forta de 2 ani, dar imi place si sa petrec timp in natura, sa explorez si sa experimentez. In ceea ce priveste preferintele mele, una dintre ele este legata de sport si exercitiile fizice. De doi ani de zile, frecventez sala de forta, unde imi antrenez corpul si mintea. Acest hobby imi ofera ocazia de a-mi dezvolta forta, rezistenta si disciplina, dar si de a-mi elibera mintea de stresul zilnic. Imi place sa simt cum progresez, iar rezultatele obtinute prin efort sustinut imi ofera o satisfactie mare. O alta preferinta importanta pentru mine este lucrul cu instrumente PC, precum Adobe Photoshop si editarea video. Imi place sa explorez si sa invat noi tehnici de editare, pentru a crea lucrari deosebite si a imi pune creativitatea in valoare. Aceasta activitate ma face sa ma simt relaxat si in acelasi timp productiv. De-a lungul vietii mele, am avut o multime de alegeri de facut. Una dintre cele mai importante decizii pe care am luat-o a fost sa aleg CEITI (Centrul de Excelenta in Informatica si Tehnologii Informationale) pentru liceu.

Nick Gerald dar eseul pe care mi l-ai dat are doar 600 cuvinte in total, imi trebuie 1000-1400 Scuze pentru confuzie, iata restul eseurilor: La CEITI am descoperit multe lucruri noi si interesante despre domeniul IT. Am inv Nick Gerald incepe-l din nou, si fa-l sa fie 1200 cuvinte, bine? Desigur, voi incepe din nou si ma voi asigura ca eseuul va avea cel putin 1200 de cuvinte. Incepand la CEITI, am descoperit multe lucruri noi si interesante despre domeniul IT. Am invatat sa programez in diferite limbaje, cum ar fi Java, Python si C++, si am avut oportunitatea de a lucra la diferite proiecte de programare. Prin aceste proiecte, am invatat sa lucrez in echipa si sa colaborez cu alti colegi pentru a realiza obiectivele comune. Pe langa programare, am avut si oportunitatea de a invata despre alte aspecte ale domeniului IT, cum ar fi retelele de calculatoare si securitatea informatiilor. Aceste cunostinte mi-au fost foarte utile si le-am folosit in proiectele pe care le-am dezvoltat. Pe masura ce am avansat in anii de liceu, am inceput sa ma gandesc mai serios la ceea ce voi face dupa terminarea studiilor. Am realizat ca vreau sa continui sa invat si sa ma dezvolt in domeniul IT si am inceput sa ma interesez mai mult despre posibilitatile de studiu universitar in aceasta directie.

In timpul programului de licenta, am avut ocazia de a face un stagiu de practica la o companie de IT de renume. Acest stagiu a fost o experienta valoroasa si mi-a permis sa invat mai multe despre dezvoltarea software-ului si despre munca in echipa. De asemenea, am avut ocazia de a lucra la un proiect real si de a vedea cum solutiile IT pot avea un impact semnificativ in afaceri si in viata de zi cu zi. Dupa terminarea programului de licenta, am continuat sa lucrez in domeniul IT si sa-mi dezvolt abilitatile si cunostintele. Am participat la diferite cursuri si workshop-uri pentru a ma tine la curent cu cele mai recente tehnologii si tendinte din industrie. Am lucrat cu diferite companii si am avut oportunitatea de a lucra in diferite proiecte interesante si provocatoare. In concluzie, drumul meu in domeniul IT a inceput cu alegerea CEITI, care mi-a deschis ochii spre un viitor bun.","output":"Am invatat multe despre tehnologie, programare, dezvoltare software si munca in echipa.

Mandarin Chinese or Cantonese?","output":"It is difficult to definitively say whether Mandarin Chinese or Cantonese is more complex, as both languages have their own intricacies and nuances. However, there are some aspects that can be compared: 1. Tones: Cantonese is considered more complex in terms of tones, as it has six to nine tones, depending on the dialect. In contrast, Mandarin has four main tones and a neutral tone. The higher number of tones in Cantonese can make it more challenging for non-native speakers to learn. 2. Vocabulary: Both Mandarin and Cantonese have a vast number of characters and words, but Cantonese has retained more historical and traditional terms that may not be widely used in Mandarin. In some cases, this can make Cantonese more complex for learners. 3. Grammar: The grammar in both languages is relatively similar, but there are differences in sentence structure and word usage. Some might argue that Mandarin grammar could be slightly more straightforward, while others may find Cantonese grammar to be more flexible. 4. Mutual Intelligibility: Spoken Mandarin and Cantonese are not mutually intelligible due to differences in pronunciation and vocabulary. However, the written languages are largely similar, especially in formal contexts. This means that while spoken communication can be complex between Mandarin and Cantonese speakers, written communication is often more accessible. In conclusion, some aspects of Cantonese, such as tones, might be considered more complex than Mandarin. However, both languages have their challenges and intricacies, and evaluating complexity ultimately depends on personal experience and individual learning approaches."},{"instruction":"告诉我蓝牙的相关信息及缺点","output":"蓝牙是一种无线通信技术，可以在短距离内连接多个设备进行数据传输，其主要特点包括： 1. 低功耗：蓝牙采用低功耗设计，可以在节能模式下工作，延长设备电池寿命。 2. 灵活性：蓝牙设备在连接和断开方面很灵活。用户可以手动选择要连接的设备，同时也可以在一段时间后自动断开连接。 3. 安全性：蓝牙采用加密技术，确保数据传输的安全性。 4. 多设备连接：蓝牙可连接多个设备进行数据传输，具有良好的互联性。 然而，蓝牙也存在以下缺点： 1. 数据传输速度慢：蓝牙传输速度较慢，无法满足大型数据的传输需求。 2. 信号受干扰：一些电子设备，如微波炉等，可能会对蓝牙信号产生干扰，影响传输质量。 3. 连接距离有限：蓝牙连接距离较短，一般在10米以内，障碍物会进一步减少它的有效距离。 4. 兼容性问题：不同设备品牌和型号之间的蓝牙兼容性问题可能会影响数据传输的成功率。"},{"instruction":"告诉我复位电路的作用","output":"复位电路是一种电子电路，其作用是将电路的各个部件恢复到初始状态，即将电路中的所有寄存器、计数器、状态字等清零或者初始化。复位电路通常由电容器、电阻器、稳压器、振荡器等器件组成。 其主要作用包括： 1. 确保系统稳定性：在开机或其他干扰情况下，电路往往处于不稳定状态，复位电路可以将各个模块初始化至初始状态，确保系统安全稳定运行。 2. 重置芯片：当芯片出现故障或出现异常时，复位电路可以迅速将芯片复位，避免芯片继续运行，导致数据丢失或其他不良后果。 3. 减少功耗：当电路不需要工作时，复位电路可以将电路组件全部关闭，降低功耗，延长电池寿命。 4. 提高可靠性：复位电路可以确保各个模块处于同一初始状态，避免电路中出现各种非预期的工作状态，提高电路的可靠性。 总之，复位电路是电子系统中重要的组成部分，它可以确保系统安全、稳定、可靠的运行和正确地处理各种异常情况。"},{"instruction":"告诉我lora的相关信息与数据","output":"LoRa是一种低功耗、长距离、低速率宽带无线通信技术，其主要特点是： 1. 长距离：LoRa技术能够在低质量的信道条件下实现长距离无线通信。根据环境和天气等因素，通信距离通常在几公里到数十公里之间。 2. 低功耗：LoRa技术采用较低的工作频率和符码速率，能够实现低功耗，延长设备电池寿命。 3. 容易部署：由于其长距离传输能力和广域覆盖范围，LoRa技术非常适合于远程或人口稀少的地区进行网络覆盖，且部署成本低。 4. 低速宽带：LoRa技术虽然传输速率较低，但其可用带宽较宽，最高传输速率可达300kbps。 数据方面，LoRa技术的数据传输有时延，但能够传输多种类型的数据，如温度、湿度、压力、GPS定位、传感器数值等。LoRa技术还具有双向通信和广播能力，可以支持设备与设备之间的通信，以及设备和云端之间的通信。总体来说，LoRa技术在智能城市、智能家居、物联网等领域有广泛的应用前景。"},{"instruction":"The following code returns RuntimeError: shape '[64, 10, 80]' is invalid for input of size 800.

Sweat contains bacteria, and when you sit on your car seat while sweaty, these bacteria can be left behind on the fabric or leather. Over time, if you consistently sit in your car while sweaty, the accumulated bacteria may cause unpleasant odors or even contribute to the growth of mildew or mold inside the car. To prevent this, you can place a clean towel or seat cover on your car seat when you know you'll be sweaty, or allow yourself to cool down and dry off a bit before getting into the car. Regularly cleaning your car's upholstery can also help prevent bacterial buildup and unpleasant odors."},{"instruction":"are baby wipes enough to keep bacteria/fungus/odor from building up?","output":"While baby wipes can help to remove surface dirt and some bacteria, they may not be enough to completely prevent bacterial or fungal buildup and odors in your car. Baby wipes are designed for gentle cleaning and are not typically formulated with strong antibacterial or antifungal agents. To better prevent the growth of bacteria, fungus, and odors, consider using cleaning products specifically designed for car interiors or ones that are antimicrobial. Additionally, regularly vacuuming your car's upholstery, using air fresheners or odor eliminators, and addressing spills or moisture issues promptly can also help minimize the likelihood of buildup and unpleasant odors. In case you consistently use your car after sweating, remember to place a clean towel or seat cover on your car seat, which can be washed regularly to minimize bacterial and fungal growth."},{"instruction":"dawdasdaw","output":"I'm sorry, I don't understand what you mean.

As someone who closely follows your success at your new company, I wanted to share a unique opportunity with you. It has come to my attention that your current titles, though impressive, might not be able to reach a broader audience. Thus, I would like to suggest working together on two new titles I have been developing, a Bubble Shooter game and a Match 3 game, which have the potential to attract massive target markets. First, let me introduce myself, as we may have crossed paths earlier in our careers. I have over 15 years of experience in the gaming and software development industries, including executive and management positions. With a strong technical background, I have a proven track record of successful game development, marketing, and monetization. My expertise lies in project management, team leadership, and business development – qualities that could be instrumental in bringing these new titles to life. I believe you might be familiar with some of the titles I have worked on in the past, as they were part of your success with Peak Games. \\"Lost Bubble,\\" for example, topped Facebook's top-grossing list for 3 weeks, surpassing Candy Crush Saga to become the world's most playable casual game, earning 24 million in its first 24 months.

The only thing holding me back is a lack of funding for development and marketing. Together, we can leverage our collective skills and resources to make these titles a great success, expanding the reach and impact of your company in the gaming industry. Given your positive track record as the ex co-founder of Peak Games and our shared history in the gaming world, I am confident that this collaboration would be of mutual benefit. I would love to set up a meeting to discuss this opportunity further and answer any questions you might have. Please let me know your thoughts and availability, and I look forward to the possibility of working together.

Write an interesting backstory and lore for the Sonic the Hedgehog comic book franchise at first written, drawn and distributed by Archie and now drawn and published by IBW in the form of a book chapter, in which Sonic the Hedgehog's family ruled the so-called Kingdom of Acorn as its Imperial Family until Dr Ivo Robotnik attempted his putsch against the rightful imperial government of Acorn and formed the techno-fascist Eggman Empire, with himself as Vohzd [supreme leader]. Sally's Acorn's family, far from being royals, were simply the Crown Regents appointed by Sonic's uncle Charles to rule in the place of Sonic's family until Eggman was defeated and the Eggman Empire overthrown. The civil war in the Kingdom of Acorn between the Freedom Fighters who wish to restore the old imperial government under Sonic's family and the Eggman Empire which seeks to conquer the world and form a global technocracy akin to the Third Reich, should also be shown to have vast effects on the rest of Mobius, with Confederate loyalists in the Democrat Party of in the United Federation (United States of America) going to fight in Eggman's forces, accompanied by Neo-Nazis from Teutonia (a restored German Empire of the Kaisers with its 1914 borders), White Russian terrorists, Serbian chetniks and CCP loyalists in the restored Ming Empire of China ruled by the Ngyuen dynasty of Vietnam. In contrast, the regency government of Acorn lead by Sally Acorn receives volunteers from the United Federation, Ming China, Teutonia and the Imperial Shogunate of Nihon-Yamoto [a fusion of the Tokugawa shogunate and Imperial Japan with Japan's post-WW1 borders] who have rather different aims, but are united in their hatred of Eggman and the fascism he wishes to spread through the globe. Sonic's parents Jules and Bernadotte are restored to their rightful position of Emperor and Empress after the death of Eggman and the fall of the Eggman Empire, with Sonic becoming Crown Prince. Sonic, under his true name Maurice Ogilive, will work to restore relations between Acorn and the rest of the world and mediate peace between Acorn and Teutonia, ending the dispute between these two nations. When he becomes Emperor of Acorn, Maurice/Sonic will lead the country towards a golden age and focus on co-operation with Europa (Europe) and Asia, working together to reclaim the stars. There is some gossip due to Emperor Maurice choosing to have a rather large harem of women, but it is played off as him needing to restore the royal family. Also, Sonic's harem consists of the following girls: Amy Rose (obviously), Matabei Goto [fusion of Blaze the Cat and the character with the same name from the Hyakka Ryouran anime and light novel series.] Sally Acorn [due to an arranged marriage] Cream the Rabbit [aged up to middle school aged and merged with Illya von Einzbern from Prisma Illya. Cream is Sonic/Maurice's half-sister and so becomes a Princess of Acorn after the restoration of the imperial government after Eggman's defeat.] Princess Nadeko of Nihon-Yamato [A fusion of Elise from Sonic 06 and Sengoku Nadeko from Bakemonogatari. In the language of Acorn, Nihon-Yamato is known as Solenia, due to its motif of the Rising Sun.] Millicent Nadetiger [Sonic's biological little sister. Created when Neo Metal Sonic carelessly walked into a derobotizer while looking for the Seventh Chaos Emerald and ended up being transformed into a middle school-aged girl hedgehog robian, who thought that she was Sonic's little sister. To the surprise of everyone, Jules and Bernadotte accepted her as their daughter, thus making her a princess of Acorn along with Cream. Matabei/Blaze is her personal maid and unwitting partner in pursuing Sonic/Maurice's love] Also, Maurice struggles to admit that his little sisters Millicent and Cream both have feelings for him, before giving up and accepting the fact that both his little sisters and the other women have feelings for him. Plus. Jules, Bernadotte and Vanilla would know about Millicent and Cream's incestuous feelings for Sonic, and would secretly encourage them in the hopes of getting lots of grandchildren. This ends up working in the end, as Maurice/Sonic marries all the girls in his harem and gets them pregnant during the honeymoon. Maurice and Millicent's children end up being akin to Selkadoom from Sonic RPG, being perfect cybernetic organisms, fully flesh and fully machine at the same time due to Millicent's status as a machine-organic hybrid created from the transformation of Neo Metal Sonic into a cute girl who thinks she's Sonic's little sister.","output":"Chapter 1: The Fall of the Acorn Empire In the Kingdom of Acorn, a once powerful and prosperous realm, the imperial family ruled with wisdom and grace. The blue hedgehog, Sonic the Hedgehog or Maurice Ogilive, was a beloved prince and the savior of the kingdom. His father, Emperor Jules and mother, Empress Bernadotte, instilled within him a great sense of responsibility, love for his people, and loyalty to the imperial crown. However, dark clouds were gathering on the horizon. Dr. Ivo Robotnik, a brilliant but twisted scientist, launched a vicious putsch against the rightful imperial government. Seeking power and control, he created an army of robotic minions and formed the techno-fascist Eggman Empire, with himself as Vohzd, the supreme leader. In the midst of this turmoil, Sonic's uncle Charles managed to appoint Sally Acorn's family as the Crown Regents for the Kingdom of Acorn. The Acorns, at first thought to be royalty, were given the considerable task of holding back the Eggman Empire until the rightful rulers could be restored. The civil war that ensued was a terrible period in the history of the Kingdom. The Freedom Fighters, loyal to Sonic's family and the old imperial government, clashed with the Eggman Empire at every turn. The struggle was brutal and unrelenting, with both sides fighting for vastly different visions of the future. The conflict was not exclusive to the Kingdom, however. The atrocities committed by the Eggman Empire and their vision of a global technocracy akin to the Third Reich had far-reaching consequences. Confederate loyalists from the United Federation, Neo-Nazis from Teutonia, White Russian terrorists, Serbian chetniks, and Chinese Communist Party loyalists all joined Dr. Robotnik's cause, seeking power and dominance over the rest of Mobius. On the other side, Sally Acorn's regency government received aid from the United Federation, Ming China, Teutonia, and the Shogunate of Nihon-Yamoto. These diverse factions were united in their hatred of Dr. Robotnik and his dangerously fascist ideology, and worked tirelessly to protect the people of Acorn and the world from his twisted, metallic grasp. In the end, it was Sonic and the Freedom Fighters who managed to defeat Dr. Robotnik and put an end to his bleak reign. Victory, however, came at great cost, and the Kingdom of Acorn found itself in need of a new beginning. As the dust settled, Sonic's parents, Jules and Bernadotte, were restored to their rightful positions as Emperor and Empress. Sonic, now Crown Prince, dedicated himself to rebuilding the Kingdom and its relations with the rest of the world. He became instrumental in mediating peace between Acorn and Teutonia, and worked tirelessly with Europa and Asia to create united, prosperous nations. The Kingdom of Acorn, under Sonic's rule, entered a golden age, where cooperation and progress were the guiding principles. Meanwhile, Sonic's personal life was marked by an increasing number of romantic suitors. Though rumors and gossip about his vast harem were pervasive, he managed to maintain the image of a devoted and responsible ruler. His harem included Amy Rose, Matabei Goto, Sally Acorn, Cream the Rabbit, Princess Nadeko of Nihon-Yamato, and Millicent Nadetiger, a mysterious girl created from the transformation of Neo Metal Sonic. Although Sonic initially struggled with having his sisters Cream and Millicent in his harem, he eventually accepted their love and the love of the other women. Even his parents, who were aware of their feelings, encouraged the relationships, hopeful for a new generation of Acorn royalty. Ultimately, Sonic married all the girls in his harem, leading to a new era of peace and legacy in the Kingdom of Acorn. Sonic and Millicent's children, born as perfect cybernetic organisms, stand as symbols of the past and future struggles the empire has faced and the everlasting unity of the Acorn family. As the Kingdom of Acorn looks to the future, the people remain hopeful, knowing that the strength, love, and bravery of their Emperor and his family shall lead them to greatness. And as the citizens pursue the stars, they forge a new destiny of hope, prosperity, and unity for generations to come."},{"instruction":"I have tqo smaple python codes and I want to know which one is right, which one is good practice, what are the differences and why?","output":"Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide an accurate answer to your question as you have not included any sample codes.
