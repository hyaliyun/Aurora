In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you keep a lot of music on your iPad, its likely taking up a sizable chunk of your storage space. iTunes Match is a paid service from Apple that allows you to stream your entire iTunes library to your iPad (or any other Apple device or computer). This can free up tons of space, as you'll no longer need to keep any music files stored on your iPad. Click here for instructions on setting it up.  There are some drawbacks to the service. Besides costing 25 per year, you'll only be able to stream when you have a network location. You can always download any of your songs to your iPad ahead of time if you're anticipating being without a network connection. iTunes Match allows you to upload songs that you didn't purchase through the iTunes Store. You can also use services like Google Play Music to upload and stream your music. If you opt for a streaming service, or make the switch to internet radio, you can delete all of the music files from your iPad at once. Any purchased music will still be downloadable from the iTunes Store.  Open the Settings app. Tap \\"General\\" and then select \\"Usage\\". Tap \\"Manage Storage\\" in the \\"Storage\\" section. Tap the Music app. You may have to wait a few moments for it to appear. If your Music app isn't listed, you don't have any music files actually stored on the iPad. Tap the \\"Edit\\" button. Tap the \\"-\\" next to \\"All Songs\\" and then tap \\"Delete\\". You can also delete individual songs this way. If you just want to delete certain songs, you can do so from within the Music app. Be aware that depending on your settings, songs may be visible that aren't actually stored on your iPad (iTunes purchases, iTunes Match songs, etc.).  Open the Music app on your iPad. Find the song or album that you want to delete. Songs that are not downloaded to your iPad will have an iCloud icon on the right side of the song. Swipe the song or album to the left to reveal the \\"Delete\\" button. If you cannot swipe a song, it means that it is not downloaded to your iPad and therefore not taking up space. If you cannot swipe an album, it means that one or more songs on the album are not downloaded on your iPad. You'll need to delete individual songs from within the album. Tap \\"Delete\\". This will delete the song or album from your iPad. If you see the \\"Remove\\" button instead of the \\"Delete\\" button, it means you are in Playlist view. You must delete songs from the Songs, Albums, or Artists view. If you've downloaded movies, TV shows, or music videos from the iTunes Store, they could be taking up a lot of space. HD videos in particular can be huge. Removing videos after you watch them can make room for a bunch of other things.  Open the Settings app on your iPad, select \\"General\\", and then \\"Usage\\". Tap \\"Manage Storage\\" in the \\"Storage\\" section. Select the Videos app. If you have a lot of videos downloaded, it will likely be one of the last apps to appear, and should be located towards the top of the list. Review your videos. You will see each video stored on your iPad, along with the size. TV shows will display the size of all the episodes on the iPad, and you can tap the show to see the size of individual episodes. Tap \\"Edit\\" and then tap the \\"-\\" next to the video you want to remove.

Nicola Sturgeon has said that a vote should be held \\"not now, but when the final terms of the deal are known\\". Mr Corbyn said: \\"What I've said is that if the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish people want a referendum, they have the right to do that. \\"That was the whole point of the devolution agreement of the 1990s. \\"I think the referendum should take place, if there is to be one, after the Brexit negotiations are concluded because this is the most important thing.\\" Nicola Sturgeon has previously called for a second vote on Scotland's constitutional future between autumn 2018 and spring 2019. Launching the SNP's general election manifesto in Perth, Ms Sturgeon said opposition to an independence referendum would be \\"democratically unsustainable\\" if the SNP wins a majority of Scottish seats. The manifesto includes a call for a vote on independence to be held \\"at the end of the Brexit process\\". This has been rejected by Theresa May, who insists \\"now is not the time\\" despite a majority in the Scottish Parliament favouring a referendum in principle. Speaking during a visit to a nursery in Westminster, Mr Corbyn said he would call on the SNP to \\"think again\\" and that he would \\"appeal to the Scottish people to think again on this\\".

However, he advises that such a decision should be put on hold until the UK has concluded its Brexit negotiations with the EU. His stance comes in response to Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP), who believes a second referendum should be held once the final terms of the Brexit deal are known, but not at present. According to Sturgeon, opposition to a second referendum would be undemocratic if the SNP secures a majority of seats in Scotland. The SNP's election manifesto unveiled in Perth supports a vote on independence at the conclusion of Brexit negotiations. Contrary to these positions, the UK's Prime Minister Theresa May rejects a second referendum, even though the Scottish Parliament is, in principle, in favor of one. She has stated her belief that \\"now is not the time.\\" While discussing these issues during a visit to a nursery in Westminster, the Labour leader emphasized that the priority should be managing Brexit negotiations, especially achieving tariff-free trade access to the European market, as this is crucial for the UK's manufacturing industry. He also advocated for positive future agreements with Europe on topics such as sea management. The leader of the Labour Party iterated that, if the Scottish Parliament attempts to pass a motion for a second referendum before Brexit is complete, his party would urge them to delay it until after the Brexit talks. He believes that the pressing matters in Scotland pertain to issues like poverty, investment, and housing needs. If elected, he claims, a Labour government would prioritize helping the Scottish people in these areas. The Scottish Liberal Democrats have criticized the Labour leader's stance on Scottish independence as being confused and inconsistent. These varied perspectives highlight the ongoing debates swirling around Scottish independence and Brexit negotiations as the UK grapples with both its internal and external future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We actually used to go to the location in Scottsdale, and we've also been to this location many times. We always enjoyed our meals there.   We didn't have it tonight, but I especially like the Bruschetta. It's a huge portion. I like the grilled foccacia and all that tops it, including tomatoes, basil, hummus and sweet balsamic reduction. It's served around a nice marinara sauce that is also topped with a bunch of junk. This is the highlight.  On this trip I got a large Greek Salad. I like the creamy type greek dressing.. it's atypical for Greek salad, but I'm into it. I also like the warm pita that surround the large bowl. I get a little side of jalepeno cilantro hummus and dip away.   My husband got chicken and lamb souvlaki tonight. The wooden skewer broke into his lamb so he had to do surgery to remove it. The lamb had gristle, the chicken was under seasoned. The side vegetables were undercooked and cold, and the rice was tepid.   When the manager came by asking how everything was, my husband gave him the FYI- and he was kind and ordered us a dessert. We declined. My husband was turned off by the chipped plate of his appetizer salad, a cricket crawling along the ground (in all fairness the door to the patio was open), and the light above our table flickering on and off.   We had a savvy dining coupon for buy one entree get one free and our bill still came to 30. We had to order two drinks to get the coupon. My husband got a Sprite, and I asked for a hot decaf tea. They said they had chamomile, but then came back to tell me that they're out of all decaf teas, so I got an apple juice I didn't drink.

The reviewer does mention one positive aspect of their dining experience, which is the cup of black bean soup that is described as \\"fine.\\" However, this was not enough to redeem the overall experience.

This year's event was no exception, with a plethora of shining stars – and some not-so-shining performances – making appearances. In this article, we will discuss those who shined in the spotlight and others who had a tougher time winning over audiences as we delve into the cinematic spectacle that was Sundance 2022. Step 1: Highlight the standout performances This year's Sundance Film Festival introduced a diverse range of films, from powerful dramas to thought-provoking documentaries. One standout performance came from rising actress Skylar Johnson in the heart-wrenching coming-of-age tale \\"Emerald Waters.\\" Johnson's portrayal of a young woman grappling with her identity and place in the world was both vulnerable and captivating, earning her well-deserved accolades from critics and audiences. Step 2: Mention notable newcomers Sundance is known for launching the careers of unknown talents, and this year's festival was no different. One such newcomer, writer-director Karen Lee, made her mark with the striking debut feature \\"Fractured Memories.\\" Lee's film explored the complexities of family, love, and loss through a poignant and visually stunning narrative, garnering critical praise and a potential distribution deal with a major streaming service. Step 3: Bring attention to thought-provoking documentaries Documentaries played a significant role at this year's Sundance Film Festival, with many addressing pressing social issues and inspiring important conversations. \\"Bridges to Hope\\" by director Thomas Fournier was one such film, offering a raw and unflinching look at the lives of individuals struggling with addiction and their journey towards recovery. The documentary stirred emotions among viewers while highlighting the importance of treatment and compassion in overcoming addiction. Step 4: Discuss the less shining stars Despite the many triumphant successes, some films and performances at Sundance struggled to make a lasting impression. One such example was the ambitious sci-fi film \\"Eclipse,\\" which failed to resonate with audiences. The film's choppy storyline and underdeveloped characters left viewers wanting more, ultimately affecting its chances for a wider release. Step 5: Note trends in themes and styles This year's Sundance Film Festival showcased a shift towards more inclusive and diverse storytelling, with many films addressing timely issues such as race, gender, and environmental concerns. This shift in focus signifies a promising trend in the independent film industry, where the aim is to bring a variety of voices and perspectives to the forefront. Conclusion:  The Sundance Film Festival has always been a platform for showcasing exceptional talent in the world of independent cinema. This year's festival highlighted many shining stars, from powerful performances to thought-provoking documentaries. While not every film left a lasting impression, the overall trend toward diverse and inclusive storytelling bodes well for the future of the industry. With all eyes on Sundance, we look forward to witnessing the rise of these shining, or not-so-shining, stars as they continue to shape the landscape of independent film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of phosphates?","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can infer that Rose farm, which produced organic milk, likely had milk production practices that reduced leaching of phosphates in comparison to the Berry farm, which produced conventional milk. To elaborate further, it is important to understand the differences between conventional and organic farming practices. Conventional farming typically involves the use of chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and herbicides to enhance crop growth and protect against pests. On the other hand, organic farming relies on natural processes, such as nutrient recycling, biological pest control, and crop rotation, to maintain soil fertility and manage pests. Phosphorus is an essential nutrient for plant growth, and it is commonly found in both organic and synthetic fertilizers. However, excessive phosphorus, mainly in the form of phosphates, can leach into nearby water bodies, contributing to water pollution and negatively affecting aquatic ecosystems. In conventional dairy farming, such as the practices at Berry farm, there is a higher likelihood of phosphate leaching due to the more frequent use of synthetic fertilizers containing high concentrations of phosphorus. The application of these fertilizers can easily result in an excess of phosphorus, which may then leach into nearby water bodies. Moreover, regular use of pesticides and herbicides can affect the beneficial microorganisms responsible for breaking down and retaining phosphates in the soil. Conversely, Rose farm, which produces organic milk, likely has practices in place that minimize the risk of phosphate leaching. Organic dairy farming focuses on sustainable farming practices that prioritize soil health and nutrient management. This often involves using organic or natural fertilizers, such as compost or manure, that can help to balance soil nutrients. Furthermore, organic practices, like cover cropping and crop rotation, promote the growth of beneficial microorganisms in the soil, which can assist in reducing the risk of nutrient leaching. Additionally, organic dairy farms typically emphasize pasture-based systems, and grazing livestock can often help to recycle nutrients back into the soil, thus reducing the need for external phosphorus inputs. As a result, this holistic and sustainable approach to farming makes it more likely that Rose farm had milk production practices that reduced the leaching of phosphates in comparison to the conventional methods employed by Berry farm."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a summary based on this article: Orlando Health and Florida Hospital will not bill survivors of the Pulse nightclub massacre for out-of-pocket medical expenses, officials announced Wednesday.      Instead, the hospitals will write off an estimated 5.5 million or more in care.      \\"The pulse shooting was a horrendous tragedy for the victims, their families and our entire community,\\" Orlando Health President and CEO David Strong said. \\"During this very trying time, many organizations, individuals and charities have reached out to Orlando Health to show their support. This is simply our way of paying that kindness forward.\\"      Its main hospital — Orlando Regional Medical Center — treated 44 of the more than 50 victims who needed immediate medical attention from the June 12 attack that killed 49 people. The nightclub is only a couple of blocks from the Level 1 trauma center.      Nine of the Pulse patients died shortly after arriving at ORMC, and their families also will not be charged, hospital officials said. One victim remains hospitalized there.      At Orlando Health, bills will be sent to health insurers for patients who had coverage, but whatever those policies don't cover will be absorbed by the hospital chain, said spokeswoman Kena Lewis.      At Florida Hospital, which treated a dozen of the clubgoers, officials said they would not even bill the victims' insurance for the treatment, nor will they bill for follow-up surgeries the survivors may need.      \\"It was incredible to see how our community came together in the wake of the senseless Pulse shooting,\\" said Daryl Tol, Florida Hospital's president and CEO. \\"We hope this gesture can add to the heart and goodwill that defines Orlando.\\"      Survivors welcomed the news.      \\"I was so worried because I can't afford any of that,\\" said Mario Lopez, 34, who was visiting from Miami when he went to the club after a friend's housewarming party.      (Naseem S. Miller)      \\"I just went out for a fun night with friends. No one expected this to happen. My life was turned upside down, and then I had to worry about how I was going to pay back the hospital.\\"      Lopez, who is uninsured, was grazed by a bullet and had fragments explode into his left side. After he was hit, he fell and split his elbow on a shard of glass. His seven-hour hospital visit left him with a new nightmare: a potential 20,000-bill.      \\"It's a huge relief\\" to know he won't have to pay, he said.      At Orlando Health, Lewis said the hospital would work with victims who will need future surgeries as a result of the shootings.      \\"We can't predict the future needs of these patients, their financial situations or what the state or federal governments may require us to do for charity policies,\\" she said. \\"While we can't assume the answer is free care forever, we will use our very generous charity and financial assistance policies to assess the best way\\" to help.      As it is, the hospital chain is expecting to shoulder at least 5 million in unreimbursed care for the Pulse victims, many of whom had extensive injuries, Lewis said. Florida Hospital officials said the bills there totaled more than 525,000.      As for Lopez, his physical wounds are healing, he said, but the emotional trauma still feels raw at times.      \\"It's tough,\\" he said. \\"Each day, I have my moments.\\"      ksantich@orlandosentinel.com, @katesantich, 407-420-5503 chayes@orlandosentinel.com, @Journo_Christal, 407-420-5493 ||||| The Costs Of The Pulse Nightclub Shooting      Enlarge this image toggle caption John Raoux/AP John Raoux/AP      Mario Perez lives in Miami, but he was in Orlando for a housewarming party Saturday, June 11. After the party, the 34-year-old went to the Pulse nightclub for Latin night.      At 2 a.m., he heard gunshots. Loud. He knew it was real.      \\"And the minute he started shooting, I got hit from the side, I got grazed by a bullet,\\" Perez says. \\"My first instinct was to fall to the floor, that's what you're taught to do.\\"      He heard gunshot after gunshot after gunshot — too many to count. But then there was a brief break in the firing, and Perez ran out the back of the club. He hid inside the kitchen of a nearby 7-Eleven until police and paramedics showed up. He was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, and was at the emergency room from 3 a.m. until 8 a.m.      The gunshot wound on his side is purple and swollen, and he has nerve damage from the bullet fragment. He cut his elbow from glass on the floor of the nightclub and needed six stitches. Perez doesn't know how much bills coming from specialists, X-rays and tests might cost him. But his bill from Orlando Regional Medical Center's emergency department is 20,000.      \\"20,000,\\" Perez said. \\"That's the quote, that's what they told me.\\"      Perez has no health insurance. He's working for a temp agency right now and doesn't have the money to be seen by a doctor for follow-up care in Miami.      So just how much will the Pulse nightclub shooting cost all of the victims? It's a difficult, if not impossible question to answer right now. At last check, 56 people had been brought to the hospital, including three patients who spent two weeks in the intensive care unit, and one patient who is still in the hospital in critical condition.      Embry Howell, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a think tank in Washington, D.C., studied the average cost of a gunshot victim in 2010. Using that benchmark, she estimates the hospital costs from the Pulse shooting will be about 1 million.      \\"And I would imagine that would be an underestimate,\\" Howell said.      Howell said many of the victims may be in the same boat as Mario Perez: uninsured.      \\"They're young, primarily Latino and living in Florida,\\" she says, a state that has not expanded Medicaid to its population.      \\"My guess would be you have a high rate of uninsured,\\" she concludes.      Ted Miller, a researcher with the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, has been studying the cost of firearm injuries for more than two decades. He used the 2011 shooting of former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords and 18 others in Arizona to make what he calls a conservative estimate: 4 to 7 million in medical costs and mental health costs for victims and survivors of people who died.      That's lifetime medical costs for the survivors, the costs of surgery and rehab — but it doesn't count long-term costs for those who are severely injured.      \\"They said some time ago that there were six people in ICU who would have longtime, serious consequences,\\" Miller said. \\"And my guess is most of those folks will have traumatic brain injuries that will have continuing lifetime care.\\"      Miller also makes a broader estimate beyond just the medical costs. That includes the cost of the police response, the cost to employers — and the dollar value of those 49 lost lives.      \\"I estimate that the total cost of the Orlando shooting is around 385 to 390 million,\\" Miller says. \\"To put that in context, on that same day, the cost of other gunshot wounds in the U.S. was probably about 600 million. So about 1 1/2 times the cost of the Orlando incident. That tells you that there are a lot of people killed and injured by firearms every day in this country,\\" he says. And, he explains, \\"Suicide deaths account for the largest share of gun violence costs.\\"      Miller's 385 million estimate doesn't include the cost of mental health counseling for people who were in the club but not physically shot — and friends and family of those there. And then there's the cost of fear: people being afraid to go out to a dance club, or maybe skipping a visit to the theme parks.      Orlando Regional received 44 of the shooting victims. A hospital spokeswoman says some patients have insurance coverage, some don't. The hospital is going to look for payment sources from the community or the state, such as victim funds that are raising money across the country. But she says the hospital expects unreimbursed costs of more than 5 million.      Pulse shooting victim Mario Perez is calculating his personal costs. He's worried he's going to lose his job. He's anxious knowing millions of dollars have been raised to help victims, but his bills are arriving now. He started his own GoFundMe campaign, but it's only raised about 600.      \\"As long as it gets covered, I'm going to be fine,\\" Perez said. \\"If they don't cover it, I'm stuck in a hole. I don't know what I'm going to be able to do if they don't assist me.\\"      This story is part of a reporting partnership with NPR, Health News Florida and Kaiser Health News. |||||","output":"Orlando Health and Florida Hospital will not charge the survivors of the Pulse nightclub shooting for their medical expenses and will instead write off an estimated 5.5 million or more in care costs.

As an avid fan of the Flashman books by George McDonald Fraser, I looked forward immensely to seeing Flashy on the big screen when this film was first released. Sadly it was a huge disappointment then - so I left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again, but it was no better the second time. Mr Fraser is a tremendously skillful writer, but I am not a fan of his film screenplay work with Richard Lester. The penchant for slapstick spoilt 'The Three Musketeers' for me and the same applies here. To me, the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong. The Flashman books are uproariously funny in parts, but they are adventure novels. There is much seriousness in the way the adventures that Flashman has - after all, he is involved in dangerous situations. This is conveyed in the novels, but not conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style. It is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book. When I first read that the book was to be filmed, the article said that the film was to star Oliver Reed. I rejoiced, as Reed to me was the epitome of Flashman. How I would have loved to see him in the role. Malcolm McDowell is a good actor, but does not fit the visual image of Flashman created by the books (too scrawny looking! Flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow). Neverheless Reed was excellent as Bismarck. What kills the film is that it is made as a comedy. The only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which Flashman kills de Gautet (Tom Bell). A great shame, as the production values, costumes, sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent - just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from Malcolm McDowell. Possibly the directorship of Richard Lester was responsible for the way the film is, as a recent radio adaptation of 'Flash For Freedom', adapted by Mr Fraser, worked quite well. Perhaps one day we may see Flashman done justice on screen. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)?

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"No, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise. In logical reasoning and argument construction, a hypothesis is considered to be entailed by a premise if it can be logically deduced or inferred from the given premise. It means the truth of the hypothesis is absolutely guaranteed by the truth of the premise.  The premise given here is \\"The warlocks leaped back under the roof.\\" From this sentence, we understand that certain characters — warlocks, who are male practitioners of magic — moved in a certain way (leaping back) and in a certain location (under the roof).  On the other hand, the hypothesis — \\"The witches jumped into the pool.\\" — involves entirely different characters (witches: typically female practitioners of magic), different action (jumping) and different location (into a pool). There is no logical connection or overlap between the premise and the hypothesis, with regard to character identities, actions and locations. The characters are not the same: warlocks are not witches; the actions are not the same: leaping is not the same as jumping; and the locations are different: under a roof is not the same as into a pool. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically deduced or inferred from the premise. Additionally, the premise does not include any information about witches, pools, or the act of jumping. Therefore, the hypothesis adds new information which wasn't presented or suggested in any way by the premise.

But her fellow teacher said that we were celebrating her 39thbirthday! We were all surprised and puzzled. After the party I was told by the fellow teacher that American women have a special saying about birthdays. If a woman is over 40, or even if she is 80, her birthday is always the 39th. If she is in her thirties, her birthday will be the 29th. And in her twenties, it's the 19th. They usually have their \\"real\\" birthday when they are below 20. This shows that American women, especially elderly women, are very sensitive  about their ages.

Here are possible answers to this question: - book - internet - manual - library - manual  I believe the correct choice is \\"internet\\", here's why: A:","output":"The fairly new way to access information among the given choices is indeed the \\"internet\\". Let me explain in detail why this is the correct choice: The internet has revolutionized the way we access information, unlike traditional methods such as books, manuals, and libraries. While they have been around for centuries, the internet has only become widely popular over the past few decades. This rapid growth has made the internet a primary source of information for many people around the world. Here are several reasons why the internet is a fairly new and effective way to access information: 1. Ease of Access: The internet provides instantaneous access to a vast amount of information on any topic you can think of. Simply type a query into a search engine, and within seconds, you'll have thousands of webpages filled with relevant information. This is a huge advantage compared to manually searching through books or visiting libraries. 2. Up-to-date Information: Traditional information sources, like books and manuals, may quickly become outdated. On the other hand, information on the internet is regularly updated, ensuring that users have access to the most current data available. This is particularly useful for topics that evolve rapidly, such as technology or science. 3. Multimedia Content: The internet allows users to access various multimedia content, which contributes to a richer learning experience. From videos and podcasts to interactive websites and social media, the internet offers a wide range of formats to consume information, catering to different preferences and learning styles. 4. Accessibility: With the development of smartphones, tablets, and laptops, people can connect to the internet and access information from anywhere in the world, anytime. In addition, people with disabilities can utilize adaptive technologies, enabling them to access the internet and diverse information with greater ease. 5. Collaboration and Sharing: The internet enables users to collaborate and share information at a global scale. Platforms like discussion forums, social media, and blogs encourage the exchange of ideas and facilitate learning. This continuous sharing of knowledge fosters the growth of collective wisdom. 6. Customization and Personalization: The internet allows users to filter and tailor the information they access according to their specific needs and interests. This personalization makes it easier to find relevant information in a shorter amount of time. In conclusion, the relatively recent rise of the internet has created a whole new approach to accessing information. Its ease of use, up-to-date content, multimedia formats, accessibility, global collaboration, and personalization make it the most efficient and effective way of acquiring information compared to traditional methods like books, manuals, and libraries."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An adjunct island is a part of a sentence that has an adjunct in it (an element that adds additional information, but its removal doesn't make the sentence ungrammatical).

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Don’t go into the relationship expecting immediate commitment. Instead, take your time getting to know your partner and bonding with her. Dating after spousal loss is an intimidating process, so your significant other may have reservations about taking this step in the first place. Many people date with the intention of creating a long-term relationship, widows included. Be sure to talk with your partner about what you both are looking for in a relationship. If you both want a committed, stable relationship, feel free to proceed with each other. However, if you find you want different outcomes, it may be better to part ways. To start this conversation, you could ask: “Can we talk about where we see this relationship going?” or “Can we talk about whether we're interested in having a committed relationship?” Your partner’s status as a widow does not have to define your relationship, despite its understandable impact. You can strengthen your relationship with your significant other by trying new things together. This won’t erase your partner’s memories of her deceased spouse; instead it will help her to look forward to a future with you. The two of you could go out to your favorite restaurant or pick up a new hobby together. Even small moments, such as cooking a meal together or sharing a joke, can go a long way in strengthening your bond. Dating a widow may present new and unexpected challenges for the relationship. You may start to feel uneasy hearing about your significant other’s late partner and measure yourself against them. Your partner may worry about losing you just as she lost her spouse before you. Communicate with each other about your feelings, so you can work through them together. One helpful way to start this conversation would be: “I feel uncomfortable when you compare my new haircut to how Phil wore his hair. It's important to me that you see me for myself.” Be sure to place emphasis on how a specific behavior makes you feel; this gets to the heart of the issue. Let them adjust to you at their own pace. Children may feel easily threatened by the idea of a new stepparent. They may gain the impression that you are trying to take over their late parent’s role.  Introduce yourself to them, but don’t try to join in on family activities right away. Your partner’s children will need to gradually get used to your presence. Follow your partner’s lead. She knows her children best. Talk with her about how to comfortably get to know her children and try to learn about their personalities and interests. It may be best to start off by coming over for dinner one night, or accompanying your partner and her children to one of their extracurricular activities. Participating in more casual activities will help to ease some of the tension.

Movie plot: Cliff Spab (Stephen Dorff) and his friend Joe Dice (Jack Noseworthy) are two slackers who go out one evening to buy some beer in a Los Angeles convenience store. While there, a group of masked and heavily armed terrorists take Cliff, Joe, and three other people hostage. The terrorists, who call themselves S.P.L.T. Image, have a video camera, and they tape their hostages. During the month-long standoff with the police, S.P.L.T. Image's only demand is that their broadcasts be televised on worldwide television live and uncut, or else the hostages will be killed. After two of the hostages are killed, Cliff, Joe and another hostage, a young teenage girl named Wendy Pfister (Reese Witherspoon), are the only ones left. After 36 days, Cliff become indifferent to being killed, and he says repeatedly, \\"So fucking what?\\", in reply to his captors' threats to kill him. Because of the coverage, this makes Cliff a media icon.The movie skips forward, picking up in the hospital. Cliff, we learn, had shot his way to freedom, at the cost of a bullet in his shoulder, and more significantly, Joe's life. Despite Joe's death, Cliff is branded a hero for saving Wendy and killing all the terrorists. He's picked up from the hospital by his brother Scott (David Barry Gray) and taken home, where Cliff soon becomes uncomfortable. He does not appreciate either the reporters camped outside his front lawn, nor his parents, who welcome him home awkwardly. Cliff cannot stand the presence of his domineering father and weak-willed mother, and he flees their house. But on the street, he finds that his life cannot go back to what it was before the convenience store. His line, abbreviated as S.F.W., is on banners, newspapers, CDs, and on billboard advertisements. At the fast food restaurant where he works, called Burger Boy, he finds his name and image on the board with a \\"Special 36¢ Cliff Spab Burger\\" being marketed in commemoration of his 36 days in captivity.Cliff flees to the home of Joe's older sister Monica (Joey Lauren Adams), who tells... My question: WHAT DOES CLIFF ASPIRE ? A:","output":"Cliff aspires to find a sense of normalcy, genuine connection, and escape from the unwanted fame and attention that has been thrust upon him after the hostage situation. Throughout the progression of the movie, we see that Cliff is overwhelmed by the media circus and constant reminders of his traumatic experience. His iconic line, \\"So fucking what?\\" (S.F.W.), speaks to his indifference towards the terrorists' threats and his attempt to diminish their power over him. However, as Cliff struggles with the aftermath of the hostage situation, he realizes that the media and society have taken his statement and turned it into a symbol that no longer represents his true intent. This disillusionment drives him to seek refuge away from the spotlight and to find meaningful relationships with those who understand his plight, such as the sister of his deceased friend Joe, Monica. In essence, Cliff aspires to regain control over his life and move past the tragedy that has come to define him. He hopes to find solace in reconnecting with those close to him before the incident and to break free from the media's portrayal of him as a superficial hero.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\"?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Google to Buy Motorola Mobility for 12.5 Billion In a bid to strengthen its mobile business, Google announced on Monday that it would acquire Motorola Mobility Holdings, the cellphone business that was split from Motorola, for 40 a share in cash, or 12.5 billion. The offer — by far Google’s largest ever for an acquisition — is 63 percent above the closing price of Motorola Mobility shares on Friday. Motorola manufactures phones that run on Google’s Android software. Android has become an increasingly important platform for Google, as global smartphone adoption accelerates. The platform, launched in 2007, is now used in more than 150 million devices, with 39 manufacturers. The acquisition would turn Google, which makes the Android mobile operating system, into a full-fledged cellphone manufacturer, in direct competition with Apple. “This is an emphatic exclamation point that Google is a mobile company,” said Ben Schachter, an analyst with Macquarie Capital. “This is clearly a defensive deal, they were backed in a corner and they had to protect the Android platform.” The deal answers a big question about Google’s next strategic step in wireless. Google has been battling with Apple and Microsoft over patents. Last month, Apple and Microsoft led a consortium of technology companies in a 4.5 billion purchase of roughly 6,000 patents from Nortel Networks, the Canadian telecommunications maker that filed for bankruptcy in 2008. Google, which lost out in the bidding, criticized the deal as an anticompetitive strategy. Several weeks later, Google acquired more than 1,000 patents from I.B.M. Motorola holds more than 17,000 patents. While the acquisition will move Google directly into the telecommunications hardware business, Larry Page, Google’s chief executive, said in a blog post that “this acquisition will not change our commitment to run Android as an open platform. Motorola will remain a licensee of Android and Android will remain open. We will run Motorola as a separate business.” Still, the deal is certain to attract significant antitrust scrutiny. The Federal Trade Commission is already investigating Google’s dominance in several areas of its business. The company has agreed to pay a 2.5 billion reverse termination fee, if it walks away, and Motorola will pay a 375 million break-up fee if it takes another offer, according to a person close to the transaction, who was not authorized to speak. In a conference call on Monday morning, Google said it was confident that it will be able to win regulatory approval, since the deal will ultimately improve competition in the smart phone market. “We think this is a competitive transaction,” David Drummond, the company’s chief legal officer said. “This is not a horizontal transaction, Google has not materially been in the handset business.” The acquisition of a major handset maker may still pose a significant challenge to the search giant, which has not specialized in manufacturing or marketing of smartphones. Last year, it closed down the online store for its first Google-branded phone, the Nexus One, citing the store’s underwhelming performance. A Motorola tie-up may also irk other phone manufacturers, like Samsung and HTC, which will now be competing directly with Google. “Can they convince their competitors that Motorola will truly operate as a standalone business?” Mr. Schachter said. And while Google has made dozens of acquisitions in recent years, most of them have been for less than 1 billion — despite a current war chest of some 40 billion in cash. On the company’s official blog, Mr. Page said Google was purchasing the handset maker to bolster its Android mobile operating system and increase the number of patents it owned. Android accounted for 43.4 percent of smartphone sales in the second quarter, according to Gartner Research, a major increase from the year ago period, when it made up about 17 percent of sales. “Our acquisition of Motorola will increase competition by strengthening Google’s patent portfolio, which will enable us to better protect Android from anticompetitive threats from Microsoft, Apple and other companies,” Mr. Page said. Carl C. Icahn, Motorola Mobility’s second-largest shareholder, had urged the company last month to “explore alternatives regarding its patent portfolio to enhance shareholder value.” Mr. Icahn owns 9.03 percent of Motorola Mobility. On Monday, he applauded the transaction, calling it “a great outcome for all shareholders of Motorola Mobility, especially in light of today’s markets.” Lazard and the law firm of Cleary Gottlieb Steen & Hamilton advised Google. Frank Quattrone’s investment bank, Qatalyst Partners, Centerview Partners and the law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz advised Motorola Mobility. The acquisition has been approved by both boards. Michael J. de la Merced contributed reporting.

Eliaquim Mangala has spoken of the difficulty he had staying fit while waiting for his £31.9million move to Manchester City to go through. City made Mangala the most expensive defender in the history of British football on Monday after finally agreeing terms with FC Porto and an investment company who owned 33 per cent of his economic rights. The 23-year-old agreed personal terms and passed a medical on a visit to Manchester last month, but has been training on his own since returning from the World Cup and a brief holiday while he waited for his future to be resolved. VIDEO Scroll down to see Eliaquim Mangala score with cheeky back heel volley. Chuffed: Eliaquim Mangala poses with a Man City shirt following his move to the Etihad Stadium. Patient: He has admitted that it was hard to stay fit as he waited for the move to go through. ‘I am happy now because I will be able to start a new adventure,’ said Mangala in his first interview with City’s club website. ‘I will be able to train again. It was good to be on holidays but after a time I started to find the time quite long. ‘I went on a run every day and trained in the gym. Holidays are great but if the time is too long, it is difficult to come back. I think that I will need a bit of time in order to be 100 per cent but it is normal – it is like those who returned to training last week, but I will work hard in order to be 100 per cent as soon as possible. ‘I am really very happy to be part of the team and I will work hard because we have lots of goals and it is very important to start to work as soon as possible.’ Mangala is determined to add to his medal collection in Manchester after winning league titles in Portugal and Belgium with Porto and Standard Liege. And he promised City fans that he will bring a winning mentality to Manuel Pellegrini’s team. Pricey: He became the most expensive defender in British football history following move from Porto. Acquisition: The defender played for Porto for three seasons before signing for Manuel Pellegrini. ‘When I am on the pitch, I always give everything from the first to the last minute,’ he added. ‘I am the kind of player that comes on the pitch to win. I am not giving away anything, I always fight until the end and I hope that we will win quite a lot of titles this season. ‘I am quite a fast defender. I am good in challenges, good in the air. I have the ability to score goals and have done so in the past few seasons. I won’t score 10 goals-a-season but for a defender I get my share from set-pieces. ‘I am motivated because to be part of a team like City I have already proved that I have a certain value, but I will not stop trying to improve. ‘To be part of a squad is good but like everybody else I want to play and it will be down to the manager to make his choice. I will work hard to try to have a spot in the starting XI but the most important is that the team win the games, win titles. It is my main goal: work in order to help the team to win as many titles as possible.’ Manchester United and Chelsea were also linked with Mangala but the France World Cup defender admits that he was impressed by City’s success in recent years and the fact that they made the most effort to bring him to English football. ‘City is a big team in England and they proved it again this year by winning the title,’ he said. ‘Then it is the team that showed me the most interest. I had the opportunity to talk with the manager and the football director and it is also important to have some guarantees when you move to a new club. I had this opportunity to talk and I liked what they said so I signed with City. ‘The squad is great so it will allow me to progress again. I am also someone who likes to win titles and I know that with the squad we have we can do great things.’ Partner: Mangala is set to form a central defensive partnership with City captain Vincent Kompany. Follow on: He will join former Porto team-mate Fernando, who joined the club earlier in the summer. Challenge: And he will be fighting for his place against Martin Demichelis. Mangala is expected to form a first-choice central defensive partnership with City captain Vincent Kompany but he will face competition from Martin Demichelis. Pellegrini also has Dedryck Boyata and Karim Rekik at his disposal, although Matija Nastasic and Micah Richards are expected to move on. ‘Vincent Kompany and Martin Demichelis are two players who possess great experience,’ said Mangala. ‘Vincent is the captain of Manchester City and the Belgium national team, Demichelis has enjoyed a great career. He played for Bayern Munich and he is now at Manchester City and has a big experience behind him. ‘They are players that I can look at and from whom I will learn a lot. They will have lots of advice for me regarding what they have already experienced. It will help me to progress and I am sure that everything will be fine. They are players that have lived through a lot of big moments and have a big experience so it can only be beneficial for me.’ Mangala joins his former Porto teammate Fernando at the Etihad after the Brazilian midfielder moved for £12m earlier this summer. He also becomes the fourth Frenchman on City’s books, joining Bacary Sagna, Samir Nasri and Gael Clichy at the club. He added: ‘I was with Bacary Sagna during the World Cup so we had the opportunity to talk. There are quite a lot of French players and Fernando, who I was in touch during all the preparation because I came here earlier. ‘I had the chance to talk with him and there are some players that speak Spanish and I understand a bit of that language so I think it will be quite quick for me to settle in. The most important thing is to have a good understanding on the pitch and to all go in the same direction.’ Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Eliaquim Mangala, a French professional footballer, has discussed the challenges he faced in staying fit while waiting for his £31.9 million move to Manchester City to be finalized.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations.  Now, I have a new situation: Carrie bought two parcels of farmland. The Northern one had soil with lots of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi, while the Southern parcel  had almost no traces of AM fungi.  Answer this question please: Which parcel had a higher soil nutrient content? A:","output":"Based on the background information provided, arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi become less prevalent and diverse in areas with higher soil nutrient concentrations. This is because Plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi under such conditions, and the fungi themselves reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae, indicating a cost/benefit balance within the plant-fungus symbiosis. Moving on to the new situation, we have two parcels of farmland. The Northern one has plenty of AM fungi, while the Southern one has almost none. Based on the inverse correlation between the presence of AM fungi and soil nutrient concentrations, it is likely that the Southern parcel of farmland which contains few or no AM fungi would have a higher soil nutrient content. The hypothesis that can be extended from this situation is that because the Southern parcel of land is richer in nutrients, plants growing there require less assistance from AM fungi to acquire nutrients. Thus, the plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi which possibly results in their decreased prevalence in the soil.  However, it should be noted that this is a tentative conclusion because other factors may also influence the presence or absence of AM fungi. For example, certain pedoclimatic conditions, such as moisture levels and pH, can influence their distribution. Furthermore, certain plants have a higher affinity for mycorrhizal relationships than others. Therefore, while the nutrient content could be playing a decisive role, the agricultural history of the parcels and the types of crops previously grown there could also influence the distribution of AM fungi.  For a definitive conclusion, soil samples should be taken from both parcels and tested for their nutrient content in a soil testing laboratory. This would not only validate the above-stated hypothesis but also provide deeper insights into the overall soil health and fertility status which is of prime importance for agricultural productivity. Furthermore, understanding the specific relationship between the local plant hosts and the AM fungi could provide useful knowledge for picking the right crops to cultivate or for creating a long-term crop rotation plan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dimitrios Pagourtzis made his initial court appearance Friday evening via closed circuit video from the Galveston County Jail. (May 18) AP      Abdul Aziz Sheikh, father of Sabika Sheikh, an exchange student from Pakistan who was killed in a shooting at Santa Fe HIgh School in Santa Fe, Texas, comforts relatives during her funeral in Karachi, Pakistan, May 23, 2018. (Photo: REHAN KHAN, EPA-EFE)      When Sabika Aziz Sheikh’s parents sent her to the United States as an exchange student from their native Pakistan in August 2017, they saw the opportunity as a step forward in her pursuit of a career in business.      They never envisioned those dreams ending at the hands of a gunman in her school, and now they want other parents to avoid the immeasurable sorrow they continue to experience.      Sheikh was one of 10 people – eight students and two teachers – killed in the May 18 shooting at Santa Fe High School outside Houston. On Wednesday, her parents – Abdul Aziz and Farah Naz – joined six other families in a lawsuit against the parents of suspected shooter Dimitrios Pagourtzis.      Sheikh, 17, was less than three weeks away from completing her exchange program and returning home to Karachi when she became one of the victims in the nation’s second-deadliest school shooting this year.      “No other parent should ever have to experience this unbearable grief,” Sheikh’s parents said in a statement. “Sabika’s picture is in front of our eyes every single moment, and her voice and laughter echo in our ears. For a mother and a father, this trauma and mourning stay until their last breath.’’      The lawsuit alleges that Antonio Pagourtzis and his wife, Rose Marie Kosmetatos, were negligent in storing the weapons their son used to carry out the massacre and ignored signs that he might harm himself or others.      Dimitrios Pagourtzis, who was then 17 and a junior at the school, has been charged with capital murder and aggravated assault on a peace officer. He admitted to the shooting spree after being arrested.      In addition to pursuing more than 1 million in damages, Aziz and Naz see the lawsuit as a way to shed light on the gun culture in the United States, their lawyer said.      “They had no knowledge of that before Sabika was killed,’’ Molly Thomas-Jensen said. “It’s part of a broader conversation that the U.S. has an anomalous problem with gun violence.’’      Thomas-Jensen works as counsel for Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun-control advocacy group that is providing part of the legal representation for the Aziz-Naz family while highlighting the issue of safe storage of firearms.

Authorities have said Dimitrios Pagourtzis used his father’s legally-owned shotgun and revolver in his shooting rampage, and also brought explosive devices that did not detonate to the school.      It is not clear how the weapons were stored – Antonios Pagourtzis reportedly told Greek station Antenna TV that his son took them from his closet – but neither the elder Pagourtzis nor his wife has been charged.      Texas law says guns can’t be made accessible to children under 17, with certain exceptions. However, Dimitrios Pagourtzis was already 17 at the time of the attack.      Defense lawyer Ron Rodgers, who represents the elder Pagourtzis and Kosmetatos, told USA TODAY via email that his clients are heartbroken over the tragedy.      “While it is perhaps natural for those looking for someone to blame for the acts of a child to point the finger at the parents, the fact is that many of the allegations concerning my clients are either inaccurate or wholly untrue,’’ Rodgers wrote.      “The allegation that my clients were negligent in storing their weapons is not supported by the evidence. The claim that the guns were taken from the closet is entirely false. They were kept in a locked gun cabinet. At this point, I can only surmise that this allegation was based on inaccurate translation. There are other statements attributed to Mr. Pagourtzis in his interview with Greek media that were translated incorrectly.’’      The lawsuit charges the parents not only failed to secure the weapons, but also neglected to take action even though their son “harbored violent and hateful impulses.’’      The list of examples cited in the complaint include a fascination with the Columbine school killings of 1999 and a habit of dressing like the shooters, the keen interest in firearms Dimitrios Pagourtzis demonstrated on social media and his uploading to his Facebook page of a photo with a T-shirt bearing the words, “BORN TO KILL.’’      Eric Tirschwell, litigation director for Everytown for Gun Safety, said the signs were strong enough for Pagourtzis’ parents to at least make sure he could not access the weapons.      “If you make the decision to have firearms in your home, you have a responsibility to make sure they are secure, and in particularly in a situation where you have a household member, a child or otherwise, who is exhibiting behavior that would cause any reasonable person to be alarmed,\\" Tirschwell said.

Abdul Aziz and Farah Naz, the parents of Sabika Sheikh, who was 17, joined a lawsuit filed in a Galveston County court. The suit was brought by family members of some of the people killed at Santa Fe High School and alleges that the parents of suspect Dimitrios Pagourtzis, 18, were negligent and irresponsibly stored their firearms.      \\"Sabika's picture is in front of our eyes every single moment, and her voice and laughter echo in our ears,\\" Aziz and Naz said in a statement.      \\"For a mother and a father, this trauma and mourning stay until their last breath,\\" they said. \\"We are grateful to everyone in the U.S. and around the world who met us in person and reached us through emails, print, electronic and social media to express solidarity and empower us to endure this most profound tragedy.\\"      Sheikh was one of eight students and two substitute teachers killed in the school shooting. Police have said Pagourtzis entered the school armed with a shotgun and revolver, weapons owned by his parents. Authorities said Pagourtzis also had explosive devices that failed to detonate.      Sheikh's parents filed their legal claims days before what would have been their daughter's 18th birthday.      Before her death, Sheikh was less than three weeks away from returning home to Pakistan after spending a year as an exchange student in the United States. She was a youth ambassador with the U.S. State Department sponsored Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study Program, which is administered by the American Councils for International Education, the American Institute for Foreign Study Foundation and I*Earn.      The lawsuit alleges that Pagourtzis' parents, Antonios Pagourtzis and Rose Marie Kosmetatos of Galveston, failed to respond to and address warning signs that their son posed a risk to others.      Ron Rodgers, a League City-based attorney defending Pagourtzis' parents in the lawsuit, said in a statement that he is confident his clients were not negligent and \\"could not have predicted what occurred.\\"      \\"My clients are truly heartbroken over the horrific loss of Ms. Sheikh and all of the victims of the May 18th tragedy, and our hearts go out to their families and the community,\\" Rodgers said. \\"While it is perhaps natural for those looking for someone to blame for the acts of a child to point the finger at the parents, the fact is that many of the allegations concerning my clients are either inaccurate or wholly untrue. The legal theories they are putting forward are premised on facts that just aren't there.\\"      Sheikh's parents, who live in Karachi, Pakistan, are represented by Everytown for Gun Safety's litigation team and by attorney Clint E. McGuire of Martinez and McGuire PLLC in Houston. McGuire did not respond to a request for comment.      Shaheerah Albasit, Sheikh's cousin and a graduate student living in Washington, D.C., said the fact that Sheikh's parents live abroad made it logistically difficult for them to join the lawsuit right away. Albasit hoped the lawsuit would contribute to the nationwide dialogue around ending gun violence.      \\"Our motivation behind (the lawsuit) is that this will contribute to increasing a sense of accountability, not just to gun owners when it comes to safe storage and responsible storage of their weapons, but also in people around them that display signs of harming themselves and harming others and to be more cognizant about them, and to take measures to ensure that they do not end up doing what (Pagourtzis) did,\\" Albasit said.      Pagourtzis remains in custody in Galveston County without bail, charged with capital murder and a first-degree felony charge of aggravated assault on a peace officer in the wounding of Santa Fe Independent School District Officer John Barnes. Pagourtzis is eligible for a life sentence if convicted, and could be eligible for parole in 40 years. A federal investigation into the Santa Fe shooting is ongoing.

Taking up a weapon, the distraught young Abe tells his mother that he loves her before beheading her. He then joins others in his community in containing a local zombie outbreak.In August 1863, when an adult Abraham Lincoln (Bill Oberst Jr.) has become President of a fracturing United States, he is apprised of rumors concerning a prominent Confederate stronghold. He is told that a regiment of 30 men had gone to Confederate Fort Pulaski to seize it from the Confederates and only one man returned barely alive. When questioning the survivor, Lincoln discovers the soldier has an illness that seems to bring corpses back to life. He then personally leads a team of the newly established Secret Service to accompany him in investigating the fort in the Deep South.They get to the fort and are attacked by Confederate survivers led by the one-armed General Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson (Don McGraw) (who did not die at the battle of Chancelorville but just lost his right arm) as well as by several of the infected people.

Unitas and Helen Superfisky, who both were of Lithuanian descent; he grew up in the Mount Washington neighborhood. When Johnny was five years old, his father died of cardiovascular renal disease complicated by pneumonia, leaving the young boy to be raised by his mother, who worked two jobs to support the family. His surname was a result of a phonetic transliteration of a common Lithuanian last name Jonaitis. Attending St. Justin's High School in Pittsburgh, Unitas played halfback and quarterback. In 1956, Unitas joined the Baltimore Colts of the NFL under legendary coach Weeb Ewbank, after being asked at the last minute to join Bloomfield Rams lineman Jim Deglau, a Croatian steel worker with a life much like Unitas', at the latter's scheduled Colts tryout. The pair borrowed money from friends to pay for the gas to make the trip. Deglau later told a reporter after Unitas' death, \\"[His] uncle told him not to come. [He] was worried that if he came down and the Colts passed on him, it would look bad (to other NFL teams).\\" The Colts signed Unitas, much to the chagrin of the Cleveland Browns, who had hoped to claim the rejected Steeler quarterback.  Unitas made his NFL debut with an inauspicious \\"mop-up\\" appearance against Detroit, going 0-2 with one interception. Two weeks later, starting quarterback George Shaw suffered a broken leg against the Chicago Bears. In his first serious action, Unitas' initial pass was intercepted and returned for a touchdown. Then he botched a hand-off on his next play, a fumble recovered by the Bears. Unitas rebounded quickly from that 58-27 loss, leading the Colts to an upset of Green Bay and their first win over Cleveland. He threw nine touchdown passes that year, including one in the season finale that started his record 47-game streak. His 55.6-percent completion mark was a rookie record.  In 1957, his first season as the Colts full-time starter at quarterback, Unitas finished first in the NFL in passing yards (2,550) and touchdown passes (24) as he helped lead the Colts to a 7-5 record, the first winning record in franchise history. At season's end, Unitas received the Jim Thorpe Trophy as the NFL's Most Valuable Player by the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA).

Second question: Why don't the people who campaign loudly against same sex marriages also campaign against atheist marriages? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Possible answers:  + no.  + yes.","output":"First question: Is it acceptable to have loud sex in a hotel? It is essential to consider the context and various factors before determining whether it is acceptable to have loud sex in a hotel or not. From a moral standpoint, it can be argued that having loud sex in a hotel is permissible, as hotels are typically seen as private spaces where couples can engage in intimate activities without being bothered. However, there is an inherent expectation of privacy and respect for other guests that one should consider. This can vary from one culture to another, as well as the specific norms and values within each society. On the other hand, the level of acceptability largely depends on the hotel type, location, and general atmosphere. For instance, in a luxury hotel or a hotel specifically catering to couples or honeymooners, rudimentary insulation and soundproofing can enable couples to engage in intimate activities without disturbing others. Subsequently, the issue of noise may be less of a concern. In contrast, it might not be considered acceptable in budget hotels, family-oriented hotels, or shared accommodations, where walls are typically thin, and other guests may be easily disturbed. Furthermore, guests who are potentially sharing walls with strangers or families, including young children, would expect their stay to be peaceful and quiet, free from any disrupting noises. In summary, whether or not it is acceptable to have loud sex in a hotel depends on several factors, including the type of hotel, its atmosphere, and the expectations of other guests. It is crucial to be respectful and mindful of others' needs and preferences to maintain a pleasant and peaceful environment. Second question: Why don't the people who campaign loudly against same-sex marriages also campaign against atheist marriages? While it is essential to recognize that not all individuals who oppose same-sex marriage share the exact same beliefs, many of those who do campaign against same-sex marriages base their opposition on religious or conservative viewpoints, which they believe should be upheld and respected by the broader society. On the other hand, atheist marriages may not necessarily challenge these conservative religious beliefs in the same way that same-sex marriages do. While people who enter into atheist marriages do not adhere to religious principles, their union may still comply with the traditional notion of \\"one man, one woman.\\" As a result, they might not be considered transgressive by the same group of people who object to same-sex marriages. Moreover, an atheist couple's choice not to incorporate religious ceremonies or beliefs may not explicitly challenge the conservative religious view of marriage directly, as they may still adhere to broader societal norms surrounding family structure. This difference could explain why some individuals can more readily accept atheist marriages while remaining vehemently opposed to same-sex marriages. However, it is important to note that some individuals and religious groups may indeed object to atheist marriages due to their lack of religious sanction, though this opposition may not generate the same level of activism or attention as same-sex marriage campaigns.  Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is related to the appropriateness of certain behaviors in shared, semi-public environments like hotels, which involves consideration of privacy boundaries and respect for others' expectations. In contrast, the second question addresses the apparent inconsistency in some people's opposition to particular types of marriages, specifically same-sex and atheist marriages, from a sociopolitical and religious perspective. These topics may intersect in terms of societal values and expectations, but they ultimately address different issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: I’m sitting at the airport on a Sunday morning waiting for my flight to Las Vegas for the now-annual pilgrimage to the NamesCon conference. A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

First question: What is the value of cos9*? Second question: What is the value of 100P2? Are these two questions asking the same thing? pick from the following. a). no; b). yes;","output":"First question: What is the value of cos9*? The first question is asking for the value of the cosine of a 9-degree angle. Trigonometry deals with the relationships between the angles and sides of triangles, particularly right-angled triangles such as those with angles of 30, 45, and 60 degrees. The cosine is one of the primary trigonometric functions, and its value depends on the input angle. In this case, it seems that there is a slight error in the notation, as \\"cos9*\\" is not a conventional notation. The correct notation should be \\"cos(9°)\\", where the \\"°\\" symbol represents degrees. So, the question is inquiring about the value of the cosine of a 9-degree angle. Calculating cosine of 9 degrees is not straightforward since it does not correspond to one of the common trigonometric angles. However, using a calculator, we can find the value: cos(9°) ≈ 0.987688 Second question: What is the value of 100P2? The second question is asking for the value of \\"100P2\\", which in mathematics refers to a permutation problem: a combination (or arrangement) of objects in a certain order. The notation \\"nPm\\" or \\"nPr\\" (in this case, \\"100P2\\") represents the number of permutations of \\"n\\" objects taken \\"m\\" at a time (or r in general notation). In this specific problem, we are looking for the number of ways to arrange 100 objects taken 2 at a time. The formula for permutations is as follows: nPm = n! / (n - m)! where \\"n!\\" is the factorial of \\"n,\\" which represents the product of all the positive integers from 1 to n. Plugging in the numbers from the question: 100P2 = 100! / (100 - 2)! Since 100! = 100 × 99 × 98 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1, and 98! = 98 × 97 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1, we can simplify this expression: 100P2 = (100 × 99 × 98 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1) / (98 × 97 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1) Many terms from the numerator and denominator cancel out, leaving: 100P2 = 100 × 99 = 9,900 So, there are 9,900 possible permutations of 100 objects taken 2 at a time. Are these two questions asking the same thing? Pick from the following. a). no; b). yes; a). No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question is related to trigonometry, specifically asking about the value of the cosine of a 9-degree angle, while the second question is asking about permutations, inquiring about the number of possible ways to arrange 100 objects taken two at a time. These are two distinct mathematical concepts and not the same thing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: What was the name of the head coach of the team that Lockett played against on November 5th? Passage:He had hoped to redshirt during the 2011 season, which was his freshman year, so that he could add size. He played in 2011 as a true freshman and got off to a modest start. Lockett only recorded four receptions for 50 yards, three rushes for nine yards, one kickoff return for ten yards, and two punt returns for a total of 13 yards in his first five games through October 8. Things started to turn around on October 15 when he posted a 100-yard return of a kickoff for a touchdown against Texas Tech. Over the ensuing weeks, he earned numerous Big 12 Conference honors for the 2011 team, including becoming a two-time Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week. His first Player of the Week recognition came on October 24 after he produced a 251-yard all-purpose yards performance on October 22 against Kansas in the Governor's Cup that included posting a 97-yard kickoff return touchdown while becoming the first player in school history to return kickoffs for touchdowns in consecutive games and having a career-high five-reception 110-yard receiving day. His other Player of the Week recognition that season came on November 7 after a 315-yard all-purpose yard November 5 game against Oklahoma State that included an 80-yard kickoff return and three rushes for 84 yards as well as three receptions for 32 yards and a touchdown. Due to what was at first an undisclosed injury, he did not play in the final three games of Kansas State's regular season. Later, the injury was determined to be a lacerated kidney. In the four games before the injury, he had at least three receptions and 125 all-purpose yards in each game.  Links: a. 2011 Kansas Jayhawks football team b. Return yards c. 2011 Kansas Jayhawks football team d. 2011 Oklahoma State Cowboys football team","output":"To find the name of the head coach of the team that Lockett played against on November 5th, we need to first identify the opposing team mentioned in the passage.

Movie title: Fast & Furious Context: This fourth 'Fast and the Furious' film begins in the Dominican Republic. A semi truck pulling several fuel tankers drives by, followed by a black Buick GNX containing Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) and two older pickup trucks. Letty climbs onto the GNX's hood and hops onto the last fuel tanker while Dom pulls ahead of the semi and stays in front of it to keep it at a certain speed. The first pickup (driven by Han from the third film, 'The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift') does a perfect 180-degree U-turn and continues in reverse while his female occupant flips over a part of the truck and lands perfectly onto the hitch on the back of the last fuel tanker. Letty is already spraying the hitch connecting the fuel tankers to each other and smashes it with a hammer once it's frozen so the last two tankers become detached and eventually come to a stop. As the second pickup is preparing the same feat (with Dom talking to them on walkie-talkies, hinting that they're not particularly great at what they are doing), Letty is standing on top of one of the tankers, and the semi driver sees her in his rear view and begins to speed up, hitting the GNX. Things get a little hectic, and the second pickup is pretty much getting dragged since they pulled off the U-turn and are connected to the trailer hitch. Letty gets knocked off of her feet but hangs on, though her hammer falls. While driving alongside of her, Dom orders Letty to spray the hitch, despite her no longer having a hammer. He instead pulls a 180-degree turn with the rear end of his car hitting the tanker, which shatters the frozen hitch, though he is now driving in reverse. At this point, they are already heading downhill, and the semi driver jumps out with his pet lizard. The semi and its trailer detach as Dom urges Letty to jump, particularly because the road curves but the semi is rolled over onto its side and is blocking the road. She jumps, and he eventually stops in front of the flipped semi as the fuel tanker, flaming...

Given the hype surrounding this restaurant, we expected a top-notch dining experience, but sadly, that was not the case. From the moment we walked through the door, we knew that this evening would be a let-down. The host who greeted us was unwelcoming and did not seem to care much about seating us promptly or answering our questions about the reservation system. Eventually, we were seated, but it took far too long, and the way it was handled left a sour taste in our mouths. Once we got to our table, it quickly became apparent that the ambiance of the restaurant was nothing like what we had seen in the advertisements. The lighting was glaringly bright, and the decor seemed as if it had not been updated since the 90s. The noise level was unbearable, so much so that we could hardly carry on a conversation during our meal. We had hoped to relax and enjoy each other's company, but the atmosphere at Sunset Delights made this impossible. When it comes to the food, we found it to be subpar at best. Though their menu offers a wide variety of options, we were disappointed with the quality and presentation of our dishes. My steak was overcooked, despite my request for it to be prepared medium-rare, and the vegetables served alongside it were bland and under-seasoned. My friend ordered the seafood pasta, which she described as oily and lacking in flavor, with an unappetizing texture. Another member of our group asked for the vegan stir-fry and received a dish that seemed to consist mainly of soggy vegetables swimming in a pool of sauce. We had anticipated a memorable meal, and unfortunately, this was something we would rather forget. To make matters worse, the service we received throughout the evening was abysmal. Our server was inattentive and seemed overwhelmed, barely checking on us, and only coming around when we flagged him down to request refills or to inquire about our appetizers, which took an unreasonable amount of time to arrive. We tried to remain understanding, considering the restaurant was busy, but the level of neglect we experienced was unacceptable. In conclusion, our visit to Sunset Delights was an utterly underwhelming experience. The lack of prompt and courteous service, coupled with the low-quality food and poor atmosphere, has left us with no desire to return. With so many other fantastic dining options available, I would recommend steering clear of this restaurant and searching for a more deserving and enjoyable establishment to satisfy your culinary cravings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While in the field, she collected two flowers to examine in detail. She puts the first flower, flower X, under a microscope and begins to look at it. After examination she determines it's an anemophilous plant. She then takes flower Y and repeats the same process to determine that it's an entomophilous type of plant.  But I can use this background: Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.  What is an answer for this question: Which flower has a less exposed stamen? Answer:","output":"Flower Y, the entomophilous type of plant, has a less exposed stamen than Flower X. Entomophilous plants are adapted for pollination by insects, and their reproductive structures are often concealed or less exposed than those of anemophilous plants. The anemophilous plants, like Flower X, have well-exposed stamens to facilitate wind pollination, allowing pollen to be easily carried by air currents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sergeant Ames is still a buck sergeant who hates Dodo because he advanced to outrank Ames within Dodo's first 24 hours in the army.  Dodo's former comrade in arms Charlie Cobb is also a buck sergeant.  As both Cobb and Ames are the best marksman in the regiment but constantly boast of their prowess, Colonel Barkley seeks to find an expert who can outshoot them. Though possessing a photographic memory that enabled him to advance from private to senior non-commissioned officer in less than 24 hours, Dodo has one weakness: though his book knowledge enables him to give lectures on weapons disassembly and ballistics, he is gun shy and an incompetent marksman. After nearly shooting several of his fellow soldiers on the pistol range, with the actual target being the safest place to hide, Dodo is ordered to go into the woods to practice.  There his missed shots impress the picnicking colonel and his daughter Betty when Dodo accidentally shoots a hawk through the eye whilst in flight and after the colonel catches a fish who breaks the line and is in the process of rolling back into the water, an accidental discharge from Dodo's pistol shoots the fish through his eye.

The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

The answer to this question is:","output":"What factors may contribute to the decay and weakening of a tree's trunk, and how do the age and position of sapwood affect its susceptibility to these factors?  Answer: The decay and weakening of a tree's trunk can be caused by factors such as broken limbs or roots, deep wounds from fire, insects, or falling timber, and tunnels created by insect larvae. Sapwood may have some advantages in resisting decay due to its relative age and position, as the inner heartwood of old trees tends to remain sound despite being exposed to these factors for hundreds or even thousands of years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The program, financed with a grant from the UN Agency for International Development, is aimed at reducing infant mortality in Madagascar, an island nation in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa. Can we draw the following conclusion? The island people are being helped OPTIONS: a. Yes; b. It's impossible to say; c. No;","output":"a. Yes The program financed with a grant from the UN Agency for International Development is aimed at reducing infant mortality in Madagascar, which suggests that the island people are being helped. Madagascar is an island nation located in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa, and it faces numerous challenges such as poverty, malnutrition, inadequate healthcare facilities, and limited access to education. The program targets one of the critical issues affecting the population, which is the high rate of infant mortality. Reducing infant mortality in any society has numerous benefits, both short-term and long-term. In the short term, it helps save lives and alleviate the emotional burden on families who lose their infants. In the long term, it contributes to the overall social and economic development of the country by ensuring the next generation has a better chance of survival and growth. The UN Agency for International Development's grant could be used for various purposes to address the problem of infant mortality in Madagascar. For instance, the funds may be allocated to: 1. Improve healthcare facilities: Enhancing the quality of healthcare services available to pregnant women and infants is essential in reducing infant mortality. This could include upgrading existing facilities, constructing new ones, and ensuring they have the necessary staff, equipment, and supplies. 2. Train healthcare professionals: Ensuring healthcare professionals are well-trained and skilled in dealing with pregnancy-related complications and newborn care would go a long way towards reducing infant mortality. 3. Enhance nutrition programs: Providing adequate nutrition to pregnant women, infants, and young children is crucial for their overall health and development, and it helps reduce the risk of infant mortality. 4. Increase education and awareness: Educating the public, especially women of childbearing age, about the importance of prenatal care, postnatal care, and proper nutrition can contribute significantly to reducing infant mortality. 5. Implement community-based interventions: Ensuring access to healthcare services and birth attendants in remote and hard-to-reach areas can help those communities better care for their pregnant women and infants, reducing the risk of infant mortality. Through these and potentially other measures, the program works in favor of helping the island people, thereby making it reasonable to conclude that the people of Madagascar are being assisted through the grant."},{"instruction":"Information:  - Becoming X is the debut album from Sneaker Pimps released in 1996.

Background: Sean Michael Waltman (born July 13, 1972) is an American professional wrestler. He wrestled for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now called WWE) under the ring names 1-2-3 Kid and X-Pac intermittently between 1993 and 2002, World Championship Wrestling (WCW) as Syxx, and Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA) as Syxx-Pac and Sean Waltman. He is currently signed with WWE working in their Legends program. Waltman has won a dozen championships between WWE, WCW, and TNA; the majority were cruiserweight and tag team titles. Context: On September 16, 1996, Waltman was shown sitting in the front row for a live episode of Nitro. Later that night, he stood and used a remote control to release New World Order (nWo) propaganda from the ceiling, revealing himself as the newest member of the recently formed faction. He was called Syxx, because he was the sixth member of the nWo, and six is the sum of numbers in \\"1-2-3 Kid\\".  In his first major angle, Syxx stole Eddie Guerrero's WCW United States Heavyweight Championship belt, leading to a ladder match for the title at Souled Out in January 1997, which Syxx lost. The next month, at SuperBrawl VII, Syxx pinned Dean Malenko for the WCW Cruiserweight Championship, after hitting him with the title belt, which he had grabbed from Guerrero at ringside. In June 1997, he lost the championship to Chris Jericho at a webcast house show in Los Angeles, California, minutes after successfully defending against Rey Mysterio, Jr.  During a feud with Ric Flair, and a loss to him at Road Wild in August, Syxx disparagingly portrayed Flair as part of an nWo segment parodying his Four Horsemen group. This segment led to a WarGames match at Fall Brawl, where Syxx, Kevin Nash, Buff Bagwell and Konnan defeated The Four Horsemen (Flair, Steve McMichael, Chris Benoit and Curt Hennig) after Hennig betrayed the Horsemen and joined the nWo. In mid-1997, the nWo invoked \\"Wolfpac Rules\\", allowing Syxx to replace the injured Kevin Nash in defending the WCW World Tag Team Championship with Scott Hall. On October 13, 1997, Hall and Syxx lost the title to The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott).  In October, a neck injury sidelined Waltman from wrestling, but he continued to appear on TV for several weeks after. While later recuperating at home, he was fired via Federal Express by WCW President Eric Bischoff. Waltman claims this was a power play aimed at his friends Hall and Nash, whose backstage influence was felt as a threat. Bischoff later said Waltman was a competent performer when sober, but sober periods were \\"few and far between\\", and \\"in many ways, Sean was lucky to even have a job\\". Question: How did Flair react? Answer:","output":"Ric Flair, a famous wrestler, didn't like how Syxx (Sean Waltman) made fun of him and his group called the Four Horsemen. This made Ric Flair and his friends really want to beat Syxx and his friends, the nWo, when they had a big wrestling match called WarGames at the event named Fall Brawl. But in that match, one of Ric Flair's friends, Curt Hennig, betrayed them and joined Syxx's team, which made Ric Flair and his team very upset."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Assuming that:  Inhaling, or breathing in, increases the size of the chest, which decreases air pressure inside the lungs. A:","output":"When deflating a balloon filled with water, it will become smaller in size. The principles of deflation are quite different for balloons filled with air versus those filled with water. In the case of a water balloon, understanding why it gets smaller while deflating requires us to explore several aspects such as the properties of water, the elasticity of the balloon, and changes in atmospheric pressure.  1. Properties of water: Water is an incompressible fluid, which means that under most conditions, it maintains its volume. Water does not shrink or expand significantly as the pressure changes the way air does. When a water balloon is inflated, water takes up space within the balloon, stretching its walls to accommodate the increased volume. When you release or puncture the balloon, the water is expelled, leaving a smaller volume behind, causing the balloon to shrink. 2. Elasticity of the balloon: Balloons are made of materials such as rubber, latex, or Mylar, designed to be elastic and stretchy. When a balloon is filled with water, it stretches the walls to accommodate the water's volume, creating tension in the material. When the water is released, the tension diminishes, and the elastic properties of the balloon allow it to contract, thus returning to a smaller size. 3. Changes in atmospheric pressure: In the case of an air-filled balloon, changes in atmospheric pressure can also influence the size of the balloon. Specifically, a balloon will expand when in an area of low pressure and shrink in an area of high pressure. However, this effect is not significant for a water-filled balloon, as water is incompressible. When a water balloon deflates, the atmospheric pressure differences do not significantly impact the size reduction. Considering these factors, when you deflate a water-filled balloon, it unquestionably becomes smaller. The incompressibility of water and the elastic nature of the balloon ensure that when it deflates, the balloon will shrink in size, whether through a controlled release of water or by puncturing the balloon. The decrease in size is due to the reduced volume of water within the balloon and the contracting properties of the balloon's material, rather than changes in atmospheric pressure like in the case of an air-filled balloon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What was the reason for everyone being sitting around the coffee table ?","output":"It is difficult to determine the exact reason as to why everyone was sitting around the coffee table and not engaging in conversation during Brooke's bridal shower without more information. However, I can suggest a few possible explanations that could have contributed to the situation you observed. 1. Lack of icebreakers: It is essential to initiate a social event like a bridal shower with some icebreakers or activities to help guests become comfortable with one another. If the event started without any introduction or icebreaking activities, the guests might have felt awkward, especially if they were unfamiliar with each other or the event's purpose. 2. Introverted guests: The group could have comprised mostly introverted individuals who find it difficult to start conversations or engage in small talk. Such guests might prefer to observe the event and might require some encouragement to participate in discussions. 3. Insufficient planning: The host may not have adequately planned or structured the event, leading to an absence of activities, games, or topics that could engage the attendees. As a result, guests remained seated around the coffee table without much to do or discuss. 4. Unsuitable environment: Sometimes, guests require a conducive environment to socialize effectively. Factors such as dim lighting, uncomfortable seating arrangements, or loud music could hinder the guests' ability to interact with one another amicably. 5. Personal issues: It is also possible that some attendees might have been experiencing personal challenges or situations that prevented them from being sociable and affected the overall atmosphere at the bridal shower. 6. Cultural differences: Cultural factors could play a role in the guests' interaction levels. If the bridal shower attendees come from diverse backgrounds or countries, they may have varying social norms and customs that could result in communication barriers, causing the event to be less engaging for the group collectively. 7. Miscommunication about the event: There could have been a miscommunication or misunderstanding about the event's purpose among the attendees. If guests were unsure about the purpose of the bridal shower or their role in it, they may have defaulted to sitting around and observing the situation. In conclusion, while it is impossible to definitively pinpoint the reason for everyone's subdued behavior at Brooke's bridal shower, several factors could have contributed to the observed situation. Identifying the reason could provide insights into addressing the problem, possibly resulting in a more engaging and successful event in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

First, it is important to note that the information provided states that shopkeepers in remote provinces have learned the international price for everything, likely as a result of the spread of foreign travel. This suggests that these shopkeepers may now be more likely to charge higher, more internationally competitive prices, rather than being more generous with their discounts. Additionally, while it is mentioned that occasional small discounts may be given for purchases in volume or cash payments, there is no information provided that directly connects these discounts to the behavior or demeanor of the customer (i.e., being courteous and friendly). It is possible that some shopkeepers may choose to offer a discount to particularly polite or charismatic travelers, but this is not explicitly confirmed by the provided information. Furthermore, the nature of these discounts is described as being \\"occasional\\" and \\"small,\\" which implies that they may not be very common or significant in value. This further challenges the notion that shopkeepers in remote provinces are consistently generous with their discounts. In conclusion, while it is possible that some shopkeepers in remote provinces may be inclined to offer discounts to courteous and friendly travelers, this generosity is not explicitly confirmed by the provided information. To better understand the likelihood and nature of such discounts, it would be helpful to gather more data on the practices and attitudes of these shopkeepers in relation to their customers, their pricing strategies, and the influence of international travel on their business."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While the characteristics of friendship might vary from one country to another, people from all cultures not only enjoy friends but need them. Many studies have shown that teenagers who have no friends often suffer from psychological disorders. It has been shown that teenagers, perhaps more than any other age group, need companionship and a sense of belonging. The negative consequences of loneliness have also been observed among the elderly. The death of a spouse often leaves a widow or a widower totally bereft  . If, however, they are surrounded by friends and relatives and if they are able to articulate  their feelings, they are more likely to recover from their grief. \\"No man is an island.\\" In other words, we are all parts of society. We all need the love, admiration, respect and moral support of other people. If we are fortunate, our friends will provide us with all of these necessary aspects of life. As most people observe, there are many levels of friendship. The degree or intensity of friendship varies depending on the personality of the individuals involved and the context of the relationships. Extroverts   enjoy being surrounded by many people whereas introverts are perhaps content with fewer but more intense friendships. Everyone is not equally open with all their friends. The degree of intimacy   is determined by many factors. Close friends can be formed at any stage in one's life but they are usually very rare. Not very many people have more than a few really close friends. Irrespective of the level of intimacy, all friendships are based on reciprocity , honesty and a certain amount of love and affection. Question: The author thinks that close friends   _   . - can be easily formed when one is young - cannot be long-lasting - are not rare for everyone - are rare for most people","output":"The author thinks that close friends are rare for most people.

Answer:","output":"Yes, \\"be a kinder person\\" can be a valid answer as to why Skylar made amends to end the blood feud. However, to provide a more detailed and long answer, one must consider other factors and motivations that might have influenced Skylar's decision. Skylar's decision to make amends could be due to a variety of reasons: 1. Personal Growth: One possible reason for Skylar's actions is her individual growth and maturity over time. People often change their perspectives and values as they evolve, becoming more compassionate and understanding. As Skylar matured, she might have recognized the pain and suffering caused by the blood feud and decided that it was time to seek a more peaceful and harmonious path, which would indeed make her a kinder person. 2. The Impact of the Blood Feud: As the blood feud continued, it could have caused significant harm and collateral damage on both sides. The loss of loved ones and the constant state of unrest may have taken a toll on Skylar, leading her to search for a way to end the seemingly endless cycle of violence and retribution. By making amends, Skylar could have hoped to break this cycle and create an opportunity for both sides to heal and move forward. 3. The Desire for Peace: Skylar might have realized that continuous fighting would only lead to more suffering and ultimately would not benefit anyone involved. With a desire to create a more peaceful atmosphere and a better future for all, Skylar could have taken the initiative to extend an olive branch and make amends, seeking to build bridges rather than perpetuate enmity. 4. Setting an Example: Recognizing the negative impact of the blood feud, Skylar might have been motivated to make amends not only for herself but also to serve as a role model for others in her community, inspiring them to choose kindness and reconciliation over violence and revenge. By doing so, she could have aimed to create positive change and encourage others to embrace a more compassionate path. 5. Emotional Exhaustion: The constant emotional turmoil and stress caused by the blood feud could have left Skylar feeling emotionally exhausted and overwhelmed. She might have sought to make amends as a way to find inner peace, relieve the emotional burden, and regain a sense of control over her life. In conclusion, while becoming a kinder person is undoubtedly a significant aspect of Skylar's decision, it is essential to recognize the various other factors and motivations that contributed to her choice to make amends. It is likely that a combination of personal growth, the desire for peace, the impact of the blood feud, setting an example, and emotional exhaustion influenced Skylar's actions, leading her to seek an end to the long-standing conflict."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The story begins by the introduction of five seemingly very different young men and their reasons for being at the Energy Bio Corporation building: janitor Satoru Mashiko (Satoshi Ohno), motorcycle courier Nozomu Got (Jun Matsumoto), coffee shop employee Akira Tanada (Masaki Aiba), insurance salesman Yukio Tomizawa (Sho Sakurai) and security center employee Shji Yamagiwa (Kazunari Ninomiya). Without warning, a masked gunman suddenly appears on the TV monitors in the lobbies on each floor of the high rise and announces that he and his allies have hijacked the building, everyone inside is a hostage, and that a bomb that will go off in ninety minutes should Energy Bio Corporation President Niimi (Masahiko Tsugawa) not arrive with the ransom. Before she is locked in the rest of the hostages in the fifth floor lobby, Yuriko Niimi (Meisa Kuroki), the daughter of the president, manages to slip away into the stairwell of the building along with motorcycle courier Got. Prior to the lockdown by the masked men, coffee shop employee Tanada found a hiding place in a nearby supply room and has been keeping in contact by cell phone with Niimi and chief detective Genji Morozumi (Yukiya Kitamura) at the police station. Meanwhile, Yuriko quickly collects company data that is worth more than the ransom money. She confesses to Got that she believes her father isn't concerned for her safety at all and that he's only interested in saving his company. In turn, Got reveals a bit of his own past and how his trusted friend died ten years ago. The electricity in the building is momentarily cut off, which allows most of the hostages to escape. This gives security manager Shinichir Okanaka (Naohito Fujiki) the opportunity to distract the gunmen while security employee Yamagiwa opens the doors on the second floor, allowing more hostages to escape after the power...

Margaret Thatcher, Hillary Clinton and the glass ceiling In her drive to dig Britain out of its post-war doldrums and to reverse what she saw as its horrifying descent into Socialism, she ignored the misery caused by her policies as the country was transformed from a welfare state to a more brutal, capitalist endeavor. She was Britain’s first and only female prime minister. But she was no feminist icon. PHOTOS: Margaret Thatcher | 1925 - 2013 Despite the occasional anecdote about how she had to rush off to buy bacon for her husband because no one else could be trusted to buy the right kind, Thatcher publicly embodied few of what we identify as the classic female traits -- nurturing, sensitive, collegial, flexible -- that experts tell us repeatedly could improve politics and the professions. Even the most feminine symbol associated with her -- her handbag -- became a symbol of that classic male trait, aggression. “I don’t feel sorry for people,” Thatcher once said after touring an area with 20% unemployment. “Feeling sorry for someone does nothing.” The most famous American female politician, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who has worked tirelessly for the rights of women and girls, is associated with the phrase “It takes a village to raise a child.” Thatcher’s equivalent: “There is no such thing as society.” For these reasons, I had to chuckle this morning when I read part of President Obama’s statement of condolence about Thatcher. “As a grocer’s daughter who rose to become Britain’s first female prime minister,” he said, “she stands as an example to our daughters that there is no glass ceiling that can’t be shattered.” It’s been 23 years since Thatcher left office, essentially deposed in a power struggle with her own conservative allies. How many British female prime ministers have come after her? How many female U.S. presidents have we had since then? I can find nothing in the record that shows she had an interest in blazing a path for women. She was criticized for failing to bring more women into the government. In her New York Times obituary, she is quoted as once having said: “The battle for women’s rights has largely been won. I hate these strident tones we hear from some women’s libbers.” She could only tolerate her own strident tones, I guess. I met her once, in the late 1980s, and we talked about fashion, if you can believe it. But that was because it was London Fashion Week, and I was part of a contingent of American and British fashion editors invited to 10 Downing Street for a reception. She was very pleasant, but she was all business. “Lean In,” the new advice book for professional women by Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, is full of grim statistics about women’s standing in the public sphere: only 22 of the world’s 197 heads of state are women, only 21 of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women, women hold only 14% of executive officer positions, 16% of board seats, and just 18% of U.S. congressional seats. “The blunt truth,” concludes Sandberg, “is that men still run the world.” Thatcher was an extraordinary woman, absolutely fearless, unflinching and seemingly without an ounce of self-doubt. “She was very macho,” her former press secretary told the Los Angeles Times. “She was determined to demonstrate she could beat the men.” Beat the men she did. But she shouldn’t be celebrated for blazing trails for women. By sheer will, she hacked open her own path to the top, then let it close behind her. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses the legacy of Margaret Thatcher, the first and only female prime minister of Britain, in comparison to other female politicians like Hillary Clinton. The author argues that Thatcher was not a feminist icon and did little to promote the advancement of women in politics. She lacked the nurturing and sensitive traits typically associated with women and demonstrated a lack of empathy for those suffering during her tenure. The author highlights that no British female prime ministers have followed Thatcher and the lack of female representation in powerful roles across the world. The article concludes by stating that although Thatcher was an extraordinary and fearless politician, she should not be celebrated for breaking the glass ceiling for women as she did little to pave the way for others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"It provides visitors with the perfect frame for a first view of the ensemble.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"It provides the best staging point to observe the ensemble.\\" true?","output":"To assess the validity of the hypothesis \\"It provides the best staging point to observe the ensemble,\\" based on the given premise \\"It provides visitors with the perfect frame for a first view of the ensemble,\\" we should first define and analyze the key terms and compare the claim and the premise carefully. In the premise, \\"the perfect frame for a first view of the ensemble\\" suggests that the location under consideration is well-suited for giving visitors an initial glimpse of the ensemble, putting it in the ideal visual context. The term \\"first view\\" implies that this particular location may be specifically tailored for visitors' initial impressions, but it may or may not address other aspects such as detailed observation, comfort, accessibility, or the completeness of the view. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that this location is not only a good starting point but also \\"the best staging point\\" to observe the ensemble. This statement implies that the location is not only suitable for the first impression but also the optimal spot from which to engage in a more in-depth examination of the ensemble. The word \\"best\\" suggests that it is superior to other potential observation points in terms of factors such as comfort, accessibility, and the ability to see the entire ensemble. To determine if the hypothesis is true, let's break down the analysis into three main factors: visual context, user experience, and observation quality. 1. Visual context: Based on the premise, it's clear that the location provides an ideal visual context for the ensemble, as it offers the \\"perfect frame for a first view.\\" This supports the hypothesis, as a good staging point would certainly include an optimal visual context. 2. User experience: Although the premise does not specifically address factors like comfort and accessibility, the use of the word \\"perfect\\" implies a positive user experience. A \\"perfect frame\\" for viewing the ensemble would likely involve adequate space, positioning, and overall ease of use for visitors, which lends support to the hypothesis that it is the best staging point. 3. Observation quality: The premise does not explicitly state whether the location offers a complete or detailed view of the ensemble beyond the \\"first view.\\" The hypothesis, however, claims that it is the best staging point for observation. To confirm the hypothesis, one would have to gather more information or evidence that supports the claim that the location allows for a thorough examination of the ensemble as opposed to just an initial impression. In conclusion, based on the premise, there is some support for the hypothesis that \\"it provides the best staging point to observe the ensemble.\\" The premise establishes that the location offers an ideal visual context and implies a positive user experience, which are key aspects of a successful staging point. However, it is not sufficient to confirm the hypothesis entirely, as it does not clearly address the observation quality beyond the first view. More information on the location's suitability for detailed observations of the ensemble would be necessary to determine the validity of the hypothesis fully."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Figure 42.1 In this compound light micrograph purple-stained neutrophil (upper left) and eosinophil (lower right) are white blood cells that float among red blood cells in this blood smear. Neutrophils provide an early, rapid, and nonspecific defense against invading pathogens. Eosinophils play a variety of roles in the immune response. Red blood cells are about 7–8 µm in diameter, and a neutrophil is about 10–12µm. (credit: modification of work by Dr. David Csaba).   Choices:  - microorganisms  - toxins  - bacteria  - neutrophils   A: A:","output":"Neutrophils provide an early, rapid, and nonspecific defense against invading pathogens. As mentioned in Figure 42.1, neutrophils are white blood cells that can be observed alongside eosinophils and red blood cells in a blood smear. These neutrophils represent an essential part of the immune system, responsible for protecting the body from harmful pathogens. Neutrophils serve as the first line of defense for the body’s immune system. They are one of the most abundant white blood cells, crucial in recognizing and eliminating infectious agents. Upon detecting an invading pathogen, neutrophils move toward the site of infection and engage in phagocytosis – the process of engulfing and destroying the foreign substance. By digesting these pathogens, neutrophils prevent the spread of infection and contribute to the overall health of the body. In addition to their phagocytic abilities, neutrophils also release specific proteins and enzymes that aid in the immune response. These substances not only help kill and break down pathogens, but also facilitate communication between other immune cells. Consequently, cytokines and other signaling molecules serve to recruit more immune cells to the site of infection, further strengthening the body's defense mechanisms. It is essential to note that neutrophils are nonspecific immune responders. This means that they do not differentiate between various types of pathogens and will work to eliminate any foreign entity they encounter. Although this rapid response is beneficial in many cases, neutrophils can sometimes cause harm to the body if they are overactive, leading to inflammation and damage to healthy tissue. In summary, neutrophils provide an early, rapid, and nonspecific defense against invading pathogens. They are a vital component of the immune system, and their functions include recognizing infectious agents, engaging in phagocytosis, and releasing proteins that assist in the immune response. Although nonspecific in nature, neutrophils are essential for protecting the body from infection and promoting overall health."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Once the storm began in earnest on that fateful Monday night, the couple took refuge in Swann's basement, only to have the walls collapse on top of them, she told She recalled her hesitation about going down into the basement, despite knowing rationally the protection it would offer: \\"I don't know why, but I was like 'No. No. No,' \\" Swann said. \\"I was procrastinating like no other,\\" she added. \\"I just didn't want to go. And I didn't know why.\\" Turned out, her instincts were right. After the walls gave way in a mini-mudslide, Swann found her head pinned by the concrete. \\"It got to the point where I stopped breathing,\\" she remembered. \\"That's when he looked at me and he said, 'I'm going to make sure you're OK whether I am OK or not.' \\" Her only answer was to gasp for air, she said. \\"I was like 'Oh, my gosh. I'm about to die,' \\" Swann said. \\"I honestly thought I was going to die.\\" But by some miracle, Servati managed to push the concrete off Swann and move her out of the way. Then the wall collapsed on him. She couldn't explain it: \\"I guess adrenaline rush and the fact that God wanted me alive – I don't know.\\" Swann called 911, but no one came for almost an hour. An hour that Swann spent watching her boyfriend get slowly crushed to death. When firefighters finally did arrive, it took more than six of them to lift the concrete that Servati had moved singlehandedly. He was rushed to the hospital, but he didn't make it. Swann didn't see him again until the funeral. Five months later, life without Servati can still be hard. \\"I've literally had to sit there and tell myself, 'Lauren, there's a reason this happened. There's a plan for you. It's OK. It's going to be OK.' \\" \\"Why be mad?\\" she adds. \\"As hard as it is to think about, this really is all part of God's grand plan. He has a purpose for my life just like he had a purpose for John's.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article is about a girl named Lauren Swann and her boyfriend John Servati, who saved her life during a dangerous storm.

Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration (for the female character! In a 40s thriller!), the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous (and possibly paedophiliac), brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the Spanish Civil War into jolting dangerous reality, has one horrific murder, an astonishing insights into class and capitalism, clever theatrical metaphors, a rare approximation of Greene's God, and an ending that is only happy if you know nothing about history.","output":"The sentiment of this review can be characterized as primarily positive with some recognition of the film's perceived flaws. The reviewer appreciates the film as an \\"underrated addition to the Graham Greene cinematic canon,\\" suggesting that they find it to be a valuable and underappreciated work.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Animal rights activists have dismissed as \\"absurd\\" and \\"cruel\\" the American government's plans to bombard Guam from the air with toxic dead mice in a bid to curtail the spread of invasive snakes.      The US air drop over the the Pacific island is due to commence in the spring, and is aimed at addressing the problems caused by non-native brown tree snakes. Having hitched a ride to the island some 60 years ago on military ships, the colony of reptiles have been deemed responsible for killing off native bird species, biting human inhabitants and knocking out electricity by slithering onto power lines.      Meanwhile, in Hawaii – some 3,000 miles away – environmentalists fear a similar invasion from the snakes, possibly through unwitting transportation in aircraft that have spent time on Guam.      But the US Department of Agriculture's plans to reduce the number of brown tree snakes in Guam – population estimates reach up to 2m – have been attacked by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta).      Martin Mersereau, director of cruelty investigations at the animal rights organisation, described the plan as a \\"clumsy dangerous massacre\\".      \\"Brown tree snakes did not ask to be stowaways on planes or ships and then forced to survive on a foreign island,\\" he said.      But irrespective of how they got to be on Guam, some residents say the snakes – which are native to Australia and Papua New Guinea – are a menace.      They can grow to be more than 10ft (3m) in length and can climb poles and trees. Attacks on people have been reported, but their venom is not lethal to humans.      Birds on the other hand are not so lucky. Experts believe that the reptiles have been responsible for the destruction of Guam's native birds, who are defenceless against the nocturnal, tree-based predators.      As well as taking a toll on native wildlife, the snakes also threaten the tourist industry of Guam, some fear. The US territory – home to some 160,000 people – relies heavily on holiday-making to support its economy.      The solution, government scientists believe, is to take advantage of the creature's two big weaknesses – its unfussiness when it comes to food and its susceptibility to a common painkiller, acetaminophen.      The drug – sold under the brand name Tylenol in the US – is harmless to humans, but is lethal to the snakes. And unlike other snakes, the brown tree variety do not turn their noses up at prey that has already been killed.      Scientists believe that stuffing dead mice with the drug and then conducting an air drop on areas known to be inhabited by the snakes would be an effective way to reduce their numbers.      \\"We are taking this to a new phase,\\" said Daniel Vice, assistant state director of US Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services in Hawaii, Guam and the Pacific Islands. \\"There really is no other place in the world with a snake problem like Guam,\\" he added.      The mice drop – due to take place in April or May – will focus on Guam's sprawling Andersen air force base, from which it is feared snakes could hitch a ride off the island.      Using helicopters, the dead mice will be dropped by hand, one by one. In a bid to mitigate any danger to other animals, they will be fitted with mini-parachutes meant to catch on the branches of trees.      Supporters of the scheme say the impact on other animals will be minimal, especially as the snakes have successfully killed off many bird species.      But the brown tree snakes do have their defenders.      \\"Although the snakes are considered invasive, no animal should be forced to endure cruel death,\\" Mersereau said.      If consumed, the drugged mice would cause renal and liver failure in the snakes, Peta claimed.      \\"For reptiles, death could take days or even weeks,\\" Mersereau said. Moreover the method being used is \\"exceeding indiscriminate\\" and could cause \\"great risk to carnivours and scavengers and also to birds\\".      But it is a risk that US officials seem prepared to take. They point at the potential cost of allowing further colonies to breed in other Pacific islands like Hawaii.      A 2010 study conducted by the National Wildlife Research Center suggested that brown tree snakes would cause between 593m and 2.14bn in economic damage each year if they became established in Hawaii. Power outages would cause the most damage, followed by a projected decline in tourism.      To date, only a few brown tree snakes have ever been found in Hawaii, and none over the past 17 years.      The mice drop is intended to keep the number of stowaways to an absolute minimum. Even if they are to have their numbers reduced, Peta disagrees with the method.      Mersereau believes that it would be better to have the snakes trapped by trackers and then euthanised humanely than given a deadly last meal of toxic mice. ||||| In this photo taken on Feb. 5, 2013, U.S. Department of Agriculture wildlife specialist Tony Salas holds a Brown Tree Snake outside his office on Andersen Air Force Base on the island of Guam. The U.S.... (Associated Press)      Dead mice laced with painkillers are about to rain down on Guam's jungle canopy. They are scientists' prescription for a headache that has caused the tiny U.S. territory misery for more than 60 years: the brown tree snake.      Most of Guam's native bird species are extinct because of the snake, which reached the island's thick jungles by hitching rides from the South Pacific on U.S. military ships shortly after World War II. There may be 2 million of the reptiles on Guam now, decimating wildlife, biting residents and even knocking out electricity by slithering onto power lines.      More than 3,000 miles away, environmental officials in Hawaii have long feared a similar invasion _ which in their case likely would be a \\"snakes on a plane\\" scenario. That would cost the state many vulnerable species and billions of dollars, but the risk will fall if Guam's air-drop strategy succeeds.      \\"We are taking this to a new phase,\\" said Daniel Vice, assistant state director of U.S. Department of Agriculture's Wildlife Services in Hawaii, Guam, and the Pacific Islands. \\"There really is no other place in the world with a snake problem like Guam.\\"      Brown tree snakes are generally a few feet (1 meter) long but can grow to be more than 10 feet (3 meters) in length. Most of Guam's native birds were defenseless against the nocturnal, tree-based predators, and within a few decades of the reptile's arrival, nearly all of them were wiped out.      The snakes can also climb power poles and wires, causing blackouts, or slither into homes and bite people, including babies; they use venom on their prey but it is not lethal to humans.      The infestation and the toll it has taken on native wildlife have tarnished Guam's image as a tourism haven, though the snakes are rarely seen outside their jungle habitat.      The solution to this headache, fittingly enough, is acetaminophen, the active ingredient in painkillers including Tylenol.      The strategy takes advantage of the snake's two big weaknesses. Unlike most snakes, brown tree snakes are happy to eat prey they didn't kill themselves, and they are highly vulnerable to acetaminophen, which is harmless to humans.      The upcoming mice drop is targeted to hit snakes near Guam's sprawling Andersen Air Force Base, which is surrounded by heavy foliage and if compromised would offer the snakes a potential ticket off the island. Using helicopters, the dead neonatal mice will be dropped by hand, one by one.      U.S. government scientists have been perfecting the mice-drop strategy for more than a decade with support from the Department of Defense and the Department of the Interior.      To keep the mice bait from dropping all the way to the ground, where it could be eaten by other animals or attract insects as they rot, researchers have developed a flotation device with streamers designed to catch in the branches of the forest foliage, where the snakes live and feed.      Experts say the impact on other species will be minimal, particularly since the snakes have themselves wiped out the birds that might have been most at risk.      \\"One concern was that crows may eat mice with the toxicant,\\" said William Pitt, of the U.S. National Wildlife Research Center's Hawaii Field Station. \\"However, there are no longer wild crows on Guam. We will continue to refine methods to increase efficiency and limit any potential non-target hazards.\\"      The mouse drop is set to start in April or May.      Vice said the goal is not to eradicate the snakes, but to control and contain them. Just as the snakes found their way to Guam, they could stow away on a ship, or more likely the cargo hold of an airplane, and begin breeding on other islands around the Pacific or even the U.S. West Coast.      That \\"snakes on a plane\\" scenario has officials in Hawaii on edge. The islands of Hawaii, like Guam, lack the predators that could keep a brown tree snake population in check.      Native Hawaiian birds \\"literally don't know what to do when they see a snake coming,\\" said Christy Martin, a spokeswoman for the Coordinating Group on Alien Pest Species, a partnership of Hawaii government agencies and private organizations.      A 2010 study conducted by the National Wildlife Research Center found brown tree snakes would cause between 593 million and 2.14 billion in economic damage each year if they became established in Hawaii like they are on Guam. Power outages would cause the most damage, followed by a projected decline in tourism. The cost of treating snake bites would account for a small share.      \\"Once we get snakes here, we're never going to be able to fix the situation,\\" Martin said.      Though the snakes are native to Australia and Papua New Guinea, Guam is much closer to Hawaii and its snake population is much more dense, meaning it is the primary threat for snake stowaways.      So far, Guam's containment seems to be working. Only a few brown tree snakes have ever been found in Hawaii, and none over the past 17 years.      \\"If we continue doing what we are doing, the chance of success is very high,\\" Vice said. \\"If what we are doing stops, I think the possibility of the snakes getting to Hawaii is inevitable.\\"      ___      AP writer Audrey McAvoy contributed to this report from Honolulu, Hawaii. |||||","output":"The American government plans to drop toxic dead mice from the air on the island of Guam to stop the spread of invasive snakes.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  Nine Inch Nails, an industrial rock band fronted by Trent Reznor, has toured all over the world since its creation in 1988. While Reznor—the only official member until adding Atticus Ross in 2016—controls its creative and musical direction in the studio, the touring band performs different arrangements of the songs. In addition to regular concerts, the band has performed in both supporting and headlining roles at festivals such as Woodstock '94, Lollapalooza 1991 and 2008, and many other one-off performances including the MTV Video Music Awards. Prior to their 2013 tour, the band had played 938 gigs.Nine Inch Nails' live performances contrast with its in-studio counterpart. Reznor writes and performs nearly all Nine Inch Nails studio material, with occasional instrumental and vocal contributions from others artists. However, Reznor has typically assembled groups of backing musicians to interpret songs for tours and other live performances. Keyboardist Alessandro Cortini said that \\"if you see the show and you're used to the CDs it's pretty clear that the studio entity is different from the live entity\\".The only constant member of the live band is Reznor.  Live Nine Inch Nails performances are typically accompanied by lighting, stage, and video projection effects. Since 1999, the visual design components of live shows have been curated by Reznor with Rob Sheridan. Three tours have been chronicled on live albums and tour documentaries. Critical and commercial response to Nine Inch Nails live performances has generally been positive. Critics have pointed to the concerts' aggressive on-stage dynamic and visual designs as high points. Reznor decided in 2008 to cease touring with the band after a 2009 farewell tour. The band resumed touring in 2013, with the group planning a set of concerts in the U.S. beginning September 28.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Solve this math problem Solve 46*y + 14*y = -0*y - 180 for y.","output":"Let's solve the given math problem step by step: 1. Simplify the equation: 46*y + 14*y = -0*y - 180 The first thing we need to do here is to simplify the equation by adding all \\"like terms\\" on each side. \\"Like terms\\" are terms that have the same variables raised to the same power. In our case, it's the terms with the y variable. We can do this by combining the terms with y on the left side of the equation: 60*y = -0*y - 180 2. Eliminate the -0*y term: Since -0*y is equal to 0, we can eliminate it from the equation: 60*y = -180 3. Solve for y: Now, to solve for y, we'll need to isolate y on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 60: y = -180 / 60 4. Simplify the expression: y = -3 So, the solution to the given math problem is y = -3."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Phish is an American rock band that was founded at the University of Vermont in Burlington, Vermont in 1983. It is known for musical improvisation, extended jams, blending of genres, and a dedicated fan base. The current line-up--guitarist and lead vocalist Trey Anastasio, bassist and vocalist Mike Gordon, drummer and vocalist Jon Fishman, and keyboardist and vocalist Page McConnell--performed together for 15 years before going on hiatus from October 7, 2000, to December 30, 2002. They resumed touring from December 31, 2002, until August 15, 2004, when they announced that the Coventry Festival would be their last show. By late 1990, Phish's concerts were becoming more and more intricate, often making a consistent effort to involve the audience in the performance. In a special \\"secret language\\", the audience would react in a certain manner based on a particular musical cue from the band. For instance, if Anastasio \\"teased\\" a motif from The Simpsons theme song, the audience would yell, \\"D'oh!\\" in imitation of  Homer Simpson . In 1992, Phish introduced a collaboration between audience and band called the \\"Big Ball Jam\\" in which each band member would throw a large beach ball into the audience and play a note each time his ball was hit. In so doing, the audience was helping to create an original composition.  In an experiment known as \\"The Rotation Jam\\", each member would switch instruments with the musician on his left. On occasion, a performance of \\"You Enjoy Myself\\" involved Gordon and Anastasio performing synchronized maneuvers, jumping on mini-trampolines while simultaneously playing their instruments.  Phish, along with Bob Dylan, the Grateful Dead, and the Beatles, was one of the first bands to have a Usenet newsgroup, rec.music.phish, which launched in 1991. Aware of the band's growing popularity, Elektra Records signed them that year. The following year A Picture of Nectar was complete: their first major studio release, enjoying far more extensive production than either 1988's Junta or 1990's Lawn Boy. These albums were eventually re-released on Elektra, as well.  The first annual H.O.R.D.E. festival in 1992 provided Phish with their first national tour of major amphitheaters. The lineup, among others, included Phish, Blues Traveler, the Spin Doctors, and Widespread Panic. That summer, the band toured Europe with the Violent Femmes and later toured Europe and the U.S. with Carlos Santana. What is Nectar?","output":"Nectar, in the context you mentioned, is part of the title of an album by the rock band Phish. The album is called \\"A Picture of Nectar.\\" So, Nectar is not a thing or a substance here, it's just a word used as part of the album's name.

When there are a lot of bubbles and the batter is still a little bit wet-looking, flip the pancake.  * Watch the top of the pancake for bubbles. When there are just a few bubbles and the batter is still very wet-looking, flip the pancake.","output":"Watch the top of the pancake for bubbles. When there are a lot of bubbles and the batter is still a little bit wet-looking, flip the pancake. The process of knowing when to flip a pancake can be crucial in achieving the perfect texture and taste. Flipping the pancake at the right time will allow it to cook evenly, resulting in a more delicious and well-cooked flapjack. The key indicators to look for while cooking a pancake are the presence of bubbles on the surface and the consistency of the batter. When cooking pancakes, you want to wait for the bubbles to form on the top of the pancake. These bubbles are a sign that the heat is breaking the structure of the batter and steam is being released, causing the pancake to rise. Waiting for a lot of bubbles to form ensures that most of the structure has already been broken down, allowing the pancake to cook more evenly when flipped. However, pay attention to the batter's consistency as well. It should still be a little bit wet-looking, which means it's not fully cooked yet. This wet batter will help in avoiding a dry and overcooked pancake. If the batter is too dry or lacks any moisture, it's an indication that the pancake has been on the griddle for too long. Waiting for a lot of bubbles and ensuring the batter is still a bit wet-looking will help achieve a pancake that is cooked through properly while maintaining its moistness and fluffiness. Flipping the pancake too early, such as when there are just a few bubbles and the batter is still very wet-looking, may not result in optimal results. An undercooked pancake will offer a less satisfying taste and texture. In conclusion, to know when to flip a pancake, observe the top and wait for a lot of bubbles to form while ensuring the batter is still a little bit wet-looking. This approach will allow you to achieve the perfect pancake texture and taste, ensuring complete enjoyment of a delightful breakfast staple."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, as a result of the suspension of a research project dealing with a dynamically mutating vaccine following the pattern of the eyesocket flu bacillus, they had absolutely nothing to do until the end of the day, because the boss didn't order them to wash test-tubes. They decided to play a game of hockey under the microscope. For a puck they used one of the millions of experimental bacillus, and one-arm pincettes, which as it happened also resembled hockey sticks, served as sticks. The bacillus was not happy with it at all. It wanted to rest after an exhausting task involving vaccine discouragement, and these whitecoats here planned to put it to work yet again. And this time the work was much more labor-intensive and even more exhausting than before, but the condition and health of the tired bacillus not as good as in the times of youth, about two hours ago. The scientists got excited. On a microscope slide they etched a hockey rink with laser, agreed on the rules, connected the microscope's camera to the big screen display and played until the morning. They had to change pucks several times, but that was fine, they had millions of them in stock. The next day they didn't have anything to do either and they continued to play. They even invited other colleagues and the popularity of the game was so huge they could afford to play it in a championship system. Soon, the games were joined by the guys from the car-repair garage next door.

She is in her late 70s, and will probably need me to care for her in the future. I am willing to take on this responsibility but I find seeing her and talking to her stressful because I am so angry ab out what she and my father did to my elder sister. My sister was born \\"out of wedlock\\" in the 1950s. My sister's father disappeared and never turned up again. My mother loved my sister a lot even if she was an unwanted baby. But then my mother met and married my father. A few years later I was born. But my father didn't love my sister and my mother failed to protect her. We moved frequently, and my sister was not allowed to come along. She never came on holiday with us; instead she was sent to holiday camps. As she grew up, she started to use drugs and became an alcoholic. My sister is now in her mid-50s, jobless, living on benefits and mixing with a crowd of drunks. She has no partner, no children, no possessions and no company except for her dog. Her health is ruined, though she no longer drinks.

From what can be inferred, the speaker wishes to understand if there have been noticeable changes in the aesthetics of other homes, possibly in term of their decor or architectural style, in comparison to the respondent's house.  Given this context, the hypothesis \\"Do you think the decor of the area has changed much since you built your house?\\" could be a likely direction of the conversation. Though the premise doesn't explicitly state about the change in decor, it does imply a curiosity towards possible changes and developments in the neighborhood over time since the respondent's home was constructed.  However, it's important to note that the hypothesis assumes that the individual built their home themselves, and is aware of how the decor of the area looked at that time, which might not always be the case. For a more accurate conclusion, it might be beneficial to have a statement that combines the style and decor aspect of the question, such as \\"Do you think the style and decor of the neighborhood have significantly revamped since you built your home?\\"   Another point to consider is the premise appears to be more concerned with the consistency of the area's aesthetics with the respondent's home decor or style. While the hypothesis derived discusses whether the decor has changed since the house was built, it does not necessarily address this consistency aspect. Hence, you might want to adjust the hypothesis to factor in this facet, such as \\"Do you think the style and decor of the other houses in the area are still in keeping with yours or have they changed significantly since you built your home?\\" So, while the hypothesis is broadly true based on the current premise, it could be made more precise by considering the above points."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on \\"gold silver fall as traders take profits\\" Text:","output":"Title: Gold and Silver Prices Drop as Traders Cash in on Profits Introduction: The recent downward trend in gold and silver prices has been attributed to traders selling their positions in these precious metals to capture profits. Market observers have noticed a significant number of traders taking advantage of the elevated prices, leading to a decrease in demand and consequently a decline in the value of gold and silver. This phenomenon, commonly known as profit-taking, is a normal part of trading in the commodities market. Gold and Silver Markets: Gold and silver have always been viewed as safe-haven investments during times of economic and geopolitical turbulence. Their value typically rises when conventional investment options, such as equities and bonds, face uncertainties or undergo considerable fluctuations. This makes precious metals an attractive option for conservative investors seeking to preserve their wealth or hedge against inflation. Since the beginning of 2021, gold and silver prices have experienced steady growth due to factors such as pandemic-induced market volatility, global inflation concerns, and currency devaluations. Consequently, this growth has presented traders with an opportunity to capitalize on the price surge and maximize their profits. Traders' Profit-taking Strategy: The strategy of profit-taking involves liquidating existing profitable positions to secure gains before the market moves in the opposite direction. This selling pressure often causes the price of an asset to decline, especially in situations where a significant number of traders employ this tactic simultaneously. In the case of gold and silver, savvy traders realized that the prices of these metals had been on an upward trajectory for an extended period. They subsequently proceeded to sell their positions, leading to an increase in supply and a decline in demand. This supply-demand imbalance has led to the current downward trend in gold and silver prices. Market Implications: While many traders have utilized profit-taking to their advantage, it is essential to consider the broader implications of this trading trend. Some market analysts believe that the decrease in gold and silver prices may signal a short-term correction and consolidation phase for these metals. This could offer an opportunity for new investors to enter the market or for existing investors to increase their holdings at more attractive prices. On the contrary, other analysts argue that continued profit-taking could drive the prices of gold and silver significantly lower, resulting in a bear market for these commodities. The possibility of a prolonged period of declining prices raises concerns for long-term investors and raises questions about the effectiveness of precious metals as a safe-haven investment. Future Outlook: As the dynamics of the gold and silver markets continue to evolve, it is unclear whether or not the current downturn in prices is a temporary blip or an indication of a larger trend. Investors and traders must monitor economic and geopolitical indicators, which could impact the demand for precious metals, to make informed decisions. Ultimately, gold and silver remain key components of a balanced and diversified investment portfolio. With proper risk management tactics and a comprehensive understanding of the market, traders can still find opportunities to benefit from these valuable commodities. In the end, whether one chooses to take profits now or hold onto their positions longer, the ability to adapt to market conditions and manage risks is paramount to achieving trading success."},{"instruction":"I have a new situation: There is currently a wildfire in the city of Milton and another one in the city of Parth. These two cities are on opposite sides of the planet, but both wildfires are nearly identical in terms of scope and intensity. So, when it's daytime in Milton, it's nighttime in Parth. New firefighters in Milton are currently arriving at the scene of the fire as the sun beats down directly above them. They are getting instructions from their boss about what they need to do today and preparing themselves for a long day.  But I can use this background: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.  What is an answer for this question: The wildfire in which city is currently less likely to spread?

Q: Almost 69% of code red calls were responded to within eight minutes in October, exceeding the 65% target. Around 5% of all 999 calls were subject to the target that month, compared to 40% before the year-long trial began. Deputy Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the new system was working, but opposition parties dispute the claim. \\"We know that change can be difficult in the health service - for staff and the public,\\" said Mr Gething. \\"However, the initial figures from this pilot suggest that the new clinical response model is ensuring that patients are getting the right care, in the right place, at the right time.\\" Tracey Myhill, chief executive of the Welsh Ambulance Service, said: \\"We've made a really solid start on this ground-breaking new pilot, and today's figures are testament of that.\\" Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said she was concerned that the \\"vast majority\\" of emergency calls were no longer subject to any time-related targets or had any performance data published. She said: \\"This new targeting regime may make life easier for Labour ministers, giving them one less negative headline every month, but in reality people are being left in the dark as to how well their ambulance service is actually performing.\\" Plaid Cymru health spokesperson Elin Jones and Ms Williams both pointed out that ambulances in three health board areas - Hywel Dda, Cwm Taf and Powys - still failed to meet the 65% threshold for code red calls responded to in eight minutes. \\"The Labour government is still struggling to meet its watered-down targets,\\" Ms Jones added. \\"It is wrong of the government to call its performance a success.\\" The Welsh government denied Ms Williams's claim about the lack of data on non-red calls, pointing out that response data on amber calls had also been published. Conservative shadow health minister Darren Millar congratulated the ambulance service on the figures. \\"Whilst the targets are lower than those elsewhere in the UK this is a significant achievement and hardworking staff should be commended,\\" he said. But Mr Millar added: \\"The answer to sustained improvement in performance does not lie in the Labour approach of scrapping targets and record breaking NHS budget cuts; instead we need to see extra investment in the ambulance service and our wider unscheduled care system.\\" A:","output":"In October, 69% of code red calls in Wales were responded to within eight minutes, exceeding the 65% target, although opposition parties dispute the claims of the new system's success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scholars who write about history are called historians.  - A decree is a rule of law usually issued by a head of state (such as the president of a republic or a monarch), according to certain procedures (usually established in a constitution). It has the force of law. The particular term used for this concept may vary from country to country. The \\"executive orders\\" made by the President of the United States, for example, are decrees (although a decree is not exactly an order). In non-legal English usage, however, the term refers to any authoritarian decision.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Lille  is a city in northern France, in French Flanders. On the Deûle River, near France's border with Belgium, it is the capital of the Hauts-de-France region and the prefecture of the Nord department.  - Northern Italy is a cultural and geographical region, without any administrative purpose, used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state, also informally referred as \\"Il Nord\\", \\"Settentrione\\" or \\"Alta Italia\\". It consists of 8 regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. According to the 2011 census, its population was 27,213,372. For statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the term Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for identifying two of the five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union, and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament.  - The English Channel (\\"the Sleeve\\" [hence ] \\"Sea of Brittany\\" \\"British Sea\\"), also called simply the Channel, is the body of water that separates southern England from northern France, and joins the southern part of the North Sea to the rest of the Atlantic Ocean.  - Jacobus Balduinus (died 1225) was an Italian jurist.  - Roman law is the legal system of ancient Rome, including Roman Military Jurisdiction and the legal developments spanning over a thousand years of jurisprudence, from the Twelve Tables (c. 449 BC), to the \\"Corpus Juris Civilis\\" (AD 529) ordered by Eastern Roman Emperor Justinian I. The historical importance of Roman law is reflected by the continued use of Latin legal terminology in many legal systems influenced by it.  - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits.

The Toulouse Metro area is, with 1 312 304 inhabitants as of 2014, France's 4th metropolitan area after Paris, Lyon and Marseille and ahead of Lille and Bordeaux.  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Bologna (;  ) is the largest city (and the capital) of the Emilia-Romagna Region in Northern Italy. It is the seventh most populous city in Italy, located in the heart of a metropolitan area (officially recognized by the Italian government as a \\"città metropolitana\\") of about one million.  - Franciscus Accursius (12251293) was an Italian lawyer, the son of the celebrated jurist and glossator Accursius. The two are often confused.   - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.  - Bordeaux (Gascon Occitan: \\"\\") is a port city on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in southwestern France.  - Ancient Rome was an Italic civilization that began on the Italian Peninsula as early as the 8th century BC. Located along the Mediterranean Sea and centered on the city of Rome, it expanded to become one of the largest empires in the ancient world with an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population) and covering 5.0 million square kilometers at its height in AD 117.  - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France.

Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Chlorophyll absorbs the sun&#x27;s energy - It is this energy that is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to form glucose or food for plants.  Question: suppose enough carbon dioxide reaches the leaves happens, how will it affect less carbon dioxide is availabe to form glucose.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"If enough carbon dioxide reaches the leaves but there is still a reduction in the amount available to form glucose, it could have varying effects on the photosynthesis process and the formation of glucose. Firstly, it is essential to understand the role of carbon dioxide in photosynthesis. It is a necessary reactant in the process, combining with water during the light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle) to produce glucose and other essential organic compounds. The enzyme responsible for this process, called Rubisco, binds to carbon dioxide and incorporates it into the molecules being formed. If there is less carbon dioxide available to form glucose due to any perturbations, it will likely result in a decrease in the rate of photosynthesis. The reasons for this decrease can be analyzed by considering two main factors: the availability of carbon dioxide for the enzyme Rubisco and the competition between carbon dioxide and oxygen in the process. 1. Rubisco Availability: In a situation where the amount of carbon dioxide is limited, the ability of Rubisco to bind carbon dioxide and initiate the Calvin cycle will be affected. As fewer Rubisco enzyme sites are occupied by carbon dioxide, the overall rate at which glucose is produced decreases. Consequently, the plant may experience slower growth, energy production, and an overall reduction in its ability to produce essential biomolecules. 2. Carbon Dioxide and Oxygen Competition: With a lowered concentration of carbon dioxide, the competition between carbon dioxide and oxygen for the active site of Rubisco becomes more critical. Rubisco can also bind to oxygen, leading to a less efficient process called photorespiration. When carbon dioxide levels are low, the likelihood of oxygen binding to Rubisco increases, causing further reductions in photosynthetic efficiency. As a result, glucose production may be further slowed down due to the limitations imposed by photorespiration. In summary, the supposed perturbation of less carbon dioxide available for the formation of glucose can have a significant influence on the rate of photosynthesis and the production of glucose in plants. The effects include reduced efficiency of the entire process, slower plant growth, and an increase in photorespiration. This scenario ultimately leads to a decrease in the photosynthetic capabilities of the plant and therefore has a negative effect on glucose production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot: The movie opens in a small town in Texas, where the Harrison family runs a quaint bed-and-breakfast called \\"The Garden Retreat\\". The main characters, Alice and Frank Harrison, are a married couple who are passionate about nature, gardening, and creating a beautiful escape for their guests. Their teenage daughter, Emma, is an aspiring entomologist (insect scientist) who shares her parents' love for the natural world. As summer approaches, an unusually aggressive and invasive species of ants begins to plague their town. The ants cause massive destruction to the town’s infrastructure, gardens, and homes, including The Garden Retreat. Reports suggest that the ants are a result of a nearby scientific experiment gone wrong. Panic slowly spreads throughout the town as the ants multiply at an alarming rate. Alice, Frank, and Emma make a tough decision to close their beloved bed-and-breakfast and relocate to a new environment that could be safe from the pests. After doing extensive research, Emma suggests that they move to a colder climate where the ants would not survive due to their tropical origins. The family agrees to move to a small town in Alaska, hoping that the cold weather and isolation would protect them from the ants. Upon arriving in Alaska, the Harrisons discover that their new home is nestled in a beautiful, serene valley surrounded by snow-capped mountains and lush forests. They work tirelessly to rebuild their establishment in this new location, naming it \\"Frostfall Sanctuary\\". As they become accustomed to their new life, they meet an eclectic group of locals who teach them about the traditions and way of life in this new environment. Emma, inspired by the resilience and strength of the family, continues her entomological studies in hopes of finding a solution to their ant problem. During the climax of the movie, the destructive ants manage to find their way to the town, likely hitching a ride on a supply shipment. With the help of the townspeople, the Harrison family coordinates a large-scale effort to save the town. Using Emma's research and the cold temperature, they create a natural barrier against the invasive ants while simultaneously rehabilitating native Alaskan fauna and flora. The movie concludes with the family's successful effort in saving their new home, and they vow to continue their work to restore balance to the ecosystem. As the credits roll, snapshots of scenes capture their journey in Alaska and the bond they forge with the locals, emphasizing the warmth and resourcefulness of the human spirit, even in the coldest of climates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information:  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - Arithmetic or arithmetics (from the Greek  \\"arithmos\\", \\"number\\") is the oldest and most elementary branch of mathematics. It consists of the study of numbers, especially the properties of the traditional operations between themaddition, subtraction, multiplication and division. Arithmetic is an elementary part of number theory, and number theory is considered to be one of the top-level divisions of modern mathematics, along with algebra, geometry, and analysis. The terms \\"arithmetic\\" and \\"higher arithmetic\\" were used until the beginning of the 20th century as synonyms for \\"number theory\\" and are sometimes still used to refer to a wider part of number theory.  - A machine is a tool containing one or more parts that uses energy to perform an intended action. Machines are usually powered by chemical, thermal, or electrical means, and are often motorized. Historically, a power tool also required moving parts to classify as a machine. However, the advent of electronics has led to the development of power tools without moving parts that are considered machines.  - The Corporate Machine is a strategy computer game from Stardock in which the goal is to create a corporation in one of four industries ( automobiles , aircraft , computers , or soft drinks ) and eventually dominate rival companies . To win the player must dominate the chosen market ( getting 55 % to 65 % of the market share depending on the number of opponents . ) The Corporate Machine is a follow up to the game Business Tycoon , which was itself a sequel to the game Entrepreneur , all developed by Stardock .  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - Microsoft Corporation (commonly referred to as Microsoft or MS) is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Redmond, Washington, that develops, manufactures, licenses, supports and sells computer software, consumer electronics and personal computers and services. Its best known software products are the Microsoft Windows line of operating systems, Microsoft Office office suite, and Internet Explorer and Edge web browsers. Its flagship hardware products are the Xbox video game consoles and the Microsoft Surface tablet lineup. As of 2016, it was the world's largest software maker by revenue, and one of the world's most valuable companies.  - Stardock Corporation is a software development company founded in 1991 and incorporated in 1993 as Stardock Systems. Stardock initially developed for the OS/2 platform, but was forced to switch to Microsoft Windows due to the collapse of the OS/2 software market between 1997 and 1998. The company is best known for computer programs that allow a user to modify or extend a graphical user interface as well as personal computer games, particularly strategy games such as the \\"Galactic Civilizations\\" series, \\"\\", \\"\\", and Ashes of the Singularity.  - Galactic Civilizations is a turn-based strategy video game developed by Stardock and released in March 2003. The game is a remake of a vintage OS/2 series of the same name. An expansion pack entitled \\"Altarian Prophecy\\" was released in July 2004. A sequel, \\"\\", was released February 21, 2006. On May 14, 2015 Stardock released \\"Galactic Civilizations III\\".  - Computer software, or simply software, is that part of a computer system that consists of encoded information or computer instructions, in contrast to the physical hardware from which the system is built.  - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.  - Microsoft Windows (or simply Windows) is a metafamily of graphical operating systems developed, marketed, and sold by Microsoft. It consists of several families of operating systems, each of which cater to a certain sector of the computing industry with the OS typically associated with IBM PC compatible architecture. Active Windows families include Windows NT, Windows Embedded and Windows Phone; these may encompass subfamilies, e.g. Windows Embedded Compact (Windows CE) or Windows Server. Defunct Windows families include Windows 9x; Windows 10 Mobile is an active product, unrelated to the defunct family Windows Mobile.  - A Company is a legal entity made up of an association of persons, be they natural, legal, or a mixture of both, for carrying on a commercial or industrial enterprise. Company members share a common purpose and unite in order to focus their various talents and organize their collectively available skills or resources to achieve specific, declared goals. Companies take various forms such as:  - A microwave oven (commonly referred to as a microwave) is a kitchen appliance that heats and cooks food by exposing it to microwave radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum. This induces polar molecules in the food to rotate and produce thermal energy in a process known as dielectric heating. Microwave ovens heat foods quickly and efficiently because excitation is fairly uniform in the outer of a homogeneous, high water content food item; food is more evenly heated throughout (except in heterogeneous, dense objects) than generally occurs in other cooking techniques.  - In consumer electronics, a remote control is a component of an electronic device such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, used to operate the device wirelessly from a short distance. Remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the consumer, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise would not be able to reach, as when a garage door opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.  - A smartphone is a mobile phone (also known as cell phones or cell mobiles) with an advanced mobile operating system that combines features of a personal computer operating system with other features useful for mobile or handheld use. Smartphones, which are usually pocket-sized, typically combine the features of a mobile phone, such as the abilities to place and receive voice calls and create and receive text messages, with those of other popular digital mobile devices like personal digital assistants (PDAs), such as an event calendar, media player, video games, GPS navigation, digital camera and digital video camera. Smartphones can access the Internet and can run a variety of third-party software components (\\"apps\\" from Google Play, Apple App Store, etc). They typically have a color display with a graphical user interface that covers more than 76% of the front surface. The display is almost always a touchscreen and sometimes additionally a touch-enabled keyboard like the Priv/Passport BlackBerrys, which enables the user to use a virtual keyboard to type words and numbers and press onscreen icons to activate \\"app\\" features.  - A corporation is a company or group of people authorized to act as a single entity (legally a person) and recognized as such in law. Early incorporated entities were established by charter (i.e. by an \\"ad hoc\\" act granted by a monarch or passed by a parliament or legislature). Most jurisdictions now allow the creation of new corporations through registration.  - A mobile device (or handheld computer) is a small computing device, typically, small enough to hold and operate in the hand and having an operating system capable of running mobile apps. These may provide a diverse range of functions. Typically, the device will have a display screen with a small numeric or alphanumeric keyboard or a touchscreen providing a virtual keyboard and buttons (icons) on-screen. Many such devices can connect to the Internet and interconnect with other devices such as car entertainment systems or headsets via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or near field communication (NFC). Integrated cameras, digital media players, mobile phone and GPS capabilities are common. Power is typically provided by a lithium battery.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I have waited tables, but before that, our friend group were regulars at several local “open all night” establishments. Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.

Now an American study has found that memory starts to fail when we are young adults. People younger than thirty years of age usually do not know that they are starting to forget information. But scientists from the University of Michigan say the loss of memory has usually already started. Researchers say people do not observe this slow reduction in mental ability until the loss affects their everyday activities. Denise Park led the new study. She directs the Centre for Aging and Cognition at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan. Her team studied more than 350 men and women between the ages of twenty and ninety years. The study identified people in their middle twenties with memory problems. She says young adults do not know they are forgetting things because their brains have more information than they need. But she says that people in their twenties and thirties are losing memory at the same rate as people in their sixties and seventies. Ms. Park says people between the ages of sixty and seventy may note the decrease in their mental abilities. They begin to observe that they are having more trouble remembering and learning new information. The study found that older adults are more likely to remember false information as being true. For example, they remembered false medical claims as being true. Younger people remembered hearing the information. But they were more likely to remember that it was false. Ms. Park is now using modern imaging equipment to study what happens in the brains of people of different ages. She is studying what parts of the brain older adults use for different activities compared to younger adults. Ms. Park says mental performance is a direct result of brain activity and brain structure. She says keeping the brain active is important. She hopes future studies will identify ways to improve the operation of our aging minds. Question: Which of the following is a suitable title for the passage? Options: A: The Mysterious Brain B: The Ability to Forget C: Memory Reduction D: Mental Performance The answer to this question is:","output":"C: Memory Reduction"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He died in the early hours of the morning on 21 September 1558, at the age of 58, holding in his hand the cross that his wife Isabella had been holding when she died.  Charles was originally buried in the chapel of the Monastery of Yuste, but he left a codicil in his last will and testament asking for the establishment of a new religious foundation in which he would be reburied with Isabella. Following his return to Spain in 1559, their son Philip undertook the task of fulfilling his father's wish when he founded the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. After the Monastery's Royal Crypt was completed in 1574, the bodies of Charles and Isabella were relocated and re-interred into a small vault directly underneath the altar of the famous Basilica of the Monastery, in accordance with Charles's wishes to be buried \\"half-body under the altar and half-body under the priest's feet\\" side by side with Isabella. They remained in this vault until 1654 when they were later moved into the Royal Pantheon of Kings by their great-grandson Philip IV, who, in doing so, disrespected his great-grandfather's wishes.  On one side of the Basilica are bronze effigies of Charles and Isabella, with effigies of their daughter Maria of Austria and Charles's sisters Eleanor of Austria and Maria of Hungary behind them.

Process:  - Body temperature rises - The brain tells blood vessels to dilate - The sweat glands become active - Moisture is released from the pores - The moisture evaporates - The evaporation causes cooling.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose brain does not tell vessels to dilate happens, how will it affect LESS body cooling occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If the brain does not tell the blood vessels to dilate, there will be less blood flow to the skin's surface which can disrupt the normal cooling process. This is because dilation of blood vessels helps to dissipate heat by increasing blood flow to the skin, where the heat can be more easily released to the environment. The perturbation would have a direct effect on the cooling process as a result of the reduced blood flow and thus reduced heat transfer to the skin surface. It could also have an indirect effect on the sweat glands' activity. Since the blood vessels might not dilate as much to facilitate heat dissipation, the body could respond by increasing sweat production to compensate, which could lead to more moisture being released from the pores. This increase in moisture may or may not be enough to achieve the same level of cooling as with appropriate blood vessel dilation. In summary, the supposed perturbation of the brain not telling blood vessels to dilate would directly affect the body cooling process as it disrupts the heat dissipation mechanism. It could also indirectly affect the process by causing an increase in sweat production in an attempt to compensate for the reduced cooling effect from the blood vessels."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Time is considered to be the most important piece of monumental art in the Park District, which hosts over 100 art works. Its importance stems from its sculptor, its message, the era in which it was created, and the design of its reflecting pool by Howard Van Doren Shaw.

Suzy hears the girl shouting to someone just inside the door of the school, but the intense thunder obscures most of her words. When the other girl is gone, Suzy talks to an unidentified person on the school's intercom, but they refuse to let her inside. Unable to gain access to the school, Suzy gets back into her cab and has the driver take her away. As the cab drives through a nearby forest, Suzy sees Pat running alone through the trees that separate the school from town.The frightened girl is Pat Hingle, and she flees to a friend's apartment in the nearby town. While alone in the bathroom, she becomes transfixed by a pair of shining eyes outside the window, and a decidedly inhuman arm smashes through the glass, grabbing her. She is pulled out of the window onto the roof, stabbed numerous times, and then hanged by a cord when she falls through the sky light. The huge pieces of glass and metal that break out of the skylight fall on Pat's friend, killing her by impaling her body and her head in numerous places.Suzy goes to the school the next day and is greeted by Ms. Tanner (Alida Valli), an instructor, and Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett), the vice directress.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the last name of the person who painted a Western Australian politician?, using the article: Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

In the film, a young couple embark on a voyage on a ketch named \\"Turtle\\". John Coates wrote the screenplay, based on his novel of the same name. Hypothesis: John wasn't fond of the movie and often criticized it   1). Yes.  2). It's impossible to say.  3). No.","output":"2). It's impossible to say. Based on the provided context, we cannot determine John Coates' opinion of the \\"True as a Turtle\\" film adaptation. The context only provides information about the movie, such as its title, release year, director, and the film's main cast. Furthermore, it is mentioned that the screenplay was written by John Coates and based on his novel of the same name. However, without any direct statements or quotes from John Coates about his thoughts or criticisms regarding the film, it's impossible to draw any conclusions about his opinion on the movie. There are numerous factors that could influence an author's feelings toward a film adaptation of their work. Sometimes, authors are involved in the film adaptation process, working closely with the screenwriters and directors to ensure their vision is accurately represented on the screen. Other times, authors may have minimal or no involvement in the project, resulting in a film that deviates significantly from the source material. In such cases, authors may either express disappointment or dissatisfaction or, conversely, appreciate the unique interpretation of their work. Furthermore, the plot's elements the film chooses to focus on or the changes it makes for the sake of the medium could lead to different opinions from the author. Similarly, other factors that can contribute to an author's opinion of a film adaptation include the quality of the acting, the effectiveness of the directing, the reception by critics and audiences, and the success of the film at the box office. Thus, without any additional context about John Coates' involvement in the \\"True as a Turtle\\" film adaptation or his statements or reactions about the final movie, it is impossible to say whether the hypothesis that \\"John wasn't fond of the movie and often criticized it\\" holds true or not."},{"instruction":"Context: Remy invited Sydney to visit her at her new college.

Article: If women are exploited year after year,they have only themselves to blame.Because they tremble at the thought of being seen in public in clothes that are out of fashion ,they are always made use of by the designers and the big stores.Clothes which have been worn only a few times have to be put aside because of the change of fashion.When you come to think of it,only a woman is able to stand in front of a wardrobe  packed full of clothes and announcing sadly that she has nothing to wear. Changing fashions are nothing more than the intentional  waste.Many women spend vast sums of money each year to replace clothes that have hardly been worn.Women who cannot afford to throw away clothing in this way waste hours of their time changing the dresses they have.Skirts are lengthened; necklines are lowered or raised, and so on. No one can say that the fashion industry makes anything really important to society.Fashion designers are seldom concerned with important things like warmth and that woman will put up with any amount of discomfort,as long as they look right.There can hardly be a man who hasnt at some time in his life smiled at the sight of woman shaking in a thin dress on a winter day,or picking her way through deep snow in high-heeled shoes. Question: Fashion designers care little for   _  . Answer: A:","output":"Fashion designers care little for the practicality, comfort, and functionality of the clothing they create. Their primary focus is often on the aesthetic appeal and keeping up with the ever-changing trends in the industry. As a result, many women find themselves purchasing and wearing items that may not provide adequate warmth, comfort, or durability, simply because they are trendy and fashionable. The fashion industry, in many cases, prioritizes visual appeal and marketability over the actual needs and practical concerns of the consumers. This can lead to women experiencing discomfort and inconvenience in their daily lives, as well as contributing to the wastefulness and consumerism that surrounds the fashion industry.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Jail term restored in Vic burning case A man who doused his pregnant girlfriend in petrol and set her alight has had his 15-year jail term restored by the High Court, which rejected Victoria's Court of Appeal judgment that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Last December the appeal court cut Yavaz Kilic's sentence by nearly a third but the High Court in Canberra on Wednesday unanimously allowed a crown appeal against that decision. Kilic, then 22, pleaded guilty in March 2015 to intentionally causing serious injury to his 23-year-old girlfriend, who suffered life-threatening burns and terminated her 12-week pregnancy. He also pleaded guilty to using a prohibited weapon and dealing with property suspected of being proceeds of crime. Kilic was initially sentenced in the County Court to a total 15 years' imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 11 years. But that was reduced on appeal to 10 years and 10 months, with a non-parole period of seven years and six months. The High Court ruled that the Court of Appeal had erred in holding that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. In their judgment, the five High Court judges said the victim described her relationship with Kilic as \\"dysfunctional and controlled by drug use\\". When she went to Kilic's home one evening in July, 2014 with two mutual friends of the couple, he ran at their car with a samurai sword and thrust it through the open driver's window where one of the friends was sitting. After a struggle with victim in the back seat, Kilic emptied a can of petrol over her and a few minutes later held a cigarette lighter to her chest. Her hair, face and clothing were engulfed in flames. She terminated her pregnancy because of her injuries and since her discharge from hospital, she has had numerous appointments for rehabilitation and physiotherapy.","output":"A man who set his pregnant girlfriend on fire has had his original 15-year jail term restored by the High Court, overturning a previous appeals court decision that deemed the sentence excessive.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Three strangers (two men and a woman) are riding in an elevator when a power outage leaves them stranded. It is slowly revealed that one of the men is suffering from losing his wife. The other man had just experienced a domestic disturbance with his girlfriend's father. The woman, covered in blood, just left the hospital after visiting her grandmother. The movie opens with Karl visiting his wife's grave. His young daughter shows up with Karl's sister-in-law and they play Marco Polo for a while. He asks his sister-in-law to care for his daughter so he can take care of something. He drives home where the blackout traps him. During flashbacks we see him taking photos of a woman whom he later buys a drink and takes to his car. Claudia is a student who lives with her grandmother. Her grandmother advises to relax and enjoy life. The story opens with Claudia covered in blood, leaving a hospital for home. She enters the elevator, which she notices is making weird noises. Tommy at first appears tough. He is first shown leaving his girlfriend's house on his motorcycle, then entering the elevator along with Karl and Claudia. When Karl takes Tommy's picture, claiming to have captured the perfect picture of angst, Tommy freaks out and demands he delete it. During a flashback we learn he is a former drug addict and fought with his girlfriend's alcoholic father. When he and Claudia start arguing, Karl urges them to remain calm. Tommy is then shown playing with a butterfly knife, which they subsequently use to keep the elevator's door open for ventilation. Tommy eventually climbs out the top of the elevator, looking for help. As Tommy is climbing up the elevator shaft Claudia flashes back to earlier that day.

Answer:","output":"The flashbacks in the movie \\"Blackout\\" are centered around the lives of the three strangers, Karl, Claudia, and Tommy, and provide insight into the events that led up to them being trapped in the elevator during a power outage. The first significant flashback is of Karl who is depicted as a man suffering from the loss of his wife. In the flashback, we see Karl visiting his wife's grave with his young daughter and sister-in-law. He asks his sister-in-law to look after his daughter before returning home, where the blackout occurs. The flashback also shows Karl taking photos of a woman, buying her a drink, and then taking her to his car. This could imply an attempt at moving on from his wife's death or possibly that he's deeply troubled. Claudia's flashback presents her as a student living with her grandmother. She's shown leaving a hospital, covered in blood, and then entering the elevator. In a conversation with her grandmother that is presented in the flashback, she's advised to relax and enjoy life. However, it's clear that Claudia's present situation, stranded in the elevator, is a contradiction to the easy-going lifestyle suggested by her grandmother. The third character, Tommy, is portrayed initially as a tough character who leaves his girlfriend's house on a motorcycle and then enters the elevator. However, during his flashback, we learn that he is a former drug addict who had a dispute with his girlfriend's alcoholic father. The flashback shows him in argumentative situations, revealing a violent and volatile side to his character. In essence, the flashbacks in the movie \\"Blackout\\" serve as an imperative narrative tool that provides backstory on each character. They delve into individual life experiences, personal struggles of the characters, their relationships, and the events that led them to their shared predicament. These flashbacks offer a juxtaposition of their past and present circumstances, thereby contributing to the rising tension and suspense in the movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sweat and dirt can get trapped on freshly waxed skin, contributing to the development of those pesky bumps. Try showering at least once a day and making sure you clean the waxed area thoroughly during your shower. Dead skin cells can build up after you get a wax, clogging the hair follicle and causing ingrown hairs. Try swapping out your regular washcloth for an exfoliating cloth. Then gently rub the wet exfoliating cloth over the waxed area with your favorite soap or body wash.  You can buy an exfoliating cloth at your local drug store or online. You can also try a topical exfoliating product, like a post-wax cream that contains salicylic acid. Be sure to apply the products to clean skin and carefully follow the directions on the package. Exfoliating can help prevent and treat bumps. If you have post-wax bumps that are painful to the touch and/or feel pressurized under the skin’s surface, you might have infected ingrown hairs. If this is the case, take a warm compress and apply it to the affected area. Leave the compress on for 1-2 minutes, and then swipe the area with a cotton ball soaked in hydrogen peroxide. You can use a warm compress several times to help alleviate the bumps. Calming inflammation after a wax can help eliminate post-wax bumps. Dab a small amount of one-percent hydrocortisone cream on the waxed area after your procedure. For example, a pea-sized amount works well after a brow wax. Use more for a larger area. Apply a thin, even layer across the skin. If you frequently get bumps after waxing, you might want to make an appointment with your dermatologist. They can determine what is causing the bumps, such as a proclivity to ingrown hairs, and whether waxing is the best way to remove unwanted hair. For example, they may suggest a depilatory or laser treatments instead of waxing. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about how to take care of your skin after getting waxed. It tells you to keep the waxed area clean and shower daily.

The show is developed by Greg Berlanti, Andrew Kreisberg, and Geoff Johns and is aired on The CW network. The show's protagonist is Barry Allen, portrayed by Grant Gustin, a forensic scientist who is struck by lightning and acquires the ability to move at superhuman speed. The series follows his journey to protect Central City from various villains and metahumans while dealing with his own personal issues and discovering secrets about his past. The fourth season marked a shift in tone for the series, as the creators wanted to bring back humor and a lighter atmosphere after the dark and serious third season. This season introduces a new villain named Clifford DeVoe, also known as The Thinker, who is a master manipulator and the most intelligent adversary that Barry has faced until then. In the quest to stop The Thinker, Barry and his team, Team Flash, which is composed of his friends and family members, must deal with various metahumans created by The Thinker and unravel the complex plan he had set into motion. The fourth season of \\"The Flash\\" is composed of 23 episodes, each running for about 42 minutes. The episodes showcase a mix of stand-alone stories, character arcs, and season-long plotlines. The show continues to explore the relationships between its main characters, including Barry and Iris West's engagement and eventual wedding, Cisco's development as Vibe, Caitlin Snow's struggle with her alter-ego Killer Frost, and Wally West's journey to find his place as Kid Flash. Overall, the fourth season of \\"The Flash\\" brought back the fun, humor, and engaging storytelling that the show was known for in its earlier seasons.

Play the table minimum when you’re new at a game. This amount will typically be about 5 and is a good place to start while you’re getting comfortable learning the rules. Once you understand a game better, you can start increasing your bets to 10 and 20. The reason you lose so much money playing slots is because you can play them so quickly. Table games take more time, thus any money you lose will be lost more slowly. Even a nickel slot machine loses you about twice as much per hour as a 5 table game. So take a seat at a blackjack table, order a drink, and enjoy the slower pace.  You can opt to sit out every other round to draw out your money as long as possible. Try using a system in which you change your next bet depending on how your previous bet worked out. For instance, increase your bet by 50% every time you win. Betting systems are meant to increase your chances of winning in the short term, but can not improve your odds long term.   Another strategy is to double your bet each time you lose. Also, you can try betting a quarter or one half of your remaining chips each time you place a bet. Since no betting system can eliminate the house edge, temporary gains will always be balanced out with big losses eventually. Limit your usage of betting systems to a few rounds and walk away while you're ahead.

Given the context: What does Alex need to do before this? Answer:","output":"Before Alex kissed Cameron tenderly at the movie theater, there are several steps they may need to take to set the stage for the kiss, depending on their relationship and situations. Here's a possible sequence: 1. Develop a relationship: Alex needs to establish a connection with Cameron - this could be as friends, acquaintances, or romantic partners. Knowing each other's likes and dislikes and finding common interests will help strengthen the bond. 2. Plan a movie outing: Once there is a connection between Alex and Cameron, they should decide to go to the movie theater together. They can choose a movie to watch based on their preferences and movie timings. 3. Identify the right moment: During the movie, Alex should try to gauge Cameron's emotions and reactions to moments in the film. This can help identify a suitable scene or moment where a kiss would be appropriate - for instance, during a tender or romantic scene in the movie. 4. Confirm consent or read body language: It's essential to ensure that Cameron is comfortable with the idea of a kiss. This can be either directly asked or inferred from body language cues like leaning in closer or making eye contact. 5. Build the anticipation: Once consent and comfort levels are established, Alex can slowly move closer to Cameron, holding their hand or gently touching their arm. This helps in building the anticipation and making the moment feel more intimate. 6. Go for the kiss: When the right moment arrives, Alex can gently lean in and give Cameron a tender kiss. It should ideally be a soft, gentle kiss that conveys Alex's feelings and emotions without being overly aggressive. 7. Observe reactions: After the kiss, Alex should observe Cameron's reactions to make sure that they enjoyed it and it was a welcome gesture. The following actions could be based on their response, including cuddling, discussing their feelings or continuing to watch the movie."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Do these two sentences mean the same thing?","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, although there are subtle differences in their structure and emphasis. Both sentences indicate that a majority of a particular group settled in Ontario, with the largest community in Toronto, and subsequent communities ranking in size in Hamilton, London, and Kingston. In Sentence (1), the use of \\"were settled\\" implies a more passive tone, meaning that the group was placed or guided to settle in these different locations, suggesting the involvement of some external force or influence. It could be interpreted as if the group's movement and settlement were directed or managed in some way. In contrast, Sentence (2) employs \\"settled,\\" which is in the active voice and seems to emphasize the group's own agency in the decision-making process. This suggests that they chose, on their own, to settle in these locations. Despite these differences in nuance, the core message expressed in both sentences remains the same: a majority of the group in question chose to settle in Ontario, with the largest community found in Toronto, followed by those situated in Hamilton, London, and Kingston. However, it is essential to acknowledge the subtle variations in tone and emphasis resulting from the distinctions in voice and structure for a more accurate interpretation of the context in which these sentences may be used."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The bio was more popular with the masses than the fiction book. The","output":"biography opened a window into the life of a fascinating and inspirational individual, a story that resonated deeply with readers from all walks of life. The fiction book, while well-written and engaging, simply couldn't compete with the real-life drama and relatable struggles that the biography portrayed. The first step in continuing to write the text is to analyze the context and identify the key elements. In this instance, there is a comparison between a biography and a fiction book. The biography is more popular, with the readers finding inspiration in the true story. The focus is on the reasons why the biography is more appealing. Step two is to expand on the comparison while keeping in mind the context. One could delve deeper into what made the biography particularly interesting and relatable to a diverse audience. The unique appeal of the biography manifested in several ways. While delving into the protagonist's journey of self-discovery, determination, and resilience, it offered readers a mirror that reflected their own lives. The challenges faced by the central figure appeared as a microcosm of the universal human need to overcome obstacles and emerge triumphant. Additionally, the author expertly wove elements of vulnerability and humanity into the narrative, ensuring that readers formed strong emotional connections with the story, establishing empathy for the subject. Step three involves providing a contrast to the reasons why the fiction book couldn't compete with the biography. This helps highlight the differences between the two and emphasizes the biography's exceptional popularity. Despite the skillful crafting of the fiction book's characters, plot, and setting, it lacked the unfiltered honesty and authenticity that emanated from the biography. Readers were inevitably drawn to the raw and intimate portrayal of lived experiences, as opposed to the more fantastical elements of the fictional story. Furthermore, the fiction book's narrative arc followed a somewhat predictable trajectory, which paled in comparison to the unexpected twists and turns that unfolded in the real-life account. In conclusion, the biography's unprecedented popularity was dictated by several factors, including its relatable content, emotional impact, and genuine portrayal of the human experience. While both the biography and the fiction book were well-crafted, the power of the true story surpassed the allure of the fictional narrative in capturing the hearts and imaginations of the readers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite a heavy police presence, some women managed to drive around Riyadh without incident, a protest organizer tells AP. There is no written law in Saudi Arabia saying women can't drive, but the ban comes from religious edicts by clerics.

But in Saudi Arabia, women are not allowed to drive because some religious leaders said so, and it's not fair to the women there. So, a group of women decided to wake up very early in the morning and drive around the city to show that they should be allowed to drive too. There were many police officers, but the women still drove without any problems. One of the women even filmed herself driving and put the video on YouTube, but she got in trouble for it. She had to stay in jail for a week and promise not to drive again. But these brave women know that sometimes, small actions can make big changes.

Angela's dedication and commitment to her studies played a significant role in her academic success. Throughout her high school years, she maintained a disciplined routine and prioritized her education above all else. Angela's study habits were the foundation of her academic success. She created a well-organized study schedule, which allowed her to manage her time effectively and cover all her subjects thoroughly. Furthermore, Angela made sure to allocate sufficient time for both learning new material and revising previously covered topics. This approach helped her retain knowledge and perform better in her exams. In addition to her well-planned routine, Angela also utilized various learning techniques that enabled her to grasp complex concepts more easily. For example, she made an effort to understand the underlying principles behind each topic, rather than merely memorizing facts. This allowed her to develop a deeper understanding of the subjects and improved her ability to solve problems and think critically. Moreover, Angela consistently stayed focused and committed to her academic goals. She sought help from teachers and classmates whenever she faced difficulties, believing that collaborative learning could only enhance her own understanding. Additionally, Angela participated in extracurricular activities that supported her academic growth, such as joining study groups and attending workshops related to her subjects of interest. On the other hand, while Katrina was also studying during high school, her approach towards academics might not have been as effective as Angela's. It is possible that Katrina's study habits did not have the same level of organization and discipline, which could have impacted her academic performance. For instance, she might have struggled to manage her time efficiently, causing her to overlook certain subjects or fail to allocate enough time for revision. Furthermore, Katrina may not have employed the same learning techniques that made Angela so successful. If she focused solely on memorization, rather than developing a deep understanding of her subjects, this could have hindered her ability to excel academically. In high school, a lack of critical thinking and problem-solving skills can often lead to a lower performance in exams and assignments. In summary, Angela's commitment to her studies, excellent time management, effective learning techniques, and willingness to seek help from others played a major role in her surpassing Katrina in academic performance during high school. While both young women studied during their high school years, it was Angela's consistent dedication and well-rounded approach that ultimately led her to excel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Sleep paralysis occurs when your body is starting to fall asleep, and causes you to be temporarily awake but unable to move. Recognize the first signs of sleep paralysis to avoid becoming frightened when it occurs. Sleep paralysis is unpleasant for most people, but it's actually a helpful jumping off point for lucid dreams, if used correctly.  Feel for buzzing, numbness, heaviness, or the sensation of falling. A feeling of heaviness or numbness moving up or across your body can also signal the onset of sleep paralysis. Listen for unpleasant or repetitive buzzing or droning. This tinnitus-like auditory hallucination may mean you are falling asleep.  You may hear words, such as your own name, inside yourself or very nearby. Try not to be startled. Welcome sleep paralysis as a platform for lucid dreaming. Embrace your awareness of your body's descent into sleep by noticing every stage. If you become frightened, remind yourself that it is sleep paralysis, and that you are falling asleep. It is common to hallucinate a presence during sleep paralysis, often a menacing or oppressive one.  Remind yourself that you are dreaming, nothing can hurt you, and you are in charge. If you are frightened, and embracing your dream isn't working, try gently wiggling your fingers or toes. Move from paralysis to lucid dream by moving dreamily. Instead of trying to move your limbs, which feel paralyzed, try instead to float out of your body, sink through your bed, or sit up out of your body. Alternately, tell the room around you to change. Say \\"Now I am transporting to the beach,\\" or some scene you frequently dream.  If there is a presence in the room, tell them you are dreaming and you want to be taken to the dream.  Expect that they will take you, and they will.

Summarize: It comes after Alex Salmond said he believed a second vote was \\"inevitable\\" Scottish Secretary David Mundell then urged the Scottish government to clarify its position on another vote. Ms Sturgeon said it would be her \\"ultimate decision\\", with party backing, but it would be made based on the country's \\"best interests\\". Speaking on a visit to China, Ms Sturgeon said: \\"There can't be a referendum, and there certainly can't be independence for Scotland, unless a majority of people in Scotland clearly want that. \\"It will be my ultimate decision, in line with the democratic decision making processes of the SNP, to determine whether or not there is a commitment to a second referendum in the SNP manifesto for the Scottish election. \\"And in due course we will take that decision and take that decision based on what we consider to be in the best interests of the country.\\" The first minister said she believed \\"one day\\" there would be another independence referendum, but that it required a change in circumstances from last year's vote. She added: \\"But whether it's the next Scottish election or a subsequent Scottish election - it's the decision of the SNP whether or not to include it in a manifesto, but it is the decision of the Scottish people whether to vote for that manifesto.\\" Mr Mundell, the Scottish secretary in the Uk government, earlier said that there were no contingency plans for a further referendum after next year's Holyrood elections - after being asked about any departmental plans in parliamentary questions by an SNP MP. On Sunday, Alex Salmond said a second referendum was inevitable with the issue \\"a question of timing\\", a spokeswoman for Ms Sturgeon said there was \\"no difference of opinion\\" between the first minister and Mr Salmond. Scottish voters rejected independence by 55% to 45% in last September's referendum. After the SNP won 56 of the 59 seats in Scotland in May's general election, Ms Sturgeon stressed there was \\"no second Scottish independence referendum on the immediate horizon\\". However, with some opinion polls pointing to the possibility of an SNP landslide in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections there has been speculation a second vote could be on the cards. Margaret Ferrier, the MP for Rutherglen and Hamilton West, submitted two written questions on the issue to the Scottish secretary. She asked \\"what contingency plans his department has prepared for the possibility of a further referendum on Scottish independence being the policy of the Scottish government after the Scottish Parliament election in 2016\\". Mr Mundell said he was \\"disappointed\\" by the questions in light of previous statements made by both Ms Sturgeon and her predecessor Mr Salmond that the referendum was a \\"once-in-a-generation\\" opportunity. In response, Mr Mundell said: \\"My department has not prepared contingency plans for the possibility of a further referendum being the policy of the Scottish government after the Scottish Parliament election in 2016.\\" Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Scotland radio programme, the Tory MP said he did not accept that circumstances had changed since the referendum. He accused the SNP of trying to find \\"an excuse\\" to have another vote. He said: \\"I think Nicola Sturgeon needs to be much clearer. Is it the SNP policy to have a second referendum or not? \\"It is clear from what Alex Salmond is saying that this isn't about the Smith Commission. For Alex Salmond the Smith Commission isn't good enough, it is independence or nothing and that's what is underlying the push for the second referendum.\\" The Smith Commission was set up after the independence referendum last year to consider further powers for the Scottish Parliament. The Scotland Bill, currently making its way through parliament at Westminster, is taking forward its recommendations. Labour's only Scottish MP and shadow Scottish Secretary Ian Murray told BBC Radio Scotland: \\"Given that everyone agreed, and Nicola Sturgeon agreed, that we shouldn't have another referendum in a generation I think she should keep her promise on that. \\"If she is going to keep that promise, it would be strange for them to have that in a manifest, to say they would deliver it over the next Scottish parliamentary period. \\"The first minister has to clear this up.\\" Summary:","output":"There are some people in Scotland who want their country to be independent from the United Kingdom. They already had a vote last year to decide if they wanted to be independent, but the majority of people voted to stay in the United Kingdom. Now, some people are talking about having another vote to see if the people of Scotland have changed their minds. There is a lady named Nicola Sturgeon who is the leader of a political party called the SNP, and she says that they will decide if there should be another vote based on what is best for the people of Scotland. Some people think that the SNP might include another vote on independence in their plans for the 2016 elections.

Context: As a mother, I’m right now navigating the hardest moment with my two daughters and my son … I was raped at 15 and molested by a teacher from 15–16 … it took 13 years of fighting before I saw any justice for those crimes and it paled in comparison to having to live with that trauma for the last 25 years. I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

Causes et facteurs Il importe de rappeler tout d’abord que le trafic de drogues est un commerce multinational/transnational qui brasse des milliards de pesos. Could you please translate this to English?","output":"First and foremost, it is important to recall that drug trafficking is a multinational/transnational business that generates billions of pesos. In providing a detailed and long answer, let's discuss the causes and factors that contribute to drug trafficking being such a massive and widespread problem across the globe. 1. High demand for drugs: One of the main driving forces behind drug trafficking is the enormous demand for drugs all over the world. The high demand creates a lucrative business opportunity for those willing to engage in illegal activities, thus encouraging the production, distribution, and sale of drugs. 2. Poverty and unemployment: People living in poverty or those facing unemployment often see drug trafficking as a way to escape their dire situation. The prospect of earning a substantial income becomes enticing for individuals who have limited options for improving their living conditions. 3. Corruption and weak government institutions: Corruption and weak law enforcement agencies enable drug traffickers to operate without much fear of being caught. Bribing officials helps traffickers run their illegal operations smoothly, with little to no interference from the authorities. 4. Connection between drug trafficking and organized crime: Drug trafficking is often linked to various forms of organized crime, such as gangs, mafias, and terrorist organizations. These criminal organizations may use the profits from drug trafficking to fund other illegal activities, strengthening their overall operations and creating a vicious cycle of crime. 5. Geographical factors: Some countries and regions, particularly in Latin America, are strategically situated for the cultivation, production, and transportation of drugs. The presence of vast, remote, and hard-to-reach areas provide a suitable environment for the growth and distribution of illicit substances. 6. Lack of international coordination: The transnational nature of drug trafficking makes it especially challenging for individual countries to combat the problem effectively. While international cooperation exists, it remains difficult to coordinate efforts and share information effectively among the various jurisdictional levels involved in addressing the issue. 7. Social acceptance and drug culture: In some communities, drug use is seen as a cultural or social norm, leading to a higher level of tolerance for the drug trade. This acceptance can further contribute to the proliferation of drug trafficking in these areas. In conclusion, drug trafficking is a complex and multifaceted issue with a myriad of contributing factors. High demand, poverty, corruption, and weak governance are some of the key elements that contribute to the persistence of drug trafficking as a global problem. Addressing these issues requires a comprehensive and collaborative response from national and international stakeholders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This iconic game was designed by Shigeru Miyamoto and Takashi Tezuka and produced by the legendary game developer, Mr. Hiroshi Yamauchi. The development of Super Mario Bros. was primarily created as an effort to utilize the capabilities of the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) gaming console, which had been launched a year earlier in 1983 in Japan. The game is structured around the eponymous character, Mario, who goes on an adventurous quest through the Mushroom Kingdom, and with the help of his brother, Luigi, attempts to rescue Princess Toadstool from the antagonist, Bowser. Over time, the game garnered unparalleled success and is often credited with aiding in the revival of the gaming industry, particularly in the United States, after the video game market crash in 1983. Super Mario Bros. is celebrated as an iconic and influential title, which served as a crucial inspiration for future titles in the genre. The game had a lasting impact on the gaming industry and propelled Mario into becoming the most recognized video game character across the globe. With its unique gameplay, memorable soundtrack composed by Koji Kondo, and vibrant graphics, Super Mario Bros. has managed to captivate the hearts and minds of gamers worldwide.

As of my last available update, Bradley Cooper resides in Los Angeles, California.  He has a lavish home in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which is a highly sought after location due to its stunning views and relative privacy for celebrities. His home, purchased around 2009, is a sprawling estate with Spanish-style architecture, boasting around 6 bedrooms, multiple bathrooms, a state-of-the-art gourmet kitchen, a home theater, and a luxurious backyard space with a swimming pool and a spa. The property is surrounded by lush landscaping and tall hedges that provide added privacy and create an oasis-like feel.  Bradley Cooper's decision to live in Los Angeles is likely influenced by the fact that the city is the hub of the entertainment industry. Many Hollywood celebrities, filmmakers, and artists reside in the area, providing access to various events, networking opportunities, and collaborations. Additionally, Los Angeles offers a wealth of industry resources, including film studios, production houses, and talent agencies, making it an ideal location for artists to further their careers. However, it is important to note that Bradley Cooper's residential status may change over time, given his career obligations, personal preferences, or family needs.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party.

News article: Ex-Irish PM Bertie Ahern assaulted by man with a crutch in Dublin pub Ireland's former prime minister Bertie Ahern was assaulted in a Dublin pub on Friday night. Ahern was attacked with a crutch by a man in his forties inside the Sean O'Casey bar just off O'Connell Street, the Irish capital's main thoroughfare. His attacker, who was said to be extremely drunk, was later arrested by the Garda Síochána and detained overnight in a city centre police station. The former taoiseach has declined to talk about the attack, which comes three years after he was verbally abused by a number of customers in another Dublin pub. Many who lost out when the Celtic Tiger economy crashed blamed Ahern and his Fianna Fáil party for fuelling a property boom based on credit. However, Ahern from 1997 onwards was one of the country's most successful and at the time popular premiers, and went on to win three general elections in a row. While Ahern has faced the wrath of angry Irish citizens caught in debt and a negative equity crisis, the ex-prime minister received glowing praise from Alastair Campbell last week.

Before you begin studying, it is important to identify what your goals are. Set a target grade for each exam and think about what you will need to do to achieve that grade. OPTIONS: - For example, if you intend to take on a presidential conference in june, your goals would include a road map, a series of lectures and presentations, an essay, and a quiz to read. An example of a goal would be to take a standardized test a few weeks after the graduate degree you have chosen to attend. - Be realistic; consider how well you've been doing all year, how good your understanding of the material is and window of time you have to study. Don't set your goals too low either. - Most people try to focus their study time on a single subject and what your goals are. You will need to understand the material you are studying and make sure you know your strengths and weaknesses ahead of time. - Doing so will help motivate you and also help you find things to practice often. If your goal is to teach the math, for example, set it for a certain amount of time, and then set it for the next class period.

Buy the fish and place the bag on the water's surface to float for thirty minutes. Untie the bag and release the fish. The correct procedure to introduce a fish to its aquarium is to first allow a few days for the water in the aquarium to settle. This step helps establish a stable environment and maintains proper water chemistry. After purchasing the fish, float the bag (with the fish inside) on the water's surface for thirty minutes, not three minutes. This is important because it helps acclimate the temperature inside the bag to the temperature of the aquarium, reducing temperature shock for the fish. After thirty minutes, untie the bag and release the fish. The first option, which suggested floating the bag for only three minutes, is incorrect since it doesn't provide sufficient time for the fish to adjust to the temperature differences, which can cause stress and potentially harm the fish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Large island had a lot of seismic activity, and Small island that presented almost no seismic activity.  Which island displayed fewer seismic waves?  Hint: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior. Answer:","output":"The Small island displayed fewer seismic waves in comparison to the Large island.  The primary reason behind this is that the Small island experiences almost no seismic activity. Seismic waves are generated due to movements within the Earth's crust, which are often prompted by tectonic activities like earthquakes. Since geologists observed a lot of seismic activity on Large island, it is evident that this island would have more seismic waves produced and traveling through its geological structure. In the study of Earth's interior and geological phenomena, geologists rely on the analysis of seismic waves to gain insights into the composition and behavior of different materials deep within the Earth. These seismic waves, which include body waves (P and S waves) and surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves), travel at varying speeds depending on the type of material they encounter (solid, liquid, or gas). When transitioning from one material to another, the seismic waves may change their speed or direction, and some may not travel through liquids or gases at all, ceasing their movement. When examining the seismic information collected from the two islands, it becomes apparent that the Small island has fewer seismic waves than the Large island. These observations indicate that the geological activity in and around the Small island is significantly lower than that of the Large island. This could be a result of several factors, such as differences in tectonic plate boundaries, geological composition, and other geodynamic processes that may be occurring beneath the Earth's surface. In summary, based on the studies conducted by the team of geologists, the Small island displays fewer seismic waves due to its lower seismic activity in comparison to the Large island, which experiences a higher level of seismic activity and subsequently generates a greater number of seismic waves. This analysis of seismic waves helps scientists understand the Earth's interior, its many layers, and the various processes taking place beneath the surface that contribute to the complex and ever-evolving nature of our planet."},{"instruction":"I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Article:","output":"Title: Hibernian Manager Alan Stubbs Rejects Third Bid from Rangers for Scott Allan Introduction: In the latest twist in the transfer window saga, Hibernian manager Alan Stubbs has officially confirmed that the club has rejected a third bid from Rangers for Scott Allan. His statement follows weeks of intense speculation surrounding the future of Allan, a highly sought-after midfielder, at Hibernian. Background: The ongoing pursuit of Allan by Rangers has captured the interest of football fans and has seen a fierce battle between the two clubs. Rangers have tried multiple times to secure the 29-year-old's services, but Hibernian has remained steadfast in their decision to hold on to the talented player, despite the tempting offers. Third Bid Rejected: Alan Stubbs, Hibernian manager, addressed the media after the third bid from Rangers for Scott Allan was reported, stating \\"We have rejected the latest bid from Rangers for Scott Allan.\\" Stubbs went on to explain the rationale behind the club's decision, emphasizing the importance of Allan's presence in the Hibernian squad and their focus on the team's success. Hibernian's Stance: Hibernian's decision to keep Allan can be viewed as a testament to their commitment towards grooming talents and nurturing players. They have been highly successful in developing Allan, molding him into the skilled midfielder he is today. The club's management is well aware of the potential market value of Allan should he decide to leave, but they prioritize the overall performance and success of the team over monetary gain. Allan's Importance to the Team: Scott Allan's contribution to the Hibernian squad cannot be understated. The midfielder has been a dominant force on the field, playing a pivotal role in guiding his team to key victories in top-tier competitions.

What is the alias of the person who disables a robot?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In a technologically-advanced 1939, the zeppelin Hindenburg III moors itself atop the Empire State Building. Aboard the airship is Dr. Jorge Vargas, a scientist who arranges for a package containing two vials to be delivered to Dr. Walter Jennings. The courier looks back while leaving with the vials, to see that Dr. Vargas has vanished. Polly Perkins, a reporter for The Chronicle, is looking into the disappearances of Vargas and five other renowned scientists. A cryptic message leads her to Radio City Music Hall, against the warnings of her editor, Mr. Paley, where she meets Dr. Jennings during a showing of The Wizard of Oz. He tells her that a Dr. Totenkopf is coming for him next. Suddenly, seemingly indestructible robots attack the city. Clearly outmatched, the authorities call for \\"Sky Captain\\" Joe Sullivan, the city's hero and Perkins' ex-lover and the commander of the private air force the Flying Legion. While Joe engages the robots with his modified Curtiss P-40 pursuit fighter, Perkins photographs from the street with little regard for her personal safety. He eventually manages to disable one robot; the rest leave thereafter. News reports show similar attacks around the globe. The disabled robot is taken back to the Legion's air base so that technology expert Dex can examine it. Polly follows and convinces Joe to reluctantly let her in on the investigation. Her information takes them to the ransacked laboratory of a dying Dr. Jennings, while an assassin escapes. Just before he dies, Jennings gives Polly the two vials and states that they are crucial to Totenkopf's plans. Polly hides the vials and withholds the information from Joe. They return to the Legion's base just before it comes under attack from squadrons of ornithopter drones. Dex tracks the origin of the signal controlling the drones and notes it on a map before his capture. Answer:","output":"The alias of the person who disables a robot in this context is \\"Sky Captain\\" Joe Sullivan. He is the city's hero and the commander of the private air force, the Flying Legion.

Options: - alone - story book - herb garden - great outdoors - sky  Explain why a human would choose \\"great outdoors\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"A human would choose \\"great outdoors\\" as the answer to the question where a bee is naturally found due to a variety of reasons, primarily because it is the most accurate and logical option given the other choices. Let's analyze each option to better understand why \\"great outdoors\\" is the most suitable answer. 1. Alone: While it's true that bees can sometimes be found alone, this option does not provide a clear or specific location. Bees are social insects that generally live in colonies, but they can indeed be found alone when searching for food or scouting for new nests. However, the term \\"alone\\" does not tell us where a bee can typically be found in terms of its natural habitat. 2. Story book: While bees are often featured in story books, these books are purely fictional representations of real-life bees and their behavior. Therefore, considering a story book as a natural habitat for bees would not be a correct answer in this context. 3. Herb garden: Bees can be found in herb gardens, as they often visit these gardens to gather nectar and pollinate flowers. However, this option is too specific to be considered the natural habitat for bees. Herb gardens are man-made creations, and while they might attract bees, the insects can be found in a much wider range of outdoor environments, not just herb gardens.  4. Great outdoors: This option is the most appropriate answer to the question. Bees are naturally found in a variety of outdoor environments such as meadows, forests, and gardens, amongst others. The term \\"great outdoors\\" encompasses all of these different locations and is therefore the most accurate option to describe where bees are naturally found. 5. Sky: Although bees are known for their ability to fly, suggesting that they are naturally found in the sky is not an accurate answer to the question. Bees spend most of their time on flowers, in colonies, or moving to find new food sources in different environments. The sky is where they fly to move from one place to another, but it cannot be considered as their natural habitat or where they are naturally found. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"great outdoors\\" to answer the question because it is the most accurate and logical choice given the other options. The great outdoors includes a range of environments where bees can be found, including the various locations where they gather nectar, pollinate flowers, and establish their colonies. While some of the other options may feature bees in certain contexts, none of them offer a concise and accurate description of a bee's natural habitat like the term \\"great outdoors\\" does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Photo      JPMorgan Chase and federal authorities are nearing settlements over the bank’s ties to Bernard L. Madoff, striking tentative deals that would involve roughly 2 billion in penalties and a rare criminal action. The government will use a sizable portion of the money to compensate Mr. Madoff’s victims.      The settlements, which are coming together on the anniversary of Mr. Madoff’s arrest at his Manhattan penthouse five years ago on Wednesday, would fault the bank for turning a blind eye to his huge Ponzi scheme, according to people briefed on the case who were not authorized to speak publicly.      A settlement with federal prosecutors in Manhattan, the people said, would include a so-called deferred-prosecution agreement and more than 1 billion in penalties to resolve the criminal case. The rest of the fines would be imposed by Washington regulators investigating broader gaps in the bank’s money-laundering safeguards.      The agreement to defer prosecution would also list the bank’s criminal violations in a court filing but stop short of an indictment as long as JPMorgan pays the penalties and acknowledges the facts of the government’s case. In the negotiations, the prosecutors discussed the idea of extracting a guilty plea from JPMorgan, the people said, but ultimately chose the steep fine and deferred-prosecution agreement, which could come by the end of the year.      Until now, no big Wall Street bank has ever been subjected to such an agreement, which is typically deployed only when misconduct is severe. JPMorgan, the authorities suspect, continued to serve as Mr. Madoff’s primary bank even as questions mounted about his operation, with one bank executive acknowledging before the arrest that Mr. Madoff’s “Oz-like signals” were “too difficult to ignore,” according to a private lawsuit.      JPMorgan, which declined to comment for this article, has repeatedly said that “all personnel acted in good faith” in the Madoff matter. No one at JPMorgan has been accused of wrongdoing and the bank was not the only one to miss Mr. Madoff’s fraud, which duped regulators and clients for decades.      In recent months, the bank has emphasized that it is scaling back businesses that could be vulnerable to money laundering and cutting ties to certain clients.      Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, made a reference to the settlement talks at an industry conference on Wednesday, saying: “You read about Madoff in the paper the other day. We have to get some of these things behind us so we can do our job.”      The looming settlements would come on the heels of JPMorgan’s reaching a record 13 billion settlement over its sale of troubled mortgage securities before the financial crisis.      The scrutiny has taken a toll on JPMorgan, undercutting its leverage in negotiations and casting the bank as a symbol of Wall Street risk-taking. That stigma also sapped the influence that JPMorgan once used to shape policy in Washington, people briefed on the matter said, where regulators are increasingly skeptical of the bank’s lobbying.      Although JPMorgan still wields some sway in Washington — it held more meetings with regulators on the so-called Volcker Rule than any other bank, according to the Sunlight Foundation — the bank’s 6 billion trading loss in London last year became a flash point in the process and inspired regulators to strengthen the rule, a restriction on risky trading that was approved this week.      Facing the scrutiny, JPMorgan and its top executives directed billions of dollars to new compliance measures and vowed to adopt a conciliatory tack with federal authorities. The bank also embarked on a tour of contrition that featured Mr. Dimon holding town-hall-style meetings with regulators.      Of all its legal problems, the Madoff case appears to be among the biggest threats because of the criminal element. The deferred-prosecution agreement, the people said, is expected to fault JPMorgan for a “programmatic violation” of the Bank Secrecy Act, which requires banks to maintain internal controls against money laundering and to report suspicious transactions to the authorities.      The bank is also planning to settle with the federal Comptroller of the Currency and a unit of the Treasury Department, which are scrutinizing broader breakdowns in JPMorgan’s detection of suspicious transactions routed through the bank. In addition to focusing on JPMorgan’s ties to Mr. Madoff, regulators from the comptroller’s office have also examined the safeguards at JPMorgan’s private banking unit in Asia and within the so-called correspondent banking business, in which it relies on foreign institutions to process transactions overseas.      The comptroller’s office, the Treasury and the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan all declined to comment.      The Madoff case could have turned out worse for JPMorgan. In recent weeks, the federal prosecutors in Manhattan debated whether to demand that JPMorgan plead guilty to a criminal violation of the Bank Secrecy Act, the people briefed on the matter said.      The government has been reluctant to bring criminal charges against large corporations, fearing that such an action could imperil a company and throw innocent employees out of work. Those fears trace to the indictment of Enron’s accounting firm, Arthur Andersen, which went out of businesses after its 2002 conviction, taking 28,000 jobs with it. Ever since, prosecutors have increasingly relied on deferred-prosecution agreements, which rebuke companies without threatening their health. Although a Wall Street bank has never faced a deferred-prosecution agreement, according to a University of Virginia Law School database, Wachovia and the banking arm of American Express have entered into such deals.      The agreements, however, have fueled concern that some banks, having grown so large and interconnected, are too big to indict.      Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan whose office is handling the JPMorgan case, has raised similar concerns. “I don’t think anyone is too big to indict — no one is too big to jail,” he said in a recent speech.      In the case of JPMorgan, the nation’s biggest bank, his office discussed the potential ramifications of criminal charges with the comptroller’s office, which is required to monitor the bank’s stability, the people said. The comptroller’s office assured the prosecutors that it would not stand in the way of the charges. And Mr. Bharara’s office concluded that the bank could withstand a criminal charge.      But ultimately, prosecutors decided that a deferred-prosecution agreement was more fitting to a case that began as a civil investigation. Criminal authorities have a higher burden of proof than their civil regulatory counterparts, having to show a legal violation “beyond a reasonable doubt” rather than just a “preponderance of the evidence” standard in civil cases.      The government’s case against JPMorgan would most likely center on its failure to file a so-called suspicious activity report about Mr. Madoff. While the bank alerted the authorities in Britain to concern about Mr. Madoff, it did not sound the alarms with American regulators.      A statement of facts that would underpin the deferred-prosecution agreement will most likely cite a series of internal JPMorgan emails suggesting that employees had concerns that never made it to Washington. Some of the emails surfaced in a separate lawsuit that Irving H. Picard — the trustee trying to recoup money on behalf of Mr. Madoff’s victims — filed against JPMorgan in 2010. Mr. Picard, who has recovered 9.5 billion for victims, sued the bank for 6.4 billion, accusing it of “aiding and abetting” Mr. Madoff.      JPMorgan has denied Mr. Picard’s accusations. A federal appeals court tossed out his lawsuits against JPMorgan and other banks.      JPMorgan’s relationship with Mr. Madoff spanned more than two decades, from 1986 to the time of his arrest in 2008. JPMorgan served as his primary bank, Mr. Picard said, collecting fees from Mr. Madoff’s brokerage firm, which moved billions of dollars through an account at the bank.      By 2006, concerns began to mount within the bank. “I do have a few concerns and questions,” one JPMorgan employee wrote in February 2006 after studying some of Mr. Madoff’s trading records, according to an email cited in the lawsuit. “All trades are generated by Madoff’s black box.”      Mr. Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence after pleading guilty to operating the scheme. ||||| JPMorgan Chase has tentatively agreed to pay 2bn to settle allegations it failed to inform US authorities of suspicious activity from Bernard Madoff, according to people familiar with negotiations between the bank and the Department of Justice.      The Justice Department has accused the bank of failing to pass on concerns about Madoff, who had an account with the bank, and was arrested five years ago this week as his 20bn Ponzi scheme came to light.      The settlement, which could come as soon as next week, follows several multibillion-dollar settlements at JPMorgan over a raft of separate legal action.      It is also expected to include a “deferred prosecution agreement” for criminal allegations, a severe and rare step against a financial institution.      Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, signalled earlier this week that the bank was looking to draw a line under the litigation.      He indicated JPMorgan would pay up to resolve the Madoff matter even though the bank has maintained for five years that the claims are “meritless”.      “We have more to go,” he told a conference in New York on Wednesday. “You read about Madoff in the paper today. We have to get some of these things behind us so we can do our job. Our job is to serve clients around the world. That’s our job. So I want to get it behind us.”      Madoff himself predicted the payment in a 2011 Financial Times interview from the prison where he is serving a 150-year sentence. “JPMorgan doesn’t have a chance in hell of not coming up with a big settlement,” he said.      According to a separate legal complaint, JPMorgan knew about the Madoff fraud going as far back as 1997 when it was alerted to “round-trip transactions” to and from Madoff’s JPMorgan account.      According to the complaint, a Madoff employee would draw down the account at the other financial institution at the end of every business day and then deposit a cheque with the same amount to JPMorgan, which was then Chase Manhattan bank. The size of the cheque ranged from 1m to 10m.      The following morning, roughly the same amount would be wired back to the other financial institution giving the appearance during that period that Madoff had twice the money, according to the complaint.      In 2007, almost 18 months before Madoff’s Ponzi scheme was revealed, John Hogan, then a senior risk officer, said – according to the complaint – “For whatever it’s worth, I am sitting at lunch with Matt Zames who just told me that there is a well-known cloud over the head of Madoff and that his returns are speculated to be part of a Ponzi scheme.” Mr Zames is now co-chief operating officer of the bank. JPMorgan has said no employee was aware of the fraud.      JPMorgan did file a “suspicious activity” report with UK authorities in 2008 but did not take a similar step in the US. Under US anti-money laundering rules financial institutions have an obligation to “know your customer” and file suspicious activity reports, or SARs, to bank regulators when they detect irregular activity.      Settling the Madoff action would further deplete a giant 23bn legal war chest that JPMorgan assembled to deal with its unprecedented wave of legal troubles. The bank agreed to pay 13bn last month to settle allegations it had mis-sold mortgage securities.      “And I got call from . . . shareholders saying, ‘fight’,” Mr Dimon told a Goldman Sachs conference. “But think of the fighting part . . . being in courts for two, three, four or five years, your people will be interviewed, your company will be demeaned in the press nonstop . . . It’s very hard to go to court in some of these matters if you’re a bank and I don’t want to threaten the health of my company forever.” ||||| What is a summary?","output":"JPMorgan Chase, a big bank, and the government are close to settling a problem related to a man named Bernard Madoff. Madoff did something very bad called a Ponzi scheme, which took a lot of money from people. The bank is going to pay about 2 billion to fix the problem. Some of the money will go to help the people who Madoff hurt. This settlement will make sure the bank doesn't get into more trouble as long as it pays the money and admits what it did wrong. This kind of agreement is not very common for big banks like JPMorgan Chase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In a 1997 interview, Deal expressed an interest in redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of \\"Full on Idle\\" sound almost the same, but The Village Voice's Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska.

To that end, he first conducted two experiments, case A and case B. In case A he used conduction, and in case B he used induction. In both cases he used same two objects. Finally, John tried to  charge his phone remotely. He called this test as case C.  and a hint : Charging an object by touching it with another charged object is called charging by conduction. By bringing a charged object into contact with an uncharged object, some electrons will migrate to even out the charge on both objects. Charging by conduction gives the previously uncharged object a permanent charge. An uncharged object can also be charged using a method called charging by induction . This process allows a change in charge without actually touching the charged and uncharged objects to each other. Imagine a negatively charged rod held near the knob, but not touching. If we place a finger on the knob, some of the electrons will escape into our body, instead of down the stem and into the leaves. When both our finger and the negatively charged rod are removed, the previously uncharged electroscope now has a slight positive charge. It was charged by induction. Notice that charging by induction causes the newly charged object to have the opposite charge as the originally charged object, while charging by conduction gives them both the same charge.  Please answer this question : In which case the objects would be closer to each other, case A or case B?

Jeff Gerber lives in an average suburban neighborhood with his seemingly liberal housewife Althea, who tolerates her husband's character flaws out of love. Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans. One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \\"black\\" off him, but finds it does not work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \\"Negro in the bathroom\\" is him. At first, Jeff believes this to be the result of spending too much time under the tanning machine. He spends almost the entire day at home, afraid to go out of the house, only going out once to venture into the \\"colored part of town\\" in order to find a pharmacy to buy \\"the stuff they use in order to make themselves look white.\\" His attempts to change his skin color fail.

The policeman assumes that, since he is a black man, he must have stolen something. During his lunch break, he makes an appointment with his doctor who cannot explain Jeff's condition either. After several calls, the doctor suggests that Jeff might be more comfortable with a black doctor. The answer is:","output":"Jeff.

Today, we are going to learn about something really cool called \\"body language.\\" It's a way we can send messages without speaking or using any words. Body language is when we use our bodies to show how we feel. Let's find out how to look at someone else's body language and how we can use it to communicate better with our friends. Our bodies can say a lot, even when we're not talking! We move our hands, make faces, and even change our posture to show what we're feeling. When we understand our friend's body language, we can be better friends by knowing how they feel. Just like when we can tell that momma is upset because she looks sad, we can also see when our friends are happy or sad. Here are some ways to understand your friend's body language: 1. Look at their face: People's faces can tell us a lot about how they are feeling. Are your friend's eyes smiling, or are they sad? Are their eyebrows raised or down low? Each expression can give you a clue about what they might be thinking or feeling. 2. Pay attention to their arms: When our friends are talking to us, their arms can help us understand them better too! If their arms are crossed, maybe they are feeling a little uncomfortable or upset. But if their arms are relaxed or painting fun pictures in the air, they might be happy or excited about something they're sharing with us. 3. Watch their hands: Hands can be great for telling us how someone is feeling. If they're waving their hands around when they talk, that might mean they're really excited or enthusiastic about something. Or if their hands are closed tightly, they could be feeling nervous or worried. 4. Look at their posture: The way our friends stand or sit can also help us know how they feel. If they're slouching or hunching their shoulders, they might be sad or feeling tired. But if they're standing tall and straight, they could be feeling confident and happy. 5. Don't forget the ears and feet: Our ears and feet might not talk, but they can still give us clues about how someone is feeling. Listening closely to someone's tone of voice, or watching how they move their feet when they speak can help us understand their body language even better. By being good at reading body language, we're learning a special skill that can help us better understand the people around us. This makes it easier to know when our friends need a hug, a high five, or a good laugh. And when we know how to understand people around us, we can also try using our own body language to show how we feel.  So next time you're with your friends, remember that our bodies can talk too! Practice paying attention to all the different ways your friends use body language, and don't forget to use your own body to show how you feel. Happy communicating!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: The Tragedy of Lucretia is a tempera and oil painting on a wood \\"cassone\\" or \\"spalliera\\" panel by whch Italian Renaissance master, it is housed in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, having been owned by Isabella Stewart Gardner in her lifetime? The answer is:","output":"The Tragedy of Lucretia is a tempera and oil painting on a wood \\"cassone\\" or \\"spalliera\\" panel created by the renowned Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli. It is currently housed in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, where it continues to be admired by art enthusiasts from around the world. Sandro Botticelli, born Alessandro di Mariano Filipepi (c. 1445 – May 17, 1510), was an Italian painter during the Early Renaissance period. He was born in Florence, Italy, which was the center of Renaissance art at the time. Under the patronage of the famous Medici family, Botticelli quickly gained recognition for his artistic talents and went on to create some of the most iconic and captivating works of the Renaissance. The Tragedy of Lucretia showcases Botticelli's skill in employing vivid colors, intricate details, and powerful storytelling in his artwork. Lucretia was a legendary Roman woman whose tragic story is told in Roman historical accounts and has been the subject of numerous artworks throughout history. The scene depicted in Botticelli's painting is one of great tragedy and emotional intensity. According to the ancient Roman legend, Lucretia was raped by Sextus Tarquinius, the son of the ruling king. After revealing the horrific event to her family and expressing her dishonor, Lucretia took her own life. Her tragic death would ultimately lead to the establishment of the Roman Republic, as the outraged citizens rebelled against the ruling monarchy. In Botticelli's rendition of this tragic tale, the despair and anguish of Lucretia and her family members are captured through their vivid expressions and gestures. The painting not only conveys the emotional turmoil of the scene but also reflects Botticelli's mastery of rendering detailed human figures, drapery, and complex narratives in his works. Isabella Stewart Gardner, an American art collector, philanthropist, and patron of the arts, owned the painting during her lifetime. Born in 1840 in New York City, Gardner developed an extensive art collection, which she displayed in her Venetian-style palazzo in Boston. When she passed away in 1924, her museum was established as per her will and the extensive art collection, including The Tragedy of Lucretia, became available for public viewing. Today, The Tragedy of Lucretia remains an impressive example of Italian Renaissance art, serving as a testament to the exceptional skill of Sandro Botticelli. Its presence at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum continues to allow visitors to appreciate the extraordinary talent of this prominent Renaissance master."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: when is the last movie of divergent coming out??","output":"The final movie in the Divergent series, titled \\"Ascendant,\\" was originally scheduled for release on June 9, 2017. After the third movie, \\"Allegiant,\\" was released in 2016, it received mixed reviews and did not perform as well at the box office as expected. Consequently, due to these circumstances, Lionsgate, the studio behind the movie franchise, decided to rethink their strategy and consider other alternatives for the conclusion of the film series. Initially, it was reported that Lionsgate planned to release \\"Ascendant\\" as a TV movie, followed by a TV series spin-off that would take place within the same universe. This decision was partly influenced by the growing popularity of streaming services and TV adaptations around that time. However, fans of the series and the main cast, including Shailene Woodley (who portrayed the protagonist, Tris Prior), expressed their disappointment and reluctance about the shift from a big-screen release to a television adaptation. This lack of interest, combined with the underperformance of the previous movie, has left the future of the Divergent series uncertain. As the years have passed without any concrete updates, it is safe to assume that the chances of the last Divergent movie being released are quite slim. Currently, there are no official announcements about the production or release of \\"Ascendant.\\" The fate of the final installment of the Divergent series hangs in the balance, with possibilities of it being revived later on or remaining unresolved indefinitely."},{"instruction":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: Rahul (Sharman Joshi) is one such young man with dreams.

During a stop in a small town square with her tour group, Lisa grows to admire a fresco of the devil carrying a dead man's body which her tour guide describes as the devil carrying away lost souls back to Hell. As her group disperses, Lisa hears a beautiful piece of music. She leaves her companions and traces its source to an elaborate music box in a little antique shop just outside the main square. While inside the shop, she encounters a strange man (Telly Savalas) purchasing parts of a life-size mannequin. After making eye contact, Lisa is startled when the man bears an uncanny resemblance to the devil depicted in the painting. The man's peculiar behaviour distresses Lisa, so she flees from the shop to rejoin her friends.However, she becomes hopelessly lost in the maze of backstreets of the town. Though she has only walked a short distance beforehand, the back streets and alleyways seem totally alien to her. The locals refuse to give her directions, as side streets lead to dead ends.

Weathering refers to the physical and chemical processes that break down rocks into smaller pieces or sediments. This can occur through various factors such as temperature changes, water, ice, chemical reactions, and biological activities.  During the weathering process, rocks are broken down into smaller fragments through physical means or are altered chemically through the action of water or other chemical agents. Once these rocks are reduced to smaller particles, they can be more easily transported by agents of erosion. Erosion is the process by which these sediments are then carried away from their original location by environmental forces such as wind, water, ice, and gravity. Over time, the eroded sediments are transported and begin to accumulate in a new area, such as a riverbed, lake bed, or ocean floor. These accumulated sediments will then go through the subsequent steps of sedimentary rock formation, including deposition, burial and compaction, and eventually lithification, turning them into fully formed sedimentary rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The last time the Seattle Mariners made the playoffs was in 2001. That year, they achieved a notable success by setting the American League record for most wins in a single season with 116 victories. Managed by Lou Piniella, the team had an impressive roster that included players like Ichiro Suzuki, who won both the American League MVP and Rookie of the Year awards in 2001, Edgar Martinez, Bret Boone, Mike Cameron, and John Olerud. The 2001 season saw the Mariners dominating on the field, as they won the American League West division title with a 14-game lead over the second-place Oakland Athletics. Their success continued into the playoffs, as they faced the Cleveland Indians in the American League Division Series (ALDS). The Mariners won the best-of-five series 3-2, propelling them into the American League Championship Series (ALCS). Unfortunately, the Mariners' postseason run came to an end in the ALCS, as they faced off against the New York Yankees. Although they managed to win Game 3 of the series, the Yankees ultimately prevailed, winning the best-of-seven series 4-1. The Yankees advanced to the World Series, where they eventually lost to the Arizona Diamondbacks. Despite their remarkable regular-season performance, the Seattle Mariners have not returned to the playoffs since that 2001 season.

John Vass, appointed head gardener in 1939, left in 1957. Called up to the RAF in 1941, he had urged that the hedges be maintained, confident that everything else in the garden could be restored after the war. Ronald Platt succeeded him from 1957 to 1959. In 1959 Pamela Schwerdt and Sibylle Kreutzberger were appointed as joint replacements. They remained at Sissinghurst until 1991, their contributions, \\"as much, if not more than Vita's, mak[ing] it the most admired and popular 20th-century garden in England\\". In 2006 they were awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Victoria Medal of Honour for their work at Sissinghurst. The pair were followed as head gardener by Sarah Cook, who was succeeded by Alexis Datta.In 2014, Troy Scott Smith, previously head gardener at Bodnant, was appointed – the first male head gardener since the 1950s. He has written of the challenges of maintaining the garden \\"in the manner of its creator, after they have gone\\". In 2018 Scott Smith announced plans to extend the flowering season at Sissinghurst beyond the autumn period established by Schwerdt and Kreutzberger, into the winter months, allowing for year-round opening of the garden. The gardening writer and landscape critic Tim Richardson, writing in 2015, described Scott Smith's re-making of the garden: \\"Sissinghurst, more than any other garden I know, inspires extremes of emotion. There is a feeling that this is Britain's leading garden – and so, arguably, the world's, a status that has proven to be both a great boon and an albatross around its neck\\". Scott Smith's plans include the reinstatement of every species of rose known to have been grown by Sackville-West. A new history of the garden by Sarah Raven was published in 2014. Sissinghurst continues to exert considerable influence, being described as a \\"Mecca\\" and a \\"place of pilgrimage\\" for gardeners from around the world and encouraging many imitators.

Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles.

See how they are played, what the rules are, how you win, and what penalties there are. By learning about lots of sports, you are able to see what you like and dislike.  Start a list of features from various sports that you want your sport to include. You might take the layout of a baseball field, the play features of bocce ball, and the penalties of football. Don’t take more than one or two features from each sport unless you want to create something that’s a variation of a sport that already exists. Write out how the game is played and how a winner is determined. Be as specific as possible about what each player or team must do and what they are not allowed to do. Decide if there is a time limit or if play goes on until a certain score or goal is reached.  Decide if teams rotate turns or if play shifts back and forth between them at random. For example, in volleyball, each team serves at specific times, but play passes back and forth until one team misses the ball. In baseball, teams take turns being at bat and in the field. Many sports, like soccer, have a time limit and the winner is whoever has the most points. Others, like tennis, are played until a specific point value is reached. If you want the sport to require teams, decide if there must be a set number or if it can vary. On the other side, plan the sport differently if you want it to be a one-on-one game. Keep in mind that some of the most popular sports are adaptable for a range of players.  Sports like soccer, basketball, ultimate frisbee, and football are designed to accommodate a range of player numbers. They typically require at least two people per team and up to ten or eleven, but the game can be played with any number in between. Games like ping pong, tennis, and racquetball require at least two and no more than four, in most cases. Set out what you think is the ideal number of players, but make note of how the game could be adapted for different numbers of players. Start broad, and expand outward into specifics. Make sure there are enough rules to make the sport work but not so many that it becomes confusing for players to learn it. For starters, set out five to ten basic rules.  You might brainstorm lots of rules and then rank them in terms of importance. Go through a process of elimination to get rid of ones that are not necessary. Rules include what players must do, what they are allowed to do, and what they are not allowed to do. For example, players must walk, are allowed to jump, but can’t run. Incorporate various rules from sports that already exist, which you researched in the first stage of the sport’s development.

Answer a question about this article: Indigenous peoples in what is now the contiguous United States, including their descendants, are commonly called \\"American Indians\\", or simply \\"Indians\\" domestically, or \\"Native Americans\\" by the USCB. In Alaska, indigenous peoples belong to 11 cultures with 11 languages. These include the St. Lawrence Island Yupik, Iñupiat, Athabaskan, Yup'ik, Cup'ik, Unangax, Alutiiq, Eyak, Haida, Tsimshian, and Tlingit, who are collectively called Alaska Natives. Indigenous Polynesian peoples, which include Marshallese, Samoan, Tahitian, and Tongan, are politically considered Pacific Islands American but are geographically and culturally distinct from indigenous peoples of the Americas. How are Pacific Islands Americans distinct from the indigenous peoples of the Americas?","output":"Pacific Islands Americans are distinct from the indigenous peoples of the Americas in several ways, including their geographical location, cultural practices, historical migration patterns, language, and political affiliations.  1. Geographical Location: The indigenous peoples of the Americas primarily inhabit the regions spanning from the north of Alaska to the southern tip of South America. In contrast, Pacific Islands Americans are indigenous to the islands of the Pacific Ocean. These islands are grouped into three main regions: Polynesia, Micronesia, and Melanesia. They include territories like Samoa, Tahiti, Tonga, and Marshall Islands. 2. Cultural Practices: While there are diverse cultural practices among both indigenous peoples of the Americas and Pacific Islands Americans, overall, they display distinct cultural traditions. For example, traditional Pacific Island culture revolves around the ocean and maritime activities like fishing, navigation, and seafaring, while many American indigenous cultures developed around terrestrial aspects like agriculture, hunting, and the environment's resources. Dance, music, and rituals also differ between these two groups. 3. Historical Migration Patterns: The ancestors of indigenous peoples of the Americas are believed to have migrated to present-day North and South America through the Bering Land Bridge from Siberia thousands of years ago. On the other hand, Pacific Islands Americans have a different migration history rooted in the Austronesian expansion, which involved navigation across the open ocean, using various techniques such as sailing and celestial navigation. 4. Language: The languages of indigenous peoples of the Americas and Pacific Islands Americans are distinct, with different language families and structures. Indigenous peoples of the Americas speak languages belonging to numerous language families such as the Algonquian, Siouan, Uto-Aztecan, and others. Pacific Islands Americans speak languages belonging to the Austronesian language family, which includes Marshallese, Samoan, Tahitian, and Tongan. 5. Political Affiliations: The political relationship between Pacific Islands Americans and the United States differs from that of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Many Pacific Island nations have specific treaties and agreements with the US that define their political associations and rights. Some are freely associated states, like the Marshall Islands, and some are US territories, like American Samoa. Indigenous peoples of the Americas, on the other hand, have various treaties, agreements, and federal recognition laws that govern their political status and rights within the US. In conclusion, Pacific Islands Americans are distinct from the indigenous peoples of the Americas in terms of their geographical origins, migration histories, cultural practices, languages, and political affiliations. While both groups are considered indigenous, their unique experiences and backgrounds contribute to the rich diversity of indigenous cultures and histories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: It's not every week that England's greatest playwright William Shakespeare hits the headlines, but the Bard of Avon   has been the subject of two news stories in recent days as new information has come to light about the writer and his working environment. In the first development, a portrait of Shakespeare, which is believed to be the only picture painted of him during his lifetime, was _ in London. The artwork has been dated back to 1610, meaning it was painted six years before the writer's death. The painting had been owned by a family descended from Shakespeare's literary patron   tor hundreds of years without them ever knowing who the man in the picture was. Alec Cobbe, who inherited the portrait, realized that the painting was a likeness of Shakespeare after visiting an exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery where he saw a portrait that had, until 70 years ago, been accepted as a life portrait of Shakespeare. Mr Cobhe immediately realized he was looking at a copy of the painting that had been in his family for centuries. The painting will now go on display in Shakespeare's hometown Stratford-upon-Avon. In a separate story, archaeologists in London believe they have unearthed the remains of Shakespeare's first theatre. The site was excavated  by a team from the Museum of London last summer, and is believed to have been built in 1576. Experts think that Shakespeare himself acted at the theatre, which may have been where the play Romeo and Juliet was premiered  . It is believed that 25 years after construction, the building was pulled down and moved timber by timber to the South Bank of the Thames, where a reconstruction of the theatre now stands. Question: .What is the story mainly about? Answer: Answer:","output":"The story is mainly about two significant discoveries related to William Shakespeare, the renowned playwright.

Over the years, Sassou had to rely more on political repression and less on patronage to maintain his dictatorship. Which group of nations did Nguesso side the Congo with? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"Sassou Nguesso sided the Congo with the group of nations known as the Eastern Bloc during his rule. The Eastern Bloc, also called the Communist Bloc, was a group of socialist countries led by the Soviet Union that existed during the Cold War, from approximately 1947 to 1991. This bloc was primarily made up of countries from Eastern Europe, as well as some other nations such as Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam. By aligning the Congo with the Eastern Bloc, Nguesso established strong ties with the Soviet Union and followed a similar political ideology of socialism and communism. Over the years, however, as economic conditions declined and political opposition increased, Nguesso had to rely more on political repression and less on patronage to maintain his dictatorship. This resulted in a shift towards authoritarian rule and the suppression of dissent, which further alienated a significant portion of the population and led to instability in the country. In conclusion, Sassou Nguesso aligned the Congo with the group of nations called the Eastern Bloc during his rule, forging a close relationship with the Soviet Union and adopting a socialist-communist political ideology. Over time, however, this alliance did not prevent the decline in economic conditions and the rising political dissent, forcing Nguesso to adopt more repressive measures to maintain his grip on power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In the 19th century, residents of the small, isolated Pennsylvania village of Covington live in fear of nameless creatures in the surrounding woods and have constructed a large barrier of oil lanterns and watch towers that are constantly manned to keep watch. After the funeral of a seven-year-old boy, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) asks the village elders for permission to pass through the woods to get medical supplies from neighboring towns; however, his request is denied. Later, his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver) admonishes him for wanting to visit the neighboring towns, which the villagers describe as wicked. The Elders also appear to have secrets of their own and keep physical mementos hidden in black boxes, the contents of which are reminders of the evil and tragedy they left behind when they left the towns. After Lucius makes a short venture into the woods, the creatures leave warnings in the form of splashes of red paint on all the villagers' doors. Meanwhile, Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard)âthe blind daughter of the chief Elder, Edward Walker (William Hurt)âinforms Lucius that she has strong feelings for him, and he returns her affections. They arrange to be married, but Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), a young man with an apparent developmental and learning disability, stabs Lucius with a knife because he is in love with Ivy himself. Noah is locked in a room until a decision is made about his fate. Edward goes against the wishes of the other Elders, agreeing to let Ivy pass through the forest and seek medicine for Lucius. Before she leaves, Edward explains that the creatures inhabiting the woods are actually members of their own community wearing costumes and have continued the legend of monsters in an effort to frighten and detract others from attempting to leave Covington. He also explains that the costumes are based upon tales of real creatures who once lived in the woods.

Generously butter a 9-inch (22.86-centimeter) pie plate.","output":"After buttering the pie plate, begin preparing the filling by whisking together 6 large eggs, 1 1/2 cups (355 milliliters) of heavy cream or milk, 1 teaspoon (5 milliliters) of salt, 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 milliliters) of black pepper, and any desired herbs or spices such as 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of dried thyme or 1/4 teaspoon (1.25 milliliters) of paprika in a large mixing bowl. Once the egg mixture is well combined, set aside and proceed to cook any additional ingredients like vegetables, proteins, or cheese that you'd like incorporated into the quiche. For instance, sauté 1 1/2 cups (355 milliliters) of chopped vegetables (such as mushrooms, onions, tomatoes, or spinach) in a separate pan with some olive oil or butter over medium heat until they become tender. If you are adding proteins, cook 1 cup (225 milliliters) of cubed bacon, ham, or sausage until thoroughly cooked and browned.

I was relegated to \\"The IT guy\\" in the family. For the most part I don't really mind it. Most of the family at least knows only to call me when their problem is more than a google search problem. Except for my grandmother. My grandmother calls me at least 6-7 times a week demanding I fix whatever problem is bothering her now. Most of them are so simple that any google search will fix them but she refuses to do anything on her own and treats me like her personal computer slave.  &amp;#x200B; There's also another problem with my grandmother, she thinks computers are worthless. Whenever I go over she decides to ask me when i'm getting a \\"real job\\" or tell me how me begin able to fix computers is \\"not a real skill\\".

I had just got done with a 12 hour shift and told her I would come over in the morning before work but she demanded I come NOW and would not stop calling me or my parents (despite me not living with them) to get me to come. In the end I decided to just end my misery and go.  &amp;#x200B; When I got there it turns out the \\"Hacker attack\\" was a rouge toolbar she had installed that was popping ad's up in her browser.

She responded by telling me I was wrong and didn't know what I was talking about.  &amp;#x200B; Well, Already having a bad day I decided to show her why she was wrong. I pulled up her download history and showed her exactly how she got the toolbar. After this she started to tell me I was wrong and that she was not \\"some stupid old lady\\" and that I was making fun of her. She then started ranting to me before I just got up and left.

Please answer a question about the following article about Catalan language: Literary Catalan allows the use of words from different dialects, except those of very restricted use. However, from the 19th century onwards, there is a tendency of favoring words of Northern dialects in detriment of others, even though nowadays there is a greater freedom of choice. What kind of words are excepted from literary use?","output":"In the context of the article, words that are excepted from literary use in the Catalan language are those that are of very restricted use and are specific to certain dialects. These may be idiomatic expressions, local slang, or terms that are only understood within the limited geographic or social context of a particular dialect. This practice of exclusion is primarily because such words might not be easily comprehensible or familiar to a broader Catalan-speaking audience, which can hinder overall understanding and communication in literary works. Since the 19th century, there has been a tendency to favor words from Northern dialects in Catalan literature, which may be a result of various historical, political, and social factors. However, in recent times, there has been a greater freedom of choice and an openness to include diverse elements from different dialects, allowing for a richer and more inclusive expression of the Catalan language. This change can lead to a broader representation of the various dialects within literary works, celebrating the diversity and richness of the Catalan language as a whole. In summary, words that are of very restricted use and specific to certain dialects are usually excepted from literary Catalan. The rationale behind this exclusion is to maintain a wider understanding and familiarity among Catalan-speaking audiences. Nevertheless, recent shifts in attitudes and acceptance of diverse dialectal elements have contributed to expanding the use of words from various dialects in literary Catalan, enriching the language's cultural expression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, many people find public speaking to be a daunting task, with the fear of facing an audience and the concern of not being able to deliver the message well. This article aims to provide valuable tips and techniques to help individuals enhance their public speaking skills and become confident speakers. 1. Think about your posture and body language Your nonverbal communication plays a significant role in conveying your message to the audience. It is essential to maintain an upright posture and be aware of your body language throughout your speech. Standing tall and maintaining eye contact with your audience members will help you come across as confident and engaging. Additionally, use hand gestures and facial expressions to emphasize key points and convey emotions. 2. Use props effectively Incorporating props in your presentation can enhance its overall impact and make it more engaging for your audience. However, it is essential to choose appropriate props that add value to your speech and do not distract from your main message. When using props, ensure that you handle them confidently, display them at the right time, and give the audience a clear view. 3. Know when and how to use pictures Similar to props, visual aids such as pictures can greatly improve your presentation's effectiveness by complementing your verbal content. Use high-quality images that are relevant to your topic and are easy to understand. Remember to limit the number of pictures used in your presentation, as too many visuals can decrease their impact and distract the audience.  4. Engage with specific audience members, rather than scanning When delivering your presentation, it is crucial to create a connection with your audience. Instead of merely scanning the room, select specific people in the audience and maintain eye contact with them for brief moments. This technique not only builds trust and rapport with your audience but also helps you calm nerves and feel more at ease while speaking. 5. Vary your tone and vocal delivery A monotonous voice is likely to make your speech unengaging and can cause your audience to lose interest quickly. To hold your audience's attention, vary your tone, pitch, and volume according to the context of your message. For example, adopt a louder and more assertive tone when expressing an essential point, and a softer, more reflective tone when sharing an emotional or personal story. 6. Embrace the power of pauses Pauses are an undervalued aspect of public speaking. They allow you to emphasize key points, provide the audience with time to process information, and convey emotions effectively. When using pauses, ensure they are intentional and well-placed to avoid giving the impression of insecurity or forgetfulness. 7. Conclude by restating your message and expressing gratitude To leave a lasting impression on your audience, it is essential to conclude your speech effectively. Restate your main points or message to emphasize those ideas and reinforce the theme of your speech. Finally, express gratitude by thanking your audience for their attention and time, showing appreciation for their engagement. Conclusion Mastering communication through effective public speaking techniques is an invaluable skill that can help you share your ideas and message with confidence and poise. By incorporating these tips into your next presentation, you can elevate your public speaking skills, engage with your audience, and leave a lasting impression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Remove any dirt and oils that have accumulated on your with a gentle cleanser. Rinse your arms thoroughly with warm water. Lubricants, such as shaving creams and gels, serve as a measure of protection against skin irritation and cuts. While you may coat your entire arm in shaving cream or gel, this may cause you to waste a large amount of the product. Instead, consider applying a lubricant to sections of your arms throughout the process of shaving. Once you have finished with a section, apply shaving gel or cream to an unshaven area of your arm. Divide your arms into small, manageable sections to shave.  Shave from the inside of your wrist, up the top of your forearm, and stop at your elbow. Gradually work your way across the forearm to the outside of your wrist, shaving in straight, even lines. Repeat on the other arm. Shave the upper part of your arm—from your elbow to your shoulder—in the same manner. Repeat on the other arm. Bend your elbow to tighten the skin. Slowly move the razor across the delicate skin of your elbow. Repeat on the other elbow. If you are shaving your arms for swimming, it is recommended that you do not shave the underside of your arms. The hair on this part of your body allows you to feel the water as you are moving through it. After you have shaved both arms, rinse them off under the warm water of your shower. The warm water helps to combat irritation. It may prevent the appearance of razor burn the next day.","output":"To significantly decrease your risk of skin irritation while shaving your arms with a traditional razor blade, the first and primary step is to cleanse your arms properly. Using a gentle cleanser, wash your arms to remove accumulated dirt and oils. Warm water should be used for rinsing as it prepares your skin for the shaving process, opening up the pores, and softening the hair follicles, thus making them easier to shave.  Once your skin is prepped, lubricants such as shaving creams and gels can be applied. These lubricants act as a protective barrier between the skin and the blade, reducing chances of skin irritation and cuts. However, rather than applying the lubricant on the entire arm, consider progressive application to avoid wastage.  Shaving should be executed methodically and systematically. Split your arm into small manageable sections. Begin the shaving process from the inside of your wrist, move up the top part of your forearm until you reach the elbow. Subsequently, start working your way across the forearm to the wrist's outside, ensuring you maintain straight and even lines for an effective shave. This process should be repeated similarly on the other arm. Also, follow the same routine for the upper parts of your arm, shaving from elbow to shoulder. Shaving around your elbow requires extra caution due to its delicate skin. Bending your elbow tightens the skin, hence facilitating safer shaving around this area. Ensure to repeat this with your other elbow as well. If you are a swimmer shaving for aerodynamic purposes, it is advisable not to shave the hair on the underside of your arms. The hair here helps in sensing water movements when swimming. Lastly, post-shaving involves a thorough rinse of the arms under the warm water from your shower. Warm water not only helps remove residual shaving cream or gel but also soothes the skin and combats irritation which could prevent the occurrence of razor burn the next day. Ensure this process is undergone methodically and patiently to maintain skin health and achieve optimal results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: To make yogurt How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of making yogurt, you can follow these detailed steps. Homemade yogurt requires only two main ingredients – milk and starter culture. The starter culture contains live bacteria that ferment the milk to produce yogurt. You can either buy a commercial yogurt starter culture or use a small amount of pre-made yogurt with active cultures as the starter. Ingredients: - 1-liter (4 cups) whole or 2% milk - 2-3 tablespoons of plain yogurt with active cultures (or a commercial yogurt starter culture) - Optional: sugar or other sweeteners, fruit, or flavorings of your choice Equipment: - Heavy saucepan or pot with a lid - Thermometer - Whisk or spoon to stir - Measuring cups and spoons - Sterilized glass jars or containers with lids - Kitchen towel or. oven mitts - Blanket or towel - Optional: yogurt maker or slow cooker Steps: 1. Prepare the equipment: Before starting, ensure that your containers, utensils, and any other equipment you'll be using are clean and sterilized. This will prevent the growth of any unwanted bacteria during fermentation. 2. Heat the milk: Pour the milk into a heavy saucepan or pot and place it over medium heat. Use a thermometer to monitor the temperature, and keep stirring occasionally to prevent it from sticking to the bottom or forming a skin on top. Heat the milk to 180°F (82°C) to pasteurize it, which will kill any unwanted bacteria or pathogens. This step also denatures the milk proteins, which helps in achieving a smoother and thicker yogurt. 3. Cool the milk: Once the milk reaches 180°F (82°C), remove it from heat and allow it to cool to about 110°F (43°C). You may want to place the saucepan in a cool water bath to speed up the cooling process, but keep checking its temperature to avoid overcooling. Too hot or too cold milk may interfere with the fermentation process. 4. Add the starter culture: When the milk has cooled to the right temperature, gently whisk in the yogurt starter culture or 2-3 tablespoons of pre-made yogurt with active cultures. Make sure to incorporate it thoroughly into the milk. 5. Transfer to containers: Pour the milk mixture into your prepared glass jars or containers. Secure the lids tightly to avoid contamination. If you are using a yogurt maker, follow the instructions provided by the manufacturer. 6. Incubate: To encourage fermentation, the yogurt needs to be kept at a consistent temperature of around 110°F (43°C) for several hours. You can accomplish this in several ways:    a. Wrap the jars in a blanket or towel and place them in a cooler or an insulated spot, such as an oven with its light on.    b. Place the jars in a slow cooker that has been preheated and then turned off.    c. Use a yogurt maker or a sous-vide water bath, following the manufacturer's instructions to maintain the correct temperature. Allow the yogurt to incubate for at least 6-12 hours, depending on desired thickness and tanginess. Longer incubation times will result in thicker and tangier yogurt. 7. Check for consistency: After the incubation period, check the yogurt for its thickness and taste. If it has reached the desired consistency, you can stop the fermentation process. 8. Refrigerate: To halt further fermentation and set the yogurt, it must be chilled. Carefully transfer the jars to the refrigerator and allow the yogurt to chill for at least 3 hours or overnight. 9. Add sweeteners and flavors: Once the yogurt has set, you can add sugar, honey, fruit, or other flavorings as per your preference. Remember to mix gently to maintain the yogurt's texture. Cleanup and storage: After making the yogurt, ensure proper cleanup of the equipment and store any remaining yogurt in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks. For your next batch, you can use a small portion of your homemade yogurt as the starter culture, or follow the same procedure with a fresh commercial starter culture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I was surprised at the location that it's in a business office complex and looked borderline sketchy. My friend from out of town was with me and even said \\"Where are you taking me?!\\" This place had great reviews which includes some yelpers I know and my brother. There was maybe 2 or 3 parties already there when we were seated and as we waited to order the place started to get pretty packed. As most pho places in Vegas on a Sunday, most of the patrons were hung over youngsters who were at the club from the previous night. I really wanted spring rolls and saw something on the menu that was shrimp egg rolls, but unfortunately it was not the spring rolls I was expecting. It was shrimp wrapped and  deep fried and came with large pieces of lettuce on the side. It was good, but a little greasy. I ordered thin sliced beef, that came with egg rolls, a shrimp cake, and broken rice. I've never had broken rice before and it reminds me of the rice at the bottom of the rice cooker that's been there after awhile and becomes crispy. The beef and egg rolls were good, but I think I would enjoyed this meal more if I had the vermicelli with it instead of the broken rice. This was also my first time trying a shrimp cake and it looked like a piece of spam with batter, but made shrimp instead. Mine was on the greasy side because shiny oil on top was visible. Unlike my friend's shrimp cake his looked less greasier than mine. The service was pretty good because they were attentive throughout our entire meal.

The Turkish government had decided to seize the Sich and destroy all the Zaporozhian Cossacks. By order of the Sultan, Selim Giray and 40,000 Tatars joined the Turkish campaign against Sich. In January 1675 15,000 Janissaries and 40,000 Tatars under Khan Selim Giray approached the Sich without being detected. Tartars surrounded the Sich and Janissaries tried to enter it, but the Zaporozhians repulsed the attack and decisively defeated the Turkish troops. 13,500 Janissaries were killed and the rest fled. The Khan retreated from the Sich back to the steppe.

Here is a question about this article: During the later stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, and to a lesser extent afterwards, uranium-235 has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (thermonuclear weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process. What is the answer to this question: What does non-fissile mean?","output":"To answer the question: \\"What does non-fissile mean?\\" we need to examine the context in which it is mentioned in the provided article. The article describes various types of nuclear weapons and mentions that the more powerful fission/fusion bombs (thermonuclear weapons) are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case. Non-fissile means that the material is not capable of undergoing nuclear fission, which is the process of splitting the atomic nucleus into two smaller, lighter nuclei, thereby releasing a large amount of energy. In the context of the article, a non-fissile uranium case is used in thermonuclear weapons, which does not undergo fission on its own, but will do so when bombarded by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

Two hours before his scheduled execution Thursday, the Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles commuted the death sentence of Samuel David Crowe, his lawyer said. Samuel David Crowe's death sentence was changed to life in prison by Georgia authorities, his attorney says. Crowe was convicted in 1988 of murdering Joseph V. Pala, the retail manager at Wicks Lumber Company in Douglas County. Crowe admitted to the crime. The board's ruling means Crowe's sentence will be changed to life without the possibility of parole. The board did not give a reason for its decision. When attorney Ann Fort called Crowe with the news, he was quiet. \\"He was really shocked and relieved but very somber about it. He takes very seriously the deep harm that he caused when he committed this crime,\\" she said. Crowe had a cocaine habit that his attorney says he kicked in prison. He spent his time behind bars counseling other inmates, teaching some of them to read and writing to people outside of prison who had drug habits. \\"He didn't want them to go down the path he did,\\" Fort said. As for the Pala family, they are devastated. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Pala's widow, Fran Pala, and his daughter, Lisa Pala-Hansen, were too upset to address the parole board. A representative spoke to the board on their behalf, the newspaper said. Crowe had been scheduled to be executed by injection at 7 p.m. ET Thursday at Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison in Jackson, 45 minutes south of Atlanta. He would have been the 19th inmate in Georgia executed by injection. William Earl Lynd was executed by injection the first week in May. He was the first inmate to die in the state since September, when the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider whether the three-drug combination represented cruel and unusual punishment. Lynd was convicted of murdering his ex-girlfriend in 1988. The U.S. Supreme Court had effectively halted all executions in the country last September, when it agreed to consider whether the three-drug combination used by most states violated the constitutional ban on cruel and unusual punishment. Death penalty opponents have argued that if inmates are not given enough anesthetic, they could be conscious enough to suffer excruciating pain without being able to express it because of the paralyzer. Their claims are supported by medical studies. Of the 24 death sentences the Georgia board has considered, Crowe's is the third it has commuted. Also this week, Mississippi executed murderer Earl Wesley Berry by lethal injection. Berry confessed to abducting Mary Bounds in 1987, beating her to death and then dumping her body in a rural road. The courts rejected Berry's attorneys' arguments that he should be spared because he was mentally retarded. CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.

Given the background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  and the situation: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Answer the following question: Which city experienced fewer rocks breaking? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, Tree city experienced fewer earthquakes compared to Red city. Since earthquakes are caused by the breaking of rocks due to built-up stresses at plate boundaries, it can be inferred that Tree city experienced fewer rocks breaking than Red city. This is likely because Tree city is farther away (60 miles) from the volcano compared to Red city, which is only 10 miles away. The distance could possibly result in less intense activity and stress at the plate boundary near Tree city, leading to fewer rocks breaking and subsequently fewer earthquakes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abstract: Key PointsMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of ∼21–25-nucleotide small RNAs that negatively regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. The founding members of the miRNA family, lin-4 and let-7, were identified through genetic screens for defects in the temporal regulation of Caenorhabditis elegans larval development. Owing to genome-wide cloning efforts, hundreds of miRNAs have now been identified in almost all metazoans, including flies, plants and mammals. MiRNAs exhibit temporally and spatially regulated expression patterns during diverse developmental and physiological processes. Most of the miRNAs that have been characterized so far seem to regulate aspects of development, including larval developmental transitions and neuronal development in C. elegans, growth control and apoptosis in Drosophila melanogaster, haematopoietic differentiation in mammals, and leaf development, flower development and embryogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. The majority of the animal miRNAs that have been characterized so far affect protein synthesis from their target mRNAs. On the other hand, most of the plant miRNAs studied so far direct the cleavage of their targets. The degree of complementarity between a miRNA and its target, at least in part, determines the regulatory mechanism. In animals, primary transcripts of miRNAs are processed sequentially by two RNase-III enzymes, Drosha and Dicer, into a small, imperfect dsRNA duplex (miRNA:miRNA*) that contains both the mature miRNA strand and its complementary strand (miRNA*). Relative instability at the 5′ end of the mature miRNA leads to the asymmetric assembly of the mature miRNA into the effector complex, the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).Ago proteins are a key component of the RISC. Multiple Ago homologues in various metazoan genomes indicate the existence of multiple RISCs that carry out related but specific biological functions. Bioinformatic prediction of miRNA targets has provided an important tool to explore the functions of miRNAs. However, the overall success rate of such predictions remains to be determined by experimental validation. AbstractMicroRNAs are a family of small, non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression in a sequence-specific manner. The two founding members of the microRNA family were originally identified in Caenorhabditis elegans as genes that were required for the timed regulation of developmental events. Since then, hundreds of microRNAs have been identified in almost all metazoan genomes, including worms, flies, plants and mammals. MicroRNAs have diverse expression patterns and might regulate various developmental and physiological processes. Their discovery adds a new dimension to our understanding of complex gene regulatory networks..

Context: Coming off an impressive home win over the Buccaneers, the Lions flew to Soldier Field for Round 2 of their NFC North duel with the Chicago Bears.  After a scoreless first quarter, Detroit jumped into the lead with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 26-yard field goal.  Afterwards, the Lions increased its lead with RB Kevin Jones getting a 4-yard TD run, while Hanson nailed a 52-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Bears threatened Detroit's lead as QB Brian Griese completed a 20-yard TD pass to TE Greg Olsen for the only score of the period.  Fortuntaely, in the fourth quarter, the Lions held on to win as Hanson got a 20-yard field goal. Detroit's defense was a huge part of this victory, as they intercepted Griese four times, including three times in the endzone. With their first season-sweep over Chicago since 2004, the Lions improved to 5-2. As a result of their winless 2008 and 2-14 2009 seasons, this became the Lions' last win on the road until Week 15 of the 2010 season. This also remained their most recent win over a division rival until Week 14 of the 2010 season when the Lions beat the Packers. Question: Which team won the game?

Options are: (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"(1). No, the text you provided does not imply that a person born in the UK automatically acquires British citizenship. The given statement explains the conditions under which a child born outside the UK or outside a British Overseas Territory would acquire British citizenship by descent. Here's a detailed explanation: The provided text is about British citizenship by descent, which applies to children born outside the UK or a British Overseas Territory. If a child is born outside these areas to a parent who is a British citizen otherwise than by descent, the child automatically acquires British citizenship. In this sense, children who do not fulfil these conditions may not automatically acquire British citizenship. Now, for those born in the UK, the rules are different. British citizenship laws have changed over the years, and the regulations governing the citizenship of children born in the UK depend on the date of birth and the nationality or immigration status of their parents at the time of their birth. For children born in the UK before 1983, they automatically became British citizens. However, following the passage of the British Nationality Act in 1981, children born in the UK on or after 1 January 1983 may or may not acquire automatic citizenship based on the status of their parents. If one parent is a British citizen or has 'settled status' in the UK at the time of the child's birth (for example, with Indefinite Leave to Remain, Permanent Residence, or as an EEA national with the right to live and work in the UK), then the child born in the UK will automatically acquire British citizenship.  However, if neither parent is a British citizen or has 'settled status' at the time of the child's birth, the child born in the UK is not automatically a British citizen and may only acquire citizenship through various processes like registration or naturalization after fulfilling certain requirements. In summary, based on the given text, the answer is no. It is not true that being born in the UK automatically makes a person British. The rules and regulations surrounding British citizenship are more complex and largely depend on the parent's nationality or immigration status and the child's birth date."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: As Internet users become more dependent on the Internet to store information, are people remember less? If you know your computer will save information, why store it in your own personal memory, your brain? Experts are wondering if the Internet is changing what we remember and how. In a recent study, Professor Betsy Sparrow conducted some experiments. She and her research team wanted to know the Internet is changing memory. In the first experiment, they gave people 40 unimportant facts to type into a computer. The first group of people understood thatthe computer would save the information. The second group understood that the computer would not save it. Later, the second group remembered the information better. People in the first group knew they could find the information again, so they did not try to remember it. In another experiment, the researchers gave people facts to remember, and told them where to find the information on the Internet. The information was in a specific computer folder  . Surprisingly, people later remember the folder location   better than the facts. When people use the Internet, they do not remember the information. Rather, they remember how to find it. This is called \\"transactive memory  \\". According to Sparrow, we are not becoming people with poor memories as a result of the Internet. Instead, computer users are developing stronger transactive memories; that is, people are learning how to organize huge quantities of information so that they are able to access it at a later date. This doesn't mean we are becoming either more or less intelligent, but there is no doubt that the way we use memory is changing. Question: What can we learn about the first experiment?

D: The second group did not understand the information.

This will give us: 82*x - 16*x = 330 2. Now, let's combine the x terms on the left side (82*x - 16*x). It's like having 82 apples and taking away 16 apples: (82 - 16)*x = 330 That becomes: 66*x = 330 3. The last step is to get x all by itself.

Please add spaces between words: ThejobpositionintheUnitedStateswasextremelybad,sincethiswasthetimefollowingthegreatdepression.","output":"The job position in the United States was extremely bad, since this was the time following the great depression. The Great Depression was a severe worldwide economic downturn that began in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It originated in the United States after the stock market crash of October 29, 1929, known as Black Tuesday. This collapse in stock prices caused banks to fail, businesses to shutter, and unemployment rates to soar. The job situation during this time was disastrous for the United States, as millions of people were left without work. Unemployment rates peaked at approximately 25% in 1933, which meant that one in four Americans were left without a job. As more people lost their jobs, the overall economy continued to decline, resulting in a vicious cycle. Those who were still employed experienced wage cuts and reduced work hours, further limiting their ability to spend and stimulate the economy. This decline in spending led to even more business closures and job losses. During this time, the U.S. government implemented various policies and measures to try and alleviate the crisis, such as President Franklin D. Roosevelt's (FDR) New Deal programs. These initiatives aimed to restore employment, stabilize the economy, and provide financial assistance to struggling citizens. Some examples of New Deal programs include the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC), which provided jobs for young men in forestry and conservation projects; the Works Progress Administration (WPA), which generated jobs in public works and infrastructure projects; and the Social Security Act, which established a system of retirement benefits and unemployment insurance. Over time, these programs and economic policies helped bring about a slow recovery, and the United States began to emerge from the Great Depression by the late 1930s. However, it's argued that the significant increase in defense spending due to the outbreak of World War II in 1939 played a huge role in restoring full employment and revitalizing the U.S. economy. In conclusion, the job position in the United States during the period following the Great Depression was abysmal, with millions of people left unemployed and struggling to make ends meet. Through the introduction of government programs and a major shift in economic policy, the country slowly recovered and managed to pull itself out of the depths of this devastating economic crisis."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Question: Who witnesses them kissing?

They have a lengthy list of websites, as mentioned in the given text, that they are responsible for registering within their system. This list continues to grow because they discover new sites as they search for information while registering other artwork. The expansion of the list is supplemented with suggestions provided to them by users. This implies an increasing volume of work that they must handle. The responsibility of searching and cataloguing images or websites is quite time-consuming and exhaustive.

After releasing several limited-edition singles and the extended play \\"Man Bites Man\\", the band released the album to critical praise.  - The Man Bites Man EP was a CD containing 4 tracks that was used to promote Dogs Die in Hot Cars , who were at the time working on their debut album : Please Describe Yourself . The release was limited to 1000 copies . The third track on this CD was used in an advertising campaign for Boots . Also , the recording of \`\` Pastimes & Lifestyles '' found on this EP is different from that of the version found on their debut - the most notable difference being that the bridge before the last chorus on this version is longer . Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley ( who produced the band 's debut album ) produced the first track on this CD , while Paul Tipler produced tracks 2 and 4 , and track 3 was produced by Craig Macintosh - the band 's lead singer .  - An EP (short for extended play) is a musical recording that contains more tracks than a single, but is usually unqualified as an album or LP. An EP originally referred to specific types of vinyl records other than 78 rpm standard play (SP) and LP, but it is now applied to mid-length CDs and downloads as well.  - Dogs Die in Hot Cars is a Scottish band from St. Andrews consisting of members Craig Macintosh (vocals, guitar), Gary Smith (vocals, guitar) Ruth Quigley (vocals, keyboards, French horn), Lee Worrall (bass and glockenspiel) and Laurence Davey (drums and percussion).  - V2 Records (or V2 Music) is a record label that was purchased by Universal Music Group in 2007, and then by PIAS Entertainment Group in 2013.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).    Given the information above, choose from the list below the object entity that exhibits the relation 'instance of' with the subject 'man bites man'.  Choices: - album  - band  - collective  - die  - edition  - extended play  - generation  - genre  - guitar  - label  - music  - new wave  - punk rock  - rock  - rock music  - scottish  - single  - studio  - studio album  - term  - word Answer:","output":"extended play"},{"instruction":"Q: Jason was applying to nursing school and asked Lee for a recommendation letter.

Programs in business, public administration, urban planning, economics, and political science will all set you up for a good future as a city manager. The other options are incorrect because: 1. Finding courses at the city or school district and apprenticeship training are not directly related to becoming a city manager. While they may provide some useful skills or knowledge, they are not the next step in the process of becoming a city manager. 2. The statement about getting a degree in business, finance, or real estate before graduating is confusing and not accurate. You need to choose an appropriate major during your undergraduate degree that will help you on your path to becoming a city manager. 3. Gaining a bachelor's degree in negotiation or financial planning could be useful, but it is not a necessary requirement to become a city manager.

Question: You are given a new situation: Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible.  and a hint : Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products.  Please answer this question : Which country's cars, Cuba's or Panama's, will emit less carbon monoxide? Answer:","output":"Panama's cars will emit less carbon monoxide compared to Cuba's cars due to the presence of advanced catalytic converter technology in their vehicles.  To understand why, let's delve into the differences between the vehicles and the function of a catalytic converter: 1. Cuban Cars: As mentioned, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars are equipped with engines designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. As a result, they do not have the means to effectively reduce harmful emissions such as nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and volatile hydrocarbons. The absence of a catalytic converter allows these harmful materials to be released directly into the atmosphere, contributing to air pollution and smog. 2. Panamanian Cars: In contrast, Panama has strong trade relations with Japan, which has enabled its citizens to drive cars with the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology. These modern vehicles are designed to significantly reduce harmful emissions through the use of advanced catalytic converters. 3. Catalytic Converter Function: A catalytic converter is a device installed in the car's exhaust system that facilitates the conversion of harmful emissions into less harmful substances. It contains catalysts made of precious metals such as platinum, palladium, and rhodium, which help to promote chemical reactions within the device. When harmful exhaust gases pass through the catalytic converter, the catalysts trigger chemical reactions, transforming the harmful substances into less harmful ones. For example, carbon monoxide (CO), a toxic and odorless gas, is converted into carbon dioxide (CO2), which is less harmful. Considering the significant technological differences between Cuban and Panamanian cars, it is evident that Panama's cars, with their advanced catalytic converter technology, will emit less carbon monoxide compared to Cuba's cars. The catalytic converters in Panamanian cars enable more efficient and effective conversions of harmful emissions into less harmful substances, reducing their overall environmental impact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context:  The township of Crompton was originally within the parish of Prestwich-cum-Oldham in the Diocese of Lichfield, until 1541, when, owing to the English Reformation, this diocese was divided and Crompton became part of the Diocese of Chester. This in turn was divided in 1847, when the present Diocese of Manchester was created.The exact date of the establishment of a place of worship in Crompton is uncertain. Although Shaw Chapel is certain to have been in existence since the early 16th century, it has been put that \\"Shaw Chapel is even more ancient than Oldham Old Church\\", as evidenced by the ancient toponymy of the area. Shaw Chapel was anciently known as St Patrick's Chapel-on-the-Moor, and during the reign of James I of England, \\"it was situate in the midst of the common called Shaw Moor, not a single habitation being near it\\". It is thought to have been constructed following an increase in wealth produced by the localisation of the woollen trade during a very bleak period, although, in 1552 it was noted that it had no endowment, and its ornaments were in poor condition. It was rebuilt in 1739 and enlarged in 1798, and rebuilt again in 1870. It is now known as the Church of Holy Trinity.Shaw and Crompton has three Church of England ecclesiastic parishes: Shaw, High Crompton, and East Crompton. In addition to the established church, a variety of Reformed denominations, particularly Nonconformism and Methodism, have been practiced in Shaw and Crompton. Presbyterian ministers were recorded preaching at Shaw Chapel in as early as the 1650s. The Religious Society of Friends held conventicles in Whitfield in 1660s and 1670s.The following is a table of churches presently in Shaw and Crompton, as of 2018. Most of the above churches participate in Shaw's annual Whit Walks event, when congregations, choirs, and brass bands parade through the streets from their respective churches before taking part in one large, communal, inter-church service.

Choices:  - allele commonness  - trait frequency  - allele rarity  - allele frequecy  A: A:","output":"The rate at which a specific allele appears within a population is called \\"allele frequency.\\" Allele frequency is a critical concept in understanding population genetics and the basic principles of inheritance and evolution. To give a more detailed explanation, let's break down some important terms and concepts related to allele frequency. 1. Allele: An allele is a variant form of a gene that is situated at a specific location or locus on a chromosome. Different alleles determine the various forms of a particular genetic trait (e.g., hair color, eye color, blood type). 2. Population: In genetics, a population refers to a group of interbreeding organisms of the same species that inhabit a specific geographical location. 3. Gene pool: The gene pool is the entire collection of genes and their alleles present within a specific population at any given time. The gene pool represents the genetic diversity of the population, which plays an essential role in adaptation and survival. Now, coming back to allele frequency, it is a measure of how common or widespread a particular allele is within a population's gene pool. It is calculated by dividing the number of copies of a specific allele by the total number of all alleles of the same gene within the population. Allele frequencies can range from 0 (the allele is absent) to 1 (the allele is fixed, or present in all individuals of the population). Monitoring allele frequencies within populations over time can help scientists understand several aspects of population genetics, such as: 1. Genetic drift: Random changes in allele frequencies occurring from one generation to the next, mostly due to chance events (i.e., random mating and random fluctuations in population size). 2. Gene flow: The movement of genes and alleles between different populations as a result of migration and subsequent breeding. 3. Natural selection: The process whereby specific alleles become more or less common over time, depending on their impact on an individual's fitness (i.e., their ability to survive, reproduce, and contribute to the gene pool). In summary, allele frequency is a key concept in population genetics that allows researchers to monitor and understand various evolutionary processes to see how they shape genetic traits within and between populations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Rose was drafted in after Johnson was advised to stop playing live or \\"risk total hearing loss\\". He makes his debut with the band in Lisbon, Portugal, on Saturday 7 May. \\"I'm happy and excited in one sense, but I think it would be inappropriate to be celebrating, in a certain way, at someone else's expense,\\" he said. \\"That's not what I'm here to do.

Johnson, 68, from Gateshead, has been lead singer with AC/DC since 1980. In a statement last month, he said he was \\"crushed\\" by his inability to fulfil the remaining tour dates. There have been rumours the split was acrimonious, but guitarist Angus Young explained he had spoken to Johnson extensively before he decided to leave the group. \\"In his heart he wanted to finish [the tour] but because of that hearing factor he had to make the decision,\\" he told the BBC. \\"It's a hard thing to do, and he'd had the problem since we kicked off touring.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - A record producer or music producer oversees and manages the sound recording and production of a band or performer's music, which may range from recording one song to recording a lengthy concept album. A producer has many roles during the recording process. The roles of a producer vary. He or she may gather musical ideas for the project, collaborate with the artists to select cover tunes or original songs by the artist/group, work with artists and help them to improve their songs, lyrics or arrangements.   - Multimedia is content that uses a combination of different content forms such as text, audio, images, animations, video and interactive content. Multimedia contrasts with media that use only rudimentary computer displays such as text-only or traditional forms of printed or hand-produced material.  - Structural film was an experimental film movement prominent in the US in the 1960s and which developed into the Structural/materialist films in the UK in the 1970s.  - In music, serialism is a method or technique of composition that uses a series of values to manipulate different musical elements. Serialism began primarily with Arnold Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique, though some of his contemporaries were also working to establish serialism as a form of post-tonal thinking. Twelve-tone technique orders the twelve notes of the chromatic scale, forming a row or series and providing a unifying basis for a composition's melody, harmony, structural progressions, and variations. Other types of serialism also work with sets, collections of objects, but not necessarily with fixed-order series, and extend the technique to other musical dimensions (often called \\"parameters\\"), such as duration, dynamics, and timbre. The idea of serialism is also applied in various ways in the visual arts, design, and architecture, and the musical concept has also been adopted in literature .  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - The Velvet Underground was an American rock band from New York City, active between 1964 and 1973. Formed by singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus Maclise (who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965), the group was briefly managed by the pop artist Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's \\"Exploding Plastic Inevitable\\" events from 1966 to 1967. Despite achieving little commercial success during its existence, the Velvet Underground is now recognized as among the most influential bands of all time for its integration of rock music with the avant-garde.   - Drone music, drone-based music, or simply drone, is a minimal music genre that emphasizes the use of sustained or repeated sounds, notes, or tone-clusters  called drones. It is typically characterized by lengthy audio programs with relatively slight harmonic variations throughout each piece. La Monte Young, one of its 1960s originators, defined it in 2000 as \\"the sustained tone branch of minimalism\\".  - Downtown music is a subdivision of American music, closely related to experimental music. The scene the term describes began in 1960, when Yoko Ono, one of the early Fluxus artists, opened her loft at 112 Chambers Street to be used as a performance space for a series curated by La Monte Young and Richard Maxfield. Prior to this, most classical music performances in New York City occurred \\"uptown\\" around the areas that the Juilliard School at Lincoln Center and Columbia University would soon occupy. Ono's gesture led to a new performance tradition of informal performances in nontraditional venues such as lofts and converted industrial spaces, involving music much more experimental than that of the more conventional modern classical series Uptown. Spaces in Manhattan that supported Downtown music from the 1960s on included the Judson Memorial Church, The Kitchen, Experimental Intermedia, Roulette, the Knitting Factory, Dance Theater Workshop, Tonic, the Gas Station, the Paula Cooper Gallery, and others. Brooklyn Academy of Music has also shown a predilection for composers from the Downtown scene.  - Anthony Schmalz \\"Tony\\" Conrad (March 7, 1940  April 9, 2016) was an American avant-garde video artist, experimental filmmaker, musician, composer, sound artist, teacher, and writer. Active in a variety of media since the early 1960s, he was a pioneer of both structural film and drone music. He performed and collaborated with a wide range of artists over the course of his career, most prominently the 1960s New York experimental music collective Theatre of Eternal Music, also known as The Dream Syndicate.  - Inside the Dream Syndicate , Vol. I : Day of Niagara or simply Day of Niagara is a 1965 album by the minimalist music group the Theatre of Eternal Music , aka the Dream Syndicate . Contributors include future Velvet Underground bassist John Cale , original Velvet Underground drummer Angus Maclise , composers La Monte Young and Tony Conrad , and Marian Zazeela .  - A poet is a person who writes poetry. Poets may describe themselves as such or be described as such by others. A poet may simply be a writer of poetry, or may perform their art to an audience.  - John Davies Cale, OBE (born 9 March 1942) is a Welsh musician, composer, singer-songwriter and record producer who was a founding member of the American experimental rock band the Velvet Underground.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - The avant-garde (from French, \\"advance guard\\" or \\"vanguard\\", literally \\"fore-guard\\") are people or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox, with respect to art, culture, and society. It may be characterized by nontraditional, aesthetic innovation and initial unacceptability, and it may offer a critique of the relationship between producer and consumer.  - Fluxus is an international and interdisciplinary group of artists, composers, designers and poets that took shape in the 1960s and 1970s. Dutch gallerist and art critic Harry Ruhé describes Fluxus as \\"the most radical and experimental art movement of the sixties\\". Fluxus is known for experimental contributions to different artistic media and disciplines. Fluxus is also known for generating art forms that were new when Fluxus artists created them. These art forms include intermedia, a term coined by Fluxus artist Dick Higgins, concept art, first developed by sometime Fluxus artist Henry Flynt, video art, first pioneered by Nam June Paik and Wolf Vostell.  - Video art is an art form which relies on moving pictures in a visual and audio medium. Video art came into existence during the late 1960s and early 1970s as new consumer video technology became available outside corporate broadcasting. Video art can take many forms: recordings that are broadcast; installations viewed in galleries or museums; works streamed online, distributed as video tapes, or DVDs; and performances which may incorporate one or more television sets, video monitors, and projections, displaying live or recorded images and sounds;.  - La Monte Thornton Young (born October 14, 1935) is an American avant-garde composer, musician, and artist generally recognized as the first minimalist composer. His works are cited as notable examples of post-war experimental and contemporary music, and were tied to New York's downtown music and Fluxus art scenes. Initially inspired by sources such as Indian classical music, serialism, and jazz, Young is perhaps best known for his pioneering work in Western drone music (originally referred to as \\"dream music\\"), prominently explored in the 1960s with the experimental music collective the Theatre of Eternal Music. He has engaged in musical and multimedia collaborations with a wide range of artists, including Tony Conrad, Pandit Pran Nath, John Cale, Terry Riley, and visual artist Marian Zazeela, with whom he developed the \\"Dream House\\" sound and light installation.  - Marian Zazeela (born April 15, 1940) is a light-artist, designer, painter and musician based in New York City. She was a member of the 1960s New York experimental music collective Theatre of Eternal Music, and is known for her collaborative work with minimalist composer La Monte Young.  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - Terrence Mitchell \\"Terry\\" Riley (born June 24, 1935) is an American composer and performing musician associated with the minimalist school of Western classical music, of which he was a pioneer. His work is deeply influenced by both jazz and Indian classical music.  - Indian classical music is a genre of South Asian music. It has two major traditions. The North Indian classical music tradition is called \\"Hindustani\\", while the South Indian expression is called \\"Carnatic\\". These traditions were not distinct till about the 16th century. There on, during the turmoils of Islamic rule period of the Indian subcontinent, the traditions separated and evolved into distinct forms. However, the two systems continue to have more common features than differences.  - Angus William MacLise (March 4, 1938  June 21, 1979) was an American percussionist, composer, poet, occultist and calligrapher, known as the first drummer for the Velvet Underground.  - In mathematics, a ratio is a relationship between two numbers indicating how many times the first number contains the second. For example, if a bowl of fruit contains eight oranges and six lemons, then the ratio of oranges to lemons is eight to six (that is, 8:6, which is equivalent to the ratio 4:3). Thus, a ratio can be a fraction as opposed to a whole number. Also, in this example the ratio of lemons to oranges is 6:8 (or 3:4), and the ratio of oranges to the total amount of fruit is 8:14 (or 4:7).

Answer the following question: Process: - Coal is put in a coal-fired steam station - Water is put in pipes in the coal-fired steam station - The coal is crushed - The coal is moved into a boiler along with hot air - The water is moving through pipes in the boiler - The steam from the water is blown against a turning mechanism - The force of the steam makes the mechanism turn - The mechanism generates electricity.  Question: suppose less coal burned happens, how will it affect LESS electricity being produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If less coal is burned in a coal-fired steam station, this will result in LESS electricity being produced. The reason for this is that burning less coal leads to a smaller amount of heat being generated, which in turn reduces the amount of steam produced from the water in the boiler. With less steam being produced, there will be less force exerted on the turning mechanism, causing it to rotate at a slower rate. This slower rotation of the mechanism directly affects the generation of electricity, leading to a reduced electrical output. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of burning less coal influences the second effect mentioned (electricity production) by causing a decrease in the amount of electricity generated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert Frost was one of America's best known and most honored serious writers. But his fame came late in his life. He was born in San Francisco, California in 1874. He lived in California during his early childhood. He was named after the chief Southern general in America's Civil War. The general's name was Robert Edward Lee. The poet was named Robert Lee Frost, because his father wanted to honor the general. Someone once asked another American writer, Ernest Hemingway, how to become a writer. The best thing, he said, was to have an unhappy childhood. If this is true, Robert Frost's childhood was unhappy enough to make him a very good writer. Robert Frost's father was a reporter who wanted to be a politician. He often drank too much wine and became angry. Robert was the victim of his anger. Robert Frost finished high school in 1891. After high school, Robert's grandfather offered to pay his costs at Dartmouth College. But Robert left the school after a few months. He did not like it. He spent the next few years working at different jobs. At one time, he worked in a factory. Later, he repaired shoes. He was a teacher. He was a reporter. Always, he wrote poetry. Robert Frost attended Harvard University for two years. After that, he returned to the many jobs he held before. For a while, Frost tried to take care of a farm in the state of New Hampshire. He was not a successful farmer. And he continued to write poetry. He said that until 1930, he earned only about ten dollars a year from writing. In 1912, he decided to try to make a new start. He took his family to Britain. The cost of living was low. In Britain, Frost found a publisher for his first book of poems. The book was called A Boy's Will. When it appeared in 1913. Frost received high praise from British readers. Praise was something he had not received in his own country. Ezra Pound, another American poet living in Britain, read the poems and liked them very much. He wrote a magazine article about Frost. He also helped get Frost's second book of poems published in America. That book was called North of Boston. 1. Who is a honored serious writer? 2. WHere did he live as a kid? 3.

Premise: \\"Cuban cigars are exceptional value for money (but U.S. residents are not allowed to bring them home).\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"U.S residents are always allowed to bring Cuban cigars into the country.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"Cuban cigars are exceptional value for money (but U.S. residents are not allowed to bring them home)\\" is true, it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"U.S residents are always allowed to bring Cuban cigars into the country.\\" In order to fully address this, let's break down both statements and analyze their logical implications. The premise consists of two separate statements: 1. Cuban cigars are exceptional value for money. 2. U.S. residents are not allowed to bring them home. Statement 1 asserts the high quality and cost-effective nature of Cuban cigars, which in itself doesn't necessarily have any legal implications or bearing on the U.S. import regulations. However, this statement contributes to understanding why someone might be interested in importing Cuban cigars in the first place. Statement 2 is what contradicts the given hypothesis. This statement clearly indicates that U.S. residents are not allowed to bring Cuban cigars home, which is a direct negation of the idea that they are always allowed to do so. Now let's examine the hypothesis: \\"U.S residents are always allowed to bring Cuban cigars into the country.\\" This statement claims that U.S. residents do not face any restrictions or limitations on bringing Cuban cigars into the country. When comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes evident that they are mutually exclusive – if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be false, and vice versa. Given that the premise is stated to be true, we can conclude that it does not entail or support the hypothesis \\"U.S residents are always allowed to bring Cuban cigars into the country.\\" The premise instead disproves the hypothesis by explicitly stating that U.S. residents are not permitted to bring Cuban cigars back home. This reinforces the idea that the importation of Cuban cigars is subject to regulations and is not universally allowed for U.S. residents. Moreover, it's important to note that this analysis is solely based on the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the legal framework around the importation of Cuban cigars and the extent of restrictions U.S. residents face, further research into the relevant laws and guidelines would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: The latest research suggests that the key factor separating geniuses from the merely accomplished is not I.Q., a generally bad predictor of success. Instead, it's purposeful practice. Top performers spend more hours practising their craft. If you wanted to picture how a typical genius might develop, you'd take a girl who possessed a slightly above average language ability. It wouldn't have to be a big talent, just enough so that she might gain some sense of distinction. Then you would want her to meet, say, a novelist, who coincidentally shared some similar qualities. Maybe the writer was from the same town, had the same family background, or shared the same birthday.  This contact would give the girl a vision of her future self. It would give her some idea of a fascinating circle who might someday join. It would also help if one of her parents died when she was 12, giving her a strong sense of insecurity and fuelling a desperate need for success. Armed with this ambition, she would read novels and life stories of writers without end. This would give her a primary knowledge of her field. She would be able to see new writing in deeper ways and quickly understand its inner workings.  Then she would practise writing. Her practice would be slow, painstaking and error-focused. By practising in this way, she delays the automating process. Her mind wants to turn conscious, newly learned skills into unconscious, automatically performed skills. By practising slowly, by breaking skills down into tiny parts and repeating, she forces the brain to internalize a better pattern of performance.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Sunlight passes through the glass into the greenhouse - The plants and floor absorb the the sunlight - The absorbed sunlight is converted to heat - The heat cannot escape the glass - The heat is trapped in the greenhouse - The hot air rises - The colder air at the top is pushed to the bottom - The colder air is then warmed by the floor and the plants.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose glass is thicker happens, how will it affect more cold air rises.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If the glass in the greenhouse is thicker, there are several potential effects on the process: 1. Insulation properties: Thicker glass generally has better insulation properties, meaning it might reduce the amount of heat loss through the glass surface. This could result in the greenhouse retaining more heat and potentially becoming warmer overall. However, this would depend on the specific type of glass used, as some types of glass transmit solar radiation more efficiently than others. 2. Transmission of sunlight: Thicker glass could potentially reduce the transmission of sunlight into the greenhouse, particularly if the glass is not optically clear. This would mean less sunlight being absorbed by the plants and floor, thus decreasing the overall heating of the greenhouse. 3. Weight and structural considerations: Thicker glass is typically heavier, which might necessitate reinforcement of the greenhouse structure to accommodate the additional weight. This could impact the overall design and construction of the greenhouse. 4. Cost: Thicker glass is generally more expensive to produce and install, which might increase the overall cost of the greenhouse. Considering the above factors, the perturbation of having thicker glass in the greenhouse could have direct and indirect effects on the process. Depending on the specific properties of the glass, the direct effects could include improved insulation and/or reduced transmission of sunlight, which might impact the temperature distribution in the greenhouse. The indirect effects might include changes to the greenhouse's structure and associated costs, which could affect the feasibility or desirability of using thicker glass. However, the overall impact of the perturbation on the process of cold air rising would still be influenced by the balance between the retention of heat due to better insulation and any reduction in sunlight transmission, which ultimately depends on the specific type and thickness of the glass involved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Zachary's parents, Alan and Nancy Cowan, visit the home of Michael and Penelope Longstreet, Ethan's parents. Their meeting is initially intended to be short, but due to various circumstances, the conversation continues to draw out. In fact, Alan and Nancy begin to leave the apartment on two occasions, but are drawn back in to further discussion. At first, the couples are friendly to each other, but their respective comments start to hurt feelings, making everyone argue with one another. Apart from fighting among themselves, the couples blame each other about who is responsible for the fight between their sons. Nancy calls the Longstreets \\"superficially fair-minded\\" and Penelope and Michael complain about Alan's arrogant and dull attitude. Everyone also gets irritated with Alan when he accepts endless business phone calls on his BlackBerry, interrupting the discussion, and showing he has more interest in his business problems than the matter at hand. Michael also receives many phone calls from his ailing mother, to his frustration.

Trump blames Assad for the attack.  A U.S. attack is likely to upset a small but growing number of U.S. lawmakers who demand President Donald Trump first ask Congress to authorize any hostilities, citing the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a federal law intended to check the president's ability to wage war. U.S. presidents, both Republican and Democrat, have long argued they have legal authority to order airstrikes and other short-term military campaigns if those engagements fall short of the \\"hostilities\\" mentioned in the War Powers Resolution.  Additionally, U.S. presidents have cited a pair of authorizations by Congress following the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks as justification for the near-constant U.S. strikes on Islamic militants around the world.  The Trump administration has used those authorizations as justification for its current war in Syria. The U.S. has 2,000 troops in Syria, and helps lead an international coalition against Islamic State in Syria and neighboring Iraq.

Hypothesis: Governor John Engler knew he was going to win the election.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it is not possible to definitively determine whether Governor John Engler knew he was going to win the 1998 Michigan gubernatorial election. While the paragraph states that John Engler, a Republican, was re-elected over Geoffrey Fieger, the Democratic nominee, it does not provide any details regarding pre-election polls, campaign strategies, public opinion, or other factors that might have influenced Engler's confidence in his chances of winning the election. Elections are influenced by numerous factors, such as the candidates' policies, debate performances, campaign financing, media coverage, and external events. Polling is often used to gauge public support for candidates during the lead-up to an election. If polling data consistently showed a significant lead for Governor Engler throughout the campaign, it could have given him a level of confidence in his eventual victory. However, without that information, we cannot draw a definite conclusion. Additionally, election results can be unpredictable, as witnessed in political upsets and unexpected turnouts throughout history. Even with robust polling data and favorable public opinion, a candidate may still be cautious about predicting their own victory. They might remain vigilant to maintain their lead or guard against complacency among their supporters. Moreover, unforeseen events or 'October surprises' can drastically change the outcome of an election. It is worth noting that the paragraph mentioned that Geoffrey Fieger was a lawyer who had represented the assisted suicide advocate Jack Kevorkian. Depending on the public's opinion of this association, it could have affected the election outcome, but the paragraph does not provide any further information on this subject.

Translate to English","output":"But first, let's delve into a bit of biological memory. The concept of biological memory refers to the ability of living organisms, including humans, to store, retain, and retrieve information vital to their survival, growth, and adaptation to the environment. Memory is essential, as it allows organisms to learn from past experiences and adjust their behavior to suit various situations. In this detailed response, we will discuss how biological memory works, its various types, and some factors that influence it. 1. How Biological Memory Works: Neurons, the basic building blocks of the nervous system, play an essential role in the formation and storage of biological memory. The process happens through synaptic connections, where the dendrites of one neuron receive information from the axons of another neuron. As the brain processes information at each neuron's synapse, it forms a neural network that retains this information. The more frequently this network is activated, the stronger the memory becomes. This phenomenon is referred to as the Hebbian theory or Hebb's rule, which states that \\"neurons that fire together wire together.\\" 2. Types of Biological Memory: Biological memory can be categorized into several types based on the duration and nature of the information stored. a. Sensory Memory: It is a very short-lived memory system that holds on to the sensory impressions of surrounding stimuli. This type of memory often lasts for just a second or less. b. Short-term Memory: This memory type can store limited amounts of information for brief periods, usually between 20 seconds to a minute. It plays a crucial role in active cognitive processes like working memory. c. Long-term Memory: This type of memory can store much more information for an extended period (sometimes even for a lifetime). Long-term memory is subdivided into explicit (declarative) and implicit (non-declarative) memory. i. Explicit Memory: This involves memories that can be consciously recalled, such as facts (semantic memory) and personal experiences or events (episodic memory).   ii. Implicit Memory: These are unconscious memories that cannot be intentionally brought to mind. Implicit memory covers procedural memory that involves learning motor or cognitive skills, classical conditioning which is associative learning, and priming, or a change in response to a stimulus due to previous exposure. 3. Factors Influencing Biological Memory: Several factors can either enhance or impair memory storage, retention, and recall, including age, stress, sleep, nutrition, and even genetics. a. Age: As humans age, the structure and function of the brain change, affecting memory performance, particularly explicit memory. b. Stress: High levels of cortisol, the stress hormone, can negatively impact memory, especially during prolonged exposure to stress. c. Sleep: Adequate sleep is vital for memory consolidation, which is the process of transferring information from short-term to long-term memory. d. Nutrition: A well-balanced diet rich in essential nutrients, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants supports optimal brain health and cognitive function, thereby positively impacting memory. e. Genetics: Certain genes may influence the development and maintenance of neural circuits responsible for memory processes. In conclusion, understanding biological memory is a fascinating and complex topic that sheds light on how organisms, including humans, store, retain, and retrieve information. It is crucial for adapting to various situations and learning from past experiences. The intricate network of neurons and their synaptic connections in the brain play a significant role in this process, creating different memory types essential for survival, growth, and adaptation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: What group may be one of the few where playing the bugle has a big role? Possible A: trumpet, military base, military band, american army, music store  Why is \\"military band\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"\\"The military band\\" is an answer that aligns with human common sense to the question \\"What group may be one of the few where playing the bugle has a big role?\\" for several reasons.  Firstly, it's important to understand the context of the bugle. The bugle is a simple brass instrument that traditionally plays a very specific role. It is used to pass along standardized instructions in a non-verbal format, particularly in a military setting. It has been historically utilized this way in many armies worldwide, given its loud sound that can efficiently communicate across large areas, especially before the invention of more modern forms of communication devises. For instance, different bugle calls are associated with specific actions or times, such as a call to wake up, a meal call, or a call to charge in battle. Considering this historical and practical significance of the bugle, the term \\"military band\\" therefore makes sense as a group where playing the bugle has a big role. Military bands exist to provide musical accompaniment for military events and ceremonies, both formal and informal. They often include bugles as part of their instrumental ensemble due to the instrument's historic connection to military life and symbolism of key parts of the military routine and discipline. In military bands, buglers often have a significant role, playing for key ceremonies, rituals, and other important occasions. While the other options like 'trumpet,' 'military base,' 'American army,' and 'music store' may also be associated with the bugle, they aren't as directly aligned in terms of common sense.  A 'trumpet' is a brass instrument, similar to a bugle, yet a distinct one and usually represents a broader musical context. A 'military base' or 'American Army' may have bugles, but these terms refer to broader entities within which bugles represent only a small aspect. A 'music store' may sell bugles, however, it does not routinely engage in playing these instruments. Therefore, the 'military band' is the most sensible common answer as it represents a group where playing the bugle indeed plays a significant and ongoing role in the band's function and tradition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Process:  - The pancreas detects chemical changes in the stomach - The pancreas creates juices that help digest food - The pancreas releases the juices into the stomach - Trypsin and chymotrypsin digest protein - Insulin is produced to move glucose from the blood - The enzymes begin producing again.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose food is digested in stomach happens, how will it affect the pancreas working SOFTER.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation, which involves food being digested in the stomach, does have an effect on the pancreas working, both directly and indirectly.  When food is digested in the stomach, the process of breaking down complex molecules into simpler ones begins. This process requires enzymes released by the pancreas, as well as other accessory organs. The pancreas plays a vital role in the digestion process, particularly in producing and releasing digestive juices and enzymes, as well as hormones like insulin that regulate blood glucose levels.  In the proposed perturbation, the digestion taking place in the stomach affects the nearby pancreas in several ways: 1. Direct effect: When the stomach detects the presence of food in need of digestion, it releases certain chemical signals that inform the pancreas of the ongoing digestion process, causing it to secrete enzymes like trypsin and chymotrypsin. These digestive enzymes help further break down proteins as the food moves towards the small intestines. If the digestion in the stomach is altered or not happening effectively, the pancreas may not receive these chemical signals normally, affecting the pancreatic enzymes' production and release. 2. Indirect effect: Another important aspect of pancreas functioning relates to the hormone insulin. Insulin is produced and released in response to elevated glucose levels in the bloodstream. The digestion of food in the stomach ultimately leads to the breakdown of carbohydrates into simple glucose molecules. If the digestion process in the stomach is hampered, the glucose levels in the bloodstream may not rise as expected, consequently affecting the production and release of insulin by pancreatic cells. Therefore, the perturbation of food digestion in the stomach can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the pancreas' functioning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the most interesting thing you have done in your life? This question aims to explore an individual's personal experience or a standout event in their life that they find most intriguing. It could be participating in a unique cultural activity, accomplishing a challenging goal, or traveling to a remarkable destination. The term \\"interesting\\" is subjective and can vary from one person to another based on their interests, preferences, and life events. The answer to this question would ideally revolve around a specific activity or event that the individual has personally experienced or participated in. 2. What is the most important thing in your life and why? This question seeks to understand an individual's values and priorities, as it asks about the significance of a particular aspect or theme in their life. It could be their career, family, relationships, personal achievements, or even personal interests and hobbies. The question delves deeper by asking the person to explain the reason behind considering it important.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If you have sleep paralysis, the area of your brain that detects threats becomes more active and overly sensitive to stimuli. The temporary paralysis is caused by this oversensitivity. To be diagnosed with sleep paralysis, you must be experiencing three of the following primary symptoms:  Inability to move: This may feel as if some outside force is causing the paralysis. Feeling fear, dread, or anxiety because of the paralysis Being consciously awake during the paralysis Clear perception of surroundings: You may notice the time, the moonlight coming in through the window, what your partner is wearing and so on. In addition to primary symptoms, you may experience these symptoms:  A sense of overwhelming fear and dread A sense of another presence Pressure on the chest Difficulty breathing Laying on your back even if that is not your preferred position Visual, olfactory (smell) or auditory (sound) hallucinations. These may be combined with the sense of another presence. A feeling of impending doom or death Studies estimate that sleep paralysis affects 5 to 40% of the population, affecting men and women of any age group, although most sleep paralysis begins during the teenage years. Risk factors for sleep paralysis include:  A family history of sleep paralysis Changing sleep schedules The existence of another sleep disorder like insomnia; narcolepsy; parasomnias such as sleepwalking or sleep talking, confusional arousals, bedwetting and sleep terrors; hypersomnias (excessive sleepiness) A history of depression, anxiety, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and bipolar disorder. These mental disorders were also associated with some of the more disturbing hallucinations. Sleep related leg cramps and Restless Leg Syndrome (RLS) Medications, including those used to treat anxiety and ADHD Drug and alcohol abuse If you don't notice a reduction in the number of sleep paralysis events within two to four weeks of trying treatment methods or you're losing significant amounts of sleep, talk with your doctor. You may even want to schedule an appointment with a sleep specialist. Sleep paralysis can be a symptom of other underlying sleep conditions or of significant psychiatric problems, but only a physician can make that determination. For example, sleep paralysis can actually be a symptom of narcolepsy, a condition with daytime drowsiness and sudden “attacks” of sleep.","output":"This article talks about sleep paralysis, which is when your brain is very sensitive and you can't move or feel scared while being awake in bed, and it affects some people more than others due to different reasons like family history or other sleep problems."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Truly the decerebrate oafs behind most films are like dogs, they return to ingest their own vomit. Well, they're 19 bucks richer now because of me. This was not at all imaginative, there was no redeeming moment, anything remotely funny was shown in the trailer (and nothing amusing was in the trailer), performances were strained (especially Molly's, totally unconvincing). What was theoretically supposed to be some comic relief was the homoerotic friend with a penchant for Disney films; none of his analogies hit home, his little moral speeches were flat, I was literally waiting for them to go on to say something meaningful, only to find out he was done. The so-called \\"hard 10\\" is the most insipid plastic creature there is (apart from having a horse-like face with a weird smile); I honestly found her friend Patty (referred to as the Hamburglar) to be much better looking than her.

Barman just wanted to make a movie because he wanted to. Just as simple as that, and he succeeded. Not only in his goal, but also in making a wonderful movie, especially visually. He knows how to use pans, slow-motion sequences, tracking shots, crane shots, etc. in a beautiful, smooth way. This gives the movie a very relaxing feel to it. The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party that they all attend to, which also is the turnpoint of this movie. The beauty of this picture lies not in the question how the characters have effect on eachother (in comparance with a similar, of course better movie like Magnolia). I simply don't think that that was Barman's idea. The beauty lies in the different details of experiences that people go through which makes or breaks their lives. Barman is very successful in telling those little stories that describe little experiences. He knows people..... and Antwerp. The soundtrack of the movie is also excellent, but not a surprise as we know that Barman is also a very succesful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS. The music is sometimes hot and at the same time relaxing which contributes to the sunny, smooth feel of the movie. Other times we hear funky pop/rock-melodies which give some scenes the strength that they need. There's only one flaw, and that's the last half an hour. Was it the runtime, which was breaking me up? Or weren't the last scenes that fresh and accurate than the scenes until then? I can't figure it out... All in all a beautiful sunny movie which lifts the Belgian cinema up. 8 out of 10! (It's the breeze that flows through a girl's hair on a sunny afternoon making her even more beautiful; it's the fresh breeze that makes you relax when it passes you at a crowded party when someone opens the door; it's the breeze that carries the perfume from that beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park who you just met a week ago; it's the breeze.....)

Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: Who holds Lucifer to his promise? Adam The answer is:","output":"Title: \\"Adam's Vow\\" Genre: Fantasy/Drama Plot: In the beginning, God casts Lucifer out of Heaven and curses him to Hell for eternity. Adam, the first human created by God, meets Lucifer in the Garden of Eden. Intrigued by Lucifer's wisdom, Adam engages in conversation with him, during which Lucifer tells Adam some of his darkest secrets. In the end, Lucifer makes Adam a promise - if Adam vows to save him from his eternal torment, Lucifer will grant him and his descendants knowledge beyond their imagination. Many years pass, and the story of Adam and Lucifer's vow becomes an age-old legend, only told in hushed whispers and only remembered by a select group known as \\"The Keepers of the Vow.\\" For centuries, descendants of Adam kept the vow by performing secret rituals to release Lucifer from his torment. However, Lucifer continues to wreak havoc on Earth, manipulating and corrupting the lives of many. The movie focuses on a modern-day descendant of Adam, named James Adamson, who learns of the vow made by his ancestor. James is a skeptical archaeologist who discovers ancient texts revealing the promise made between Adam and Lucifer. Initially, he dismisses the legend as a myth, but as he delves further into his research, inexplicable occurrences begin to unfold around him. Hunted by a secret society that seeks to control the powers that Lucifer promises, James must decide whether to accept the responsibility that comes with his lineage and fulfill the vow, or to turn his back on his ancestor's bargain. Alongside his partner Sarah, who also becomes entangled in the mystifying events, they must unravel the secrets of the ancient pact. As James and Sarah uncover the truth behind the legend, they stumble upon a long-forgotten prophecy that could change the course of humanity. Torn between fulfilling the vow and the possible consequences, James wrestles with the moral dilemma over whether he should release Lucifer and grant him the freedom he was promised. In the gripping climax, James makes a decision to confront Lucifer once more. Instead of releasing him from his torment, James sets a new condition - rather than giving unrestricted knowledge to humanity, Lucifer must use his powers for the betterment of mankind, without corruption or chaos. If Lucifer refuses, the vow remains unfulfilled, and he remains in torment. Lucifer, bound by the bloodline of Adam, has no choice but to acquiesce to James' demand. In the end, humanity benefits from the gained knowledge with newfound wisdom, and Lucifer remains trapped, awaiting another chance to manipulate his way to freedom. \\"Adam's Vow\\" is a thrilling and captivating drama, exploring themes of morality, human nature, and the power of choice, all against the backdrop of an ancient legend that echoes through the ages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- He may be a long way from the football field, but Pele at least is back to talking and getting better at a Sao Paulo, Brazil, hospital.  The city's Albert Einstein Hospital issued a statement Saturday saying the football legend -- born Edson Arantes do Nascimento -- was improving but still in intensive care battling an illness.  Pele is lucid, talking and responding to antibiotics, the hospital said. He remains on temporary dialysis, which was a reason he was moved to the ICU in the first place, because the machine he needed was there.  The hospital issued a second statement later Saturday, indicating that Pele continues to recover and that doctors plan to take him off dialysis early Sunday.  Earlier this week, the 74-year-old was admitted to the medical facility -- the same place he recently underwent surgery to remove kidney stones -- for a urinary tract infection.  The athletic icon had one kidney removed during this days as a player, his aide, Jose Fornos Rodrigues, told CNN.  Pele tweeted Thursday that he was looking forward to spending the holidays with family and starting \\"the new year with renewed health, with many international trips planned.\\"  \\"I am blessed to receive your love and support,\\" Pele said, \\"and thank God this is nothing serious.\\"  Known as \\"The Black Pearl\\" and simply \\"The King,\\" Pele is one of the best known names in all of sports.

Movie title: Bad Kids Go to Hell Context: A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day (Jeffrey Schmidt) conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. Despite receiving an expulsion notice from Headmaster Nash (Judd Nelson), a new low-income student Matt Clark (Cameron Deane Stewart) plans to compensate for his poor behavior by joining the awkward Tarek Ahmed (Marc Donato), the jock Craig Cook (Roger Edwards), the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon (Augie Duke), the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst (Amanda Alch), and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes (Ali Faulkner) in detention. After giving them the task to complete a school history assignment, Dr. Day restricts their internet reach and takes away many of their phones, leaving the students imprisoned alone in the library, remodeled by the janitor, Max (Ben Browder), with Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. They all try to break out of the library, but they are sealed in. Behaving mischievous, Veronica hides Meganâs inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having a shortness of breath and dying before itâs found. Getting the intranet (no Internet is available) to work, Veronica does her research. They discover an old, deceased Indian, Jacob Rainwater, once owned land that was stolen from the Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, before it was taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school.

He was also briefly a member of the UK Subs in 1991. He joined Rancid in 1993 after the band was searching for a second guitar player and was present on their second album \\"Let's Go\\". He has produced albums for bands such as Agnostic Front, The Business, Dropkick Murphys, Swingin Utters, Marky Ramone and the Intruders, Anti-Heros, Patriot, The Forgotten, Harrington Saints, and Pressure Point. He recently mixed Charged GBH's new album entitled \\"Perfume and Piss\\", as well as Cock Sparrer's album \\"Here We Stand\\" both alongside Michael Rosen.  - The Dropkick Murphys are an American Celtic punk band formed in Quincy, Massachusetts in 1996. The band was initially signed to independent punk record label Hellcat Records, releasing five albums for the label, and making a name for themselves locally through constant touring and yearly St. Patrick's Day week shows, held in and around Boston. The 2004 single \\"Tessie\\" became the band's first mainstream hit and one of their biggest charting singles to date. The band's final Hellcat release, 2005's \\"The Warrior's Code\\", included the song \\"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\\"; the song was featured in the 2006 Academy Award-winning movie \\"The Departed\\", and went on to become the band's only Platinum-selling single to date, and remains one of their best-known songs. The band is known for their loud, energetic live shows.  - Charged GBH, commonly known as GBH, are an English street punk band which was formed in 1978 by vocalist Colin Abrahall, guitarist Colin \\"Jock\\" Blyth, bassist Sean McCarthy (replaced by Ross Lomas by the time they had signed to Clay records) and Drummer Andy \\"Wilf\\" Williams. GBH were early pioneers of English street punk, often nicknamed \\"UK82\\", along with Discharge, Broken Bones, The Exploited and The Varukers. GBH have gone on to influence several punk rock musicians.   - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Proto-punk (or \\"protopunk\\") is the rock music played by garage bands<ref name=\\"Bangs (RS-2nd ed./Garage)\\"></ref> from the 1960s and early 1970s that presaged the punk rock movement.

Although they have never enjoyed commercial success, they are considered one of the most influential street punk bands of all time, helping pave the way for early 80's punk scene and the Oi! subgenre.

They took a hiatus from 19891993, but continued to record and play concerts through the early 2000s. Anti-Heros are one of the first and most popular American Oi! bands. The original lineup consisted of Mark Noah (vocals), Mike Jones (bass), Phil Solomon (drums) and Joe Winograd (guitar).

The main function of a kitchen is serving as a location for storing, cooking and preparing food (and doing related tasks such as dishwashing), but it may also be used for dining, entertaining and laundry.  - A chef is a highly trained and skilled professional cook who is proficient in all aspects of food preparation of a particular cuisine. The word \\"chef\\" is derived (and shortened) from the term \\"chef de cuisine\\", the director or head of a kitchen. Chefs can receive both formal training from an institution, as well as through apprenticeship with an experienced chef.     After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'harald wohlfahrt' exhibits the relationship of 'occupation'. Find the answer from the choices below.

How is \\"Bishop Magic Don Juan and Money motherfucking Mike!\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Bishop Magic Don Juan and Money motherfucking Mike!\\" can be translated as \\"Biskup Magic Don Juan a Peníze sakra Mike!\\" This translation attempts to maintain the original structure and names from the English phrase while using Czech terms to convey the meaning. Here's a breakdown of the translation: 1. \\"Bishop\\" is translated as \\"Biskup,\\" which means a religious figure within the context of the Roman Catholic Church. However, it is important to note that \\"Bishop Magic Don Juan\\" is a nickname rather than a religious title. In this case, \\"Bishop Magic Don Juan\\" is left in its original form as a personal nickname. 2. \\"and\\" is translated as \\"a,\\" which is the conjunction used to connect words or phrases in Czech. 3. \\"Money\\" is translated as \\"Peníze,\\" which is the general term for money or cash in Czech. 4. \\"motherfucking\\" is a vulgar slang term, and although there isn't a direct equivalent in Czech, \\"sakra\\" is used to convey the sense of profanity without being too offensive. In this case, \\"sakra\\" can be translated as \\"damn\\" or \\"bloody\\" in English. 5. \\"Mike\\" is a personal name and would typically remain the same in translation. However, since Czech uses a different alphabet (Latin with diacritics), the name \\"Mike\\" could be adjusted to fit the Czech pronunciation, like \\"Majk\\" or \\"Mik,\\" but it is not necessary for the understanding of the phrase. So, the final translation of \\"Bishop Magic Don Juan and Money motherfucking Mike!\\" in Czech can be \\"Bishops Magic Don Juan a Peníze sakra Mike!\\" or \\"Bishop Magic Don Juan a Peníze sakra Majk!\\" depending on your preference for the pronunciation of \\"Mike\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Pain & Gain Movie plot: The film opens with Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) running from large numbers of heavily armed policemen, only to be hit by a police cruiser. Then the story goes back in time a few months. Lugo is a schemer and recently released convict, who served time for Medicare fraud. Sun Gym owner John Mese (Rob Corddry) hires him to increase membership and make the gym more fitness based. Lugo triples the gym's membership within three months and befriends trainer Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie). Doorbal, a bodybuilder, uses steroids, which render him impotent. Lugo soon lusts after the earnings and lifestyle achieved by a new gym member he begins to train: Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub), who Lugo believes is a crook. Inspired by motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong), Lugo decides to be a \\"doer\\" and hatches a plan to extort Kershaw for his assets by kidnapping and torturing him.Lugo recruits accomplices Doorbal and Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson), a recently released cocaine-addicted convict who has turned to religion. Though Doyle is reluctant to join the team, he soon caves in after a violent altercation with his priest. This \\"Sun Gym gang\\" unsuccessfully attempts to kidnap Kershaw at home, but incapacitate him with a taser outside his deli and take him to a small warehouse he owns (which is stocked with sex toys). The kidnappers disguise their voices, but Kershaw identifies Lugo from his distinctive cologne. The scheme goes as planned otherwise: Kershaw makes calls, under duress, to provide fake explanations for his disappearance, gets his family to move out of state, and signs the documents which transfer his assets to Lugo. Lugo even bribes John Mese to notarize documents in Kershaw's absence, by presenting documents signed by Kershaw and using Kershaw's money to sponsor the Sun Gym.The Sun Gym gang is able to collect Kershaw's money and assets, but they realize releasing him is a bad idea. Therefore, Lugo concocts a plan to kill Kershaw by forcing him to drink liquor and crash his BMW, making it look like a drunken... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Pain & Gain,\\" Adrian Doorbal, played by Anthony Mackie, is impotent because of his use of anabolic steroids. Steroids are synthetic substances that mimic the male hormone testosterone. While they can help in building muscle mass and improving physical performance, they also come with side effects, including impotence. Impotence, in this case, refers to the inability to achieve or maintain an erection that is firm enough for sexual intercourse. The use of anabolic steroids can result in hormonal imbalances, which in turn cause erectile dysfunction. This side effect occurs because steroids interfere with the normal production of testosterone in the body. Doorbal's impotence in the film serves as a character element that adds complexity to his situation and motivations throughout the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make sure wherever you choose to put it is not very hairy and won't get rubbed too much by your clothes.  Don't put the patch on your breasts or anywhere where you have a rash or irritated skin. To prevent the adhesive from irritating your skin over time, plan to change the location every time you put on a new patch. Depending on what you’re wearing, it may be visible if you put it on the outside of your upper arm. Put it on your butt cheek or back if you don’t want it to show. Use soap and water to wash your skin where you want to place the patch. Dry your skin completely with a towel so there's no moisture getting between your skin and the sticky adhesive.  Don't use any lotion, oil, powder, or other skincare products on your skin—wait until after the patch is on to moisturize (and skip the area where the patch is). It's okay to put the patch over skin that's slightly hairy—natural peach fuzz is fine. If there’s thick, coarse hair in the area, shave it before you wash your skin and apply the patch. Use your fingers to carefully tear open the individual package. Slide the patch out and check to make sure it's in good shape. If the patch is torn, punctured, or if the two clear layers are missing on the adhesive side, throw it out and open another package. Use your finger to peel away one of the plastic layers on the adhesive side of the patch. Throw away the plastic layer. Once you open the patch you need to use it immediately so the sticky material doesn't get dirty. Hold the patch over where you want to put it and stick it on. At this point, only half the sticky part should be exposed so the patch is half stuck to your skin. Then, use your fingers to peel off the remaining adhesive protector on the other side of the patch. Be careful not to touch the sticky part with your fingers. Once the patch is on, use your palm or fingers to press down so it's securely on your skin. Hold it there for 10 seconds. If you see any air pockets or folds, iron those out with your fingers as best you can. Look at the patch and make sure the edges aren't folding up or air pockets haven't formed. It's meant to stay on for 1 week so you shouldn't have an issue with it coming unstuck.  If it does come slightly unstuck at the corners, mash it down with your fingers to keep it on. You can bathe, swim, and play sports while you’re wearing the patch—the adhesive is super durable. If your patch happens to fall off at any time, you can reapply it to your skin if the adhesive is still sticky or replace it with a new patch.","output":"The article provides detailed instructions on choosing the appropriate location for applying a skin patch, preparing the skin, and ensuring the patch is securely and properly applied, considering potential visibility, avoiding irritation, and allowing for bathing and physical activities without disrupting the patch's effectiveness."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Evangeline calls him a liar, then jumps, hanging herself -- and also causing her head to rip off and bounce down the stairs. Louis stares over the balcony...as his eyes switch to a demonic shade of orange. Cut to present day: a girl named Maddie goes to a party held by Angela Feld with her friends Lily and Suzanne. She realizes her ex-boyfriend Colin is there, dealing drugs. Also there is Lily's ex-boyfriend Dex and his friend Jason. At the party, Angela prompts everyone to go wild, as she must make money off the party or she will have to live on the streets. Lily and Dex eventually reunite, while Suzanne becomes incredibly drunk. Maddie goes to the toilet, only to have a hand grab her through the mirror. They pass it off as an elaborate trick placed by Angela. Police break up the party. Panicked, Colin stuffs his drugs into a grate to hide it from the police before leaving.

News article: 3 tips for crafting tempting offers that sellers will love It's like striking gold: After hours of scouring homes for sale in Atlanta, GA, or Seattle, WA, you've found the house of your dreams. In fact, you went home last night and played a little game of Where Does the Sofa Go? But before you can say \\"home sweet home,\\" there's an offer to be made (and accepted). While these three tips won't guarantee that your offer will be chosen, they will help you be competitive, and you'll be one step closer to landing your dream home. Subscribe for house hunting tips, hot new listings, and real estate must-reads. * A valid email address is required. * That email address is already in use. Please log in to update your email preferences. * Something went wrong. Sign up with a valid email address to continue. If you think your dream home's listing price is just a place to begin negotiations, think again. First, have a conversation with your real estate agent and look together for similar homes and recent sales in the area. You can do a little sleuthing on your own by searching Trulia for sold homes — just be sure to choose a time frame within the past three months for the most accurate results. Looking at comparable homes will give you a better idea of the seller's asking price in relation to similar properties and can help you shape your offer based on property-specific amenities and location. Next, you should decide how you'll pay for your purchase: cash or financing. Cash offers can sometimes command a lower selling price since there aren't mortgage details to sort through and the sale should close faster. If you're using financing but can offer a quick close (less than 30 days), take that into consideration in your offer price — your real estate agent may be able to leverage a quick close to sweeten the deal. If you're thinking of submitting a lowball offer, engage in a candid conversation with your real estate agent. Agents know the market well and might even know a thing or two about the listing agent through previous sales. There are certain times when a lowball offer might start favorable negotiations, but there are many others when such an offer can derail the reality of landing your dream home. If you decide to submit an offer substantially below the listing price, be prepared for a negotiation process — or a flat-out \\"no.\\" When you're ready to make your offer, back it up with everything the seller needs to know. You want the seller to believe that yours is the one offer to look at twice. Be sure to include completed offer paperwork with signatures where they belong, and make sure you're asking for seller concessions that make sense for the market. Maybe you're looking to have some of your closing costs covered. Perhaps you just want the old, worn-out carpeting replaced. Asking for seller concessions is a normal part of the offer process, but you need to know what you can reasonably expect. If you're in a competitive bidding situation, odds are that the seller is going to choose the offer requiring the least amount of work on the seller's part. Work with your real estate professional to make a list of \\"musts\\" and \\"would like\\" items for the sellers to tackle. You can put these concessions side by side with your offer price and see what makes for the most compelling deal. Bottom line: If you're negotiating and something's got to give, consider your requested concessions to stay competitive.

If you're financing, you will have a purchase ceiling from your mortgage lender, but when the perfect home comes along, it's easy for heartstrings to overrule good financial sense. Ask yourself realistically, how much can you comfortably carry as a mortgage payment each month? How much is that home really worth? How long do you plan on staying in the home, and does that justify a higher-than-asking price?

More from Trulia How to avoid HOA Drama and Red Tape 4 signs your mortgage payment is about to go up 6 insiders reveal secrets every house hunter should know What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article gives 3 tips for people who want to make good offers on a house they love, so the house seller will be more likely to accept their offer. 1. First, you should look at similar houses in the area that have been sold recently, to get an idea of how much they are worth. This will help you make a more realistic offer on the house you like. 2. Think about how you will pay for the house - either with cash or by borrowing money. Cash offers can sometimes have a lower price because they are quicker and easier for the seller. 3. When making your offer, include everything the seller needs to know, like completed paperwork, and ask for any things you want the seller to do, like fixing the carpet. Be prepared to negotiate or have your offer rejected if it's too low. Remember to be realistic about how much you can afford and how long you plan to live in the home when setting your maximum price."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Relatives of a dying lady I was caring for kicking and screaming not to give their Mum pain relief because they were so terrified / knew it would probably be the thing to end her life. She had a horrible aggressive cancer that ravaged her whole body and needed very regular doses of strong pain relief which - as she had a terminal illness and was receiving end of life care - did not have an upper limit so to speak. She had pain relief as and when needed to make her comfortable and that often results in people ultimately overdosing. Mum had Alzheimer's and was howling and writhing in agony so we were giving her pain relief but daughters knew it would probably result in her death - which they were right about possibly happening and in their grief and panic, started trying to prevent us from doing anything. Didn’t want us getting near her at all and we had to go through an awful scenario of trying to explain what we had to do for Mum and why and when they still wouldn’t have it or allow us near, we had to do what nobody wants and go against their wishes by administering the pain relief anyway. One daughter screamed the place down, threatened to have me arrested and struck off / said she would go to the papers and tell them about how we killed her Mum and in the end she had to be removed from the bedroom. Her Mum was given the pain relief, immediately relaxed and fell asleep then died peacefully in her sleep about 15 mins later. The saddest thing is her daughter wasn’t able to be there and see her Mum dropping off so peacefully and her last memory will forever be of her screaming and thrashing about as she (daughter) was physically removed from the room.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What did Reznor think he should have just written himself? ?  A remix album, titled Year Zero Remixed, was released in November 2007. Due to the expiration of his contract with Interscope Records, the album's release, marketing, and promotion were completely in Reznor's control. The album features remixes from artists including The Faint, Ladytron, Bill Laswell, Saul Williams, Olof Dreijer of The Knife, and Sam Fogarino of Interpol. Reznor himself strongly supports fan-made remixes of songs from the album, as evidenced by his decision to upload every song in multi-track form to the then-newly launched Nine Inch Nails remix website.  Instrumental versions of the songs on Year Zero are available at the site for download in multiple formats, including MP3, WAV, GarageBand, and Ableton Live formats. A planned film adaption of Year Zero became a television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched the idea to television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is \\"still churning along\\", and that he had begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an \\"Ask Me Anything\\" session on Reddit on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was \\"currently in a holding state\\" and explained, \\"We [Reznor and Sheridan] didn't find the right match with a writer, and really have been avoiding doing what we should have done from the beginning: write it ourselves. [...] This project means a lot to me and will see the light of day in one form or another.\\" In 2017, during an interview promoting new Nine Inch Nails EP Add Violence, Reznor said that \\"They got so far as hiring a writer for it, but then it fell to shit because we never had the right writer. I should have just done it [myself].\\" A:","output":"Reznor thought he should have just written the script for the Year Zero miniseries himself. He expressed this sentiment in a 2017 interview, mentioning that they had hired a writer for the project, but it didn't work out since they never found the right fit.

One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: What color do you like best? Do you like yellow, orange and red? If you do, you must be an optimist, a leader, or an active person who enjoys life, people and excitement. Do you prefer grey and blue? Then you are probably quiet, shy and you would rather follow than lead. If you love green, you are likely to be strong-minded and determined. You wish to succeed and want other people to see you are successful. At least this is what psychologists  tell us. They have been seriously studying the meaning of color preference, and the effects that colors have on human beings. They tell us that we don't choose our favorite color as we grow up. If you happen to love brown, you do so as soon as you open your eyes, or at least as soon as you could see clearly. Black is while light and bright colors make people not only happier but more active. A yellow room makes us feel more cheerful and more comfortable than a dark green one does, and a red dress adds warmth and cheer to sad winter days. It is a fact that factory workers work better, harder and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark grey. Remember, then, that if you feel low, you can always brighten your day or your life with a few colorful things. Also remember that you will know your friends (and your enemies) better when you find out what colors they like and dislike. And don't forget that anyone can guess a lot about you when you choose a piece of handkerchief. Question: 68. Why are machines painted orange in some factories, according to the passage? Options: A: Because workers tend to prefer orange to other colors. B: Because other colors are forbidden in factories. C: Because less accidents happen due to the introduction of orange machines. D: Because orange machines are easier to clean.","output":"The correct answer is C: Because less accidents happen due to the introduction of orange machines. According to the passage, factory workers work better, harder, and have fewer accidents when their machines are painted orange rather than black or dark grey. This suggests that the choice of orange as the color for machines in some factories is related to improving safety and efficiency among the workers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The situation reached a crisis on May 7, 1963. Breakfast in the jail took four hours to distribute to all the prisoners. Seventy members of the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce pleaded with the protest organizers to stop the actions. The NAACP asked for sympathizers to picket in unity in 100 American cities. Twenty rabbis flew to Birmingham to support the cause, equating silence about segregation to the atrocities of the Holocaust. Local rabbis disagreed and asked them to go home. The editor of The Birmingham News wired President Kennedy and pleaded with him to end the protests. Fire hoses were used once again, injuring police and Fred Shuttlesworth, as well as other demonstrators. Commissioner Connor expressed regret at missing seeing Shuttlesworth get hit and said he \\"wished they'd carried him away in a hearse\\". Another 1,000 people were arrested, bringing the total to 2,500. News of the mass arrests of children had reached Western Europe and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union devoted up to 25 percent of its news broadcast to the demonstrations, sending much of it to Africa, where Soviet and U.S. interests clashed. Soviet news commentary accused the Kennedy administration of neglect and \\"inactivity\\". Alabama Governor George Wallace sent state troopers to assist Connor.  Attorney General Robert Kennedy prepared to activate the Alabama National Guard and notified the Second Infantry Division from Fort Benning, Georgia that it might be deployed to Birmingham.No business of any kind was being conducted downtown.

Here is a premise: \\"A mean old woman waiting for her pancakes.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"A lady shares her pancakes with everyone.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise, which states that there is a \\"mean old woman waiting for her pancakes,\\" does not directly provide enough information to determine whether the hypothesis, \\"A lady shares her pancakes with everyone,\\" is true or false. However, we can evaluate the premise and hypothesis by analyzing different aspects of the information provided and consider any assumptions we may need to make. First, let's analyze the premise: 1. The woman is described as mean - This may suggest that she has a tendency to behave unkindly or unfairly towards others. However, being mean does not inherently mean she will not share her pancakes. 2. The woman is described as old - We can infer that she may have acquired certain behaviors or perspectives throughout her life that contribute to her being mean. Nonetheless, her age alone does not indicate whether she shares her pancakes or not. 3. The woman is waiting for her pancakes - This suggests that she has not received her pancakes yet, which means she has not yet had the opportunity to share them. However, this does not comment on whether she will share them once she has them. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: \\"A lady shares her pancakes with everyone\\" - This statement seems to contradict the premise that the woman is mean since sharing food with everyone could be perceived as a kind or generous act. However, from the premise, we cannot confirm whether this hypothesis is true or false, as the premise does not provide any information about the woman sharing her pancakes or not. In conclusion, the premise alone does not confirm or refute the hypothesis. The mean old woman waiting for her pancakes could potentially choose to share them with everyone once she receives them. On the other hand, she might not share the pancakes, which would align more closely with her mean behavior. To determine the validity of the hypothesis, we would need more information about the woman, her actions, motivations, or context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I came to NEW PORT SOUTH expecting a surrogate movie about the Columbine school massacre similar to Gus Van Sant's ELEPHANT and certainly the synopsis in the TV guide stating that a student sociopath rebels against the system did give me that impression but this is a very boring movie where little happens so consider yourself warned  The story is about Maddox , a Chicago high school student who decides to strike back at what he perceives to be an authoritarian regime . The major problem is that the character is underwritten and the actor who plays him Blake Shields is unable to embellish any script deficiencies . You have the gut feeling that Maddox should have the evil charisma of Hitler , Saddam or Bin Laden but he never comes across as anything more than a petulant truculent teenager and it's impossible to believe he could rally any disciples . The subtext of you overthrow one manipulative authoritarian regime only to replace it with another manipulative regime is too obvious which means NEW PORT SOUTH is an entirely unconvincing drama that's not worth going out of your way to see Choose your answer.

The world will never have enough of this wonderful tale. The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale. This cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editing. This Cinderella story is more like an Ugly Duckling that never hatches or rather, is never transformed into a swan. All the production value that money can buy, cannot purchase good cinematic timing and dramatic development - or good acting. The entrance of Cinderella at the ball as so poorly done, there was no drama of anticipation nor excitement of discovery. The writing made me very nervous, too. The Prince Charming was the most undesirable of memory. Why would any girl want to marry a boorish, self-absorbed prince who disliked women?  Turner's turn on the Stepmother role was an embarrassingly painful showing that demonstrated one-liners more than acting nuance. Even the Cinderella part held little interest or sympathy. Perhaps only one sentence will describe this attempt: So cheaply '90's, What MUST be mentioned and mentioned in shameful excess is the glorious photography, matte work and production design. It was a pleasure to peruse the landscapes, sets and settings as the story unfolded. For some Cinderella storytelling, go for two gems: 1) Rodgers and Hammerstein's Cinderella Musical with Lesley Ann Warren. Even with the obvious stagey TV - 60's look to the sets, this is the best version on celluloid - bar none. An all star cast makes every effort to provide the highest entertainment. Engaging, diverting and memorable writing and music. This is the classic. 2) Ever After- this Drew Barrymore gem maintains the historical perspective, alters the story line but not enough to derail the effective development of the salient points of this classic tale. The characters of the principals and of all of the supporting roles were written smartly and acted well. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"This review is mostly negative because the reviewer didn't like the new version of the Cinderella story.

He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Natural philosophy or philosophy of nature (from Latin \\"philosophia naturalis\\") was the philosophical study of nature and the physical universe that was dominant before the development of modern science. It is considered to be the precursor of natural science.  - The Quinarian system was a method of zoological classification which had a brief period of popularity in the mid 19th century, especially among British naturalists. It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup. Swainson's work on ornithology gave wide publicity to the idea. The system had opponents even before the publication of Charles Darwin's \\"On the Origin of Species\\" (1859 ) which paved the way for evolutionary trees.  - Johann Jakob Kaup ( April 10 , 1803 - July 4 , 1873 ) was a German naturalist .

He was born at Darmstadt. After studying at Göttingen and Heidelberg he spent two years at Leiden, where his attention was specially devoted to the amphibians and fishes. He then returned to Darmstadt as an assistant in the grand ducal museum, of which in 1840 he became inspector. In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines. The extensive fossil deposits in the neighbourhood of Darmstadt gave him ample opportunities for palaeontological inquiries, and he gained considerable reputation by his \\"Beiträge zur näheren Kenntniss der urweltlichen Säugethiere\\" (18551862). He also wrote \\"Classification der Säugethiere und Vögel\\" (1844), and, with Heinrich Georg Bronn, \\"Die Gavial-artigen Reste aus dem Lias\\" (18421844).  - William Sharp Macleay or McLeay (21 July 1792  26 January 1865) was a British civil servant and entomologist.

The name Connecticut originates from the Mohegan-Pequot word, \\"Quinnehtukqut,\\" which means, \\"beside the long tidal river.\\" This native origin, along with its unique spelling and pronunciation, makes it a challenging name for some people to spell correctly. Comparing the options provided: 1. New Jersey: The spelling of New Jersey is relatively straightforward, as it is composed of two familiar words. Named after the English Channel Island of Jersey in honor of Sir George Carteret's defense of the island during the English Civil War, the state's name does not present significant challenges in spelling or pronunciation. 2. New York: Similar to New Jersey, the spelling of New York is quite simple. It was named in honor of the Duke of York, who later became King James II of England, upon the capture and renaming of the Dutch colony of New Amsterdam. Being one of the most famous states in the US, its name is widely known and recognized. 3. Minnesota: While Minnesota may be a slightly more difficult name to spell than New Jersey or New York due to its Native American origin from the Dakota word \\"Mnisota,\\" it has become a familiar name for many since it is widely mentioned in various contexts such as national sports teams and other cultural references. 4.

Connecticut: As mentioned earlier, the name Connecticut is derived from a native term and its spelling is not as apparent when compared to others on the list.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Splitting the nucleus of an atom produces a massive amount of what type of energy?   A: The answer is:","output":"Splitting the nucleus of an atom produces a massive amount of nuclear energy. This process is known as nuclear fission, and it involves breaking the nucleus of a heavy atom, such as uranium or plutonium, into two or more smaller nuclei called fission fragments. The energy released in this process comes from the conversion of a small amount of the mass of the atom into energy, as explained by Einstein's famous equation, E=mc².  Nuclear fission generates an enormous amount of energy in the form of heat and radiation because the strong nuclear forces that hold the nucleus together are overcome, releasing the binding energy that holds the protons and neutrons together in the nucleus. This energy is several orders of magnitude greater than that released in chemical reactions, such as burning fossil fuels. Nuclear power plants use controlled nuclear fission reactions to produce electricity. This is achieved by using the heat generated from the fission process to produce steam, which then drives turbines connected to electric generators. Nuclear energy is considered a highly efficient and low-carbon power source, but it also comes with potential safety and waste management concerns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because if more than 5 red squares existed in any row, the total would exceed 10, which contradicts the assumption.          Let's evaluate in terms of a (9 times 2) block.      2. **Counting the red squares, consider blocks forming an (9 times 9) grid:**     - Each (9 times 2) block has a maximum of 10 red squares under our assumption.     - Recall that the board is composed of overlapping (2 times 2) blocks.

The probability that explorer ( j ) does not receive any advice from these ( j-1 ) older explorers is given by the probability that there are no friendships with them.

For any x_1, x_2 in the domain, when x_1 neq x_2, frac{f(x_1) - f(x_2)}{x_1 - x_2} < 0. This can be rewritten as (x_1 - x_2)(f(x_1) - f(x_2)) < 0. Therefore, when x_1 < x_2, it follows that f(x_1) > f(x_2), indicating that the function is monotonically decreasing. Let's analyze each function based on these criteria: ① For f(x) = x^2, we see that f(-x) = (-x)^2 = x^2 = f(x), which means f(x) is an even function, not satisfying the first condition for being an odd function.

Therefore, the total probability that Player B takes the second shot is: P = 0.5 times 0.4 + 0.5 times 0.8 = 0.2 + 0.4 = 0.6. So, the probability that Player B takes the second shot is boxed{0.6}.  Part 2: Probability that Player A Takes the i-th Shot Let P_{n} represent the probability that Player A takes the n-th shot. The probability that Player A takes the (n+1)-th shot can be expressed in terms of P_{n} as follows: P_{n+1} = 0.6P_{n} + 0.2(1 - P_{n}) = 0.4P_{n} + 0.2. This can be rearranged to show the relationship between consecutive probabilities: P_{n+1} - frac{1}{3} = 0.4(P_{n} - frac{1}{3}). Given that P_{1} = 0.5, we find that P_{1} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} neq 0. This indicates that the sequence {P_{n} - frac{1}{3}} forms a geometric sequence with the first term frac{1}{6} and common ratio 0.4. Therefore, we have: P_{n} - frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1}. Solving for P_{n} gives us: P_{n} = frac{1}{3} + frac{1}{6} times left(frac{2}{5}right)^{n-1}.

To find the expected number of times Player A shoots in the first n shots, denoted as E(Y), we sum up the probabilities from 1 to n: E(Y) = P_{1} + P_{2} + ldots + P_{n} = frac{1}{6}sum_{i=1}^{n}left(frac{2}{5}right)^{i-1} + frac{n}{3}.

Since (B), (O), and (D) are collinear, it follows that (B), (X), (O), (Y), and (D) are all collinear. Thus, (X), (O), and (Y) are collinear. 8.

Add the remaining digits of A to Z.    - The sums of Y and Z will be equal; hence, the number x is special. Since the presence of at least eight 0s and eight 1s ensures the number is special provided the sum of all digits is even, and given the even distribution of digits in a large random number, the probability that a number is special approaches (frac{1}{2}) due to the balancing effect described. # Conclusion: [ boxed{frac{1}{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given f(x) = x^2  2mx + 6 is a decreasing function on (infty, 1], then the range of m is.","output":"The function f(x) = x^2 - 2mx + 6 is a quadratic function that opens upwards.

Show that at least one root of P is rational.","output":"Given (P, Q) are non-zero polynomials with integer coefficients such that (operatorname{deg}(P) > operatorname{deg}(Q)). We are to show that at least one root of (P) is rational if the polynomial (p cdot P + Q) has a rational root for an infinite number of prime numbers (p). 1. **Identifying Rational Roots**:    Let (p) be a prime number, and let (r_p) be a rational root of (p P + Q). Since ( operatorname{deg}(P) > operatorname{deg}(Q) ), the dominant term in (P) will eventually outweigh those in (Q) as (x) increases. 2. **Controlling the magnitude of the roots**:    There exists an integer (M) such that for all (x) satisfying (|x| > M), we have    [    |P(x)| > |Q(x)|    ]    Consequently,    [    p |P(x)| > |Q(x)|    ]    Using the triangle inequality, we get    [    |p P(x) - Q(x)| > 0    ]    This implies that there are no roots for (|x| > M) when (p P(x) - Q(x) = 0). 3. **Bounding the roots**:    Hence, the rational root (r_p) must satisfy (|r_p| leq M).  4. **Application of Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem**:    By the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem, there exists a subsequence ( left(r_{phi(p)}right) ) for some strictly increasing function (phi: mathbb{N} to mathbb{P}) such that ( left(r_{phi(p)}right) ) converges to a limit (r). We aim to show that (r) is rational. 5. **Assumptions and goal**:    Suppose (r neq 0). We wish to show that the irreducible denominators of ( r_{phi(n)} ) are bounded. If their denominators are bounded by some positive integer (k), then the sequence ( k! r_{phi(n)} ) would be integer-valued and convergent, hence eventually constant. Therefore, ( left(r_{phi(n)} right)_{n geq 0} ) would be stationary and rational. 6. **Denominators not bounded case**:    Assume the irreducible denominators of ( r_{phi(n)} ) are unbounded. Without loss of generality, assume the denominator tends to ( +infty ). 7. **Behavior of the denominators**:    The denominator of (r_p) must divide (p times a) (where (a neq 0) is the leading coefficient of (P)). Since the denominator tends to (infty), it cannot divide the constant term (b) of (P) for large (n), hence it must be a multiple of (p). 8. **Expressing rational root**:    Let (p = phi(n)). Denote ( s_p in mathbb{Z} ) such that    [    r_p = frac{s_p}{p f_n}    ]    Here, ( p f_n ) is the denominator. Since ( r_p ) divides (f_n cdot (b p + c)), there exists ( t_p in mathbb{Z} ) such that    [    s_p t_p = (b p + c) f_n    ] 9. **Simplifying the expression**:    Thus,    [    t_{phi(n)} = frac{(b p + c) f_n}{s_p} = frac{(p b + c)}{p r_p} = frac{1}{r_p phi(n)} left( b + frac{c}{phi(n)} right)    ]    As (n to infty),    [    t_{phi(n)} to frac{b}{r}    ]    Hence, the sequence (left(t_{phi(n)}right)) is an integer-valued convergent sequence, so it is stationary.

Jerome wants to place the frogs such that no two frogs are ever at the same intersection point at the same time. (a) Prove that Jerome can always do this if ( n ) is odd. (b) Prove that Jerome can never do this if ( n ) is even.","output":"# Part (a) Let's prove that Jeromos can always place the frogs such that they never land on the same intersection point at the same time when n is odd. 1. **Initial Setup**:    Consider a large circle that includes all the line segments within it. Extend all segments so that their endpoints lie on the circle. By definition, no new intersections are created when extending the segments because every two segments intersect exactly once, and three segments never meet at a single point. 2. **Point Classification**:    Classify each endpoint as either an entry or exit point:    - Entry point: Where the frogs start.    - Exit point: The other endpoint of the segment.    Since there are n segments, there will be n entry and n exit points. 3. **No Adjacent Entry Points**:    Assume there are two adjacent entry points on the circle. Let these entry points correspond to the segments A and B. Consider the shape formed by the parts of A and B that connect at their intersection, and a circle arc between the two entry points, with no other entry or exit points in between (denote this shape by X).    Since X is convex, any other segment must either intersect the boundary of X at zero or exactly two points. Therefore, each segment within X must intersect both A and B exactly once. 4. **Equal number of Intersections**:    As frogs jump from entry to exit points, they will not change direction. If they start at entry points and jump n-1 times, they will reach exit points. So, no two frogs will encounter the same point at the same time if positioned correctly.    Thus, if two segments A and B are the boundary of X, there must be equal frogs on either side of these segments, meaning they must have an equal number of intersections. 5. **Odd Segments**:    Assume there's an odd number n. Assign one entry and one exit such that entry and exit points alternate around the circle. Given an odd number, this arrangement ensures segments intersect without coinciding at intersections within X.    Therefore, Jeromos can always position the frogs such that they will not land on the same intersection point at the same time when n is odd. **Conclusion**: Jeromos can always arrange the frogs appropriately when n is odd. [ boxed{text{Part (a) proved}} ] # Part (b) Let's prove that Jeromos cannot arrange the frogs such that they never land on the same intersection point at the same time when n is even. 1. **Contradiction Setup**:    Assume that Jeromos can place the frogs such that they never land on the same intersection point at the same time for an even n. For an even n, each segment intersects all the other segments, creating n-2 intersections. 2. **Segment Orientation**:    Each segment has its endpoints classified as entry or exit. Since n is even, both endpoints on either side of a segment must be of the same type because dividing an even number by 2 results in a pair.    When frogs start and one side of the entry points (all segments collectively), they meet at intersections proportionate to jumps. Given n-1 jumps and intersections inherently, at some point, must align due to parity. 3. **Impossible Equal Division**:    Given an even n, if the two endpoints are of the same type, they inherently divide segments equally. This point leads to unavoidable overlaps. 4. **Contradiction in Placement**:    Arranging entries and exits alternates and given an even number leads to parity misalignment; thereby, making some frogs meet at the same intersection point after some jumps. This results in collision inevitability. **Conclusion**: For an even n, Jeromos cannot place the frogs appropriately to avoid overlap at intersections.

Each cell ((i, j)) represents whether the (i)-th girl and the (j)-th boy solved a particular problem. 2. **Analyze each row (girls):**    Since each girl solves at most 6 problems, each row in this table can have at most 6 columns marked (indicating problems solved by that girl). 3. **Analyze each column (boys):**    Similarly, for each boy, each column can have at most 6 rows marked (indicating problems solved by that boy). 4. **Total number of solved problems:**    If each girl and boy solves at most 6 problems, the total number of cells marked in the 21x20 table is:    [    T leq 6 times 21 = 126 quad text{(for girls)}    ]    [    T leq 6 times 20 = 120 quad text{(for boys)}    ]    Thus, at most 246 cells can be marked in total considering both constraints. 5. **Counting the number of solutions:**    Let’s consider the number of problems.

By symmetry, the probability of getting fewer heads than tails is equal to the probability of getting fewer tails than heads. 2. Denote the probability of getting fewer heads than tails as x. Then, there are three possibilities: getting fewer heads than tails, getting fewer tails than heads, or getting an equal number of both.        So, the equation becomes 2x + y = 1 where y = Pr(text{4 heads, 4 tails}). 3. The total number of equally likely outcomes from flipping 8 coins is 2^8 = 256. 4. The number of ways to get exactly 4 heads (and thus 4 tails) out of 8 flips is given by the binomial coefficient: binom{8}{4} = 70.    Therefore, y = frac{70}{256} = frac{35}{128}. Substituting y into the equation: [ 2x + frac{35}{128} = 1 ] [ 2x = 1 - frac{35}{128} = frac{128}{128} - frac{35}{128} = frac{93}{128} ] [ x = frac{93}{128} times frac{1}{2} = frac{93}{256} ] Thus, the probability that Logan gets fewer heads than tails when flipping 8 coins is boxed{frac{93}{256}}."},{"instruction":"The maximum value of the function f(x) = 2cos x + sin x is ______.","output":"**Analysis:**   This question examines the auxiliary angle formula and the properties of the sine function.

Conclusion: The total number of valid smooth numbers divisible by 6 in the given range is 57.
