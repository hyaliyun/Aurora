Considering their allocated budget for home improvement, the couple saw this sale as an excellent opportunity to get more value for their money while still improving their home's comfort, aesthetics, and functionality. Secondly, the couple recognized that a hot tub would provide them with more opportunities for relaxation and bonding compared to a regular bathtub.

The LAPD is currently on the lookout for the suspect, who should not be too hard to find, given his unique attire and recent injuries. According to the LA Times, the incident began when the unidentified man in a Lakers uniform approached the security guard and asked for directions. After engaging in this brief conversation, the man suddenly pulled out an assault pistol and ordered the guard to get down on the ground. Fearing for his life, the security guard complied and handed over his wallet when demanded by the assailant. However, the situation took an unexpected turn when the mugger, in his haste to make off with the wallet, took a moment to check the contents for cash. Seizing this opportunity, the security guard turned the tables by grabbing the gun from the unsuspecting perpetrator and striking him in the head with a heavy flashlight he had on hand. LAist reports that the blow to the head left the assailant dazed, giving the guard enough time to take control of the situation. In the confusion that ensued, the Lakers-clad mugger managed to escape from the scene of the crime, but not before leaving behind a significant amount of blood from his injuries. Police are now following this trail of evidence, working to identify the suspect using fingerprints left on the gun and DNA collected from the blood. In the meantime, they are also asking for the public's help in locating the suspect. An LAPD spokesperson commented on the case, stating, \\"We'll try to identify the suspect by prints off the gun and DNA from his blood. In the meantime, maybe someone remembers seeing a guy in a bloody Lakers uniform with a gash on his head.\\" This unusual crime has generated a buzz in Los Angeles, as both Lakers fans and non-fans alike are baffled by the perpetrator's choice of outfit for such a bold attempt at robbery. While the circumstances surrounding the crime remain somewhat unclear, the security guard's quick thinking may serve as a lesson to would-be criminals considering following in the Lakers-clad mugger's footsteps. As the search for the suspect continues, we can only hope that he is brought to justice soon. Until then, the people of Los Angeles will no doubt be casting a wary glance at anyone donning a Lakers uniform in the near future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The C.I.A. made the assessment based on the crown prince’s control of Saudi Arabia, which is such that the killing would not have taken place without his approval, and has buttressed its conclusion with two sets of crucial communications: intercepts of the crown prince’s calls in the days before the killing, and calls by the kill team to a senior aide to the crown prince.

The agency has passed that assessment on to lawmakers and Trump administration officials.      The change in C.I.A. thinking came as new information emerged, officials said. The evidence included an intercept showing a member of the kill team calling an aide to Prince Mohammed and saying “tell your boss” that the mission was accomplished.

Article: North Korea workers fail to turn up at Kaesong      More than 120 South Korean firms operate at Kaesong Industrial Complex      North Koreans have failed to report for work at Kaesong Industrial Complex, suspending one of the few points of co-operation between the Koreas.      The complex is a joint industrial park and there are more than 120 South Korean companies that operate there, employing 53,000 North Korean workers.      It is seen as a crucial source of hard currency for North Korea.      The move is the latest in a series of provocations that have raised tensions in the Korean peninsula and the region.      \\"As of now, no North Korean workers have reported to work this morning,\\" a spokesperson for the South Korean Unification Ministry said.      The ministry added that 77 South Korean workers would leave the zone on Tuesday, but 479 were still inside Kaesong.      Investment risk      The complex was launched in 2003 and was largely funded by South Korea.      Seoul has said the purpose of the complex was to develop a joint industrial park where South Korean companies could manufacture their products using North Korean labour.      It said that would help North Korea start to reform its economy, which is in a dire state, and ease tensions between the two Koreas.      South Korea has given incentives to companies to try and encourage them to set up operations there. These include political risk insurance to cover losses in their investment.      As a result, if the project is threatened, South Korea also tends to lose.      South Korean President Park Geun-hye said the boycott by North Korea would harm the country's credibility.      \\"Investment is all about being able to anticipate results and trust and when you have the North breaking international regulations and promises like this and suspending Kaesong while the world is watching, no country in the world will invest in the North,\\" she told a cabinet meeting in Seoul.      Last symbol      \\"I don't know what to do, honestly. I can't simply tell my workers to leave or stay,\\" an executive from a South Korean clothing firm told the Reuters news agency.

South Korean companies pay more than 80m (£52m) a year in salaries. As a whole, the Kaesong complex produced 470m worth of goods last year.      It accounts for nearly all inter-Korean trade.      The BBC's Lucy Williamson, reporting from Seoul, said that for almost a decade the joint industrial zone has chugged on, through North Korean nuclear tests, rhetoric, and even military clashes with the South.      But now the last symbol of joint inter-Korean co-operation is effectively suspended, she says.      North Korea has blocked access to South Koreans working there since Wednesday.      Tough sanctions      On Monday it said it would withdraw all its own employees and suspend operations in the zone. A decision would come later on whether it would shut it down for good.      North Korea has expressed anger at South Korean media reports that the North would not shut down Kaesong because its struggling economy is heavily dependent on the complex.      The United Nations imposed tough sanctions on North Korea last month following its third nuclear test.      Pyongyang has responded to this and to joint military exercises between South Korea and the US with escalating rhetoric. It has threatened to use nuclear weapons and said it would restart a nuclear reactor.      Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play.      The North has also shut down an emergency military hotline between Seoul and Pyongyang.      Last week, it warned it would not be able to guarantee the safety of foreign embassy staff after 10 April, and that countries should begin evacuating their diplomatic staff.      Over the weekend, the US cancelled a scheduled test of its Minuteman 3 ballistic missile, citing concerns that it could be misinterpreted by Pyongyang.      Meanwhile, Japan said it has deployed US-made Patriot anti-missile batteries in Tokyo and other parts of the country to guard against North Korea launching ballistic missiles.      Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said that the government was \\"fully prepared to protect the lives and safety of the Japanese people\\".      \\"North Korea is still continuing its provocative actions towards the international community, but we must take measures in a calm manner by cooperating with other nations,\\" Mr Abe said.      \\"In particular, we believe it is necessary to implement the latest sanctions resolution by the UN.\\"      No one here in Japan thinks Pyongyang is really preparing to attack Japan, says the BBC's Rupert Wingfield-Hayes in Tokyo.      But it may try to fire a missile over the top of Japan in to the Pacific Ocean, and if it does, Tokyo has made it clear it will shoot the missile down, our correspondent adds. ||||| SEOUL North Korea intensified threats of an imminent conflict against the United States and the South on Tuesday, warning foreigners to evacuate South Korea to avoid being dragged into \\"thermonuclear war\\".      The North's latest message belied an atmosphere free of anxiety in the South Korean capital, where the city center was bustling with traffic and offices operated normally.      Pyongyang has shown no sign of preparing its 1.2 million-strong army for war, indicating the threat could be aimed partly at bolstering Kim Jong-un, 30, the third in his family to lead the country.      The North, which threatens the United States and its \\"puppet\\", South Korea, on a daily basis, is marking anniversaries this week that could be accompanied by strong statements or military displays.      The warning to foreigners in the South, reported by the KCNA news agency, said once war broke out \\"it will be an all-out war, a merciless, sacred, retaliatory war to be waged by (North Korea).      \\"It does not want to see foreigners in South Korea fall victim to the war,\\" the agency quoted the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee as saying.      \\"The committee informs all foreign institutions and enterprises and foreigners, including tourists...that they are requested to take measures for shelter and evacuation in advance for their safety.\\"      None of the embassies in Seoul appeared to have issued any directives to their nationals and airlines reported no changes in their schedules. Schools catering to foreign pupils worked without interruption.      The warning, read out on North Korea's state television in a bulletin that interrupted normal programming, was the latest threat in weeks of high tension following U.N. sanctions slapped on Pyongyang for its latest nuclear arms test.      It followed the North's suspension of activity at the Kaesong joint industrial park just inside North Korea, all but closing down the last remnant of cooperation between the neighbors. North Korean workers failed to turn up on Tuesday.      North Korea had said South Korea was trying to turn the Kaesong complex into a \\"hotbed of war\\".      Speculation remained high that the North may launch some provocative action this week - perhaps a missile launch or a nuclear arms test.      In a previous appeal, its authorities urged diplomats in Pyongyang to leave on grounds their safety could not be assured beyond Wednesday. None appeared to have taken any such action.      \\"VERY DANGEROUS\\" SITUATION      Also featured in broadcasts were country-wide reports of celebrations marking Saturday's 20th anniversary of the current leader's father, Kim Jong-il, taking over North Korea's leadership and next Monday's birth date of his grandfather, post-World War Two state founder Kim Il-Sung.      A spokeswoman for South Korea's presidential Blue House dismissed the warning, saying no one felt under threat.      \\"We understand that not only South Koreans, but also foreigners residing here remain unfazed as they have great trust and confidence in our military and the Republic of Korea,\\" Yonhap news agency quoted Kim Haing as saying. She was referring to South Korea by its official name.      A government source in Seoul said a North Korean medium-range missile, reported to have been shunted to the east coast, had been tracked and was believed to be ready for launch.      \\"Technically, they can launch it as early as tomorrow,\\" the source said.      But a U.S. embassy official in Seoul said a directive issued last week saying there was no imminent threat to Americans in South Korea remained valid. \\"Our workers are in all our offices today,\\" he said. \\"We have not evacuated anyone.\\"      Stocks, which had fallen 4 percent over the past four days, edged higher on Tuesday despite the warning. The won currency moved little, dipping slightly after the North Korean statement.      World leaders have expressed alarm at the crisis and the prospect of a conflict involving a country claiming to be developing nuclear weapons.      China, the North's sole diplomatic and financial ally, issued a new call for calm and restraint, though Beijing's leaders have shown increasing impatience with Pyongyang.      A Russian foreign ministry spokesman, in a statement on the ministry's website, said Moscow was in solidarity with all G8 industrialized countries \\"as regards the rejection of Pyongyang's current provocative and bellicose line of conduct\\".      An official from the 27-nation European Union said Pyongyang \\"looks calm\\", but acknowledged there was a \\"limited risk...of an armed conflict\\".      U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, speaking in Rome, described the situation as \\"very dangerous. A small incident caused by miscalculation or misjudgment may create an uncontrollable situation\\".      The North is also angry at weeks of joint U.S.-South Korean military exercises off the coast of the peninsula, with B-2 stealth bombers dispatched from their U.S. bases.      But the United States announced the postponement last weekend of a long-planned missile launch, a move officials said was aimed at easing tensions on the peninsula. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry visits Seoul this week.      Employers at the Kaesong complex faced uncertainty as the 53,000-strong North Korean workforce stayed away. A spokesman for textile company Taekwang Industrial and at least two other firms said production had stopped.      South Korean figures said 406 South Koreans remained in Kaesong on Tuesday after 69 left the complex, which generates 2 billion in trade for the impoverished North.      Addressing a cabinet meeting, South Korean President Park Geun-hye described the suspension of Kaesong as \\"very disappointing\\" and said investors would now shun the North.      South Korean companies are estimated to have invested around 500 million in the park since 2004.      North Korean workers at the park have appeared increasingly agitated in recent days, refusing to talk to their colleagues.      Many Southerners connected with the park bedded down at budget hotels in a nearby South Korean town in the hope that an order would come from the North to re-open.

How to make a pipe out of a pen  Obtain a cheap click pen with a removable cartridge and a metal tip.  The metal tip is crucial; this is where you will be burning your pipe tobacco. If the tip is plastic, you will ingest toxic fumes from the burning of plastic.","output":"Step 1: Disassemble the pen First, twist or pull apart the pen to remove its components, including the ink cartridge, the spring, and the pen's outer casing. Make sure you do this carefully to avoid damaging the pen or hurting yourself. Step 2: Clean the pen components Wipe away any ink residue from the pen's components, particularly the metal tip and the outer casing, using a cloth or paper towel. You may also run the metal tip under water to remove any remaining ink. Step 3: Reassemble the pen without the ink cartridge Put the spring back into the outer casing of the pen, ensuring that it remains in place at the bottom. Then, insert the metal tip back into the casing. Make sure the spring and the metal tip fit snugly against each other within the casing. The pen should now resemble a pipe with a hollow tube and a metal bowl. Step 4: Test the airflow Check the airflow through the pipe by blowing through the end opposite the metal tip. There should be enough airflow to draw smoke, but not too much that it feels excessively loose. Step 5: Load the pipe with pipe tobacco Place a small amount of pipe tobacco into the metal tip – this is now the bowl of your pipe. Make sure it's packed just tight enough to maintain airflow, but not so loose that the tobacco will fall out. Step 6: Use a lighter to ignite the tobacco Hold a lighter or match flame to the bowl while you gently inhale through the other end. The tobacco should begin to smolder, and you will draw smoke through the pen-turned-pipe. Step 7: Enjoy carefully and responsibly Smoking any substance carries potential health risks. While this makeshift pipe is a creative solution for a short-term or emergency situation, it's essential to use a proper pipe or smoking device for long-term use.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works.

Literary career During the war Camus joined the French Resistance cell Combat, which published an underground newspaper of the same name. This group worked against the Nazis, and in it Camus assumed the nom de guerre Beauchard. Camus became the paper's editor in 1943. He first met Sartre at the dress rehearsal of Sartre's play, The Flies, in June 1943. When the Ailies liberated Paris in August 1944, Camus witnessed and reported the last of the fighting. Soon after the event on 6 August 1945, he was one of the few French editors to publicly express opposition and disgust to the United States' dropping the atomic bomb in Hiroshima. He resigned from Combat in 1947 when it became a commercial paper. After the war, Camus began frequenting the Cafe de Flore on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in Paris with Sartre and others. He also toured the United States to lecture about French thought. Although he leaned left, politically, his strong criticisms of Communist doctrine did not win him any friends in the Communist parties and eventually alienated Sartre. In 1949, his tuberculosis returned, whereupon he lived in seclusion for two years. In 1951, he published The Rebel, a philosophical analysis of rebellion and revolution which expressed his rejection of communism. Upsetting many of his colleagues and contemporaries in France, the book brought about the final split with Sartre. The dour reception depressed Camus; he began to translate plays. Camus's first significant contribution to philosophy was his idea of the absurd. He saw it as the result of our desire for clarity and meaning within a world and condition that offers neither, which he expressed in The Myth of Sisyphus and incorporated into many of his other works, such as The Stranger and The Plague. Despite his split from his \\"study partner\\", Sartre, Camus was still categorized as an Existentialist. He specifically rejected that label in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What label does Camus reject?\\" is \\"Rebellion\\"?","output":"According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What label does Camus reject?\\" is \\"Existentialist.\\" Camus specifically rejected the label of Existentialist in his essay \\"Enigma\\" and elsewhere in his works.

The sentence describes a situation in which John is conducting research in the library when he suddenly hears someone nearby humming and whistling.

In English, pronouns can be used to replace nouns when the reference is clear and understood to avoid repetition in a text. In this case, it would be unnecessary to repeat John's name, as it is evident that the individual being annoyed is John himself. The use of capitalization with \\"He\\" strengthens the assumption that \\"He\\" is John and not another individual or the man humming and whistling, as proper names are often capitalized to indicate their importance or to emphasize them. However, although it is highly likely that \\"John\\" and \\"He\\" refer to the same person in this context, it's important to note that, in a more extended text or dialogue, the writer should aim to provide enough context and clarity to ensure that the reader can easily determine which term refers to which character.

What is more certain is that Glastonbury was an important religious centre by 700 and claims to be \\"the oldest above-ground Christian church in the World\\" situated \\"in the mystical land of Avalon.\\" The claim is based on dating the founding of the community of monks at AD 63, the year of the legendary visit of Joseph of Arimathea, who was supposed to have brought the Holy Grail.

The present Diocese of Bath and Wells covers Somerset – with the exception of the Parish of Abbots Leigh with Leigh Woods in North Somerset – and a small area of Dorset.

This article: The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building. In 1955 Dallas Barrack, a Springdale antique dealer, bought Oklahoma Row, and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries.

Pick from: --yes --it is not possible to tell --no","output":"It is not possible to tell. Although the given information, \\"Interesting rock formations in the desert landscape, with stars above,\\" suggests a clear view of the stars, it does not provide us with sufficient data to draw a definitive conclusion about the presence or absence of clouds in the night sky. Assuming that the rock formations are in a desert landscape, we can infer that the geographical location has a generally dry and arid climate, which usually results in fewer clouds compared to wetter or more temperate regions. However, even deserts can have occasional cloud cover at night, and this may not obscure all the stars in the sky. Furthermore, the phrase \\"with stars above\\" implies that stars are visible, but it does not clarify whether all or only certain sections of the sky are filled with stars. It is possible that clouds could be present in other areas of the sky, not directly above the rock formations, but still not obstructing the view of certain stars. In summary, while the given information suggests that some stars are visible in the night sky above the rock formations in the desert landscape, it is not possible to tell if there are no clouds in the night sky based solely on this statement. Other factors, such as a more detailed description of the sky, weather patterns, and geographical location, would be necessary to determine the presence or absence of clouds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Slayer is an American thrash metal band from Huntington Park, California. The band was formed in 1981 by vocalist and bassist Tom Araya and guitarists Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman. Slayer's fast and aggressive musical style made them one of the founding \\"big four\\" bands of thrash metal, alongside Metallica, Megadeth and Anthrax. Slayer's current lineup comprises King, Araya, drummer Paul Bostaph and guitarist Gary Holt. Hanneman and drummers Dave Lombardo and Jon Dette are former members of the band. In the original line-up, King, Hanneman and Araya contributed to the band's lyrics, and all of the band's music was written by King and  Hanneman. The band's lyrics and album art, which cover topics such as murder, serial killers, necrophilia, torture, genocide, human experimentation, Satanism, hate crimes, terrorism, religion, antireligion, Nazism and war, have generated album bans, delays, lawsuits and criticism from religious groups and factions of the general public. However, its music has been highly influential, often being cited by many bands as an influence musically, visually and lyrically; the band's third album, Reign in Blood (1986), was described as one of the heaviest and most influential thrash metal albums. Slayer has released twelve studio albums, two live albums, a box set, six music videos, two extended plays and a cover album. Four of the band's studio albums have received gold certification in the United States. The band has received five Grammy Award nominations, winning one in 2007 for the song \\"Eyes of the Insane\\" and one in 2008 for the song \\"Final Six\\", both of which were from the album Christ Illusion (2006). Between 1991 and 2013, the band sold five million albums in the United States.

Let's solve the math problem step by step. We have:  10*f + 364 = 117*f - 64 We need to find the value of \\"f\\". First, let's move all the \\"f\\" terms to one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract \\"10*f\\" from both sides: 364 = 117*f - 10*f - 64 Now, let's simplify it by doing 117*f - 10*f which is equal to 107*f: 364 = 107*f - 64 Next, we need to get rid of the \\"-64\\" on the right side of the equation. To do this, we can add \\"64\\" to both sides: 364 + 64 = 107*f When we add 364 and 64, we get 428: 428 = 107*f Now, we need to find the value of \\"f\\". To do this, we can divide both sides of the equation by \\"107\\": 428 ÷ 107 = f When we divide 428 by 107, we get 4: f = 4 So, the value of \\"f\\" we found is 4. Yay!

Answer:","output":"Langston Hughes, an influential American poet born in Joplin, Missouri, on February 1, 1902, authored numerous poems throughout his extensive career as a writer. Although it's challenging to definitively attribute a single poem to him solely based on him being from Joplin, one of Langston Hughes' most famous poems, entitled \\"I, Too,\\" reflects his experiences growing up as an African American in the early 20th century.  \\"I, Too\\" is an evocative poem that resonates with many readers due to its themes of individuality, resilience, and hope for a brighter future. Written in 1926, it highlights the struggle for racial equality and justice in America, which was profoundly shaped by the Jim Crow era's racial segregation and discrimination. Langston Hughes elaborates on this by taking on the persona of a Black servant who faces rejection and separation from mainstream society. In the poem, Hughes confidently proclaims that the narrator, like the rest of America, is part of the nation, and the time will come when he will no longer be treated as inferior. Through allusions, metaphorical depictions, and an optimistic outlook, he envisions a day when Black Americans will be fully acknowledged as vital members of the American society. This idea creates a powerful message of unity and growth, which remains relevant to ongoing debates about race, identity, and belonging. As a leading figure of the Harlem Renaissance, Langston Hughes was inspired by the lives of Black people and their culture. This movement, which began in the 1920s, consisted of African American artists, writers, and musicians who sought to illuminate the beauty of Black culture and assert its position as an integral component of American history. The Harlem Renaissance served as a platform for African American voices, with renowned figures like Zora Neale Hurston, Claude McKay, Countee Cullen, and Duke Ellington, amongst others. In conclusion, Langston Hughes, the poet from Joplin, MO, wrote many poems in his lifetime. One of his most famous works, \\"I, Too,\\" exemplifies his capacity to represent the spirit, resilience, and hope of African Americans during the early 20th century. While it is impossible to definitively connect a single poem to the town of Joplin, \\"I, Too\\" serves as an essential reminder of the writer's ongoing relevance and dedication to addressing issues related to race and social justice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If you answered that they are all good for your health you are spot on again. Fruits used to be a staple in many diets, however in amongst all of the low carb and anti sugar chaos, many people are now avoiding them. In a rush to rid the diet of ‘toxic sugar’, fruit has fallen on the wayside. However, many studies have shown that fruit is not linked to any adverse health effects, quite the opposite in fact. Most recently researchers in Sweden discovered that eating a diet high in fruits could reduce the risk of an often lethal form of aortic aneurysm. The study collected data from over 80,000 people over a 13 year period and found that people eating at least two whole fruits per day, reduced the risk of developing  an abdominal aortic aneurysm by almost a third. The main fruits that were eaten were apples, pears, bananas, oranges and other citrus fruits. The fruits’ high antioxidant levels may offer protection by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation. Eating whole fruits can also reduced the risk of developing diabetes. Earlier this year a study published in the British Medical Journal revealed that certain whole fruits – in particular blueberries, grapes, apples and pears – could lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The study found that over an 18-year period, 6.5% of the 187,382 participants developed diabetes, but those consuming at least two serves of fruit per week reduced their risk by up to 23%. In the same study those who consumed two or more serves of fruit juice per day increased their risk of developing diabetes by as much as 21%.

I tried to fit my new picture with a nice border, but I couldn't because the  Choices:  a). picture was too narrow.;  b). border was too narrow.;","output":"Although both options could potentially be applied in various situations, we will proceed with option b: \\"border was too narrow.\\" This would make the complete sentence: \\"I tried to fit my new picture with a nice border, but I couldn't because the border was too narrow.\\" Having a narrow border might seem like a minor issue, yet it can be highly problematic when it comes to appropriately framing artwork or photographs. A border's primary purpose is to complement and enhance the overall appearance of the image, as well as provide structural support to protect the enclosed picture over time. Therefore, it is crucial to select a suitable border that ensures both beauty and stability. In this scenario, the narrow border was incapable of meeting these requirements, as it failed to accommodate the dimensions and aesthetics of the picture. Undoubtedly, a border of the correct width is essential for fulfilling the aforementioned goals. Should the edge have been too wide, it might have potentially dominated the visual aspects of the artwork, diminishing its impact on the viewer. Conversely, if the border had been extremely thin, it would have failed as a protective measure, leaving the picture susceptible to damage. To remedy such a situation and make the most out of one's artwork, it is advisable to seek professional guidance from a framer or art consultant, who can offer valuable insights into the appropriate type of border. Factors like the width, color, style, and material of the border should be taken into consideration to create the perfect combination, which complements the picture instead of competing against it. Additionally, customized borders can be a particularly appealing option, as they allow for an increased level of personalization to suit individual tastes. In summary, finding the right balance is crucial in border selection, especially when considering the width. Though the narrow border posed a challenge in our example, a proper resolution can be reached by consulting with art professionals and exploring various options. Ultimately, selecting a fitting border will serve to accentuate the visual appeal of the artwork while ensuring its maintenance and longevity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. that was seeking to impose order over a landscape marked by feuding warlords in the capital city. Working together, the ICU and Al-Shabaab succeeded in 2006 in gaining control of Mogadishu. That sparked fears in neighboring Ethiopia that violence would spill over there, according to the Council on Foreign Relations. Those fears -- combined with a request from Somalia's transitional government -- led Ethiopian forces to enter Somalia in December 2006 and to remove the ICU from power. That move proved to be a turning point, one that radicalized Al-Shabaab, which attacked Ethiopian forces and gained control of parts of central and southern Somalia, according to a 2011 case study by Rob Wise, who was then with the Counterterrorism Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. What is Al-Shabaab's relationship with Kenya? In 2011, the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion intended to create a security buffer zone in southern Somalia after attacks on tourist destinations in northern Kenya that it blamed on Al-Shabaab. More recently, Ethiopian troops crossed the border and expelled Al-Shabaab from Baidoa, a strategic town midway between the Ethiopian border and Mogadishu. The group then targeted African Union soldiers and government buildings in the capital in suicide attacks. A suicide bombing in March 2012 killed five people at the Presidential Palace. Analysts say tension appears to have been growing within Al-Shabaab between Somalis and foreign fighters, several hundred of whom are thought to have entered Somalia in recent years to join the group. There may also have been disagreement within the group about the announcement in February 2012 of an alliance between Al-Shabaab and al Qaeda and about the group's ban on foreign aid organizations working in Somalia to save millions threatened by famine. Al-Shabaab breaks new ground with complex Nairobi attack. How and from where does it recruit? The organization has a sophisticated public relations arm that includes a Twitter account and video production abilities. \\"Remember Mumbai?\\" one tweet asked Saturday, as gunfire was erupting from Westgate mall in Nairobi. The comment was an apparent reference to the 2008 attack in which 10 Pakistani men associated with the terrorist group Lashkar-e-Tayyiba stormed several buildings in Mumbai, India, killing 164 people over a three-day period. \\"Some youngsters resist death even when told not to be taken alive. It's going to be a long ordeal,\\" Saturday's tweet said. Soon after, it announced it was responsible for Saturday's attack in Nairobi, Kenya. \\"Alshabab confirms its behind the #Westgate spectacle,\\" it said. A 2009 Al-Shabaab video is as slickly produced as a reality TV show, complete with a hip-hop jihad voice and a startling message. \\"Mortar by mortar, shell by shell, only going to stop when I send them to hell,\\" an unidentified voice raps on the video in American English. The video shows a man reported to have been Abu Mansoor al-Amriki, a U.S. citizen from Alabama. \\"Away from your family, away from our friends, away from ice, candy bars, all those things is because we're waiting to meet the enemy,\\" he says. But enemies -- and alliances -- can shift. Al-Amriki, whose real name is Omar Hammami, said last year in a video posted online that he had had a fallout with Al-Shabaab \\"regarding matters of the sharia and matters of strategy\\" and feared for his life. He was reported last week to have been killed in Somalia by Al-Shabaab. CNN is not able to confirm the report. Finding replacements may not be hard. Sheikh Ahmed Matan, a member of Britain's Somali community, said he knows of hundreds of young Somali men living in the West who returned to Somalia for terrorist training. How is it funded? The once ragtag Somalia-based al Qaeda affiliate has grown into an economic powerhouse, raising tens of millions of dollars in cash from schemes that have involved extortion, illegal taxation and other \\"fees,\\" according to the 2011 United Nations report. The United States believed then that the group was coordinating with al Qaeda groups in Yemen and might have been plotting attacks in the region and abroad. In 2011, it was generating \\"between 70 million and 100 million per year, from duties and fees levied at airports and seaports, taxes on goods and services, taxes in kind on domestic produce, 'jihad contributions,' checkpoints and various forms of extortion justified in terms of religious obligation,\\" according to the report from the U.N. Monitoring Group on Somalia and Eritrea. How have Somalis been affected? Years of lawlessness and poverty have exacted a toll that Al-Shabaab has not helped. In 2011, the United Nations declared a famine in the southern Somalia regions of Bakool and Lower Shabelle, and Al-Shabaab reversed an earlier pledge to allow aid agencies to provide food in famine-stricken areas. That year, the U.N. Interagency Group for Child Mortality Estimation announced that Somalia had the highest mortality rate for children 4 and younger in the world. In May, a report jointly commissioned by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization and the USAID-funded Famine Early Warning Systems Network reported that 258,000 Somalis had died in the famine between October 2010 and April 2012 and that half of the victims were younger than five. What is the United States doing? The United States has supported U.N.-backed African forces fighting Al-Shabaab and strengthened its counterterrorism efforts against the group. It has also donated millions in aid. The U.S. State Department said this week that Somali security forces, aided by the African Union Mission in Somalia, have driven Al-Shabaab out of major cities and towns, creating \\"a window of opportunity to fundamentally change Somalia's trajectory. What is the status of Somalia's government today? In September 2012, Somali parliament members selected Hassan Sheikh Mohamud as the new president in a vote that marked a milestone for the nation, which had not had a stable central government since Barre's overthrow 21 years before. That did not mean Al-Shabaab was calling it quits. In January, French forces attempted to rescue a French intelligence commando held hostage in Somalia by the group. The raid left the soldier dead, another soldier missing and 17 Islamist fighters dead. But there has been political progress there. In January, for the first time in more than two decades, the United States granted official recognition to the Somali government. Want to know more about Somalia? Get the fast facts.

Al-Shabaab, an Islamist extremist group, formed in Somalia around 2006 and later allied with Al-Qaeda in 2012. The group seeks to impose its interpretation of Islamic law and expel foreign influences from Somalia. 2. Al-Shabaab gained control of Mogadishu in 2006, sparking fears of violence spilling over to Ethiopia. Ethiopian forces subsequently entered Somalia in December 2006 and removed the Islamic Courts Union (ICU) from power, pushing Al-Shabaab into a more radicalized direction. 3. Kenya has had a strained relationship with Al-Shabaab since 2011 when the Kenyan government ordered a cross-border incursion into Somalia to create a security buffer zone after the group attacked tourist destinations in northern Kenya. 4. The group recruits members from within Somalia as well as from the Somali diaspora living in western countries. They use propaganda and social media outlets to attract and radicalize new members. 5. Al-Shabaab is funded through a variety of sources, including extortion, illegal taxation, duties, and fees levied at airports and seaports.

Somalia has been negatively affected by Al-Shabaab's actions, with famine and high mortality rates for children under five. The group's ban on foreign aid organizations has exacerbated these issues. 7. The United States has supported counterterrorism efforts against Al-Shabaab and provided aid to Somalia.

Does it follow that \\"Many people were there.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"There were lots of people\\" does imply that \\"Many people were there.\\" Both statements convey the same underlying meaning, which is that there was a significant number of individuals present at a particular location or event. While they use different phrases, they both serve to emphasize the abundance of people in the given context. Let's examine these two statements more closely to better understand their similarities and differences. 1. \\"There were lots of people\\": In this statement, \\"lots\\" is a colloquial expression used to suggest a considerable quantity or number. By saying \\"lots of people,\\" it paints a picture of a crowded area or a large gathering where the presence of people is quite noticeable. This statement can be used in various situations, such as describing attendance at a party, a busy marketplace, or a popular tourist destination. 2. \\"Many people were there\\": This statement uses \\"many\\" to denote an indefinite but considerable number of people. Much like \\"lots,\\" \\"many\\" highlights the idea that there is a sizable gathering or crowd at a specific location or event. This statement can be employed in similar contexts as \\"There were lots of people,\\" although \\"many\\" might be considered a slightly more formal choice of wording. While both phrases underscore the abundance of people, it is important to note that neither statement provides an exact number. Instead, they allow the listener or reader to infer that the number of people present was significant or noteworthy. This can be a useful way of emphasizing the popularity or success of an event or location, or drawing attention to a specific aspect, such as overcrowding. In sum, the statements \\"There were lots of people\\" and \\"Many people were there\\" are essentially interchangeable, as they both express the idea that a significant number of people were present in a certain situation. As a result, either phrase can be used to emphasize the substantial presence of individuals at a location or event, depending on the particular context and the desired level of formality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

Write a question about the following article: Cloud argues, \\"the emblematic moment of the period from 1955 through the 1980s in American labor was the tragic PATCO strike in 1981.\\" Most unions were strongly opposed to Reagan in the 1980 presidential election, despite the fact that Reagan remains the only union leader  to become President. On August 3, 1981, the Professional Air Traffic Controllers Organization  union—which had supported Reagan—rejected the government's pay raise offer and sent its 16,000 members out on strike to shut down the nation's commercial airlines. They demanded a reduction in the workweek to 32 from 40 hours, a 10,000 bonus, pay raises up to 40%, and early retirement. Federal law forbade such a strike, and the Transportation department implemented a backup plan  to keep the system running. The strikers were given 48 hours to return to work, else they would be fired and banned from ever again working in a federal capacity. A fourth of the strikers came back to work, but 13,000 did not. The strike collapsed, PATCO vanished, and the union movement as a whole suffered a major reversal, which accelerated the decline of membership across the board in the private sector. Schulman and Zelizer argue that the breaking of PATCO, \\"sent shock waves through the entire U.S. labor relations regime.... strike rates plummeted, and union power sharply declined.\\" Unions suffered a continual decline of power during the Reagan administration, with a concomitant effect on wages. The average first-year raise  fell from 9.8% to 1.2%; in manufacturing, raises fell from 7.2% to negative 1.2%. Salaries of unionized workers also fell relative to non-union workers. Women and blacks suffered more from these trends.

This House would ban the promotion of diets What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"Introduction: The promotion of diets has become a prevalent aspect of modern society, driven by a media landscape that often glorifies specific body types as the epitome of beauty and well-being. While some diets can be helpful for certain individuals, there is an increasing concern surrounding the negative effects of promoting diets on a large scale, leading to the proposition that this House would ban the promotion of diets. Several arguments can be made in favor of this stance, focusing on topics such as physical health, mental health, individual identity, and social responsibility. Argument 1: Protecting Physical Health One of the primary reasons to consider banning the promotion of diets is to protect people's physical health. Many promoted diets are not scientifically substantiated, and some can even be detrimental to one's health. By banning the promotion of such diets, the House would be ensuring that individuals only receive reliable, evidence-based nutritional advice. For instance, fad diets often promise quick results by drastically cutting calorie intake or eliminating entire food groups, which can lead to nutritional deficiencies, slowed metabolism, and other negative health outcomes. By removing these unsound diets from the public sphere, this House would prevent individuals from potentially damaging their bodies while pursuing unrealistic weight-loss goals. Argument 2: Preserving Mental Health Another significant argument in favor of banning the promotion of diets concerns mental health. The constant exposure to diet promotions can contribute to feelings of inadequacy, guilt, and pressure to attain often unattainable body types. This can result in negative self-perception and, in some cases, has been linked to the development of eating disorders like anorexia nervosa and bulimia. By putting an end to the promotion of diets, the House would create an environment where individuals are less likely to be bombarded with unrealistic body ideals, helping to promote a healthier relationship with one's body and food. Argument 3: Fostering Individual Identity Banning the promotion of diets can also have a positive impact by fostering individual identity and promoting body diversity. The promotion of diets, often accompanied by imagery of slim body types, perpetuates the idea that there is a single \\"ideal\\" body shape that everyone should strive for, which is blatantly incorrect. By contrast, a ban on diet promotions would help emphasize that bodies can be healthy, strong, and beautiful in various shapes and sizes, encouraging individuals to embrace their uniqueness and better understand their own health needs. This can facilitate a healthier, more accepting society where body image is celebrated, rather than dictated by external sources. Argument 4: Encouraging Social Responsibility Finally, the ban on promoting diets can contribute to increased social responsibility for media outlets, influencers, and advertisers. The rampant promotion of diets reflects the prioritization of profit over public health and well-being, as organizations often endorse specific diets or weight-loss products without regard to their potential harm. Banning diet promotions would force these entities to reevaluate their content and advertising strategies. Instead, they would be required to present scientifically-backed, balanced, and inclusive representations of health and nutrition, better serving their audiences and promoting a healthier society. Conclusion: In conclusion, several arguments support the idea that banning the promotion of diets would be beneficial to society at large. Not only would it protect physical and mental health, but it would also help promote the importance of individuality and body diversity while pushing media outlets and advertisers towards greater social responsibility. By implementing this ban, the House would send a strong message that public health and well-being take precedence over short-lived trends and profit-driven promotions."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a sentence with a missing word, pick the answer option that best fills out the missing word in the sentence.

The sentence you provided has the following pieces of information relevant to the question: 1. Joseph Ratzinger was created a cardinal. 2. The event occurred in a small four-appointment consistory. 3. The date of the consistory was 27 June 1977. So from this information, we can infer that Joseph Ratzinger became a cardinal on the exact date mentioned in the question - June 27, 1977. It's important to note that Pope Paul VI was the reigning pope at that time (from 1963 to 1978) and had the authority to create cardinals. Therefore, it is evident that Joseph Ratzinger was made a cardinal by Pope Paul VI on June 27, 1977. Moreover, the sentence also informs us about the inclusion of Bernardin Gantin from Benin, Africa, though the question did not specifically ask for information about other individuals who became cardinals on the same date.

The show delves into the world of hedge funds, revealing how the characters navigate the landscape and deal with the moral and ethical issues that arise. The famous Biggie Smalls' line \\"Mo Money, Mo Problems\\" rings true in this thrilling drama, as the primary focus lies on the insatiable appetite for wealth and the problems that come with it. Step 1: Setting the Scene To articulate the world of 'Billions,' it is essential to explore the main characters and plotline. The show revolves around two central figures: Bobby \\"Axe\\" Axelrod, a billionaire hedge fund manager played by Damian Lewis, and Charles \\"Chuck\\" Rhoades Jr., a ruthless U.S. Attorney portrayed by Paul Giamatti. As the characters chase wealth and power, they find themselves in a perpetual cat-and-mouse game that blurs the line between right and wrong. Step 2: More Money Bobby Axelrod is the epitome of the rags-to-riches story, having built his wealth from the ground up after losing his family in the 9/11 attacks. Along with his cunning intelligence and immense wealth, Axe wields enormous influence and charm. However, his ambition for even greater wealth often lands him in precarious situations, drawing the attention of law enforcement agencies like the SEC and Chuck Rhoades. A prime example of Axe's insatiable hunger for wealth is when he resorts to illegal tactics, such as insider trading, to enhance his financial empire. His actions, motivated by greed and the drive for more money, lead to strained relationships and greater scrutiny from the authorities. Step 3: More Problems As Bobby's wealth and power grow, so do his problems. He faces constant threats from rival hedge fund managers and other powerful forces seeking to bring him down. Simultaneously, his actions attract the attention of Chuck Rhoades, who seeks to dismantle Axe's empire and establish himself as a champion of justice. The subsequent legal battles, betrayals, and public scrutiny cause major disruptions in both the professional and personal lives of the show's characters. For Chuck Rhoades, his relentless pursuit of justice often borders on obsession, blurring the line between professionalism and personal vendetta. This quest for moral high ground starts to affect his relationships at work and his personal life, with his marriage to Wendy Rhoades, who happens to be Axe's trusted performance coach, a significant source of tension. Step 4: The Price of Wealth The central theme of 'Billions' demonstrates the potential consequences when the pursuit of money and power knows no bounds. As the characters topple over ethical lines and embrace every opportunity to accumulate more wealth, their problems grow in tandem. The show offers viewers an insightful look into the moral sacrifices and psychological ramifications that the characters face as a result of their actions in pursuit of billions. Conclusion: In conclusion, 'Billions' is an electrifying series that offers a compelling exploration of the high-stakes world of finance, the lengths people will go to achieve wealth, and the problems that inevitably arise due to their insatiable appetites. As the show continues to enthrall audiences, it serves as a poignant reminder of the words of Biggie Smalls: \\"Mo Money, Mo Problems.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Its main use industrially is in the production of acetylene and calcium cyanamide. Is it true that calcium carbide cac2 is the raw material for the production of acetylene?","output":"Yes, it is true that calcium carbide (CaC2) is the raw material for the production of acetylene. Calcium carbide is one of the most important and commonly used industrial raw materials and has extremely diverse applications due to the potential chemical reactions it can undergo. Calcium carbide is made by heating a mixture of lime (calcium oxide) and carbon (usually derived from coke or anthracite coal) in an electric arc furnace to temperatures around 2000–2200 °C. During this process, the carbon reacts with the limestone to form calcium carbide. The acetylene gas is produced by adding water to calcium carbide. When water is mixed with calcium carbide, the following chemical reaction occurs: CaC2 + 2H2O → C2H2 (acetylene) + Ca(OH)2 The product of this reaction consists of acetylene gas, an important industrial chemical, and calcium hydroxide as a byproduct. The generated acetylene gas can be collected, purified, and used in numerous applications. Acetylene has several important uses in industry due to its highly reactive nature, which forms the basis of flame welding and cutting processes. The gas burns at a temperature hot enough to melt and fuse metals, allowing it to be used in welding steel, cutting processes, and metallurgical applications. Further, it serves as a raw material for the synthesis of a variety of organic chemicals like chloroprene and vinyl chloride, used extensively in the manufacturing of synthetic rubbers and plastics. Another application of calcium carbide includes the production of calcium cyanamide (CaCN2) through the reaction with nitrogen gas at high temperatures in an electric arc furnace. Calcium cyanamide is an essential ingredient in fertilizers due to its ability to provide nitrogen to plants, and thus plays a vital role in agriculture. Calcium carbide also finds use in steelmaking as a powerful desulfurizing agent, removing sulfur impurities from molten steel, ensuring the production of high-quality steel with improved mechanical properties. In conclusion, calcium carbide (CaC2) is a crucial raw material in the production of acetylene. Its role in producing this versatile gas, and its numerous other applications, make it a vital compound for various industries ranging from welding, metallurgy, and chemical production to agriculture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be an attack helicopter, which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack. Throughout their attack, Dorian and Angus can hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers. Likewise, they can hear the helicopter pilots on their headsets. The next day, the police inform Beatrice Lever that Henry has died. She appears shocked and crestfallen, when Dorian and Angus arrive. It quickly becomes clear that she encouraged her sons to scare him to death. She is also furious about his affair, and wants revenge on his mistress. Angus and Dorian are worried that the people they heard on the radio might have overheard enough to connect them to his death.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Bob Harris was a weatherman at a small television station. He worked for twenty years and during those twenty years, he felt that his life was boring. Every day, he studied the weather and tried to predict the next day's weather. Then, he stood in front of the camera and read his report. Some days it was cloudy, some days it was sunny; sometimes rainy, while sometimes snowy. The weather changed each day, but Bob still felt that his job was always the same. His boss often told him to be happier and smile more in front of the camera, but Bob rarely smiled. He thought that most people did not watch his weather report and his job did not matter much to anyone. One day, he arrived at work and began to study the weather as usual. He noticed that something was different that day. Everything he studied told him that there was going to be a very big storm very soon, though he was not completely sure. Suddenly, Bob felt excited. He ran to his boss's office and asked to do a special weather report. The boss agreed and Bob gave a special report that afternoon, warning people of the coming storm. Because of this report, many people were safe during the storm. Bob realized  that his job was actually very important. Question: How did Bob realize that his job was actually very important?

Those that have found employment are often stuck in menial jobs such as window cleaning, packing or bottling and stacking shelves. Job shortage: A fifth of graduates are unemployed or in unsalaried or low-paid posts six months after leaving university, official figures reveal. The research by the Higher Education Statistics Agency paints a sobering picture for young university leavers who have spent at least three years studying and have built up large debts. It shows many are emerging into a hugely competitive job market where they may wait years before securing meaningful employment. The trebling of tuition fees last year to a maximum of £9,000 has created the prospect of thousands of students leaving university in two years with debts of £40,000 or more once living costs are added - and no prospect of starting to pay it off for the foreseeable future. Details were released at the same time as a Confederation of British Industry report warned too many sixth formers were being pushed into the ‘default’ university route instead of considering vocational courses and on-the-job training. Key industries such as manufacturing, construction, IT and engineering face a recruitment crisis as a result, it said. Of the 190,000 full-time first degree leavers in 2011-2012 who took part in the HESA survey, more than 17 per cent said they had continued studying. Two-thirds said they were working - but barely more than half were on permanent contracts.Six per cent said they had taken basic, unskilled work such as manning rubbish trucks or sorting mail. Two per cent were doing internships, 1.3 per cent were involved in voluntary work and 2.7 per cent classified themselves as other/unknown, a category which includes ‘developing a portfolio’. Another five per cent had opted to travel or do ‘something else’. Opportunities for university leavers. have shrunk by four per cent since last year, according to a survey by. the Association of Graduate Recruiters earlier this month. Crisis: Opportunities for university leavers have shrunk by four per cent since last year, according to a survey by the Association of Graduate Recruiters earlier this month. Banking and finance has seen 45 per cent of jobs evaporate, while accountancy and professional services firms have 17 per cent fewer vacancies. At the same time the pay premium gained from higher education is being eroded, creating a double whammy for graduates. Twenty years ago they earned 52 per cent more on average than workers with lower or no qualifications. Now that is down to 27 per cent. National Union of Students president Toni Pearce said: ‘Many of those entering the work-place for the first time are finding it hard to find a job that matches their skills. ‘Those taking their first step on the career ladder are willing to work hard and pay their dues but employers must stop exploiting them through things like unpaid internships.’ The CBI report called for a university admissions-style system to be set up to help more young people apply for apprenticeships and vocational courses. This is needed to prevent a chronic shortage of suitable workers as it estimated the majority of posts created between now and 2020 will be in high-skilled jobs. ‘What is now seen as the “default route” of an undergraduate degree is not suitable for all - young people have different talents and learn in different ways,’ the report said. ‘We should aim to inspire but also be realistic, setting out the costs and likely return on options open to young people, including the vocational options that have long been undersold.’ Policy director Katja Hall added: ‘We need to tackle the perception that the A-levels and three-year degree model is the only route to a good career. ‘When faced with a £27,000 debt, young people are already becoming much savvier in shopping around for routes to give them a competitive edge in a tighter job market.’ Highlights:","output":"1.

Some people think that more students should learn skills and trades instead of going to university, because there are more jobs in fields like construction and technology. 5.

Pearly queen: The Pearl of Asia - the largest pearl in the world, once part of the crown jewels of the Moghul empire - is on display at the V&A. A parasitic invertebrate that has just been pooed out by a shark is hardly the place you'd go to find that classy necklace. But experts have scuppered the popular belief that pearls form through friction with a grain of sand - saying that they actually build around tapeworm larvae. The revelation, which might have surprised fans of the beads such as Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, comes as part of a new exhibition at the V&A in London. A video demonstrating how the precious stones form when tapeworm larvae excreted by sharks and stingrays become trapped in water-filtering shellfish such as oysters will be on show at the museum's Pearls exhibition, which begins on Saturday. The show's co-creator, Hubert Bari, said:. 'The people marketing (pearls) prefer to say, \\"It is so fantastic, your. necklace was made from a grain of sand\\". 'It is better to speak about a grain of sand than to speak about a piece of s*** from a stingray.' The somewhat unsavoury origins of the. pearl have been known since 1852, when Filippi of Turin proved that a. parasitic flatworm called the Distomum duplicatum was the cause of the. stones forming inside freshwater mussels. ...and here's the little guy who made it: The larvae of a tapeworm, which gets into shellfish and causes them to excrete a substance that forms into a pearl. Precious: An Akoya pearl necklace, previously owned by Marilyn Monroe, which is one of the items in the V&A exhibition. The tapeworm had its crucial role in pearl formation acknowledged in a 1903 paper by Professors Herdman and Hornell on pearl fisheries in Ceylon. Pearls can form around any parasite -. including fish and snails - that has drilled into the the flesh of sea. creatures such as mussels, but tapeworms and flatworms that have been. excreted by larger animals are the most common invaders. The. immune system of the shellfish then fights the worm by surrounding them. with layer upon layer of nacre - a calcium-based material that makes up. their shells - causing the parasite to suffocate and become trapped in. this solid casing. Wealth: The Roseberry Pearl and Diamond Tiara that was given to Hannah De Rothschild as a wedding present in 1878. Ancient and modern: The Pearl Pendant Earrings (top) and Ring (centre) once owned by Hollywood film star Elizabeth Taylor, left, and right, the Hope pearl, which was previously owned by King Louis XIV of France. Oysters, which produce a milky nacre, are the most common source for commercial pearls, but other animals can produce pearls that are black, blue, red or green, depending on the natural colour of their nacre. Pearls are most abundant where ecosystems thrive from larger predators through to the parasites and their hosts. The V&A exhibition explores the history of pearls, chronicling how the jewels went from being a luxury. adored by royalty (Queen Victoria loved pearls so much she had. Garrard’s create black pearl jewellery when she was in mourning) to. objets d’art, by jewellers such as Vietnamese Sam Tho Duong, and a. mass-produced product worn by fashionistas and aristos alike. Aristocracy: The Lady Raine Spencer tiara, owned by the stepmother to the late Diana, Princess of Wales. Fit for a princess: The Hanover tiara, worn by both wives of Prince Johann Georg of Saxony. I. Natural: The exhibition opens on Saturday and includes historical displays and features about the science of pearls. It goes back to the invention of the cultured pearl and how Kokichi Mikimoto produced it on an industrial scale in Japan. Marilyn Monroe wore a 16in string of Mikimoto pearls to court the day she divorced her second husband Joe DiMaggio in 1954. After the war, the Hollywood hits of the 1940s and the 1950s generated a feelgood factor and a style that was desired – if not affordable for ordinary Americans. Doris Day, Lauren Bacall and Ava Gardner were among the actresses who wore pearl chokers made up of cultured pearls – they gradually started to take over from natural pearls. For centuries, pearls had been a sign of extreme wealth. Finding. one usually required a diver to open 2,000 oysters, – but Mikimoto, who. headed the company which made Monroe’s necklace, pioneered the. commercial ‘culturing’ of pearls, where irritants were deliberately. introduced to oysters to farm jewellery. Mikimoto said he wanted to ‘adorn the necks of all women around the world with pearls’. The new exhibition at the V&A in London features jewellery from Elizabeth Taylor's (left). The Duchess of Cambridge (right) with a £48 pair of drop-pearl earrings by Belinda Hadden. History went full circle when Kate, Duchess of Cambridge, wore a £48 pair of drop-pearl earrings by Belinda Hadden, to the celebration of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee in 2012. The exhibition also features Liz. Taylor’s stunning Bulgari pendant earrings, a pearl-drop earring worn by. Charles I at his execution in 1649, a brooch given as a sentimental. gift to Queen Victoria by Prince Albert and a sparkling collection of. tiaras, including one with pearls ‘the size of walnuts’ made for the. wedding of Hannah de Rothschild who in the 1870s was the wealthiest. woman in England. Much of the show focuses on rare, natural pearls from the Arabian Gulf. Coco Chanel changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time, and ambassadors since have included Jackie Kennedy (pictured with son John Jr) and Princess Diana. Elizabeth Taylor's Bulgari pendant earrings: 'To find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing. She wore them in the film Ash Wednesday,' said co-curator Beatriz Chadour-Sampson. ‘Qatar and the other Gulf states have  money and they want to buy their heritage back,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘They now own Elizabeth Taylor’s pendant earrings and many other pieces including an eye-popping 1930s Cartier five-strand graduated pearl necklace. 'If you think that you need thousands of oysters to find a pearl it’s no surprise they have been seen as objects of desire through the ages.’ The Romans wore pearls as items of sheer luxury, while in medieval times they became a Christian symbol for purity and chastity, and then in the Renaissance symbols of  authority and wealth. They were even felt to have medicinal. properties – philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon is said to have. taken crushed pearls mixed with lemon juice as an elixir. ‘Pearls are still given at weddings today and  have an association with joy,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘But. at the same time they are directly associated with death. The classical. belief that pearls were created from the teardrops of the gods links. them with sadness and tears.’ Marvel: Visitors will be able to look at exhibits such as the Roseberry Pearl and Diamond Tiara. Rich and famous: Marilyn Monroe with Joe DiMaggio wearing her Mikimoto necklace, one of the few pieces of fine jewellery she actually owned, and Lady Rosebery's tiara (right), 1878. Their cachet has continued into the age of Hollywood and celebrity, helped by the rise of cultivated and imitation pearls. Coco Chanel changed the fashion by happily wearing genuine and fake pearls at the same time, and ambassadors since have included Jackie Kennedy and Princess Diana. ‘What fascinated me is the variety of pearls, the international trade and the worldwide obsession,’ says Chadour-Sampson. ‘Rubies and emeralds have been fashionable at certain times, and even diamonds go in and out of favour, but the appeal of pearls appears to  have been continuous through all jewellery history.’ Pearls is at the V&A (in partnership with the Qatar Museums Authority), Sept 21-Jan 19. ‘A five-string graduated natural Gulf pearl necklace made by Cartier in the 1930s. He sourced his pearls directly in the Gulf that were then mounted in Paris. This really embodies the endurance of the divers and the rarity of the pearls.’ ‘Worn by Charles I when he was beheaded in 1649. It’s very difficult to authenticate these things, but in this case the family has a note saying what this pearl is and it’s written in the hand of Queen Mary II, his granddaughter.’ ‘George III, who was normally known for his restraint, dressed to dazzle with jewels at festive events and is recorded as having a special interest in buttons and button-making.’ ‘A wedding present when Hannah de Rothschild, the richest woman in England, married a wealthy young politician, Archibald, 5th earl of Rosebery. She died 12 years later and Rosebery then presented it to his daughter-in-law. The New York Times described the pearls in the tiara as being as big as walnuts.’ ‘Necklace given to Monroe by Joe DiMaggio on their honeymoon. It was bought in Japan directly from Mikimoto, so the quality is very good.’ ‘A heart-shaped openwork gold brooch given to Victoria by Prince Albert in 1843 on their third wedding anniversary. It’s surmounted by a crown with four Scottish freshwater pearls from the River Tay.’ ‘Liz Taylor was crazy about jewellery, and even wrote a book, My Love Affair with Jewellery. To find a pair of drop pearls of such quality and size is astonishing. She wore them in the film Ash Wednesday.’ ‘The Abernethy pearl is the largest Scottish river pearl ever found – it was found in the 1960s. River pearls tend to be smaller than saltwater pearls.’","output":"The Pearl of Asia, the largest pearl in the world, which was once part of the crown jewels of the Moghul empire, is on display at the V&A museum in London.

These glands are distributed across the majority of the human body's surface area, predominantly found on the forehead, soles of the feet, palms of the hands, and the chest. When the body's core temperature rises due to factors such as hot weather, physical exercise, or emotional stress, the autonomic nervous system triggers the eccrine glands to release sweat. As the sweat is excreted onto the skin and exposed to the air, it evaporates, producing a cooling effect on the body's surface. This process helps to regulate body temperature and maintain it within an optimal range, usually around 98.6°F (37°C). By dissipating excess heat, sweating prevents the body from overheating, which is crucial for the proper functioning of internal organs and various biochemical processes necessary for survival. Among other animals, different species have evolved distinct strategies to cope with hot temperatures. While some animals, such as dogs and birds, rely predominantly on panting (i.e., rapid, shallow breathing) to cool down, other mammals like elephants and horses also utilize sweat glands to regulate their body temperature. The use of sweat glands is more common in mammals, whereas most birds, reptiles, and amphibians rely on alternate cooling mechanisms. In conclusion, given the facts provided, humans use sweat as a primary means of adjusting to hot temperatures, consistent with their nature as animals. This process is enabled by the eccrine glands that are distributed across the body, which secrete sweat onto the skin to successfully facilitate temperature regulation. Similar adaptations can also be observed in certain other mammal species, highlighting the importance of thermoregulation mechanisms across the animal kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The event brought together various countries and international organizations to pledge financial and technical support for rebuilding Iraq's economy and infrastructure. The conference aimed to address the numerous challenges faced by Iraq, such as political instability, security threats, and a struggling economy. During the conference, several key economic reconstruction pledges were made to support Iraq's recovery process. These commitments aimed to boost the nation's economy, improve public services, foster a conducive environment for private sector development, and promote sustainable growth in the long run. 1. Financial assistance: Donor countries and organizations pledged billions of dollars in grants and loans, which were crucial for immediate post-war reconstruction efforts. The United States pledged 20 billion, with other countries and international organizations pledging an additional 13 billion to support infrastructure projects, social services, and economic development. 2. Debt relief: Iraq's heavy debt burden, accumulated during the rule of Saddam Hussein, created an impediment to its economic progress. Several creditor countries, particularly members of the Paris Club, agreed to provide substantial debt relief for Iraq, reducing the burden and allowing the country to invest in growth and human development. 3. Technical assistance: International organizations like the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the United Nations pledged support in providing technical expertise to help Iraq rebuild its institutional capacity, develop sound economic policies, and improve governance and public administration. 4. Private sector development: Encouraging private sector growth plays a crucial role in the country's long-term economic recovery. Participants at the Madrid Conference acknowledged the importance of supporting private businesses and entrepreneurs through policy reforms, infrastructure investments, and access to finance. 5. Job creation and human development: A significant focus at the Madrid Conference was the need to create jobs and promote human development in Iraq. Hence, several pledges were made to invest in education, healthcare, and social programs, aiming to enhance the skill level of Iraq's workforce and improve the overall welfare of the population. In conclusion, the Madrid Conference played a pivotal role in laying the foundation for Iraq's post-war economic reconstruction. The pledges made during the conference sought to address various aspects of the country's recovery, including financial assistance, debt relief, technical expertise, private sector development, and human development investments. These commitments reflected the international community's collective efforts in stabilizing and revitalizing the Iraqi economy, supporting long-term growth, and improving the lives of its people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Option 1: starts using a large ax on the sides of some bushes. - This option could fit as it provides a logical continuation of the man being in his front yard, assuming he wants to trim the bushes. Option 2: is holding a bow and arrow. - This option seems out of place, as there is no clear connection between the man standing in his front yard and using a bow and arrow. Option 3: is using a leaf blower attached to his back. - This option is also a potential fit, as using a leaf blower in a front yard is a common activity for yard maintenance. Option 4: puts out a piece of paper and begins to scrape up the leaves and dirt in front of him. - This option is less plausible. Typically, one would use a rake or other yard tool, rather than a piece of paper, to clean up leaves and dirt. Based on the analysis, option 1 and 3 seem to be the most fitting endings for the paragraph, as they both involve activities related to yard maintenance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: How could being someones taxi for the day while they run errands be good for the world? Possible A: gain, supplies, helpful, help people, add to  Why is \\"help people\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Help people\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense because it inherently captures the essence of empathy, community support, and human connection. The act of being someone's taxi for the day while they run errands showcases a sense of personal investment and care for the well-being of others, which is a fundamental aspect of human nature. This detailed explanation will cover various aspects such as emotional intelligence, social responsibility, environmental impact, and potential ripple effects of this helpful act. 1. Emotional Intelligence: Helping others is a quintessential example of emotional intelligence, which includes the ability to understand, interpret, and manage our own emotions and those of others. By assisting someone in their daily errands, the person providing the taxi service demonstrates empathy and has the capacity to put themselves in the other person's shoes. This selflessness and compassionate behavior are not only appreciated but also aligned with human common sense values. 2. Social Responsibility: Being a helpful member of society is to acknowledge that we exist within a network of individuals, each with complementary strengths and needs. By offering assistance to someone who may not have the means or ability to run their errands efficiently, one actively contributes to the well-being of society as a whole. This sense of social responsibility is ingrained in most humans, making \\"help people\\" a common-sense answer. 3. Environmental Impact: Although this may not be the primary reason for why \\"help people\\" is aligned with human common sense, there are potential indirect environmental benefits to providing taxi services to someone. Consolidating trips and carpooling reduces individual car usage, leading to lower greenhouse gas emissions and reduced road congestion. This positive environmental impact further solidifies the choice to help as a sensible and responsible decision. 4. Ripple Effects: Another reason \\"help people\\" is regarded as a common-sense answer is due to the potential ripple effects it may create. Kindness and assistance often inspire recipients to pass on the generosity to others, causing a chain reaction of benevolence. This virtuous cycle may reinforce a sense of community and belonging, ultimately creating a better and more connected world. In conclusion, the answer \\"help people\\" aligns with human common sense because it encompasses emotional intelligence, social responsibility, environmental impact, and potential positive ripple effects. These elements combine to represent the fundamental values and instincts that drive humans to be helpful and mutually supportive members of society. By offering transportation assistance to someone in need, one becomes a valuable part of a collective effort to foster compassion, understanding, and progress in this interconnected world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, it is not possible to affirm that every politician loves to help their people and do the right thing. a). yes - This answer is incorrect because it generalizes all politicians, which doesn't account for the diversity of motivations and actions among them. b). it is not possible to tell - This answer might seem tempting, but choosing this option would imply a lack of understanding of the varied nature of politicians.

How to increase urine flow  Visit your doctor for a prostate exam after age 50.  The prostate is a gland in men that sits low in the abdomen, and when it gets enlarged it squeezes the urethra. This causes slow flow, difficulty starting to urinate, dribbling, and a weak stream. Possible answers: [i] Follow your doctor's instructions regarding how to be prepared. For women, a typical menstrual cycle generally lasts about 40 days. [ii] All of these conditions may lead to an enlarged prostate, especially when you are urinating. If this is the case, go to your doctor and have them measure the fluid in your urine. [iii] Notice if you have any previous painful semen or pain. These symptoms can indicate that you may have an urinary tract infection or have another medical issue. [iv] It is very common for men to get enlarged prostates after the age of 60. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or bph, which is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. Answer:","output":"[iv] It is very common for men to get enlarged prostates after the age of 60. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH, which is a noncancerous enlargement of the prostate. In order to increase urine flow and alleviate the symptoms of BPH, it's essential to adhere to a healthy lifestyle and follow specific recommendations tailored to your needs. Some potential solutions may include: 1. Medications: Your doctor might prescribe medications such as alpha-blockers (e.g., tamsulosin) to relax the muscles in the prostate and bladder neck, allowing for better urine flow. Another class of drugs, called 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g., finasteride), may be used to shrink the size of the prostate, leading to improved urine flow over time. 2. Minimize irritants: Caffeine, alcohol, and acidic or spicy foods can irritate the bladder and worsen urinary symptoms. Reducing the consumption of these irritants might help increase urine flow. 3. Stay well-hydrated: Drink plenty of water throughout the day to promote healthy urinary system function and prevent dehydration. Aim for approximately 6-8 glasses of water daily, although specific needs may vary depending on your activity level and overall health. 4. Double-voiding technique: After urinating, wait for a moment before trying to urinate again. This can help ensure that your bladder is completely empty, which may help increase urine flow over time. 5. Pelvic floor exercises: Strengthening the pelvic floor muscles can help improve bladder control and alleviate some urinary symptoms associated with an enlarged prostate. 6. Maintain a healthy weight: Excessive weight can put pressure on the bladder and contribute to urinary problems. Eating a balanced diet and engaging in regular physical activity can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. 7. Minimize stress: Stress can directly affect bladder function and exacerbate urinary symptoms. Practicing relaxation techniques, such as deep breathing exercises or meditation, can help manage stress levels. 8. Timed voiding: Set a schedule for regular bathroom breaks, regardless of whether you feel the urge to urinate. This will help train your bladder to empty at specific intervals, thereby potentially increasing urine flow. If your symptoms are severe or do not improve with lifestyle changes and medications, your doctor may suggest more invasive treatments, such as surgery or minimally invasive procedures (e.g., Urolift®). It is crucial to have open communication with your healthcare provider and discuss the best approach to manage your enlarged prostate and improve urine flow."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Which language is this?","output":"The language of the sentence you provided, \\"Ale to sauver sa peau ho udrží v plné přeměně, dokonce I po smrti\\" is a mixture of different languages: Czech, French, and Slovak. These three languages belong to different groups of the Indo-European family.  Let's break down the sentence: 1. \\"Ale to\\" - This is Czech and Slovak. In Czech, it means \\"but it\\". Similarly, in Slovak, it translates to \\"but the\\".   2. \\"sauver sa peau\\" - This is a French phrase which literally translates to \\"save his skin\\". It's an idiomatic expression equivalent to the English phrase \\"save one's own neck\\", meaning to escape from a dangerous or difficult situation.     3. \\"ho udrží v plné přeměně\\" - This phrase appears Czech, where \\"ho udrží\\" translates to \\"it keeps him\\" and \\"v plné přeměně\\" translates to \\"in full metamorphosis\\". 4. \\"dokonce i po smrti\\" - This final phrase is again Czech, which translates to English as \\"even after death\\". In conclusion, while the sentence consists predominantly of Czech, elements of French and possibly Slovak are present as well. The analysis, however, is complicated by the fact the sentence doesn't seem to be properly structured in any of these languages, and the use of these languages interchangeably in a single sentence is unusual. The translation would be roughly equivalent to: \\"But it saves his skin, it keeps him in full transformation, even after death.\\" Please note, due to the mixed nature of the languages and the sentence's presentation, it could involve some sort of idiom or vernacular phrase that could alter its intended meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Elaine Thompson was the first female to win gold in both the 100m and 200m since which track star of the 1980s?","output":"Yes, I can help you with that question. Elaine Thompson, a Jamaican sprinter, won gold medals in both the 100 meters and 200 meters during the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games. She became the first woman to achieve this incredible feat since Florence Griffith-Joyner, better known as Flo-Jo.  Florence Griffith-Joyner was an American track and field athlete who dominated the events in the 1980s. Born on December 21, 1959, in Los Angeles, California, Flo-Jo rose to fame and solidified her status as an unstoppable force in women's athletics. Her remarkable ability to triumph in both short-distance sprints contributed to her success during her athletic career. Flo-Jo's groundbreaking accomplishment transpired during the 1988 Seoul Olympic Games, where she made history by securing gold medals in both the 100 meters and 200 meters races. This incredible performance was accompanied by world records that are still unbeaten to this day; she completed the 100 meters race in 10.49 seconds and the 200 meters race in 21.34 seconds. Alongside her individual victories, Flo-Jo also played a role in the United States' successful bid to win the 4x100 meters relay, which crowned her with a third gold medal. She additionally took home a silver medal in the 4x400 meters relay. Regarded as one of the fastest women in the world, Florence Griffith-Joyner's widespread influence and legacy was further expanded upon in 2016 when Elaine Thompson achieved a similar level of success. Thompson's double-gold victory at the Rio Olympic Games marked the end of a 28-year wait since the last time a woman had dominated both the 100 meters and 200 meters events, paying homage to the insurmountable talent of the legendary Flo-Jo."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Greenwich   is on the River, five miles from the middle of London, and its history is two thousand years old. The first English people were fishermen there, and they named the place Greenwich, meaning \\"green village\\". Later the English kings and queens lived at Greenwich in their beautiful places. The name of the earliest palace was Placentia. Its windows were made of glass--the first in England. But trouble was coming to Greenwich. In 1649, a war started in England and for eleven years there was no king. The men who had worked for him at Placentia decided to live in the place themselves. They sold all its beautiful things, and bought small pieces of the palace garden with money. Finally, the war ended and King Charles II came back. But Placentia was falling down. So King Charles built a new and bigger palace, which is now open to the public. At this time, Charles was worried about losing so many of its ships at sea because their sailors did not know how to tell exactly where they were. So in 1675, Charles made John Flamsteed, the first astronomer   in England, try to find the answer. Flamsteed worked in a new building on the high ground in Greenwich Park. From it with a telescope which he made himself, Flamsteed could look all round the sky. And he did, night after night, for twenty years. Carrying on Flamsteed's work a hundred years later, an astronomer called Harrison finally made a clock which told the time at sea, and helped sailors to know where they were.You can see Harrison's clock, still working, in Greenwich's museum of the sea. Because of Flamsteed's work, every country in the world now tells its time by Greenwich time. Question: Charles made John Flamsteed try to find   _  .

Question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Talk radio. Yes or no? Answer: While talk radio has historically been associated with AM/FM, starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of podcasts . Question: when did talk radio begin in the U.S.? Answer:","output":"Talk radio, as a format, has its roots in the early days of radio broadcasting in the United States. However, it wasn't until the 1940s and 1950s that the format began to take shape as we recognize it today.  In the 1920s and 1930s, the Golden Age of Radio, radio broadcasting was largely characterized by live musical performances, comedy, drama, and news programs. During this time, the idea of individuals expressing their opinions and engaging in discussions on air was not a significant element of radio programming.  It was in the 1940s that several factors contributed to the rise of talk radio as a format. First, the development of technology, like the advent of magnetic tape, allowed for easier recording, editing, and playback of radio content. This gave broadcasters the ability to create pre-recorded interviews and discussion programs, making it less difficult to include talk-based content in radio programming schedules.  Second, the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) decision to end its \\"Mayflower Doctrine\\" in 1949 led to a more open environment for political discussion on the radio. The Mayflower Doctrine had essentially prohibited radio stations from editorializing in their news coverage and expressing political opinions. With the end of this policy, radio stations became free to engage in political debates and commentary, laying the groundwork for talk radio as we know it today.  Throughout the late 1940s and early 1950s, the popularity of talk radio began to grow, with a number of local radio stations starting to experiment with this format. One notable early talk radio show was \\"Open Mic\\" hosted by Barry Gray in 1945 at New York City's WMCA. Talk radio continued to expand during the 1950s and 1960s with shows hosted by personalities like Joe Pyne, David Susskind, and Long John Nebel. The 1970s saw the development and popularization of syndicated radio talk shows. This meant that pre-recorded talk radio programs were distributed to multiple radio stations across the country, allowing for a larger audience reach. The repeal of the Fairness Doctrine in 1987, which had required equal time for opposing points of view on controversial topics, led to further growth of talk radio. This allowed for the emergence of politically-oriented talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh, who began his nationally syndicated show in 1988.  In conclusion, although there isn't an exact date when talk radio officially began in the U.S., it can be traced back to the 1940s and 1950s when radio stations began experimenting with talk-based content. The development of new technology and changes in FCC regulations paved the way for the format to grow, ultimately leading to its modern form that continues to be popular today."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Bacteria enters the body - Bloodstream - Cells in the body are attacked - Cells are killed Answer:","output":"The final step of the process after cells are killed is the activation of the immune system to eliminate the bacteria and repair the damage caused by the bacterial infection.  Here's an overview of the process: 1. Bacteria enters the body: Bacteria can enter the body through various routes like a break in the skin, inhalation, ingestion, or contact with mucous membranes. 2. Bloodstream: Bacteria can travel through the bloodstream and reach virtually any part of the body. In some cases, bacteria can also produce harmful toxins that can be carried by the bloodstream. 3. Cells in the body are attacked: Bacteria can attack various types of cells in the body, either directly or by hijacking resources like nutrients and oxygen to multiply. 4. Cells are killed: As bacteria multiply and infiltrate tissues, they can damage and ultimately kill cells. The damage caused to the cells and tissues may lead to inflammation, tissue destruction, and organ dysfunction. Final step: Activation of the immune system - After cells are killed, the immune system kicks in to fight off the bacterial infection. Components of the immune system, like white blood cells (WBCs), recognize and respond to the presence of foreign invaders (bacteria).  - The immune system initiates both an innate immune response (non-specific defenses like phagocytosis) and an adaptive immune response (targeted antibody production) to neutralize and eliminate bacteria and their toxic byproducts. - This immune response may involve inflammation and fever, as well as other symptoms that aid in fighting the infection. - Once the bacteria have been neutralized, the immune system also initiates tissue repair and healing processes to restore the affected area to its normal function. It's important to note that this is a simplified overview of a complex biological process. In some cases, the immune system might be weakened or unable to clear the bacterial infection, which could require medical treatment such as antibiotics to support the immune response."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: What little there was, started with Charles de Wailly's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773–80), and Claude Nicolas Ledoux's Barriere des Bonshommes (1785–89). First-hand evidence of Greek architecture was of very little importance to the French, due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines that sought to discern the principles of the Greeks instead of their mere practices. It would take until Laboustre's Neo-Grec of the second Empire for the Greek revival to flower briefly in France. What is the answer to this question: How concerned was France with Greek architecture?","output":"In the context of the article, French concern with Greek architecture was limited during the periods described. While the French did show interest in emulating Greek architectural principles, the adaptation of actual Greek architecture was less of a priority for them, particularly due to the influence of Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines.  In the late 18th century, there were only a few examples of buildings influenced by Greek architecture in France, such as Charles de Wailly's crypt in the church of St Leu-St Gilles (1773–80) and Claude Nicolas Ledoux's Barriere des Bonshommes (1785–89). These examples indicate that Greek-inspired architecture was not at the forefront of French architectural design during this era. The French approach to Greek architecture changed from simply emulating the principles of Greek architecture to incorporating more explicit elements of Greek style only during the second French Empire under the influence of Laboustre's Neo-Grec. However, this period of renewed interest in Greek architecture was fleeting. Moreover, the French were more focused on Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines, which sought to understand and apply the underlying principles of Greek architecture rather than strictly adhering to their specific practices. This focus on the essence of Greek architecture, rather than directly mimicking their architectural styles, indicates that the French were more concerned with the philosophical aspects of Greek architecture than its physical representations. In conclusion, France's concern with Greek architecture was relatively subdued. While there were instances of French architects incorporating Greek elements into their works, the more significant influence came from Marc-Antoine Laugier's doctrines that sought to determine and apply the principles of Greek architecture. France's interest in physically replicating Greek architectural styles only emerged briefly during Laboustre's Neo-Grec in the second Empire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It's a matter of personal preference, but most people either use Windows or a flavor of UNIX. If you're using Windows, it's a good idea to install a UNIX environment like Cygwin or MinGW. You'll generally want to make sure whatever environment you're using includes the following:   GCC (the Gnu compiler). If you're using Windows, you can install it in Cygwin or MinGW. Binutils is a collection of tools used for manipulating object files. Again, if you're using Windows, you can install it in Cygwin. A good text editor. Vim and emacs are commonly used in UNIX environments. Windows users can use Notepad, or check out Notepad++ for a multi-tab upgrade. Perl and/or Python.

If you do feel daring enough to code a bootloader, check out Rolling Your Own Bootloader on OSDev.org. The kernel is the core of your operating system, providing an interface between the user and the computer hardware. There are monolithic kernels and micro kernels. Monolithic kernels implement all the services in the kernel, while microkernels have a small kernel combined with user daemons implementing services.

Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made. Claiming a person can't do their job because of their race is sort of like the textbook definition of racism.\\" But he did not retract his endorsement of Trump, made last week, and he said he does not believe Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton is \\"the answer.\\" Ryan made his comments during an appearance at a women's shelter in Washington, D.C. In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the Midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.'''

The sailors aboard the Emma first encounter the Alert abandoned at sea, rather than crewed by Cthulhu cultists and taken over by Emma's crew after a violent confrontation as in the original story. Additionally, the film depicts the narrator present at the time of his great-uncle's death, who dies peacefully in his sleep, rather than being summoned upon the mysterious death of his great-uncle, who was presumably killed by Cthulhu cultists in the original short story. The narrator (Matt Foyer) notes that Inspector Legrasse, who had directed the raid on cultists in backwoods Louisiana, died before the narrator's investigation began. In the original story, the narrator does not seem to end in a lunatic asylum or experience any mysterious nightmares himself.

Name: The individual's full name is Martin Riz. This could provide information on his possible Italian, or another nationality as names can be indicative of cultural or national origin. 2. Birth Date: Martin Riz was born on September 16, 1980. Knowing his birth date allows us to determine his age, which would be crucial when discussing career length or period of activity. As of 2022, this would make him 41 years old. 3. Nationality: Martin Riz is explicitly identified as an Italian. From this, we can infer that he is either born in Italy, has Italian heritage, or both. Nationality may also affect his training landscape and opportunities, skiing culture he grew up with, and could influence the types of competitions he has access to or prominence in. 4. Profession/Activity: The biography states that Martin Riz is a ski mountaineer. This specifies not only the broader category of 'skiing' but further narrow the field to mountaineering which involves climbing mountains often with special equipment and methodologies that might be separate from traditional or cross-country skiing. This would indicate a high level of physical fitness, technical skill, and potentially an interest or background in outdoor and high-altitude activities. It could also indicate participation in specific competitions or events catered to ski mountaineering sports and related disciplines. Therefore, based on these details, we are dealing with an experienced and probably accomplished ski mountaineer who was born in Italy (or of Italian descent) in 1980. His career choice may reflect his Italian origins, potentially influenced by the country's geographical features, notably the presence of the Alps and the Apennines, which are popular for winter sports. This basic information may serve as a foundation for further investigation into Martin Riz's life though more information would be needed to provide further detail, including elements like career milestones, notable achievements, personal life, etc."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: salt, checkers, shopping mall, old west, meat store  Why is \\"old west\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","output":"\\"Old West\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it refers to a historical period and geographical location where general stores were prevalent, and the items mentioned - whiskey, grain, and saddles - were common goods during that time. The Old West, also known as the American Wild West or the Western Frontier, was a period in American history during the 19th and early 20th centuries, characterized by the westward expansion of European settlers. It mostly took place in the western half of the United States, including the Great Plains, the Rocky Mountains, and the Southwest. During this era, general stores were often the primary source of supplies for settlers, cowboys, and pioneers. These stores provided a wide range of goods, including food, clothing, tools, and other necessities required for everyday life in the harsh and rugged environment of the Old West. Among the commonly available items were whiskey, grain, and saddles: 1. Whiskey was a popular beverage and was consumed for various reasons such as pleasure, relaxation, or medicinal purposes. It could be used as a painkiller, an antiseptic, or a bartering commodity. 2. Grain was an integral part of the settlers' diets, serving as the main ingredient for making bread and other staple foods. It could also be used as animal feed for livestock, which was an essential part of life on the frontier. 3. Saddles were necessary equipment for horseback riding, which was the primary mode of transportation in the Old West. They were indispensable for traveling long distances, working on cattle drives, and engaging in various other activities that required mobility and speed. In contrast, the other options provided - salt, checkers, shopping mall, and meat store - do not offer a contextually appropriate or historically accurate setting for buying whiskey, grain, and saddles at a general store.

Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - The notion of postdramatic theatre was established by German theatre researcher Hans-Thies Lehmann in his book \\"Postdramatic Theatre\\", summarising a number of tendencies and stylistic traits occurring in avant-garde theatre since the end of the 1960s. The theatre which Lehmann calls postdramatic is not primarily focused on the drama in itself, but evolves a performative aesthetic in which the text of the performance is put in a special relation to the material situation of the performance and the stage.   - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Eugen Bertolt Friedrich Brecht (10 February 1898  14 August 1956) was a German poet, playwright, and theatre director of the 20th century. He made contributions to dramaturgy and theatrical production, the latter through the tours undertaken by the Berliner Ensemble  the post-war theatre company operated by Brecht and his wife, long-time collaborator and actress Helene Weigel.  - The Spree is a river that flows through the Saxony, Brandenburg and Berlin states of Germany, and in the Ústí nad Labem region of the Czech Republic. Approximately in length, it is a left bank tributary of the River Havel, which itself flows into the Elbe and then the North Sea. It is the river on which the original centre of Berlin was built.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - An urban area is a human settlement with high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets and in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources leads to human impact on the environment.

Background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  Paragraph: Scientists studied water stratification in two saltwater lakes. they were trying to find out why the fish population decreased in Long lake, and was very healthy and abundant in Shoal lake. They found out the phenomenon occurred more often in Long lake, leading to very many unpleasant chain effects.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which lake had a lower net productivity?","output":"Based on the provided information, Long Lake experienced a decrease in fish population due to more frequent water stratification compared to Shoal Lake. Water stratification limits nutrient mixing between layers, which in turn affects primary production by limiting photosynthetic processes. As a result, there would be lower net productivity in the ecosystem. In this scenario, Long Lake had a lower net productivity due to the higher occurrence of water stratification, which led to adverse effects on the overall health and abundance of its fish population. On the other hand, Shoal Lake maintained a healthy and abundant fish population, indicating higher net productivity in comparison to Long Lake."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Problem:Passage: Norte Chico sites are known for their density of large sites with immense architecture. Haas argues that the density of sites in such a small area is globally unique for a nascent civilization. During the third millennium BC, Norte Chico may have been the most densely populated area of the world (excepting, possibly, Northern China). The Supe, Pativilca, Fortaleza, and Huaura River valleys each have several related sites. Evidence from the ground-breaking work of 1973 at Aspero, at the mouth of the Supe Valley, suggested a site of approximately 13 hectares (32 acres). Surveying of the midden suggested extensive prehistoric construction activity. Small-scale terracing is noted, along with more sophisticated platform mound masonry. As many as eleven artificial mounds \\"could be\\" present. Moseley calls these \\"Corporate Labor Platforms\\", given that their size, layout, and construction materials and techniques would have required an organized workforce.The survey of the northern rivers found sites between 10 and 100 ha (25 and 247 acres); between one and seven large platform mounds—rectangular, terraced pyramids—were discovered, ranging in size from 3,000 m3 (110,000 cu ft) to over 100,000 m3 (3,500,000 cu ft). Shady notes that the central zone of Caral, with monumental architecture, covers an area of just over 65 hectares (160 acres). Six platform mounds, numerous smaller mounds, two sunken circular plazas, and a variety of residential architecture were also discovered at this site.The monumental architecture was constructed with quarried stone and river cobbles. Using reed \\"shicra-bags\\", some of which have been preserved, laborers would have hauled the material to sites by hand. Roger Atwood of Archaeology magazine describes the process: Armies of workers would gather a long, durable grass known as shicra in the highlands above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive retaining wall of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags. In this way, the people of Norte Chico achieved formidable architectural success. The largest of the platforms mounds at Caral, the Piramide Mayor, measures 160 by 150 m (520 by 490 ft) and rises 18 m (59 ft) high. In its summation of the 2001 Shady paper, the BBC suggests workers would have been \\"paid or compelled\\" to work on centralized projects of this sort, with dried anchovies possibly serving as a form of currency. Mann points to \\"ideology, charisma, and skilfully timed reinforcement\\" from leaders. Solution:","output":"1. What is unique about the density of Norte Chico sites according to Haas?

Specifically, it would be a description of a scientific process that occurs within a hydrogen bomb, also known as a thermonuclear bomb. To provide a detailed answer: Hydrogen bombs, or H-bombs, rely on the nuclear fusion process, in which lighter atomic nuclei combine to form heavier atomic nuclei. In the case of an H-bomb, isotopes of hydrogen – deuterium and tritium – are used as fuel for the fusion reaction. When a hydrogen bomb is detonated, a fission bomb (similar to an atomic bomb, fueled by the splitting of uranium or plutonium nuclei) is used as a trigger. The energy released by the fission bomb causes the temperature and pressure around the hydrogen fuel to rise dramatically. This extreme environment causes the hydrogen isotopes' nuclei to combine and form helium, releasing an immense amount of energy in the form of an explosion. This process is also accompanied by the release of high-energy neutrons, which can cause further fission in the bomb's fissile material, thereby amplifying the overall energy output. In summary, the answer to the question lies in the description of the process of nuclear fusion that takes place within a hydrogen bomb using isotopes of hydrogen, such as deuterium and tritium, as fuel. The fusion process in an H-bomb is initiated by a fission trigger, which creates the necessary conditions for lighter hydrogen nuclei to combine, releasing vast amounts of energy in the form of a powerful explosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Golf Digest has the incredible conclusion to the story of Valentino Dixon, a 48-year-old who caught the magazine's attention six years ago, when it profiled the detailed colored-pencil drawings he did of golf courses, a passion that began when a warden asked him to illustrate Augusta National’s 12th hole using a photograph. He spent as many as 10 hours a day drawing, and the magazine dove into his art as well as his story. It seemed off. He was serving a 39-years-to-life sentence for the August 1991 murder of 17-year-old Torriano Jackson at a Buffalo street party, reports the AP. What Golf Digest found when it started digging didn't exactly inspire confidence in the conviction: Though the gun was Dixon's, there was no physical evidence, unreliable witnesses, and another man's confession to the crime just two days after it occurred, among other things. Its 2012 article spurred national media coverage and interest from the Georgetown University Prison Reform Project, but as of 2017, things seemed at a dead end. The article explains the \\"confluence of factors\\" that went on to fuel Dixon's vacated conviction, which included the magazine's work and attention on the case from the Erie County district attorney’s wrongful convictions unit.

Here is a news article: Advisers to Mitt Romney are split over how broadly and aggressively to attack President Barack Obama for his handling of foreign policy following the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya, according to top Republicans close to the campaign.      Some aides are arguing that the campaign has been given a huge gift: a new opening to argue White House failure and incompetence. “Across the board – domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues – President Obama has been outmatched by events,” said a Romney adviser advocating an aggressive response to the chaos in the Middle East. “He’s an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he’s been outmatched.”      Text Size -      +      reset      And indeed, POLITICO has learned that Romney now plans a major speech on foreign policy at some point after Wednesday’s debate, probably next week. The speech will focus on “a failed foreign policy and how we arrived at this moment, where people are storming our embassies, [and] the Iranians are storming ahead with their nuclear program,” said a senior Republican close to the campaign.      (PHOTOS: 10 slams on Obama and Benghazi)      “You can start to go around the world and look at all the crises, and our deteriorating relations with certain countries,” the Republican added.      But the campaign is sticking with its day-to-day message on the economy — a view promoted internally by Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist, who is among those arguing that issue is what voters will use to judge whether Obama deserves a second term. “As messy as the world looks, it’s not voters’ primary concern,” a top aide said. “And if we’re not talking about their primary concern, we’re not winning.”      The truth is Romney now finds himself besieged with conflicting advice, internally and externally: Attack Obama harder. Offer a detailed agenda. Pivot to foreign policy. Pivot back to the economy.      Romney’s response: Ignore it and stick to the game plan, which does not include any serious, sustained detour into foreign policy. His internal polls show the same thing as Obama’s: Voters just don’t care much about foreign policy in this election. This is the reason Obama was so quick to drop his attack on Romney for not mentioning the troops or Afghanistan in his convention speech. Voters didn’t seem to care.      (Also on POLITICO: Reid defends Rice, W.H. on Libya)      This is basically the Stuart Stevens doctrine. And regardless of the passionate arguments of some other aides, including several outside foreign-policy advisers, the boss is going with Stevens on this until further notice.      That doesn’t mean they won’t talk foreign policy at all. Romney’s running mate Paul Ryan previewed the campaign’s argument on “Fox News Sunday,” telling Chris Wallace: “We’re seeing the ugly fruits of the Obama foreign policy unravel around the world on our TV screens. Syria — you’ve got 20,000 dead people. Iran is closer to a nuclear weapon. The Middle East peace process is in shambles, and we have our flags being burned all around the world. Russia is thwarting us at every stage in the process. This is a weak foreign policy with terrible results, which makes us less safe.”      For now, Romney and Ryan plan to avoid discussing the Libya attack as an isolated issue, but instead plan to use the issue “to kick-start a broader conversation about the failure of Obama’s foreign policy, around the region and in many parts of the world,” a Romney aide said.      Romney and Ryan will answer questions about Libya when asked in interviews, but plan to say very little for now about the death of Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans in what the administration is now calling a “terrorist” attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya. ||||| The Obama administration and re-election campaign appeared to give conflicting statements Sunday about the president’s knowledge on the terror attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya, according to the Romney camp, which has joined in calling for a clearer explanation of the assault and the U.S. response.      Obama campaign senior adviser David Axelrod said on CNN’s “State of the Union” that the president called the Sept. 11 strike an act of terror “the day after it happened.”      However, David Plouffe, a senior White House adviser, said later Sunday that “in the days after” the attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya, it was “not clear” the strike was an act of terror.      “This ... obviously was a very, very fast-moving period of time,” Plouffe said on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” \\"I think now, based on the recommendations and the investigation of the intelligence community, they made the decision to conclude that this was a terrorist attack.”      Axelrod was apparently referring to Obama's public statement on Sept. 12 in which he referred to \\"acts of terror.\\" However, Obama did not explicitly label the attack terrorism at the time -- no administration official did so until the following week.      Ryan Williams, Romney campaign spokesman, said in a statement: \\"The Obama White House and the Obama campaign can’t seem to get their stories straight on the attack on our consulate in Libya. This morning, they offered conflicting stories on if and when the President thought the attack in Benghazi was a terrorist act.\\"      \\"These inconsistencies raise even more questions about the confusion and mixed messages that have marked the White House’s response from the very beginning,\\" Williams added.      U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice said Sept. 16 that the attack was a “spontaneous” response to an anti-Islamic movie trailer and not a pre-planned or terrorist attack.      Amid the questions about the administration's handling of the tragedy after the attack are concerns about security in the months preceding it. The New York Times reported Monday that the aggressive response by Libyan security guards to a small bombing in June may have given the U.S. team a false sense of security about the preparedness for a bigger strike. Training and security had been stepped up earlier this year at the recommendation of a Special Forces team.      Sen. Bob Corker also is among Republicans calling for more and complete answers about the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya -- where four Americans were killed -- calling the administration’s response so far “bizarre.”      “It seems that with each passing day, the situation surrounding the administration’s response to the terrorist attack on the U.S. Consulate in Libya becomes more bizarre. The United States Congress and the American people are still waiting to get straight answers,” Corker told National Intelligence Director James R. Clapper Jr. in the letter dated Sept. 29.      The letter follows Clapper taking responsibility last week for the administration’s initial response and acknowledging the assault was a “deliberate and organized terrorist attack.”      Corker, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, also said Plouffe’s comments on Sunday show the administration’s “deafening silence” on the attack in Libya is evidence of “gross negligence or incompetence.”      Rep. Peter King, the New York Republican who heads the House Homeland Security Committee, on Friday called for Rice to resign over her \\"misleading\\" statements. Democrats leaped to her defense, accusing King of playing politics.      Corker also joins in the growing concern about whether the consulate, as well as U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and the three other Americans killed, had adequate security and why FBI investigators have yet to reach the crime scene.      “Yet just 18 days ago the administration apparently judged that it was appropriate for our consulate to be lightly guarded and it was safe for our ambassador to come through the city with a small security detail,” Corker wrote. “What has changed in Libya in such a short time that even FBI agents, our most elite investigative personnel, cannot safely enter the city? What has led to such a precipitous decline?” ||||| WASHINGTON — An effective response by newly trained Libyan security guards to a small bombing outside the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi in June may have led United States officials to underestimate the security threat to personnel there, according to counterterrorism and State Department officials, even as threat warnings grew in the weeks before the recent attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans.      The guards’ aggressive action in June came after the mission’s defenses and training were strengthened at the recommendation of a small team of Special Forces soldiers who augmented the mission’s security force for several weeks in April while assessing the compound’s vulnerabilities, American officials said.      “That the local security did so well back in June probably gave us a false sense of security,” said one American official who has served in Libya, and who spoke on condition of anonymity because the F.B.I. is investigating the attack. “We may have fooled ourselves.”      The presence of the Special Forces team and the conclusions reached about the role of the Libyan guards offer new insight into the kind of security concerns that American officials had before the attack on Sept. 11.      Security at the mission has become a major issue as the Obama administration struggles to explain what happened during the attack, who was responsible and how the ambassador ended up alone.      Republicans and Democrats in recent days have demanded more detailed explanations from the White House and State Department on possible security lapses. “There were warnings,” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program on Sunday.      Just how much American and Libyan officials misread the threat has become even more evident as they analyze the skill with which the mortar attack at an annex a half mile away was carried out by the attackers. That assault, nearly three hours after the initial attack on the main diplomatic mission, killed two former Navy SEALs who were defending the compound.      With as few as four armed Americans and three armed Libyans guarding the mission as the attack began, Mr. Stevens’s own bodyguard was so far away that he needed to sprint across the compound under gunfire to reach the building where the ambassador was working at the time. But the bodyguard ultimately left without Mr. Stevens, who died of smoke inhalation.      And even after eight additional American security officers arrived from Tripoli, the roughly 30 Americans were surprised and outgunned again in the second attack, dependent on an ad hoc collection of Libyan militiamen to protect their retreat and avoid greater casualties, Libyan officials said.      American counterterrorism officials and Libyans on the scene say the mortar attack was most likely carried out by the same group of assailants who had attacked the mission and then followed the convoy of American survivors retreating to what they thought was a safe house.      The first mortar shell fell short, but the next two hit their mark in rapid succession with deadly precision, according to an account that David Ubben, one of Mr. Stevens’s security guards, told his father, Rex Ubben, which was supported by other American and Libyan officials.      “There are three villas inside and the walls are high, and the only house that got hit was the house we were in,” said Fathi el-Obeidi, a Libyan militia commander who came to help evacuate the Americans.      This indicated that many of the assailants were practiced at aiming their mortars, skills they learned in fighting Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi’s army.      “David did not draw a distinction between the attackers,” Rex Ubben said in a telephone interview. David Ubben, a 31-year old Iraq war veteran, was wounded in the mortar attack, and is recovering from his wounds at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. His father said he had declined to speak to reporters.      The Sept. 11 attack culminated several weeks of growing violence against Western and other diplomatic posts in Benghazi. State Department officials said they were aware of the worsening climate and took precautions. One American official who worked in the mission said the Americans there were able to get around with “appropriate prudence.”      One American official, who said he traded e-mails with Mr. Stevens three days before his death, said the ambassador did not mention any heightened security concerns. CNN, however, has reported that Mr. Stevens did express such worries in a diary that one of the network’s correspondents found at the ransacked mission.      Eric Schmitt reported from Washington, and David D. Kirkpatrick and Suliman Ali Zway from Benghazi, Libya. Steven Lee Myers and Michael S. Schmidt contributed reporting from Washington, and Kitty Bennett from Florida. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"This article is about a disagreement among Mitt Romney's advisors regarding the 2012 Presidential campaign.  Some of Romney’s advisors wanted to strongly criticize President Barack Obama's foreign policy, especially after the death of the U.S. ambassador to Libya. They believed that this would show that President Obama was not effectively handling world events. They wanted to argue that his policies led to people storming U.S. embassies and Iran moving forward with its nuclear program.  However, other advisors disagreed. They thought it was better to focus on the economy, as they believed that was what voters cared more about. These advisors thought that talking about foreign policy would distract from the issues that voters found most important. Romney ended up deciding not to focus too much on foreign policy. He believed, like President Obama, that voters didn't care much about foreign policy in this election. The article also talked about confusion and disagreement regarding the administration's response to the attack in Libya.

Sentence: \\"The scientist ran the rats through the maze.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","output":"A linguist would likely consider the sentence \\"The scientist ran the rats through the maze\\" to be acceptable linguistically. The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the basic structure of a modern English sentence: Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). It also conveys a clear and understandable meaning. However, it is essential to consider various linguistic perspectives to provide a detailed analysis. From a syntactic perspective, the sentence follows the established rules of English grammar, containing a subject (“the scientist”), a transitive verb (“ran”), a direct object (“the rats”), and a prepositional phrase (“through the maze”). The sentence is formed using the basic structure SVO, common in English, making it easy for readers to parse and understand.  From a morphological point of view, the sentence displays proper word formation by using recognizable morphemes - the smallest meaningful units of language. For instance, “scientist” is formed by adding the suffix “-ist” to the root word “science.” Similarly, “maze” and “rats” are singular nouns with recognizable suffixes, “-s” for plural form and “-es” for plural countable nouns. In terms of semantics, the sentence effectively conveys clear and coherent meaning. The reader can understand that there is a scientist who is running rats through a maze, implying an experiment or test involving rats navigating a labyrinth, which is a common scenario in psychological and neurological studies. From a lexical point of view, the vocabulary used in the sentence is appropriate and consistent with standard English usage. The words “scientist,” “ran,” “rats,” and “maze” are all easily understood by native English speakers and provide a clear and unambiguous meaning. Furthermore, the collocation of words, such as \\"scientist\\" and \\"rats,\\" create mental imagery and are common associations in the field of experimental psychology and neuroscience. Lastly, the sentence is also acceptable from a pragmatic standpoint. Pragmatics is focused on the context, intention, and interpretation of language use in different situations. The sentence is clear and effective in conveying the intended message across, as its context can be understood without much difficulty. The reader can infer that the scientist is likely conducting an experiment to study the rats’ cognitive or behavioral capabilities. In conclusion, a linguist would rate the sentence \\"The scientist ran the rats through the maze\\" as acceptable linguistically, as it follows the rules of syntax, morphology, semantics, lexical choice, and pragmatics. The sentence is grammatically correct, clearly conveys its intended meaning, and is coherent with the standards of modern English."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: King Kong Movie plot: In the Indonesian port city of Surabaya, Fred Wilson, a spokesman and promotions specialist for a huge oil conglomerate, Petrox, is preparing a voyage aboard one of the corporation's exploration ships. As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe. Jeff also talks about a strange wedding ritual the natives follow to placate the beast; that a beautiful woman must be \\"wed\\" to it to satisfy it's temper.Wilson believes Jeff is a spy and orders him detained until they can run a check on his credentials.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: To members of Generation X, Buick has long been a name associated (and perhaps unfairly) with octogenarian dreams or hangover heaving. But if the company has any say about the future of it’s brand image, this is slowly but surely changing. That’s right, 40-somethings, Buick is coming for you. But fret not, young’uns. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. When Buick introduced the Avenir concept during the 2015 North American International Auto Show in Detroit, showcasing it as the future design direction for the brand, many people speculated that the sheet-pull actually revealed a production-ready replacement for the company’s full-size sedan, the LaCrosse. A blink of an eye later (by automotive industry standards) the all-new 2017 LaCrosse took center runway during the 2015 Los Angeles Auto Show modeling a leaner, longer and lower profile. FOLLOW DAILY NEWS AUTOS ON FACEBOOK. 'LIKE' US HERE. Taking bold steps in unlikely directions, Buick’s focus and audience remains affluent but increasingly younger. Witness the new Envision compact crossover, which is quickly proving itself an international bestseller. Consider the new Cascada convertible, already winning awards and bringing some fresh air into the lineup. And when the flagship LaCrosse goes on sale later this month, starting at 32,065 (not including the 925 destination charge), expectations are nothing short of segment leading. In advance of the showroom gleam expected from the LaCrosse’s new-car shine, I spent a few hours experiencing the premium full-size sedan first-hand in Portland, Oregon. A full 300 pounds leaner yet packed with new technology and reengineered for better driving precision, the all-new 2017 LaCrosse, like its Pacific Northwest surroundings, proved unforgivingly pleasant. North American-designed for a global audience Design is a tricky thing. There will always be lovers and haters. In the case of the new Buick LaCrosse, rest assured there will be fewer haters. While not the most distinctive of automobiles, the LaCrosse’s lack of polarizing points is what’s attractive about the car. With luxury increasingly leaning toward notice-me-now styling, this Buick’s subtle strength lies in its ability to elicit appreciative stares instead of gawking glares. Indeed, the LaCrosse is equipped with a face your grandmother could love…but also your mother, your sister, your niece, your wife, your girlfriend, and all your lady friends in between. Putting forth a handsome visage without hint of a smile, sneer or smirk, the 2017 LaCrosse is the first Buick to feature the brand’s new badge. To become standard on all 2018 models, the LaCrosse literally puts center stage the recognizable crest with its diagonally arranged shields – now in red, silver and blue. It’s a small change with a significant return. “That’s a Buick?” seems almost a foolish question. Seemingly classic and modern at once, the LaCrosse features a traditional Buick “sweep spear” profile comprised of two distinct character lines. The first flows seamlessly from the grille, sweeping over the headlights and across the front fenders into the doors, where it fades. The second emerges from the front door handles, swells boldly into the masculine haunches, and melts away after drawing the eye to the arched deck lid and boomerang-shaped LED tail lamps. The result is more cohesive and dramatic than the awkwardly penned spear defining the previous LaCrosse. With a roofline 1.6 inches lower than the current LaCrosse, the 2017 model sits on a wheelbase that is stretched 2.7 inches, yet the car’s overall length grows by an almost indecipherable 0.6 inches. The big Buick also gains just 0.4 inches in the waist, although its wheels have been pushed outward 1.3 inches in the front and 1.1 inches in the rear. This lower, sportier stance provides the LaCrosse with a confident but not cocky road presence. After opening the large but lithe doors, getting into or out of the LaCrosse is easy. Once inside, perforated leather seats hug your frame as might your favorite old couch. Yet unlike that furnishing’s familiar mold of your favorite Netflix binge-watching position, the LaCrosse adds the benefit of support and cushioning in all the right places. Nearly every interior surface is covered in satisfyingly soft materials. And with trim colors named Brandy, Shale and Dark Atmosphere surrounding ebony accents, you might as well sink in. Clean design is the name of the interior’s game as the instrument panel features only a handful of familiar knobs for operating the audio and dual-zone climate control systems. Knob-turners can also go new-school via the 8-inch full-color touchscreen display, or employ voice commands to access additional features such as standard Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, and OnStar 4G LTE Wi-Fi hotspot integration. The touchscreen remains accessible when the vehicle is in motion, which is helpful for front-seat passengers who are assisting the driver in figuring out prompts and accessing information. A head-up display is standard on Premium models (41,065) and projects information such as speed, navigation, audio, performance, and certain active safety features onto the windshield within the driver’s line of sight. The LaCrosse’s HUD also allows for added personalization of brightness and visual height, which is particularly beneficial for someone of my barely-see-over-the-dash, five-foot-two stature. Tinkering with some new tech, the all-new Electronic Precision Shift proves awkward in instruction but relatively easy in execution. To shift into Drive, merely thumb in the controller’s side button and toggle right then down. Fittingly, accessing Reverse requires the reverse motion, and selecting Park requires a pressing of the “P” button on the top side of the shifter. (Stop snickering.) Neither odd nor optimal, the electronic gear selector frees up space upon and within the console itself. Where a traditional shifter’s mechanics would be, Buick instead provides a rubber-lined cubby for slide-free storage. Although the LaCrosse is not wanting in terms of beverage holders or snack cubbies, it does lack an overhead eyewear storage compartment. For my diminutive arm span, this is my sunglasses location of choice as the LaCrosse’s under-console cavern proved a bit of, well, a stretch for me. Lengthy-limbed front passengers may also suffer finger-jamming problems on occasion. Average-sized persons, we envy you. Conveniently, however, the driver’s side 12-volt power port is placed in an accessible-for-all position. The LaCrosse also features wireless charging, ensuring that our gadgets and gizmos never cease functioning as the electronic leashes they’ve become. Regardless of the car, programs that introduce a new vehicle to the media are, in essence, manufactured fairytales. Drive routes are not chosen by accident or for convenience but are instead calculated to every smooth surface, off-camber angle, climb and descent, ensuring all the while that they wind through picture-perfect scenery (because pretty). The Pacific Northwest, however, is not the ideal locale for a vehicle introduction because the roadways can and will be porous, coarse surfaces (read: loud). So decibel-vaulting are the roads that they make a Saturday night East Village bar crowd seem like a weekday library visit. But the Buick engineering team was so confident, maybe even boastful, of the new LaCrosse’s QuietTuned cabin that they didn’t even try to apologize. Was their hubris worth it? Sections of road during our round-trip drive from downtown Portland to idyllic Astoria made themselves known like the jarring early-morning battles between New York cabbies and deliveries. While you might get used to the noise, you still wish you didn’t have to. On smooth roads, the LaCrosse is quiet – as a premium vehicle should be. On moderate pavement, yes, it’s audibly satisfactory. On the eardrum-piercing surfaces of Oregon? Just hang up the phone call and accept the graveling din. Still, the two vehicles I tested did effortlessly absorb road vibrations, keeping me fairly content in my comfy couch of a bucket seat. In one vehicle, I did experience mildly annoying wind noise during some freeway driving but less so over the same section in another vehicle. A quirky window seal gremlin perhaps, but one quickly forgotten when the steering wheel was in my hands. The Buick LaCrosse is a full-size sedan that doesn’t act like one. My co-driver and I took turns in a silver LaCrosse Essence with front-wheel drive (38,665), loaded with 20-inch wheels and every option package, and in a black LaCrosse Premium with all-wheel drive (43,265), outfitted with a sunroof (1,550) and safety equipment (1,690). All in, the two vehicles were priced fairly close (43,430 and 46,505) but were as different as their Pantone paints. All 2017 LaCrosse models are equipped with a direct-injected 3.6-liter V6 engine estimated to produce 310 horsepower at 6,800 rpm and 282 pound-feet of torque at 5,200 rpm. The power is more than adequate to move the roughly 3,600-pound sedan. The fuel-saving engine start/stop system also performed so politely that I almost didn’t notice it. Often, such systems produce a sputter and a shakedown. In the Buick, everything was appropriately fluid. The 8-speed automatic transmission shifted smoothly, too. It wasn’t perfect as there was the occasional foot-to-floor downshift lag, but there’s nothing here to break-up with Buick over. A new five-link rear suspension and a MacPherson-strut front suspension come as standard equipment, and opting for the 20-inch alloys adds Buick’s HiPer strut front suspension as well as continuously adjustable dampers and driver-selected Touring and Sport modes. Change to Sport mode, and the shift in the car’s attitude is almost instant. The steering feel is stiffer but more precise and feedback is pleasing. Winding roads encourage more aggressive driving and curves beg to be apexed (which you should always be doing, anyway). Models with 18-inch wheels lack a Sport mode selection, but this is not a penalty by any means. Comfort and capability are traits evident on any LaCrosse trim level. In standard tune, some steering precision disappears but the vehicle remains light on its toes and provides ample driving enjoyment despite its smaller shoes. And you’ll easily surpass speed limits without even trying. I didn’t anticipate disliking the redesigned 2017 Buick LaCrosse. I merely didn’t expect to enjoy it as much as I did, especially when you consider I am in my 30s and have a bias toward compacts outfitted with loud turbos. This Buick is not one of those cars. But it was good to feel like an adult for a day. Whether the all-new LaCrosse is truly segment leading remains to be seen, but based on my brief encounter it’s certainly off to a pleasing start.

Oddly, Romanian has retained certain features of Latin which other Romance languages have lost. For example, unlike most Romance languages, which have two genders (masculine and feminine), Romanian has kept the neuter of Latin, although it is somewhat modified and closer to masculine.  Romanian vocabulary has been strongly influenced by Western languages, such as French and Italian, but it also contains words from other languages such as German, Hungarian, and Turkish. Despite so many influences from other countries, however, Romanian has maintained its Latin character with about 75% of its words coming from the ancient language.  As with any translation work, ensuring proficiency and understanding of both languages is necessary for the translated text to correctly convey the message from the original language to the target language. This translation of \\"This is a real improvement\\" into Romanian is a clear and direct transmission of the original statement in English, ensuring that its context and connotative message are retained. Remember, when translating any text into a different language, it's pivotal to be aware of the cultural nuances and idiosyncrasies inherent in the language. A literal translation may not always capture the intended meaning or may even result in a phrase that sounds unnatural or awkward to native speakers. As such, it's important to be aware of the linguistic subtleties when translating.

Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - The Ohio State Buckeyes are the athletic teams that represent The Ohio State University, named after the colloquial term for people from the state of Ohio and after the state tree, the Ohio Buckeye.

Title: Save your money    Justification: The title advises potential buyers of the product to save their money, suggesting that the reviewer does not believe the product is worth the investment. This indication is negative. 2. Review: Don't even waste your time.    Justification: This statement tells readers not to bother with the product, implying that it isn't worth their time or effort. Again, this is a negative sentiment. 3. Review: This item is also a waste.    Justification: The reviewer explicitly calls the product a \\"waste,\\" which communicates dissatisfaction with the item. This statement is negative. 4. Review: My pup actually likes the taste.    Justification: This statement highlights that the reviewer's dog enjoys the taste of the product. This is a positive sentiment. However, it might not be enough to offset the overall negative impression created by the previous statements. Overall, the majority of the review's sentiments are negative. Though there is one positive comment about the dog enjoying the taste, it does not change the predominantly negative tone. Therefore, this product review is not positive."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

You are given a new situation: Two researches studied living organisms, Joe studied eukaryotes, while Bill studied prokaryotes. They were fascinated by genetic variation.  and a hint : Prokaryotes have a different way to increase genetic variation. It’s called genetic transfer or bacterial conjugation . It can occur in two ways. One way is when cells “grab” stray pieces of DNA from their environment. The other way is when cells directly exchange DNA (usually plasmids) with other cells. For example, as shown in Figure below , the donor cell makes a structure called an F pilus , or sex pilus. The F pilus attaches one cell to another cell. The membranes of the two cells merge and genetic material, usually a plasmid , moves into the recipient cell. Genetic transfer makes bacteria very useful in biotechnology. It can be used to create bacterial cells that carry new genes.  Please answer this question : Which researcher observed more membranes of two cells merging? The answer to this question is:","output":"Bill, the researcher who studied prokaryotes, observed more membranes of two cells merging.

A spork I'd seen before, but the addition of a simple serration on the side of the fork end makes this a genuine \\"three-in-one\\" implement for eating one's full three-course takeaway meal on the plane. The sporf is no innovation; back in 1940 the \\"sporf\\" was born. It took me until 2015 to notice this one thanks to its rather pleasant design. The sporf is a little like most strategy documents that I come across. It is one implement designed to serve a multitude of goals, but with one fatal flaw: you can only ever use one part of the sporf / strategy at any one time. With the sporf, things would get messy trying to use the spoon and knife and the same time. The knife and fork work quite well in sequence but physics prevents me using both at the same time as I can with the older technologies of knife and fork. In strategy formation, we can develop a multitude of potential purposes within one document, killer vision statement or mission. But it's important to recognise that the teams around us will only ever be able to do one thing really well at any one time. This is a lesson oft ignored by schools, in particular, as they attempt to ask educators to create an ever-more creative curriculum without having first tackled attitudes towards summative assessments throughout the year. It is also a challenge in some of the world's most successful, but now stagnating, big businesses: they've spent decades or centuries building a reputation across a large array of devices, technologies, components or clothing, but the real strategy is working out which of the current array needs killed off to enable teams in their quest to develop something totally new, properly innovative.

Translate to English","output":"Tariff Policy Prior to the reform of the Georgian water supply and sanitation sector, tariffs for water utilities were approved by local authorities, who, considering the difficult economic situation of the population, in most cases set tariffs that did not cover the costs of enterprises related to the provision of utilities and services. Before the reform of the water supply and sanitation sector in Georgia, the tariff policy was determined by local authorities. The overall economic situation of the population was challenging, and as a result, the tariffs set often didn't cover the expenses incurred by the enterprises providing public utilities and services. As the tariff policy was determined at the local level, there could be inconsistencies and inefficiencies in how the tariffs were implemented across different regions. The main purpose of the reform process was to address these issues and create a more sustainable and efficient system for managing water supply and sanitation services. The reform aimed to establish a more transparent and accountable tariff-setting process that better reflected the actual costs of providing water and sanitation services. A key aspect was to ensure that the tariffs were fair and affordable for the population while also enabling enterprises to cover their operational costs. Another goal of the reform was to promote investment in the water supply and sanitation sector, including infrastructure improvements, modernization, and capacity building. By implementing a more sustainable tariff policy, it would enable the sector to attract investors and secure the necessary funds for growth and development. The tariff policy reform also aimed to improve the quality and reliability of water supply and sanitation services by encouraging enterprises to increase their efficiency and effectiveness. This included adopting better technologies and management practices, as well as implementing performance-based incentives to motivate enterprises in meeting service standards. Overall, the reform of the water supply and sanitation sector in Georgia sought to address significant challenges in the tariff policy and create a more sustainable, efficient, and transparent system for managing these essential services. By doing so, it was hoped that the population would benefit from improved water and sanitation services while also supporting the long-term growth and development of the sector."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is also an odd number. So, 125 is multiplied by three and then one is added. 125 * 3 + 1 = 376. - Third is 73. This is another odd number. Thus, 73 is multiplied by three and then one is added. 73 * 3 + 1 = 220. - Fourth is 33. This remains an odd number. As such, 33 is multiplied by three and then one is added. 33 * 3 + 1 = 100. - Fifth is 184. Since this is an even number, it simply is divided by two. 184 / 2 = 92. - Sixth is 144. This is also an even number, so it is divided by two. 144 / 2 = 72. - Seventh, and final, is 183. This is a notably odd number.

Question: The place where students run a number of news media outlets is a kind of? Context: As at most other universities, Notre Dame's students run a number of news media outlets. The nine student-run outlets include three newspapers, both a radio and television station, and several magazines and journals. Begun as a one-page journal in September 1876, the Scholastic magazine is issued twice monthly and claims to be the oldest continuous collegiate publication in the United States. The other magazine, The Juggler, is released twice a year and focuses on student literature and artwork. The Dome yearbook is published annually. The newspapers have varying publication interests, with The Observer published daily and mainly reporting university and other news, and staffed by students from both Notre Dame and Saint Mary's College. Unlike Scholastic and The Dome, The Observer is an independent publication and does not have a faculty advisor or any editorial oversight from the University. In 1987, when some students believed that The Observer began to show a conservative bias, a liberal newspaper, Common Sense was published. Likewise, in 2003, when other students believed that the paper showed a liberal bias, the conservative paper Irish Rover went into production. Neither paper is published as often as The Observer; however, all three are distributed to all students. Finally, in Spring 2008 an undergraduate journal for political science research, Beyond Politics, made its debut.

How to move to another state when you have custody of your child  Identify if you have sole custody.  In some-but not all-states, you can move your children out of state if you have a permanent order for sole custody. This is the law in california, for example. Answer:","output":"[ii] However, many states don't acknowledge the concept of \\"sole\\" custody, and their laws will be very different. Accordingly, you always need to find out your state's requirements. It's essential that you research your state's specific laws regarding child custody and relocation before making any plans to move out of state. Custody laws can differ significantly between jurisdictions, and understanding how these laws apply to your situation is crucial in ensuring a smooth transition for both you and your child. 1. Research your state's custody laws and relocation requirements: Begin by reviewing your state's family law statutes or consulting with a knowledgeable family law attorney in your area. You can also look for information on your state's court website or visit your local law library to access relevant resources. In general, you'll need to determine whether your state has specific requirements for obtaining permission to move out of state and how this can be done, either through court hearings or mediation. 2. Consult with the other parent: If you have a cooperative relationship with the child's other parent, it's important to discuss your plans for moving and how this will affect the child's relationship with both of you. Be prepared to address concerns and possibly make compromises to ensure that the child's best interests are met. Remember that the other parent may have legal rights regarding the child that must be respected, such as visitation rights or joint legal decision-making authority. 3. Prepare a proposed parenting plan: If you have to go to court to request permission to move, you'll likely need to submit a proposed parenting plan that outlines how you intend to maintain a relationship between the child and the noncustodial parent in your new location. This plan should include details about visitation schedules, transportation arrangements, and how you'll handle any issues that arise after the move, such as scheduling conflicts or changes in the child's needs. 4. Obtain court approval if necessary: In some cases, you'll need to seek court approval before moving out of state with your child. This may involve attending a court hearing or participating in mediation, where you'll have the opportunity to present your case to a judge or mediator. Be prepared to explain why the move is in the child's best interest and provide evidence to support this, such as increased job prospects, better educational opportunities, or closer proximity to extended family members who can provide support. 5. Notify the other parent and obtain written consent (if possible): Even if your state doesn't require court approval for your move, it's generally recommended that you obtain written consent from the other parent before relocating with your child. This can help to prevent future disputes and provide a record of your agreement should any issues arise later. 6. Update your custody order (if applicable): If your move has been approved by the court or agreed upon by both parents, it's important to update your custody order to reflect these changes. This may involve submitting a new parenting plan or modifying your existing order to include provisions related to the move, such as child support adjustments or changes in visitation schedules. By considering these steps and being proactive in meeting your state's requirements, you can help to facilitate a smoother move for both you and your child while ensuring that the interests of all involved parties are protected."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: when did the last surviver of the titanic die??","output":"Millvina Dean, the last known survivor of the Titanic, passed away on May 31, 2009, at the age of 97. She was the youngest passenger on board the ship when it tragically sank after hitting an iceberg on April 15, 1912. Millvina was born on February 2, 1912, just a few months before the Titanic's maiden voyage. Her parents, Bertram Frank Dean and Eva Georgetta Light Dean, along with her older brother, Bertram Vere Dean, decided to emigrate from England to Wichita, Kansas, in the United States, where her father had plans to open a tobacco shop. The family initially planned to travel on another ship, but due to a coal strike, they were transferred onto the Titanic. At the time of the sinking, Millvina was only nine weeks old and, along with her mother and brother, managed to escape the ill-fated ship on Lifeboat 10. Unfortunately, her father perished in the disaster and was among the more than 1,500 lives lost. After their harrowing experience, Millvina's mother decided to return to England with her children, where they lived the rest of their lives. Despite being a Titanic survivor, Millvina had no memory of the disaster, and her mother did not speak of the incident until Millvina was in her 8th year. After learning of her connection to the Titanic, Millvina largely kept the fact a secret for many years, only sharing her story later in life. In her later years, Millvina participated in Titanic-related events, conferences, and interviews, often providing an invaluable personal account of her family's experience. As the last survivor of the Titanic, Millvina Dean was a living link to the past and a poignant reminder of one of history's most tragic maritime disasters. Her passing in 2009 marked the end of an era and closed the final chapter on the Titanic's remaining personal connections."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer a question about the following article about Heian period: The In-no-cho filled the void left by the decline of Fujiwara power. Rather than being banished, the Fujiwara were mostly retained in their old positions of civil dictator and minister of the center while being bypassed in decision making. In time, many of the Fujiwara were replaced, mostly by members of the rising Minamoto family. While the Fujiwara fell into disputes among themselves and formed northern and southern factions, the insei system allowed the paternal line of the imperial family to gain influence over the throne.

Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.  - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective.

This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries.

The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - The Los Angeles Kings are a professional ice hockey team based in Los Angeles.

TEXT:I never understood why some people dislike Bollywood films: they've got charismatic actors, great dance numbers, and heightened emotion--what's not to like? What I didn't realize was that I had only seen the upper-crust of Bollywood. Then I watched \\"Garam Masala\\". I could tell from the first scene that this was not a movie I was going to like (the film opens with a montage of the two leads driving around a city and apparently happening serendipitously on a series of photo setups populated with gyrating models), but I kept hoping things would improve. Sadly, they didn't. The main problem is that the two protagonists, Mac & Sam, are completely unsympathetic. They spend the entire movie lying to women--and lying brutally- -in order to get them into bed, and the audience is supposed to find this funny, and be charmed. The boys are unscrupulous and inept, and not in a lovable way. Mac even goes so far as to have one of the women drugged in order to keep her from discovering his cheating. The script is extremely poor, with repetitive scenes, setups that never lead to anything, and illogical actions and statements by the characters. In fact, the characters are never really developed at all. The males are boorish, greedy jerks, and the women merely interchangeably beautiful. If you go by this movie, you would think that \\"air hostesses\\" are pretty easy to pass from man to man. In reality, betrayal is not so humorous.  The only bright spots I found in the movie were one dance number that had brilliant sets, and a few slapsticky moments involving the French-farce, door-slamming aspects of the story. But Bollywood dancing is better enjoyed in movies choreographed by Farah Khan, and for slapstick you might as well just go straight to the silent comedies of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd, who seem to have influenced writer/director Priyadarshan not a little. Priyadarshan also takes false credit for inventing the story: the basic premise of the plot is stolen from the 1960 play \\"Boeing Boeing.\\" The original author of that work, Marc Camoletti, is credited nowhere. At least Priyadarshan changed the title for this remake, rather than brazenly using the original without giving credit, as he did in his 1985 version of this same tale. (According to IMDb's credits list.)","output":"Step 1: Read the text carefully and understand the overall sentiment. Step 2: Look for positive and negative statements or opinions. Step 3: Determine which sentiment is more dominant in the text.

PUBLISHED:. 01:14 EST, 9 May 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:18 EST, 9 May 2013. Police investigating the disappearance of Jessica Heeringa, the Michigan woman abducted in late April during her shift at a gas station, have said that the suspicious substance found at the scene where she vanished is her blood. 'The substance has been confirmed as blood,' police said in a statement released today. 'Based on a subsequent DNA analysis, the blood has been confirmed to be from Jessica Lynn Heeringa.' Police said that there was only a small amount of blood located at the Norton Shores, Mich., Exxon gas station where Heeringa was working on a late shift. The 25-year-old mother of one was within moments of closing the station when she vanished. Police have revealed that Jessica Heeringa's blood was found at the gas station where she disappeared. Heeringa's family has been notified that her blood was found at the scene, police said. Last Tuesday police released a second video. in the hope that it will help lead to a breakthrough in the mystery of a mother. who went missing on April 26. The video, police say, more. clearly shows traffic in the area, including a silver minivan that. police have been in search of as they've continued trying to unravel. this mystery. A 15,000 reward has been pledged by Exxon Mobil to go toward a reward fund for Heeringa, who was working at an Exxon Mobil station when she disappeared. The. footage comes from a business a mile from the Exxon station, which had. no cameras, and show's the silver van passing around 11:04pm. Police believe Heeringa disappeared between 10:50 and 11:15 that night. New footage: Police say this latest video evidence released in the disappearnce case of Jessica Heeringa shows a suspect silver minivan. Clue: Christian Van Antwerpen, pictured, says he heard the van's driver flirting with Heeringa 'suspiciously' hours before she vanished April 26. Do you know this man? Police have released this sketch, left, of a man seen driving away from the gas station in Michigan where young mother Jessica Heeringa, right, was last seen last month. Antwerpen said he did not see the man, but only heard his voice. The. tip is yet another among the hundreds police say have come in since. Heeringa vanished and will be added to the evidence. investigators have thus far been able to gather. The sketch of a wavy-haired man was released April 30,. based on an account given by a witness who saw a male drive away from. the gas station - and police hoped it would reinvigorate. their investigation. 'With the sketch, now we are retracing some of our steps' Norton. Shores Police Chief Daniel Shaw told WZZM. 'We are taking the sketch out to some. of those individuals we've already talked to, and are showing them the. sketch. Workplace: The Exxon Mobil gas station in Norton Shores, Michigan - from where Heeringa was snatched. the parent company has pledged a 15,000 reward. 'Someone knows this person. That is a very good drawing. Someone is going to know who that is.' Authorities. have also released previous video, shot from the nearby Old Homestead. Tavern, showing a minivan witnesses told police had been in the area. around the same time that Heeringa went missing. Norton Shores Police Chief Dan Shaw admitted that the video leaves much to be desired in terms of hard-hitting evidence,. but hoped releasing it, too, could help unlock the. mystery. Chief Shaw told WOOD-TV:. 'I wish I had the technology like you see on TV where you can blow it. up and I can see the driver inside, but that doesn’t exist for me.' He. told the station that the vehicle appears to match the Town &. Country minivan seen by witnesses in the area prior to Ms Heeringa's. disappearance. Authorities are now looking to question its driver, described as a 'heavyset' white male, between 30 and 40 years old. Police suspect that she may have been familiar with her abductor. 'There. is no sign of a struggle in the store, so it's possible she knew who. the person was as a customer or as an acquaintance,' Chief Shaw told ABCNews. Authorities were alerted on Friday night when a worried customer called about the unattended gas station at 11:15pm. Vigil: A friend hugs Shelly Heeringa, Jessica's mother, during a vigil at Pointes Mall in Norton Shores. That. customer, Craig Harpster, said he came to the gas station like he. normally does after work, and noticed that no one was there. After looking around and finding no one, he told WOOD-TV that he had a 'gut feeling that something bad had happened' and called police. Mr Harpster's 911 call was also released by authorities over the weekend. In the call, he tells the dispatcher:. 'There's nobody here. Um... it wouldn't allow me to pump gas. I just. walked inside, there's nobody. There's a car here. There's another car. out front. But it's just very suspicious why there's nobody here.' Ms Heeringa made her last sale at 11pm. The missing woman's family made a. heartfelt plea for information on Sunday as police reclassified her. disappearance as an abduction. Plea: Shelly Heeringa attended the vigil for her daughter on Tuesday as police released the sketch. In. a press conference on Sunday morning, Chief Shaw said officers were. treating the case as abduction after examining evidence at the scene. No money was stolen from the gas station and it appeared that Ms Heeringa had left cleaning supplies on the counter. Police described Heeringa as a white female, 5'1 tall, approximately 110 lbs., with blonde shoulder length hair, and blue eyes. Jessica is also known to wear wire rim glasses. She may be wearing a blue collared shirt saying 'Sternberg Exxon.' With no surveillance footage from the gas station, police are relying on public information for help in the investigation. 'I'm sure she was abducted,' Ms Heeringa's mother told Michigan Live. '[There was] no struggle. She was cleaning a machine, she left her car keys, [and] no money was taken from the gas station.' The. anguished family were praying for Jessica's safe return. 'She's loved. by everyone,' her mother said. 'She has a 3-year-old boy who is missing. his mom and wants her back.' Derek Antol, a regular customer at the station, told Michigan Live, that he was 'dumbfounded' by the incident. 'I didn't know her, I didn't even know her name until this,' Antol said. 'But she was always very sweet, friendly gal.' Missed: Heeringa was allegedly abducted at about 11pm on Friday from the gas station. Hope: Liz Lunsford of Muskegon releases balloons across the street from the Exxon Mobil gas station. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"Sure, here are some simple main points from the article: 1. A woman named Jessica Heeringa, who worked at a gas station in Michigan, disappeared while she was closing the station for the night.  2. The police found some blood at the gas station, and tests proved that the blood was Jessica's.  3. They also got a video showing a silver minivan near the gas station around the time Jessica disappeared. They think this van could be important. 4. A 15,000 reward has been offered by Exxon Mobil, which is where Jessica was working when she disappeared, for information that brings her back. 5. Police also have a drawing of a man seen driving away from the gas station. They think this man might know something about what happened to Jessica. 6. The person who might have taken Jessica might be someone she knew because there were no signs of a fight in the store. 7. Jessica's family and the police are really worried and are asking for anyone with information to come forward. 8. Jessica is a mom with a 3-year-old boy who misses her a lot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

In BCS Title Hunt, It's Go for Throat As college football enters the final weeks of the season, the stakes have never been higher. Teams jockey for the coveted spots in the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) rankings, and every decision becomes scrutinized and dissected by analysts and fans alike. However, one aspect of the game that has come under special attention is the sportsmanship aspect, specifically, the concept of taking a knee. While some coaches and players believe in showing mercy and respect towards their opponents through taking a knee, others argue that this is not just any regular season game – it is a high stakes BCS title hunt. Thus, \\"go for the throat\\" becomes a common mentality, prompting aggressive play calling and the relentless pursuit of victory. In recent years, taking a knee has become a contentious issue in various sports. More often than not, we see teams with significant leads choosing to \\"salt the clock\\" by kneeling, thus ensuring a victory without further embarrassing their opponents. Some argue that this displays sportsmanship, while others contend that this is not always the case. In the realm of college football, however, the debate takes on added significance due to the BCS rankings. With the BCS rankings determined by a complex formula that considers various factors, including a team's strength of schedule, the coaches' and Harris Interactive Polls, as well as the average computer rankings, every point scored could impact the final standings. Critics of the \\"go for the throat\\" mentality question whether college football has lost its sense of sportsmanship. They argue that the preoccupation with scores, rankings, and bowl games has turned the sport into a ruthless business, with players and coaches more concerned about their statistics and job security than with maintaining the traditions and values of the game. By running up the score, teams reinforce the notion that winning is the only thing that matters, and that any means justify the end. However, proponents of this aggressive mentality argue that it ultimately brings out the best in teams and athletes. They believe that in the high-pressure BCS title hunt, there is no time for mercy or for taking it easy. The sport demands competitors push themselves to the absolute limit, with the knowledge that their efforts on the field can make or break their chance at that elusive BCS title. By going for the throat, teams are only utilizing their full potential and playing to the best of their abilities. The pursuit of victory is quintessential to the spirit of the sport, and the BCS atmosphere only amplifies this. Additionally, those who support \\"going for the throat\\" argue that it is better to face the reality of the BCS rankings and play accordingly than to pretend it doesn't exist. As a team, the goal is ultimately to win, and if running up the score is part of the strategy, then so be it. Furthermore, they contend there is no hard and fast rule that declaring they should ease off the pedal in the final minutes of a game when victory is all but assured. Every team is different, and there will always be disagreements regarding the right approach in these situations. As the race for the BCS title continues to heat up, the discussion surrounding sportsmanship and competitiveness will likely persist. While some may argue for the traditional approach of taking a knee and demonstrating mercy, others will contend that these are extraordinary circumstances. The BCS title hunt is not just another regular season game – it is a championship pursuit where every point matters, and for many, \\"going for the throat\\" is deemed an essential part of achieving their ultimate goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Over the course of several days, participants donned colorful costumes, danced to rhythmic beats, and indulged in an exuberant cultural experience that epitomizes the nation’s joy and love for life. Carnival, or \\"Carnaval\\" in Portuguese, is a pre-Lent festive tradition observed in many countries. However, the Brazilian Carnival has evolved into a massive spectacle that attracts millions of tourists worldwide. This vibrant festival highlights the fusion of European, African, and Indigenous cultures that make up Brazil's unique cultural identity. Each region of the country boasts its distinct Carnival celebrations, but the world-famous events in cities like Rio de Janeiro, Salvador, São Paulo, and Olinda are incomparable in their grandeur. This year's Carnival saw an eclectic mix of themes, with revelers going all out in artistic expression. Brilliantly adorned floats captivated audiences, while percussion-heavy Samba music reverberated through the air, inducing an infectious atmosphere of celebration. The much-anticipated Samba school parades were another highlight of the Carnival, as various schools displayed their spellbinding performances, vying for the top spot in the fiercely competitive yearly affair. Among the unique Brazilian Carnival customs are the \\"blocos\\" – informal street parades and parties where people sing, dance, and often play instruments. Attendees decorated themselves with feathers, glitter, and body paint while flaunting their creativity through extravagant outfit designs. The blocos were a kaleidoscope of colors that transformed the urban landscape into a vibrant tableau during the festival. Amid all the fun and excitement, there was also a social aspect to the Carnival. Many participants took the opportunity to voice their opinions on political and social issues. On this occasion, calls for gender equality, LGBTQ+ rights, and environmental preservation were prominent. The festival's unity-in-diversity spirit provided a platform for constructive dialogue and an opportunity for individuals to make assertive, impactful statements. The Brazilian Carnival is a time to unwind and experience life's pleasures to the fullest, a brief moment for people to forget their daily stresses and embrace happiness. Street vendors looking to capitalize on the high spirits and large crowds set up shop, offering tantalizing street food ranging from the traditional \\"acarajé\\" to sweet \\"brigadeiros.\\" As the Carnival drew to a close, old friendships were strengthened, new bonds were formed, and memories were created that would last a lifetime. The remaining hours saw participants dancing tirelessly, with the intoxicating Samba beats propelling them forward as they sought to savor every last moment of this time-honored festival. The sun began to set, casting a golden hue over the streets, and the revelers understood that, although carnival season was ending, they were already looking forward to next year's grand fiesta. In conclusion, the Brazilian Carnival serves as a glorious display of the nation's vibrant culture and the contagious joy that flows through its veins. For both locals and tourists, the Carnival is an unforgettable experience that reiterates the significance of unity, creativity, and self-expression. As the Carnival concluded, participants went back to their daily lives with rejuvenated spirits and cherished memories, eagerly anticipating next year's extravagant celebration."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He has now been told he will not face any charges. He said he volunteered to co-operate and complained that the decision to arrest him was disproportionate. He also plans to lodge a formal complaint with the Police Ombudsman. The former officer was one of seven men questioned in June 2014 about the awarding of police vehicle contracts. He had strenuously denied any wrongdoing, and on Tuesday, his solicitor received a letter from the Public Prosecution Service (PPS) informing him that his client will not face any charges. \\"This matter can be resolved very quickly in an easy way if Chief Constable George Hamilton, who I know personally, is prepared to offer his regrets for what happened,\\" Mr McCausland told BBC Radio Ulster. \\"But I have to consider everything because my reputation has been damaged.\\" He said the allegations against him were not founded on any evidence. \\"The police have a unique power, which is to remove someone's liberty, and that should be as a last resort,\\" he said. \\"There was absolutely no need to remove my liberty or anyone else's liberty, because people were prepared to fully co-operate with the police.\\" Responding to Mr McCausland's remarks, the PSNI chief constable said he is \\"wholly content\\" with the way in which the police dealt with the case. Welcoming the fact that the process had concluded, George Hamilton said he fully respected the direction made by the PPS. \\"I am wholly content that the PSNI fulfilled their legal obligations in response to this investigation and reported all available evidence to the PPS,\\" he said. \\"I am also entirely satisfied with the integrity and professionalism of the investigation. \\"Prosecutorial decisions are a matter for the PPS\\". Detectives were investigating allegations of bribery and misconduct in public office in the awarding of contracts for police vehicles. Mr McCausland had criticised his former employer for arresting him, because he had volunteered to assist the investigation. The Public Prosecution Service said in its letter to Mr McCausland's solicitor that, based upon evidence currently available, the test for prosecution had not been met. Mr McCausland was one of the most high profile PSNI officers before retiring in March 2011, under the Patten redundancy scheme. The owner of one of Northern Ireland's largest car dealerships, who was also among the seven men questioned in 2014, has also been told he will not face any charges. Terence Donnelly, of Donnelly Brothers, had always maintained that he would be completely exonerated in relation to all allegations arising from the investigation. In a statement to the BBC, his solicitor said Mr Donnelly welcomed the decision by the PPS. In April this year, a former PSNI officer who had gone on to lead an English police force was told he would not face charges as a result of the same investigation. Mark Gilmore was suspended as chief constable of West Yorkshire Police in June 2014 after being questioned by the PSNI. His suspension was lifted in May after the PPS informed him it would not be pressing charges. However, he has not resumed his role as chief constable.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person that had a reclusive life style? is inside the article: Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,..., can you guess it ?

By its count, there are roughly 20,000 payday lender locations in the US, which works out to one for about every 16,000 people. McDonald's currently has 14,267 locations, per NBC News, which notes that the small (typically 500 or less), short-term (most often 14 days, as full payment of the loan and fees is due on the borrower's next payday) loans are most typically used by those \\"at or near the bottom of the economic spectrum.\\" And those that make use of payday lenders may find their financial situation worsened: The mean payday borrower makes 22,476 a year and paid 458, or 2% of their annual income, in fees. And those using payday loans typically owe money to lenders during 55% of the year. And as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau put it in a 2013 report, \\"these products may become harmful for consumers when they are used to make up for chronic cash flow shortages.\\" Expand this summary.","output":"Payday lenders can be found in larger numbers throughout the United States than even the fast-food giant, McDonald’s. This is according to an edition of Inside the Vault, a newsletter from the St. Louis Federal Reserve. In their report, they estimated that there are nearly 20,000 brick-and-mortar payday loan lenders in the US. When divided by the country's population, this averages to about one payday lender for every 16,000 people. Comparatively, McDonald’s, which is often seen as one of the most omnipresent corporate icons, currently operates 14,267 outlets as stated by NBC News. Payday loans are essentially small loans, usually 500 or less, designed to sustain a borrower until their next paycheck comes in. They are intended to be short-term loans, most often having a term of 14 days, as the full repayment of the loan with all its associated fees is due on the borrower’s next payday. This type of financial service is most commonly availed by individuals who are \\"at or near the bottom of the economic spectrum\\" as these loans provide quick, albeit pricey, financial relief in times of immediate need. However, frequent use of payday loans may lead to a worsening financial situation for these borrowers. According to data, the average payday loan borrower earns a yearly income of 22,476 and spends 458, equating to 2% of their annual income, solely on loan fees. Additionally, borrowers of payday loans typically find themselves in debt for more than half the year. In a 2013 report, the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau warned that these products could be damaging for consumers when utilized as a band-aid for chronic cash flow issues. When relied upon too heavily, these high-cost, short-term loans can contribute to a cycle of ongoing debt, making it increasingly difficult for consumers to stabilize their financial situation.  In light of the number of payday lenders abundantly outnumbering McDonald's locations, the prevalence and potential issues surrounding payday loans in America become even more apparent. As financial needs rise, so does the industry responding to it, often time to the detriment of borrowers in the lower economics spectrum, leading to an insidious cycle of debt and further economic distress."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.

Answer choices: - Energy.  - Chemical energy  - Carbon Dioxide  - Organic compounds  - flow of electrons  - heat energy  - oxidation reaction  - temperature The answer is:","output":"Carbon Dioxide. The carbon cycle is a natural process that involves the continuous circulation of carbon atoms between the Earth's atmosphere, organisms, and the environment. Carbon is essential for life, as it forms the backbone of various organic compounds critical for the structure and functioning of living organisms, such as carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is a key component in the carbon cycle and is transferred between organisms and the atmosphere. CO2 is a byproduct of various biological and physical processes, such as cellular respiration, combustion of fossil fuels, and volcanic eruptions. In the atmosphere, CO2 absorbs and emits infrared radiation, playing a crucial role in the greenhouse effect and the regulation of Earth's climate. Photosynthesizing organisms, mainly plants and certain types of bacteria, convert atmospheric CO2 into energy-rich organic compounds during the process of photosynthesis. These organic compounds are then used by living organisms to produce energy, build constituent molecules, or are stored for later use. When organisms respire, combust, or decay, the carbon stored in these organic compounds is released back into the atmosphere as CO2, completing the carbon cycle. Besides CO2, the carbon cycle also involves the transfer of various organic compounds that contain carbon atoms such as glucose, lipids, amino acids, and nucleotides.

He is estranged from wife Katherine, who left him two years before, suspecting him of adultery. She has been living the society life back East while their daughter Rebeeca (whom G.W. calls \\"Becky\\") (Stefanie Powers) is completing her college degree.  Following a meeting with a group of homesteaders whom he cautions against trying to farm on the Mesa Verde: \\"God made that land for the buffalo. It serves pretty well for cattle.

While both sentences seem to share the concept of describing an animal with similar colors, the key differences lie in the type of animal, additional descriptive information, and overall intent of each sentence. Here's a breakdown of the differences and similarities between the two sentences: 1. Type of animal: The first sentence talks about a sheep, while the second sentence describes a calf. Sheep and calves are distinct types of animals – sheep are typically raised for their wool, while calves are young cattle. 2. Descriptive information: In the first sentence, the focus is primarily on the color of the sheep and their proximity to each other, while the second sentence offers additional information about the calf, such as the tag on its ear. Tags on ears may denote ownership, identification, or other relevant information about the animal, so the mention of the tag introduces an aspect not present in the first sentence. 3. Overall intent: The first sentence primarily serves to describe a scene involving a black and white sheep and a white sheep walking together. Meanwhile, the second sentence focuses on the specific features of a calf, rather than its interactions with other animals. Given the differences in animal type, level of detail, and overall intent of each sentence, I believe the similarity between these sentences is quite low, hence my rating of 1 out of 5. They do share the common aspect of describing animals with black and white colors, which is why the rating isn't 0, but the key differences make them distinct from one another."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Family seeks to destroy all technology and kill Neville, who has become a symbol of the science they blame for humanity's downfall. At night, living atop a fortified apartment building equipped with an arsenal of weaponry, Neville is a prisoner in his own home. One day, as Neville is in a department store helping himself to new clothing, he spots a woman who quickly runs away. He pursues her outside but later decides he is hallucinating and dismisses the sighting. On another day, the Family finally captures Neville. After a summary trial he is found guilty of heresy by the family's leader, Jonathan Matthias, a former news anchorman. Neville is sentenced to death and nearly burned at the stake in Dodger Stadium. He is rescued by Lisa, the woman he had earlier dismissed as a hallucination, and Dutch, a former medical student. Lisa and Dutch are part of a group of survivors, some of whom are children. Although their youth has given them some resistance to the disease, they are still vulnerable to it and will eventually succumb to mutation. Neville realizes that even if it is possible to duplicate the original vaccine, it would take years to salvage humanity. However, he believes it may be possible to extend his immunity to others by creating a serum from his own body.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

Two identical chemical compounds are both in beakers on top of burners in a laboratory. Beaker A is sitting on top of a burner that is set to a low temperature, and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature. Ken, the scientist studying these compounds, is closely monitoring the chemicals to see what type of changes occur.  Are the particles in Beaker X more or less likely to bump into each other than the particles in Beaker A?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, it's clear that at higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, allowing them to move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and collide with greater force. Given that Beaker A is on a burner set to a low temperature and Beaker X is on a burner with a high temperature: 1. I will first consider the temperature difference between the two burners. Beaker X will have a higher temperature than Beaker A, due to the different settings on the burners. 2. Since Beaker X has a higher temperature than Beaker A, the particles in Beaker X will have more energy compared to the particles in Beaker A. 3. With more energy, the particles in Beaker X will move faster compared to the particles in Beaker A. 4. As the particles in Beaker X move faster, they are more likely to bump into each other and collide with greater force than the particles in Beaker A. In conclusion, the particles in Beaker X are more likely to bump into each other than the particles in Beaker A.

On the one hand, anarchy engulfs Sudan, Zaire, and other nations, and this chaos helps spread nasty diseases (malaria, cholera, AIDS, etc.) around the world. Does it follow that \\"Malaria, cholera, and AIDS are nasty contagious diseases that can be spread around the world.\\"?","output":"Yes, it does follow that \\"Malaria, cholera, and AIDS are nasty contagious diseases that can be spread around the world.\\" These diseases pose significant risks to public health and can be facilitated by factors such as anarchy, political instability, and lack of access to essential healthcare services. Let us look at each disease in detail to understand their contagious nature and the impact they can have on affected populations. 1. Malaria: Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by the Plasmodium parasite. The disease is transmitted primarily through the bite of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Malaria is considered a significant global health threat, with an estimated 216 million cases and around 445,000 deaths occurring in 2016 alone. The majority of these cases occur in sub-Saharan Africa, where political instability and weak healthcare systems can exacerbate the spread of the disease. Climate change, international travel, and migration can also contribute to the expansion of malaria's reach, increasing the risk of outbreaks in previously unaffected areas. 2. Cholera: Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease caused by the ingestion of food or water contaminated with the Vibrio cholerae bacterium. Cholera outbreaks typically occur in areas with poor sanitation and limited access to clean water. As with malaria, political instability and weak healthcare infrastructure can worsen the spread of cholera. In conflict-affected regions, displaced populations often live in overcrowded camps with inadequate systems for sanitation and provision of clean water, increasing the risk of cholera outbreaks. While cholera is endemic in many parts of the world, it can quickly become a significant public health issue when natural disasters, war, or civil unrest lead to large-scale displacement and a breakdown of essential services. 3. AIDS: Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV is primarily spread through unprotected sex, sharing of infected needles, or mother-to-child transmission during childbirth or breastfeeding. While AIDS is indeed a global health concern, it is important to note that it is not spread as easily as malaria or cholera. Unlike these other diseases, AIDS cannot be transmitted through casual contact, contaminated food, or water. Rather, the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS can be attributed to factors such as high-risk sexual behavior, intravenous drug use, lack of awareness or stigma around the disease, and limited access to testing and treatment options. In countries suffering from anarchy and political unrest, healthcare systems may be insufficient or completely collapsed, contributing to the spread of HIV/AIDS. To summarize, it is accurate to say that malaria, cholera, and AIDS are nasty contagious diseases that can spread around the world. These diseases are particularly prevalent in regions experiencing anarchy, civil unrest, and inadequate healthcare infrastructure, which can contribute to the widespread dissemination of these infectious diseases.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What is the ethnicity of Henry Louis Gates?\\"  Context: \\"During a panel discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni during the 2003–04 academic year, two prominent black professors at the institution—Lani Guinier and Henry Louis Gates—pointed out an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at Harvard. They stated that only about a third of black Harvard undergraduates were from families in which all four grandparents were born into the African American community. The majority of black students at Harvard were Caribbean and African immigrants or their children, with some others the mixed-race children of biracial couples. One Harvard student, born in the South Bronx to a black family whose ancestors have been in the United States for multiple generations, said that there were so few Harvard students from the historic African American community that they took to calling themselves \\"the descendants\\" (i.e., descendants of American slaves). The reasons for this underrepresentation of historic African Americans, and possible remedies, remain a subject of debate.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Henry Louis Gates Jr. is an African American scholar, writer, and public intellectual. He currently serves as the Alphonse Fletcher University Professor and Director of the Hutchins Center for African and African American Research at Harvard University. Gates is renowned for his work in the field of African American literature, cultural studies, and genealogy, and has won numerous awards and honors for his contributions to these fields. In the context provided, the discussion at Harvard University's reunion for African American alumni highlighted an unintended effect of affirmative action policies at the institution. Gates, along with Lani Guinier, observed that the majority of black students at Harvard were not from the historical African American community, but rather from Caribbean and African immigrant backgrounds or the children of biracial couples. This led to an underrepresentation of students who are descendants of African American slaves. Given this context, and based on Gates' own scholarship and career in studying the African American experience, it is clear that his ethnicity is African American—meaning that he is a part of the community that traces its ancestry back to African slaves who were brought to the United States during the period of transatlantic slavery. This heritage is significant not only in terms of Gates' personal identity, but also in shaping his academic and intellectual interests. In conclusion, Henry Louis Gates is an African American scholar who has dedicated much of his career to exploring the history, literature, and culture of the African American community. His ethnicity has played a vital role in informing his research, teaching, and activism, and has made him an influential figure in promoting a greater understanding of the African American experience and the ongoing challenges faced by this community in today's society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke   or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.  Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes  , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk.  \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods.

Hugo Chavez Arrives in Cuba for Another Round of Cancer Treatment Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez landed early Sunday morning in Cuba, where he will undergo another round of radiation therapy to treat an undisclosed form of cancer. Cuban head of state Raúl Castro greeted Chávez at the airport, the island's state press reported. In a televised address before his departure, Chávez said he would be in Havana until Wednesday or Thursday and would be back in time for events marking the 10th anniversary of his restoration to the presidency after a failed 2002 coup. \\"I'm going to Cuba to continue the battle for life,\\" he said. \\"I have a lot of faith in Christ our lord that that he's going to repeat the miracle (for me) to continue living, to defeat this illness,\\" Chávez said. He drew a parallel with the 2002 coup, saying he thought it miraculous that he lived through it and regained the presidency. Chávez, who is running for re-election to another six-year term in October, also announced plans to raise Venezuela's minimum wage. He said it would go up 15 percent in May and another 15 percent in September. The increase had been expected because of Venezuela's soaring inflation, which currently stands at about 25 percent. The leftist president's government has raised the minimum wage between 20 percent and 30 percent each year during the past decade. The raise will bring the country's minimum wage from 1,548 Venezuelan bolivars (360) a month to about 2,048 bolivars (476) a month starting in September. Chavez said the wage increase will benefit about 3.9 million workers as well as 2 million retired Venezuelans whose pension benefits vary depending on the minimum wage. Zetas and MS-13 Join Forces in Guatemala The president has also increased spending recently on government social programs that provide cash handouts and other benefits to the poor. Chávez's recent statements about his cancer and the incomplete information he has provided about his illness have kept many Venezuelans guessing about whether his health could affect this year's presidential race. At a Mass alongside relatives Thursday, Chávez shed tears and he prayed aloud saying: \\"Give me your crown, Christ. ... Give me your cross, 100 crosses. I'll carry it, but give me life because I still have things to do for these people.\\" On Friday, Chávez told his aides in televised remarks not to worry about rumors about his health. \\"If we're going to be every day responding to rumors, sometimes it's a waste of time,\\" he said. Chávez has regularly traveled to and from Cuba for treatment since last June, when he said an initial surgery removed a tumor the size of a baseball. He has said a second surgery in February removed a second, smaller tumor from the same area in his pelvic region.

Otherwise classify it as \\"no\\". \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\"). 1 In short, a \\"Yes, and\\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'.  Prompt: Hi, sorry we're late.

It also requests that the State party provide, in its next periodic report, up-to-date information on the number of cases in which prosecutions have been brought against traffickers and police officers involved in trafficking, as well as information on convictions handed down. In order to tackle the issue of human trafficking, the Committee has emphasized the importance of proper training and knowledge for the personnel responsible for dealing with the victims. This includes medical staff and psychologists working in social protection centers. As these professionals play a major role in aiding the victims, it is crucial that they fully understand the specific needs and unique circumstances that these individuals face. Adequate training and education will equip the staff with the essential tools required to provide appropriate support and care, while also helping the victims in their recovery process. Moreover, the Committee encourages the State to intensify its efforts in developing an effective mechanism for the collection of data on the fight against human trafficking. This process is vital in identifying the scale of the problem and monitoring the progress made. Access to reliable data will facilitate the design and implementation of well-informed policies aimed at combating the issue in the long term. Regular reviews of the relevant data will also enable adjustments to be made where necessary to improve the overall effectiveness of the anti-trafficking measures in place. Additionally, the Committee requests that the State include in its upcoming periodic report, up-to-date information regarding the number of cases in which legal proceedings have been initiated against both human traffickers and police officers involved in this illicit trade. By keeping track of such cases, the State will be better equipped to assess the efficiency of its current legal framework in tackling the problem and to identify any necessary amendments or improvements. Furthermore, this information will provide valuable insights into the enforcement of anti-trafficking laws and the commitment of the State to hold those responsible accountable. Lastly, the periodic report should also contain information on the convictions handed down in such cases. This data will allow the State to assess the effectiveness of its judicial system in delivering justice to the victims of human trafficking while also serving as a deterrent for potential traffickers and those who may engage in similar activities. Overall, by addressing the recommendations of the Committee, the State will significantly enhance its ability to combat the scourge of human trafficking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What kind of car are Bob and Shirley driving in the opening credits. Title: Orgy of the Dead Movie plot: The film opens to two muscle-bound men dressed in loincloths approaching a crypt. They open the doors, revealing a coffin. They remove the lid and exit the crypt, then the inhabitant of the coffin (Criswell) sits up to deliver an opening narration. This narration mostly matches the prologue of Night of the Ghouls (1959), with one minor variation and an additional line. The phrase \\"world between the living and the dead\\" of the original is changed to \\"void between...\\". There is also a new line at the end: \\"A night with the ghouls, the ghouls reborn, from the innermost depths of the world!\\"[1] The opening credits feature the image of \\"an immobile young woman clad in gold\\". The image was probably inspired by a memorable scene of Goldfinger (1964).[1] Following the credits, the camera shifts to a lone Chevrolet Corvair driving down a California desert road. Its passengers Bob (William Bates) and Shirley (Pat Barrington) are arguing over the decision to use this night to search for a cemetery. Bob is a horror writer who hopes that the scene of a cemetery at night will bring him inspiration. The conversation ends when Bob accidentally drives the car off the road and over a cliff.[1] The next scene opens to a nocturnal image of a fog-shrouded cemetery. The lonely figure of the Emperor (Criswell) walks towards a marble altar, sits, and then summons his \\"Princess of the Night\\", the Black Ghoul (Fawn Silver), who appears and bows before him. The Emperor warns that if the night's entertainment fails to please him, he will banish the souls of the entertainers to eternal damnation, indicating that he is an all-powerful demonic being.[1] As the full moon appears, the Black Ghoul summons the first dancer of the night, a Native American woman (Bunny Glaser).

He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  But I can use this background: Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.  What is an answer for this question: Which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes?","output":"Based on the background information provided, freezing is an effective method of preserving food by slowing down the decay and growth of microorganisms. Lower temperatures slow down reaction rates and make water less available for bacterial growth. In Robert's case, to achieve slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes, he should store them at a lower temperature. Therefore, storing the cupcakes at 0° F would be the better option compared to storing them at 10° F.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In chapters 3 and 4 we described how the U.S. government adjusted its existing agencies and capacities to address the emerging threat from Usama  Bin Laden and his associates. After the August 1998 bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, President Bill Clinton and his chief aides explored ways of getting  Bin Laden expelled from Afghanistan or possibly capturing or even killing him. Although disruption efforts around the world had achieved some successes, the core of  Bin Laden's organization remained intact. President Clinton was deeply concerned about  Bin Laden. He and his national security advisor, Samuel \\"Sandy\\" Berger, ensured they had a special daily pipeline of reports feeding them the latest updates on  Bin Laden's reported location. In public, President Clinton spoke repeatedly about the threat of terrorism, referring to terrorist training camps but saying little about  Bin Laden and nothing about al Qaeda. He explained to us that this was deliberate-intended to avoid enhancing  Bin Laden's stature by giving him unnecessary publicity. His speeches focused especially on the danger of nonstate actors and of chemical and biological weapons. As the millennium approached, the most publicized worries were not about terrorism but about computer breakdowns-the Y2K scare. Some government officials were concerned that terrorists would take advantage of such breakdowns. On November 30, 1999, Jordanian intelligence intercepted a telephone call between Abu Zubaydah, a longtime ally of  Bin Laden, and Khadr Abu Hoshar, a Palestinian extremist. Abu Zubaydah said, \\"The time for training is over.\\" Suspecting that this was a signal for Abu Hoshar to commence a terrorist operation, Jordanian police arrested Abu Hoshar and 15 others and informed Washington. One of the 16, Raed Hijazi, had been born in California to Palestinian parents; after spending his childhood in the Middle East, he had returned to northern California, taken refuge in extremist Islamist beliefs, and then made his way to Abu Zubaydah's Khaldan camp in Afghanistan, where he learned the fundamentals of guerrilla warfare. He and his younger brother had been recruited by Abu Hoshar into a loosely knit plot to attack Jewish and American targets in Jordan. After late 1996, when Abu Hoshar was arrested and jailed, Hijazi moved back to the United States, worked as a cabdriver in Boston, and sent money back to his fellow plotters. After Abu Hoshar's release, Hijazi shuttled between Boston and Jordan gathering money and supplies. With Abu Hoshar, he recruited inTurkey and Syria as well as Jordan; with Abu Zubaydah's assistance, Abu Hoshar sent these recruits to Afghanistan for training.  Question: \\"In Nov. 1999 what intelligence agency intercepted a call and who did they arrest in an effect to stop a terrorist attack?\\" Answer: \\"Jordanian intelligence. Abu Hoshar and 15 others\\" Is this answer to the question correct?  - no  - yes","output":"Yes, the answer is correct.

Q: Having maxed out credit cards, but on-time payments my credit score prior to filing for Ch 7 was 530, post discharge it was 632 and now six months later is 692! There is life after Bankruptcy! GWNorris3rd's response was: Bankruptcy will ruin your credit for some time to come. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy can remain on your credit report for up to 10 years. Although a bankruptcy stays on your record for years, the time to complete the bankruptcy process under Chapter 7, from filing to relief from debt, takes only about 3-6 months. If you decide against Chapter 7 when it may be the right decision for you, your missed debt payments, defaults, repossessions, and lawsuits will also hurt your credit, and may be more complicated to explain to a future lender than bankruptcy. The impact to your credit score is largely based on where your credit stands now and what information is on your credit report.​. In 2010, FICO released information about how bankruptcy and other credit mistakes affect your credit score. Using a mock scenario with two different credit profiles, FICO showed a bankruptcy could cost up to 240 points for someone with a 780 credit score and 150 points for someone with a 680 credit score. And, while a bankruptcy can severely damage your credit score, that doesn’t mean that bankruptcy has to be the end of a good credit rating forever. How Long Does Bankruptcy Stay On The Record. There are two types of bankruptcy – Chapter 13 bankruptcy and Chapter 7 Bankruptcy: Plus, as long as your report is filled with nothing but A+ grades, you should have a decent credit score within a few years, and even a good score by the time the bankruptcy drops off your report. 4. Keep Your Oldest Accounts Active Chapter 13 Bankruptcy. The bankruptcy itself and the debts associated with the bankruptcy will be displayed differently on your credit report. A completed Chapter 13 bankruptcy will stay on your report for up to seven years, and discharged debts will also stay on the report up to seven years after they are discharged. How Long Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Last? In most cases, it takes approximately three to four months to complete a Chapter 7 bankruptcy and obtain a discharge. However, if you have a complex case or creditors object to your discharge, it can take longer. This means that you can complete your case quickly and begin rebuilding your credit right away. How Long Does Chapter 7 Bankruptcy Remain on Your Credit Report? A Chapter 7 bankruptcy will usually stay on your credit report for ten years. But in general, this does not prohibit you from obtaining new credit and moving on with your life. In fact, most debtors start receiving new credit card offers shortly after they receive their discharge. To do this we’ll need to set the record straight on some of the most commonly held misconceptions about how bankruptcy impacts credit scores. Myth #1: Having no negative information on your credit report prior to bankruptcy leads to a higher post-bankruptcy credit score than if your report contained derogatory information prior to the filing. Myth #3: You will have a low credit score for as long as the bankruptcy information remains on your credit report. Fact #3: While it’s true that you should not expect a high score following bankruptcy, if you manage your credit optimally in its aftermath you can be looking at a 700 score or higher after only about 4-5 years. You cannot file for Chapter 7 bankruptcy if you previously went through bankruptcy proceedings under Chapter 7 or Chapter 13 within the last six years. If you obtained a Chapter 13 discharge in good faith after paying at least 70% of your unsecured debts, the six-year bar does not apply. Query: how long bankruptcy affect credit A:","output":"Bankruptcy affects credit for different durations depending on the type. A Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your credit report for up to 10 years, while a completed Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays on your report for up to 7 years. However, by managing your credit optimally post-bankruptcy, it is possible to achieve a 700 credit score or higher after about 4-5 years."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Who was the emperor while Prince Sanjō Sanetomi was an Imperial court noble?

Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - Whitney Elizabeth Houston (August 9, 1963  February 11, 2012) was an American singer, actress, producer, and model.

I bought the album for \\"La Tortura,\\" featuring the salty, seductive Alejandro Sanz, but will keep it for \\"Obtener Un Si,\\" a gorgeous ambient song reminiscent of Brazilian Jazz favorites, like \\"The Girl from Ipanema.\\" \\"Obtener Un Si\\" (\\"To Obtain a 'Yes'\\") is a song that comes onto you like a warm glass of sweet merlot taken in a balmy late summer bath. Smoooth, soothing and e n t i r ely intoxicating! This girls lyrics are absolutely beautiful in Spanish, and when translated to English, her eloquent intelligence is a stiking pleasure.

Here are two sentences: He added that we are \\" not going to make progress if we don 't broaden the tent . \\" He added Democrats are not going to make progress if we dont broaden the tent . Do they have the same meaning?","output":"Analyzing the sentences: 1. \\"He added that we are 'not going to make progress if we don't broaden the tent.'\\" 2. \\"He added Democrats are not going to make progress if we don't broaden the tent.\\" In the first sentence, the subject is not specified. The pronoun \\"we\\" could refer to any group that the speaker and the listener are part of. This could mean a specific group like a company, a political party, a country, etc., or it could mean \\"we\\" in a broad sense, like humanity as a whole. In the second sentence, the subject is clearly stated as 'Democrats'. So \\"we\\" refers here to the Democrats specifically. So, while both sentences technically convey the same action (broadening the tent in order to make progress), the key difference lies in the subject performing the action.  Thus, the two sentences do not have the exact same meanings as the subjects they refer to are different - one is general (could be any group part of the conversation or mankind as a whole) and the other is specific (Democrats)."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Who is the worker the boy beagle knocks using the spinning bars? is inside the article: Oswald is walking merrily on the road, heading towards the county fair.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around. She was so young but seemed to enjoy jumping on some bouncy trampoline type thing at the Sea World. My husband might remember the funny things better than I do.

Now, as for whether you should tell your friends and family about your recent windfall from horse betting, it's important to carefully consider the following factors before making a decision: 1. Personal relationship dynamics: Every person's family and friends group is unique. It's important to understand the relationships you have with these individuals and how they might react to the news. Will they be supportive, or might they become envious or resentful? Consider how sharing this information could affect your relationships in both the short and long term. 2. Financial responsibility and security: With a large sum of money like 100 million, your financial situation has drastically changed. Taking time to carefully plan your financial future, including setting aside funds for taxes, investing, and planning for your long-term needs is critical. Informing others about your winnings could open you up to requests for loans or financial assistance, which might make managing your newfound wealth more challenging. 3. Potential scams or exploitation: Unfortunately, making a significant amount of money in a short period of time can draw unwanted attention from scammers or people looking to exploit your good fortune. Keeping your winnings private can be a reasonable step in guarding against potential scams and protecting your financial security. 4. Impact on personal values and beliefs: When you come into a large amount of money, it can affect your personal values and beliefs—both positively and negatively. You may have the ability to make a difference in the lives of others or contribute to charitable causes, but it's essential to reflect on how sharing your windfall might change your perceptions of yourself and your relationships with others. 5. Privacy: Lastly, consider whether you want your financial status to be public knowledge. Some individuals prefer to keep their financial situation private for a variety of reasons, including maintaining a low profile or avoiding unwanted attention. In conclusion, deciding whether to tell your friends and family about your recent horse betting winnings depends on a variety of factors. It's essential to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of disclosure carefully and assess how it may affect your relationships, financial security, and personal values. Ultimately, the decision will come down to your personal preferences and unique circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Social anxiety ruined my life - until I found the one place I felt at home Social anxiety disorder seems to be rooted, as Sartre plausibly pointed out, in the fact that most of what we are is a projection of what others think of us. We should all be afraid of “the look” of another person because it’s an unfathomable abyss into our very essence. And yet, despite its roots in our imagination, social anxiety is an unremittingly “physical” disease. You can have long-term therapy, or read as much philosophy on the subject as you like, but your body won’t care. The next time you interact with another human being on the bus, at the checkout, or on the phone, waves of adrenaline flood your body all the same, resulting in a racing heart, faltering voice and glowing red cheeks. Current scientific opinion attributes all this to serotonin imbalances and overactive amygdalae. There are also genetic factors at work which try to explain why social anxiety tends to run in families. Whatever the ultimate cause, the stubbornly physical basis of social anxiety suggests that there is no immediate cure. One doctor informed me that it’s just something that has to be lived with. A harsh conclusion indeed, and one that I and other social anxiety sufferers have found to be made much harsher by the nature of the modern world. Related: Living with anxiety is hard, but there are coping mechanisms In the past I imagine it would have been quite easy for a socially anxious individual to make a life for themselves doing some form of manual labour that wouldn’t require the cultivation of “people skills”. But in today’s world, where selling one’s attributes is of the utmost importance, such skills are an absolute necessity. Whether it’s in a corporate environment (meetings, group presentations, conferences, the importance of “leadership”) or an ordinary retail job, there is a clear correlation between success and one’s ability to produce confident spiel. Not the best state of affairs for the social anxiety sufferer who finds just eye contact with another human being a nerve-racking experience. This was all painfully driven home to me after I graduated from university. Many graduate schemes bring in prospective hires by making out that everything “will be exactly like your first year at uni”. Cue induction weeks in swanky hotels, team-building exercises, group nights out – all designed to relax us and coax out the productive happy loquacious people we all are. For me though, a person who spent the whole of his first year at university locked in his dorm, venturing out only to attend seminars and avoid starvation, it took no time at all for this set up to become a maelstrom of torturous discomfort. I tried to focus on the “job” aspects of the exercise, but I could not avoid that which an social anxiety sufferer fears the most: the conversational banalities that make the world go round, the simple stuff like “what are you doing this weekend?” Inevitably I got asked a lot of these questions, and rather than freeze up and, god forbid, have people think I was weird, I simply walked away. It was at this point in my life that I became suicidal. If I couldn’t do small talk, then what chance was there of me ever becoming a functioning member of society? But then I discovered that there exists a place where all manner of oddballs and misfits of the world can be happily accommodated. The City. There was a firm looking for a trainee broker with enough smarts to manage a bank of clients but not enough gumption to ask uncomfortable questions. They thought I would fit right in. And they were right. No one cared about who I was or what I was doing that weekend, just as long as I made money, which (hidden behind a phone and computer) I did pretty well. Ironically, shallowness and anomie – an anathema for most right-thinking people – became my nirvana. Dialling phones all day, working long hours, not distracting myself in horseplay. For the first time, it didn’t mean I was weird; it meant I was super-focused. Related: Being in a psychiatric hospital felt wrong, but it was the turning point I needed | Anonymous By no means was any of this a redemptive experience or a model of overcoming adversity, but it did confirm that survival is possible for someone who does not do well in social situations. It also made me wonder how many people there are out there who are perfectly capable of doing all sorts of jobs, but are passed over by employers and overzealous human resources departments worried that anxious dispositions mean smaller profit margins, or imagine social awkwardness means having Norman Bates running amok in their organisation. I think that all of society, and not only social anxiety sufferers, could benefit from a new outlook; one that does not make being the life and soul of the party the ultimate imperative. I felt great relief the moment I decided to stop apologising for being a quiet person who likes doing quiet person things. Such is the nature of social anxiety, that once I accepted who I was, and crucially, let other people know, the weight and shame of the condition evaporated leaving me feeling less, well, anxious. There are still down days, but being truly comfortable with my quietness has at last got me to the stage where the reaction of most people who I tell about my condition is to exclaim: “What? You’re not shy!” – which is as humorous as it is gratifying. • In the UK, the Samaritans can be contacted on 116 123. In the US, the National Suicide Prevention Hotline is 1-800-273-8255.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? If the diarrhea happened within a day or so of changing cat foods or introducing a new food, it could be the new diet. Go back to the old food that was not causing problems and the stool may go back to normal. When the stool is firmed up, try changing the diet very gradually, a little new food at a time. If you suspect your cat is allergic to her food, try changing her diet. Food sensitivities (allergies) do occur in cats and may cause diarrhea. So, when changing the diet, make sure the new food has very different ingredients than the old food, otherwise, there may not be much difference to the cat at all. Your veterinarian can also discuss with you trying a high fiber diet for your cat. This may include the use of a prescription diet available only through veterinary channels, and not found on the pet store shelves. Royal Canin, Hill’s Prescription Diets and Purina pet food companies have a veterinary-only subset of diets created for special medical conditions. For some pets, you might slowly introduce a new food. A good ratio might be 90 percent current food and 10 percent new food. Gradually increase the amount until you reach all new food in about 10 days. Let your kitty tell you how fast you can switch to the new diet. Other cats may prefer adding 10% new food and remaining at that ratio for 3-5 days before adding in 10% more. There is no hard and fast rule and it is not a race. Adding half a teaspoon of unflavored Metamucil into your cat's food once or twice a day for 5-7 days  may help firm things up. Canned plain pumpkin may do the same thing. Both Metamucil and canned pumpkin are high in fiber. Probiotics add good intestinal “bugs” back into the gastrointestinal system to help rebalance a system that is out of sorts with the diarrhea. An easy and tasty option is FortiFlora for cats, an over the counter (OTC) Purina product. Water loss can be significant with ongoing diarrhea and your pet can get dehydrated. To detect dehydration, gently pinch the normally loose skin at the back of the neck. When a cat is normally hydrated, the skin snaps right back down. If the pinched skin smooths out slowly, or remains tented, the cat is dehydrated. If the cat appears to be dehydrated, take her to the vet right away.","output":"If your cat has diarrhea, try slowly changing their food, adding fiber like pumpkin or Metamucil, giving probiotics, and checking for dehydration, but ask a vet for help if needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Although it is considered a delicacy in Japan and some other countries, meat from whales -- an endangered species -- cannot be sold legally in the United States. \\"We write to address the misdemeanor charge recently filed by the U.S. attorney,\\" the restaurant said in a statement posted on its Web site. \\"In serving this meat, OPTIONS: - CNN ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - California ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - Hump ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - Japan ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - Kiyoshiro Yamamoto ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - Los Angeles ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - Santa Monica ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - The Hump ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - Typhoon Restaurant Inc. ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - U.S. ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" - United States ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\"","output":"- The Hump ignored its responsibilities to help save endangered whales from extinction and failed to support the world community in its uphill fight to protect all endangered species.\\" The reason this is the correct choice is because the passage talks about the restaurant, The Hump, being charged for serving whale meat. This means that The Hump is the one ignoring its responsibilities. All the other choices are incorrect because they are not the focus of the passage. The passage is not about CNN, California, Japan, Kiyoshiro Yamamoto, Los Angeles, Santa Monica, Typhoon Restaurant Inc., U.S., or United States ignoring their responsibilities. It specifically mentions the restaurant The Hump as the one facing charges for serving endangered whale meat."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: What may happen after they come to this conclusion ?","output":"Upon coming to the conclusion that it's best for their pet to have a fresh start, they may decide on option (A): Taking their dog to an adoption center. The following events can potentially occur after making this decision: 1. Research and select a suitable adoption center: They will need to look for a reputable and trusted adoption center in their area that specializes in dog adoptions, or at least has a proven track record of successful dog adoptions. This may include researching online, asking for recommendations from friends or family, or checking reviews on sites like Yelp or Google. 2. Prepare their dog for the adoption process: They will need to gather all relevant documents, such as the dog's vaccination records, medical history, and any other pertinent information that the adoption center may require. It's also essential to ensure the dog is groomed and is in good health before going to the adoption center. 3. Schedule and attend a meeting with the adoption center: They will need to contact the chosen adoption center and set up an appointment to discuss the dog's needs and situation. It's crucial to be honest about their reasons for surrendering the dog and provide any helpful information to the adoption center staff to help them find an appropriate new home. 4. Completing the surrender process: Upon arriving at the adoption center, they will need to complete the necessary paperwork, including an explanation of their reasoning for giving up the dog and any applicable fees. They may also discuss the center's policies on updates about the dog's well-being and their potential involvement in selecting a new home for the dog. 5. Emotional adjustment: It's likely they will experience a range of emotions during this time, from relief to sadness and guilt. It's crucial to remember that the decision to surrender the dog was not taken lightly and that they are ultimately looking out for the dog's best interests. 6. Helping the dog transition: The adoption center staff will assess the dog, including its behavior, temperament, and any specific requirements, to help find the best new home for them. They will work to match the dog with appropriate adopters who can provide a loving, safe, and supportive environment. 7. Periodic follow-ups and updates: Depending on the adoption center's policies, they may receive updates on their dog's well-being and adjustment to their new home. This can provide reassurance that the dog is being well-cared for, and help them find closure in their decision. 8. Reflecting and moving forward: As they embark on their move and adjust to life without their dog, they may reflect on the circumstances that led to this decision and continue to seek comfort in knowing they chose the best possible outcome for their beloved pet. They may also consider adopting a new pet in the future, once their living situation is more stable and conducive to providing a long-term, loving home for an animal in need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Ross McEwen pulls an unusual bank job in the New Mexico town of Santa Maria, taking the banker Frenger with him, then letting him go a few miles away, minus boots but with an I.O.U. for the 2,000 he stole. Pat Garrett, the new marshal, will try to catch the thief, as will bounty hunters after Frenger's reward offer of 3,000. McEwen is bitten by a rattlesnake before he can board a train, where he is helped by a couple of passengers, Monte Marquez, a gambler, and Fay Hollister, a nurse. The train tracks are washed out near Albuquerque, so the small group goes off alone via a route used to deliver mail. Fay finds out a posse from Santa Maria is after a wanted man and recalls that's where McEwen came on board. But he and she have developed an attraction. When they reach an Alamogordo saloon that Marquez's cousins run, a cattleman named Burnett is willing to take on McEwen as a hired hand. Garrett and deputy Clint Waters come to town, so McEwen must leave but offers her an engagement ring. Fay rides along, but ends up separated and captured by Garrett's men. After crossing the desert with difficulty, McEwen comes across a Mexican rancher named Florencio, whose family is ill. He stays to help and starts a fire to signal the lawmen, needing their assistance. Marquez gets there along with Garrett and Fay, but because Florencio is another relative of his, pretends that McEwen is a total stranger. Garrett isn't fooled, though, and McEwen is convinced to turn himself in, the marshal promising to vouch for his good deed.

Given the question: I saw one last night on an episode of Designated Survivor. To qualify this, I’m not normally bothered by product placements. Sometimes they can even add to the scene. But this one was bad, really bad. Agent is busy hunting for baddies. Finishes questioning one naughty person who climbs in his Ford F150 and speeds off. So far, so good - it is the sort of vehicle a country-living billionaire bad-guy would drive. The agent then pulls out her phone and… Move to close up of phone screen showing Ford app already loaded (and screen unlocked!). Agent slowly moves finger to app. Does something. Pause as app does fancy graphics. Cut to car interior. Shot of dash, showing Ford logo on steering wheel. It’s bright blue - are they not normally grey or more subtle? Pause for a second… Zoom in on dash. Dash light up. Car starts. Show pretty dash lights for a second or so. Cut to agent Agent walks to car, gets in drives off. Lingering shot of rear of car. It was just so clumsy. Massive halt to the flow of the scene to show it. In most films you never see anyone starting cars, putting on seatbelts or similar unless this is part of the plot because it’s unnecessary and not interesting to watch. I sort of expected the remote start function to have some sort of relevance later… but no, it was totally ignored. Added to that: There was no password or security on her phone - and this is an agent investigating super secret stuff. If you don’t show her unlocking the phone, why show her lovingly prodding the app? They are as relevant. She unlocked and started the car while she was 20–30 paces away, on the grounds of a suspect ranch. Someone could easily have jumped in the car. Not very security conscious.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"The suggested answer provides statistical data on the worldwide mortality rate of stomach cancer but does not address the specific question of the prognosis of stomach cancer.  Stomach cancer prognosis depends on various factors such as the stage of the cancer, one's general health, age, response to treatment, and the specifics of the tumor. The five-year survival rate for stomach cancer is generally used to discuss the prognosis.  If the cancer is localized and only in one area of the stomach, the 5-year survival rate is about 69%. If the cancer is in lymph nodes or nearby structures, the survival rate decreases to about 31%. In situations where the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, the survival rate further declines to about 5%. However, these are general numbers, and individual prognosis can vary greatly based on the factors mentioned above and advances in treatment. Therefore, the suggested answer is not a complete or accurate response to the question. The prognosis for stomach cancer involves more than just the yearly death rate. In other words, the proposed answer should provide information on survival rates and other factors that affect prognosis, not the mortality rate alone.

Hypothesis: The man is dressed professionally. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Based on the premise provided, we can gather several pieces of information about the man: 1. He is wearing a military-style uniform. 2. He is standing in a public corridor. 3. He has his arms positioned behind his back. These details give us an understanding of the man's attire and posture. Uniforms—especially military-style uniforms—are often associated with professionalism and discipline. In most cases, military personnel and related occupations adhere to specific guidelines regarding their uniforms, personal grooming, and etiquette, reflecting a sense of order and authority. Given the context of the man's attire and posture, it is reasonable to infer that he is dressed professionally. Military-style uniforms convey an image of professionalism and formality, much like a suit or other business attire. Additionally, the man's posture, with his arms behind his back, also implies a sense of discipline, further supporting the image of professionalism. Thus, if the premise is true, we can confidently conclude that, within the context of military standards and conventions, the hypothesis (the man is dressed professionally) is likely true as well. However, it is essential to consider the possibility that the uniform might be worn inappropriately or in an unauthorized manner, deviating from established professional standards, such as an imitation or costume. If this circumstance is the case, the conclusion about the hypothesis could be challenged. Overall, considering the information provided in the premise, it is highly probable that the man is dressed professionally. Understanding and validating this hypothesis would rely on the context and further verification of the legitimacy of the military-style uniform worn by the man."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - John O.

Article: Deep in the wilderness of northern Kenya, two boys found a pair of crying cheetah cubs  . The cubs' mother had been killed by a lion. The cheetahs were only a few weeks old. In the wild, about 9 out of 10 cheetah cubs die before they are three months old. They are food for lions. But these cubs were so lucky that they were saved by their \\"heroes\\", who brought them to Jane and Ian Craig. The Craigs help save endangered animals at the Lewa Wildlife Conservancy. The Craigs nursed the cheetah cubs back to health -- feeding them with bottles, sleeping with them, and comforting them. They named the cubs Sambu and Toki. But what would become of these cubs? How would they survive on their own? In the wild, cubs stay with their mothers until they are almost 2 years old. During that time, cheetah mothers teach their young how to hunt and how to protect themselves. The Craigs wouldn't be able to find a cheetah mother to teach the cubs. So they turned to a man named Simon King. King has spent more than twenty years studying cheetahs. He gave them a nod of approval when hearing about this, though taking care of two baby cubs would take a huge amount of time. For two years, he would need to have them at his side most of the time. But he felt there was no other choice. And so, when the brothers were one month old, King became their father. The brothers followed King everywhere. If they saw large dangerous and fierce mammals, King would growl at the cubs the way a mother cheetah would have, which was a signal for the cubs to stay away. They learned quickly. King taught the cheetahs to hunt using a toy rabbit as King pulled it around on a rope. With more lessons and training, the brothers began to hunt on their own. King is one proud father now.

Step 2: Identify the question \\"What uses sweat to adjust to hot temperatures?\\" The question asks which organisms or group of organisms use sweat to regulate their body temperature in response to a hot environment. Step 3: Analyze the provided information to answer the question The statement provided only talks about human beings using sweat to adjust to hot temperatures. Therefore, we cannot confidently generalize this information to all omnivores since the information does not explicitly include other organisms. Step 4: Determine the correct answer Based on the provided information, the correct answer would be \\"humans\\" as it is explicitly stated that humans use sweat to adjust to hot temperatures. The answer \\"omnivores\\" cannot be confirmed since the statement does not provide adequate information about other omnivorous organisms and their temperature regulatory mechanisms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: (John McDonnell/The Washington Post)It’s been a month since the Capitals learned that Dale Hunter would not return as coach, but on Thursday General Manager George McPhee reiterated that he is taking his time to find the franchise’s next bench boss. Not surprisingly, McPhee was vague when discussing the coaching search with reporters and did not want to divulge names of possible candidates, but he did say not to expect an announcement before the NHL entry draft June 22-23 in Pittsburgh. “It’s been narrowed down a little bit but we’ll get there when we get there,” McPhee said. “I don’t anticipate doing anything before the draft. We’ll work on that, but we’re working on other things as well.” This will be the fifth coaching hire McPhee has made during his tenure as general manager, but it’s only the second time — and first since 2002 — that he’ll have found a coach in the offseason. Bruce Cassidy was the only other coach McPhee hired in the offseason. “I think you want to make a real thoughtful decision. You have certain things in your mind in what you want in a coach and when you do it in the summer, you just have more time,” McPhee said. “There’s no need to set an artificial deadline, to have it done before the draft or have it done by summer camp. “The Devils hired a guy in [mid-July] last year and they end up in the finals,” he added. “I think in terms of housekeeping some people like to get it done before the draft but I just don’t think it’s that important. What’s important is hiring the right person and really being able to come to your team with a terrific head coach and knowing that you’ve really done a real comprehensive job in the summer of talking to these people.” So what is McPhee looking for? Every coach he’s hired previously did not have NHL head coaching experience, but asked if time spent on an NHL bench even as an assistant was a prerequisite, McPhee said “not necessarily; we’re wide open.” Possible candidates range in experience and background from those with plenty of head coaching experience like Pat Quinn, Marc Crawford and Terry Murray; to NHL assistant coaches Adam Oates, Mike Sullivan and John Stevens; to up-and-coming AHL coach Jon Cooper, who just won the Calder Cup with the Norfolk Admirals. Paul Maurice and Flyers assistant Craig Berube were both interviewed but according to numerous reports, both have been told they’re no longer in the running. Capitals assistant coaches Dean Evason and Jim Johnson are believed to have interviewed for the vacancy as well, but when asked if either would be returning to the organization, McPhee said “not sure; probably not — we’ll see.” While McPhee wasn’t expansive in the qualities he’s looking for in a coach, he did provide a window into the style the Capitals will play, which likely won’t be the system Hunter utilized. McPhee said he wants to see a more up-tempo style, but in conjunction with the work ethic and commitment level the Capitals showed with Hunter at the helm. “Do you hire the coach to fit your talent? Do you hire the coach whose system you like? It’s generally a combination of both things. Who can coach this group of players, and do we like the style of play that this coach likes to use,” McPhee said. “But as I said when we met right after the playoffs, it’s not necessarily the style of play that’s most important. If you’re the coach, you’ve got to sell this to the players and have them buy in and that’s what works. If you can get everybody to buy in. “We really liked the way that the team competed, that was something that we’ve been trying to get to,” McPhee said. “To have them compete like that, and they were terrific. They played their guts out; it was great. We want to maintain that kind of commitment and play a little more up-tempo.” Caps announce 2012-13 preseason schedule Halpern won’t be back with Capitals Knuble: Caps’ stars not kids anymore Write a title for it.","output":"\\"George McPhee Prioritizes Careful Selection Over Speed in Search for Next Capitals' Coach\\""},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Summit Plantation House -  Summit Plantation House was built for William and Amarinthia Wilkinson in 1819 and is a relatively intact example of a modest Federal style plantation house.

Note whether the line is straight. Since the equation of the line is in slope-intercept form, it has a constant slope, meaning the line is straight. So potentially, the variables are directly proportional. Determine the y-intercept. If the variables are directly proportional, the line will pass through the point (0,0){displaystyle (0,0)}. The y-intercept of this line is the point (0,3){displaystyle (0,3)}. So, the variables are not directly proportional.

The term \\"cheesy\\" often refers to something that lacks originality, is overly sentimental, clichéd, or insincere in expression. This perception of cheesiness implies that the work in question might not connect with the audience or be taken seriously, and its message could be lost, thereby leading to a less than favorable response.  The context in which the term \\"cheesy\\" is being used is crucial in understanding the overall sentiment. For instance, if the sentence is used to describe a comedy, the response might be less negative since humor is the central focus. However, if the sentence refers to a drama or a romance, the connotations would be more negative as audiences expect more depth and sincerity in these genres. By analyzing the sentiment, it is evident that the speaker is not impressed with the quality of the dialogue and that it could detract from their enjoyment or engagement with the subject matter. The implication is that the author or speaker of the cheesy dialogue failed to create a unique or convincing narrative, resulting in a lack of impact and a weakened connection with the audience. Moreover, when the expression \\"full of cheesy dialogue\\" is used, it implies that the issue is not just with a single line but rather that it continues throughout the work, which may exacerbate the negative impression. Consequently, the sentiment tells us that the speaker is not only disappointed with a particular instance but thinks the whole work is flawed in terms of dialogue. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"full of cheesy dialogue\\" is generally perceived as negative, reflecting the speaker's dissatisfaction and critique of the work in question. Depending on the context and the audience's expectations, the phrase could point to the lack of originality, insincerity, excessive sentimentality, or the resorting to clichés in crafting dialogue. This perception could lead to a diminished connection with the audience and weaken the overall impact of the work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question What may happen if the writer does not seek medical attention ? Answer:","output":"If the writer does not seek medical attention, there could be several potential outcomes, depending on the underlying cause of their symptoms. It is important to note that this answer is not meant to replace a professional medical opinion or diagnosis. However, some possible scenarios include the following: 1. No adverse consequences: It is possible that the writer is experiencing benign palpitations or occasional irregular heartbeats, which may not necessarily be harmful or indicative of a serious condition. In this case, not seeking medical attention might not result in any adverse consequences. 2. Undiagnosed heart condition: If the writer has an undiagnosed heart condition such as a heart murmur, arrhythmia, or structural abnormality, not seeking medical attention could potentially result in the condition worsening or causing complications. An electrocardiogram (EKG) might be helpful in identifying certain heart conditions, although it may not always pick up or accurately diagnose every issue. 3. Missing a treatable condition: Without seeking medical attention, the writer could miss out on effective treatments or management strategies that could help alleviate their symptoms or improve their overall heart health. Many heart conditions can be managed through medication, lifestyle modifications, or in some cases, surgical interventions. Delayed diagnoses and treatments can lead to avoidable complications and may increase the risk of more serious health issues down the line. 4. Anxiety and worry: Not addressing the writer's concerns could lead to increased anxiety and worry, which might, in turn, contribute to perceived or actual worsening of their symptoms. This could result in a negative impact on their overall mental and emotional well-being. 5. Potential emergencies: In some cases, untreated heart conditions can lead to life-threatening emergencies like heart failure, stroke, or blood clots. Failing to seek medical attention for symptoms that might be indicative of a heart issue could put the writer at risk for such emergencies. In summary, not seeking medical attention for symptoms like irregular or unusual heartbeats can pose various risks, from missing out on a treatable condition to experiencing potentially life-threatening complications. It is always advisable for the writer to consult with a healthcare professional, who can perform appropriate diagnostic tests, such as an EKG or other cardiac investigations, and provide an accurate diagnosis and appropriate medical treatment or advice."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1898, a large plot of land was sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. for the construction of 1,200 houses. The houses were never built, but the land later became the site of Trafford Park Village, known locally as The Village. The announced arrival of the Westinghouse factory acted a spur to development, and in 1899, Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd was formed, with the aim of providing housing for the anticipated influx of new workers. Nuttall's land was acquired, and by 1903 more than 500 houses had been built, rising to over 700 when the development was completed in 1904. In 1907 it was estimated that the population of the Village was 3,060. The development was laid out in a grid pattern, with the roads numbered instead of being named. Avenues numbered 1 to 4 run north–south, streets numbered 1 to 12 run east–west. The Village was almost completely self-contained, with its own shops, public hall, post office, police station, school, social club, and sports facilities. Three corrugated iron churches were built: a Methodist chapel in 1901, St Cuthberts (Church of England) in 1902, and the Roman Catholic St Antony's in 1904. St Cuthbert's was subsequently replaced by a brick building, but closed in 1982. Only St Antony's remains open; it contains the altar and a stained glass window from the chapel at Trafford Hall, donated by Lady Annette de Trafford. The Village's design attracted criticism from the start; the streets were narrow, with few gardens, and the whole development was close to the pollution of the neighbouring industries. In that respect it resembled the terraced properties in the surrounding areas, many of which were condemned as slums in later years. By the 1970s The Village was also considered by Stretford Council to be a slum area, and unsuitable for residential housing. In the first phase of clearance, during the mid-1970s, 298 houses were demolished. A further 325 houses were demolished in the early 1980s, leaving only the largest 84 houses remaining. Answer:","output":"The first name of the person whose land was acquired is not mentioned explicitly in the given context. The land was initially sold to Edmund Nuttall & Co. in 1898, and later Trafford Park Dwellings Ltd acquired Nuttall's land for the development of Trafford Park Village.

Their study found that theobromine , found in cocoa, was nearly a third more effective in stopping coughs than codeine, which was considered the best cough medicine at present. The Imperial College London researchers who published their results online said the discovery could lead to more effective cough treatment. \\"While coughing is not necessarily harmful it can have a major effect on the quality of life, and this discovery could be a huge step forward in treating this problem,\\" said Professor Peter Barnes. Ten healthy volunteers were given theobromine, codeine or placebo, a pill that contains no medicine, during the experiment. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers knew who received which pill. The researchers then measured levels of capsaicin, which is used in research to cause coughing and as a sign of how well the medicines are stopping coughs. The team found that, when the volunteers were given theobromine, the capsaicin needed to produce a cough was around a third higher than in the placebo group. When they were given codeine they needed only slightly higher levers of capsaicin to cause a cough compared with the placebo. The researchers said that theobromine worked by keeping down a nerve activity , which cause coughing. They also found that unlike some standard cough treatments, theobromine caused no side effects such as sleepiness.   Question: According to Professor Barnes, theobromine   _  .

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Based on the sentence \\"A man entering a busy street.\\", is the sentence \\"A man is near traffic.\\" a true sentence?","output":"Based on the sentence \\"A man entering a busy street,\\" it can be reasonably inferred that the sentence \\"A man is near traffic\\" can be true.  In order to justify this, let's break down the information provided in the first sentence: 1. A man: The subject is a human male. 2. Entering: The action that the man is performing is that of moving into or going into. 3. A busy street: The location of this action is a street that is described as busy, which suggests a significant amount of activity, likely including vehicular traffic. From this information, it can be concluded that the man is moving into an area where there is likely to be a considerable amount of vehicular movement. Now let's examine the second sentence: \\"A man is near traffic.\\" 1. A man: The subject is, once again, a human male, consistent with the first sentence. 2. Is near: This phrase suggests that the man is close to or in proximity to something. 3. Traffic: The focus of the man's proximity is traffic, which typically refers to the movement of vehicles along roads or streets. Given that the first sentence describes a man entering a busy street, it can be inferred that he is moving into a location characterized by vehicular movement, which aligns with the concept of traffic. As entry into a busy street implies that the man is close to or surrounded by this vehicular activity, the second sentence's assertion that \\"a man is near traffic\\" can be considered true based on the information provided in the first sentence. It's important to note that context and additional information might impact this inference. For example, if the street is busy due to street performances, vendors, or other non-traffic-related activities, the sentence \\"A man is near traffic\\" may not necessarily be true. However, based solely on the information provided in the prompt, it is reasonable to consider that the man's proximity to a busy street correlates to his proximity to traffic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does day mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"No, the word \\"day\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences.  In the first sentence, \\"He was a successful pianist in his day,\\" the word \\"day\\" is used in the sense of a general period of time, such as a specific era or timeframe in history or in someone's life. Here, \\"his day\\" means the time when the subject was at the peak of his career, popularity, success, etc. It's an idiomatic expression implying the period when he was most active or successful as a pianist. This usage is often found when referring to the apex or high point of someone's career or life. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"In the days of the Roman Empire,\\" the word \\"day\\" is used to refer to a much longer and more specific historical period. This context is speaking about a more concrete period in the past, specifically the duration of the Roman Empire – which lasted for hundreds of years. Here, \\"days\\" is used as a synonymous term for \\"times\\" or \\"era.\\"  A key difference is that \\"in his day\\" is more subjective and variable, depending on the life or career length of the individual in question, while \\"the days of the Roman Empire\\" refers to a set, widely recognized period in world history. As such, though the word \\"day\\" is used in both sentences, its meaning varies greatly, dictated by the context in which it is being used.

In this sentence, the main components are: - \\"Furthermore\\" (indicating a continuation or addition to a previous point) - \\"agricultural subsidies\\" (the subject - financial support provided to farmers) - \\"must be coupled\\" (the action - linking or connecting) - \\"to stronger requirements\\" (the object - more strict rules or conditions) - \\"on ammonia discharge\\" (referring to the release of ammonia) Step 2: Create a literal translation of the sentence into German, using appropriate vocabulary and grammar. Literally translating each component of the sentence: \\"Furthermore\\" = \\"Darüber hinaus\\" \\"agricultural subsidies\\" = \\"Agrarsubventionen\\" \\"must be coupled\\" = \\"müssen gekoppelt werden\\" \\"to stronger requirements\\" = \\"an strengere Anforderungen\\" \\"on ammonia discharge\\" = \\"bei Ammoniakemissionen\\" Step 3: Assemble the translated components into a coherent German sentence, observing proper word order and grammar.

Surveillance video shows Taylor jumping on vehicles in a car park and driving a car through a window into the showroom. Taylor's death is one of several cases under scrutiny in the US, in which an unarmed black person has died during an arrest or while in police custody. Although Taylor - a student at Angelo State University in West Texas - failed to heed Mr Miller's orders, Chief Johnson said that there was no physical contact between the officer and Taylor. Mr Miller, a recent graduate of the city's police academy, shot Taylor four times, killing him. Chief Johnson said Mr Miller failed to follow police department policy and put himself and other officers in danger. The police chief said the officer \\"exercised poor judgement\\". Mr Miller, 49, has not been charged with any crime. However, police are still investigating and will turn over evidence to a grand jury, which will decide whether to charge him. It is uncommon for a police officer in the US to be dismissed so quickly after a shooting involving the police. The investigative process normally takes months, which has frustrated victims' families elsewhere.

After finding success in country pop-styled music, McBride released her next studio album, Timeless, in 2005, which consisted of country covers. The album included cover versions of country music standards, such as Hank Williams' \\"You Win Again,\\" Loretta Lynn's \\"You Ain't Woman Enough,\\" and Kris Kristofferson's \\"Help Me Make It Through the Night.\\" To make the album fit its older style, McBride and her husband hired older Nashville session players and outdated analog equipment. The album sold over 250,000 copies within its first week, the highest sales start for a McBride album. The lead single, a cover of Lynn Anderson's \\"(I Never Promised You a) Rose Garden\\", went to number 18 on the country charts, but the other two singles both failed to make top 40.

For instance, if the help is being expected from a friend or a family member and the task is reasonable and not harmful to others, then it is appropriate. However, if the help is being expected in a manipulative or selfish manner, it could be less ethical. ACTION2: Talking to my biological mother only to get some documents I want. This action appears to have an element of selfishness, as the conversation is solely centered on obtaining documents rather than establishing or maintaining a relationship with the biological mother. In this situation, the lack of genuine interest in the mother or her feelings can be considered less ethical.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years after the Battle of Rullion Green was the Battle of Drumclog?","output":"Title: The Connection between the Battle of Rullion Green and the Battle of Drumclog: Exploring the Timeline of Conflict in 17th Century Scotland Introduction The Battle of Rullion Green and the Battle of Drumclog were two significant events during the 17th century in Scotland that had everlasting effects on the socio-political landscape of the time. The battles occurred in the backdrop of a tenuous political atmosphere, characterized by religious struggles, factionalism, and power plays. To understand the connection between these events, it is essential to look at the timeline and answer the question: How many years after the Battle of Rullion Green was the Battle of Drumclog? Background: The Battle of Rullion Green (1666) The Battle of Rullion Green took place on November 28, 1666, in the Pentland Hills near Edinburgh, Scotland. It was the climax of the Pentland Rising, a series of events in which disaffected Presbyterians, then labeled as Covenanters, rose against the English crown's interference in Scottish ecclesiastical affairs. The roots of the conflict can be traced back to the era of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, which included the English Civil War, the Irish Confederate Wars, and the Scottish Civil War. This period saw significant resistance against the imposition of the Anglican episcopacy and prayer book in Scotland, embodied in the signing of the National Covenant in 1638 and the Solemn League and Covenant in 1643. However, after the English Commonwealth period and the restoration of Charles II in 1660, Scottish Presbyterians found themselves facing renewed challenges. The King sought to establish Anglicanism across the kingdom, leading to the passage of the Act of Uniformity in 1662, which effectively forced countless ministers from their livings. This act, along with other measures taken by the government, only fueled the discontent among the Covenanters. The Battle of Rullion Green marked the end of the Pentland Rising. Despite having some initial successes, the Covenanter force of approximately 900 men under the command of Colonel James Wallace ultimately faced defeat at the hands of a well-prepared royal army led by General Tam Dalyell. The battle's aftermath was one of repression, and the Scottish government reasserted its authority through imprisonment, execution, and other punitive measures. The Battle of Drumclog (1679) Fast forward to June 1, 1679, 12 and a half years after the Battle of Rullion Green, the Battle of Drumclog took place in South Lanarkshire, Scotland. This was a significant event during the period known as \\"The Killing Time,\\" another Covenanter uprising against the Anglican policies of Charles II. The catalyst for this uprising was the assassination of Archbishop James Sharp in May 1679 by a group of Covenanters. The Killing Time is remembered for its brutal suppression of Scottish Presbyterians by the government. Troops led by government-affiliated nobles, such as John Graham of Claverhouse, were dispatched across the country to identify and punish those who refused to conform to the state-supported Anglican church. At Drumclog, the Covenanters achieved a surprising victory against a larger force of government soldiers commanded by Claverhouse. Though the battle was relatively small in scale, it was a symbolic triumph for the Covenanters, who emphasized divine intervention as the cause of their success. Nonetheless, this victory would be short-lived, as the government forces quickly regrouped and decisively defeated the Covenanters at the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in the same month. Conclusion The Battles of Rullion Green and Drumclog, separated by 12 and a half years, reveal the prolonged struggle of Scottish Presbyterians against the religious and political policies of the time. Despite the eventual defeat of the Scottish insurgents, the Covenanters' resistance would continue to define the period's socio-political narrative. These conflicts contributed to the enduring divisions between the Anglican episcopacy and Presbyterianism in Scotland, and they represent important moments in the history of religious and political dissent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This type of cream can significantly reduce flare-ups, though it may take up to 3 weeks. Your doctor can prescribe a stronger cream than you can get over the counter so you’re able to manage your atopic dermatitis long term.  The best time to apply the cream is right after you shower. Rub the cream on the affected areas.  Make sure you only use the corticosteroid cream as your doctor directs you, as they can have serious side effects if you use them too long on any particular area. A lukewarm bath can help relieve the symptoms of eczema, taking the sting out of warm skin. Bath your child with eczema once daily, but not for more than 10 minutes at a time. Add a dash or two of bath oil to the water, and apply a moisturizer or corticosteroid cream afterward.  Some people find colloidal oatmeal effective. You can find colloidal oatmeal at a drug store. Add it to a warm bath, and sit in the bath 10-15 minutes.  When skin is infected, use bath time to soften scabs. Gently rub off the scabs after the bath, as creams should be applied directly to skin. Do not add bubble bath or other such additives to your bath. These will irritate your skin. A bleach bath sounds harsh, but it can actually be helpful to kill the bacteria on your skin that cause eczema flare-ups. If your doctor approves it, add a 1/2 cup of household bleach to a lukewarm bath. You or your child can take a bleach bath once a day. Don't soak in the bleach bath for longer than 5-10 minutes.  For an infant or toddler bleach bath, add 1 teaspoon (4.9 mL) of bleach per 1 gallon (3.8 L) of water. Do not apply bleach directly to the skin. This could cause irritation. While it can be difficult to isolate what irritants or allergens cause a flare-up, it can be important for dealing with atopic dermatitis. For irritants, everything from bar soap to laundry soap and to perfume and cigarette smoke can cause flare-ups. To isolate what irritants affect the person with atopic dermatitis, try switching out items one at time. For instance, you can start by trying a more natural laundry detergent. If that's not it, you can try switching out the soap used in the bath or shower for another one. If you have atopic dermatitis, you may also be more sensitive to certain allergies, including food and airborne allergens. They may cause normal reactions, as well as causing your eczema to flare up. Try to determine what causes allergic reactions for you by keeping a food journal, so you can track allergic reactions against what you eat.  For food allergies, foods such as peanuts, wheat, soy, milk, and eggs can cause allergic reactions, including an eczema flare-up, in children and adults with atopic dermatitis.  Some airborne allergens you may be more susceptible to include pet dander, pollen, and dust mites.  Ask your doctor about allergy testing if you cannot determine what you or your child may be allergic to. Some food allergies, especially peanuts, can cause life-threatening reactions. If you believe you or your child is having an allergic reaction to a food, seek medical care immediately. Fabrics that scratch the skin, such as wool and even some man-made fibers, can also cause flare-ups. Choose fabrics that don't scratch, and make sure clothing fits properly so it doesn't rub. Natural fibers such as cotton, silk, and bamboo are good choices, but avoid wool.  Also, remove tags from clothes or by ones without, as they can rub, as well.  Always wash new clothes before wearing them, as they can still have irritating dyes and chemicals in them. Keep your skin moisturized, as it can help keep eczema flare-ups to a minimum. In addition, it can help soften your skin, easing the pain of eczema. Pick a cream that is thick and fragrance-free. Fragrances can irritate skin if you have eczema. In fact, something simple such as petroleum jelly can be effective. Wet therapy is the process of apply wet bandages at night to help soothe eczema. They reduce heat on the skin, block you from scratching, and help moisturize the skin.  First apply a corticosteroid cream to the irritated areas of the skin. Use a moisturizer all over the body after the corticosteroid cream. Remember the corticosteroid cream should only be applied to the areas where your eczema is flaring up.  Soak cloth towels, clean bandages, or paper towels in water with a small squirt of unscented bath oil. Wrap the wet towels around the skin. Apply them to the areas that are most severe. You may need to completely cover your arms and legs if the eczema is really bad. Try a wet shirt if your chest is irritated.  Remove them in the morning. You can also apply them during the day. If you do so, take them off when they are dry.  Hold cool, wet towels against the face, but don't wrap them around. Keep them on for 5 minutes. Scratching makes the rash worse. In fact, scratching the rash can cause the skin to thicken in areas and lead to infection. If you have trouble not scratching, cut your nails short or wrap band-aids around your fingertips. Oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), can be helpful to reduce the itching associated with flare-ups. Because they can cause drowsiness, take them before bed. If your atopic dermatitis doesn't respond to at-home treatments, she may recommend other topical or oral treatments. She may also recommend a referral to a dermatologist (skin specialist), who can prescribe other medications.  If your skin becomes infected, or you develop open sores from scratching, your doctor will likely prescribe antibiotics. Your doctor may prescribe oral or injected corticosteroids. These suppress inflammation by mimicking the natural effects of your body's hormones in greater doses. They have the possibility of serious side effects and are not recommended for mild cases or long-term use. Another option is skin-repairing creams. A certain class of drugs called calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, pimecrolimus) alter your immune system when applied to the skin and help reduce atopic dermatitis flare-ups. They can cause serious side effects, so they are usually reserved only for severe cases. Summary:","output":"Managing atopic dermatitis involves the use of prescribed corticosteroid creams, appropriate bathing techniques, identification of irritants or allergens, wearing non-irritating fabrics, maintaining skin hydration, techniques like wet therapy to soothe flare-ups, and various other prescribed treatments if required, including oral or injected corticosteroids and skin-repairing creams."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Hear what your friend or mate has to say first rather than jumping to conclusions or getting defensive.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

Write an article with the title: \\"Cracked Mayan Code May Point to 8 Tons of Lost Treasure\\" Article:","output":"Title: \\"Cracked Mayan Code May Point to 8 Tons of Lost Treasure\\" Introduction: In a groundbreaking discovery, archaeologists and linguists have reportedly cracked a previously unsolved Mayan code, which could potentially lead to an incredible treasure hoard estimated to be around 8 tons in weight. The code, hidden in an ancient Mayan text, has captivated the imagination of historians and treasure hunters alike, opening up new possibilities in the field of archaeology and our understanding of the Mayan civilization. Step-by-step explanation of the discovery: The deciphering of the code was a painstaking process that involved collaboration between multidisciplinary teams of experts. Here's how they did it: 1. Acquiring the ancient text: The mysterious text, which was written on a series of stone tablets, was first discovered during an excavation at a Mayan temple in 2018. The archaeologists involved realized the potential significance of their find and took steps to preserve the delicate artifacts. 2. Deciphering the Mayan script: The next step was translating the Mayan script, which is a highly complicated writing system that has mostly been deciphered in recent decades. A group of linguists and epigraphers was assembled to collaborate on this challenging task. 3. Identifying the code: The researchers noticed recurring patterns and alignments in the layout of the text, suggesting that it contained a hidden message. They approached the task of deciphering the code using a combination of mathematical analysis, pattern recognition, and historical contextualization. 4. Cracking the code: After extensive analysis, the team made a breakthrough when they realized that the code was a sophisticated set of directions encoded into the text that could potentially lead to a treasure of immense value. The text, when deciphered, described what appeared to be a massive trove of gold, silver, and precious stones - estimated to be around 8 tons in total. Potential treasure location and impact on archaeology: The cracked code appears to point to a location deep within the jungles of Central America, which could be the site of a previously undiscovered Mayan city or even a hidden temple complex. This has spurred numerous expeditions and investigations, with the hope of unearthing this extraordinary treasure as well as potentially revealing a wealth of new information regarding the enigmatic Mayan civilization. Moreover, the discovery has revitalized the field of archaeology, pushing researchers to delve deeper into any overlooked evidence within other ancient texts and artifacts. It also highlights the value of interdisciplinary collaboration, and how combining expertise from various fields can lead to transformative breakthroughs in the understanding of our past. Conclusion: The cracking of the Mayan code has opened up a new world of possibility in the quest for lost treasures and the ongoing efforts to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Mayan civilization. As teams of archaeologists eagerly follow the decoded directions in search of the 8-ton treasure trove, the story serves as a powerful reminder of the incredible discoveries that still await us just beneath the surface of human history."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The majority of Sicilians preferred independence to the Savoia kingdom; in 1866, Palermo became the seat of a week-long popular rebellion, which was finally crushed after Martial law was declared. The Italian government blamed anarchists and the Church, specifically the Archbishop of Palermo, for the rebellion and began enacting anti-Sicilian and anti-clerical policies. A new cultural, economic and industrial growth was spurred by several families, like the Florio, the Ducrot, the Rutelli, the Sandron, the Whitaker, the Utveggio, and others. In the early twentieth century Palermo expanded outside the old city walls, mostly to the north along the new boulevards Via Roma, Via Dante, Via Notarbartolo, and Viale della Libertà. These roads would soon boast a huge number of villas in the Art Nouveau style. Many of these were designed by the famous architect Ernesto Basile. The Grand Hotel Villa Igiea, designed by Ernesto Basile for the Florio family, is a good example of Palermitan Art Nouveau. The huge Teatro Massimo was designed in the same period by Giovan Battista Filippo Basile, and built by the Rutelli & Machì building firm of the industrial and old Rutelli Italian family in Palermo, and was opened in 1897.

A coroner ruled a verdict of misadventure at his inquest today.

Gary Windle, a local resident, was found by a farmer amidst the perilous winter weather. The coroner presiding over the inquest delivered a verdict of misadventure today, shedding light on the tragic events leading to Windle's untimely demise. As snow blanketed the landscape, Gary Windle decided to visit a friend for an overnight stay. However, it was during this visit that he changed his mind and decided to head back home. Unbeknownst to him, this seemingly innocuous decision would set in motion a chain of events that ultimately led to his tragic fate. Intending to avoid a potentially hazardous drive home, Windle opted to take a taxi instead. While this may have seemed a safer alternative, sadly, it would not be enough to protect him from the perilous conditions that awaited him on his journey. While details of the incident may never be fully known, the facts pieced together so far suggest that Windle's taxi encountered some kind of trouble en route. Whether this was due to the inclement weather or an unrelated mishap remains uncertain. Whatever the cause, Windle was faced with no other choice but to leave the safety of the taxi and venture forth into the hostile weather on foot. As he trudged through the relentless snow and frost, the weather conditions worsened, swallowing the landscape in a thick, icy white shroud. Despite his best efforts to battle through the storm, the sheer intensity of the natural elements overwhelmed Windle, leaving him with no option but to succumb to nature's relentless force. The following morning, a local farmer stumbled upon Gary Windle's lifeless form, encased in a frozen tomb of snow and ice. The harsh winter weather had claimed another victim, dashing the dreams and hopes of a man who was only trying to return to the warmth and safety of his home. The inquest's verdict of misadventure underscores the unpredictable nature of life and serves as a somber reminder of the importance of respecting and preparing for the forces of nature. This tragedy has left a lasting impact on the Briercliffe community: neighbors, friends, and loved ones mourn the loss of Gary Windle, who left behind an indelible mark in their lives. Residents have come together to offer their support and solace, acknowledging the brief, fragile nature of our existence. In times of tragedy, it is the resilience and unity of a community that emerges as the beacon of hope, love, and perseverance. Although Gary Windle's life was cut tragically short, his memory will live on in the hearts and minds of those who knew him, as a sobering reminder of the unpredictability of life and the profound effect that just one individual can have on the lives they touch."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Enzymes increase the rate of chemical reactions by reducing the amount of activation energy needed for reactants to start reacting. One way this can happen is modeled in the Figure below .

I'd seen Fritz Lang's film on video some years ago. I'd been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magic. Conditions were ideal at Cinematheque Ontario. Pristine full-length print. Intertitles in the original Gothic-script German with simultaneous English translation, accurate without being too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. The film's magic sputtered for a little while but ultimately failed to catch, at least for me. This film bears no real relation to Wagner's Ring cycle as I already knew but some may not. Wagner had adapted the 13th c. Niebelungenlied to his own purposes. Part I of Fritz Lang's epic -- \\"Siegfried\\" -- has much that will be familiar to listeners of Wagner however. \\"Kriemhild's Revenge\\" is the story of Siegfried's wife Kriemhild, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) the Hun, and her desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, the rechristened Nibelungs, for the murder of Siegfried. The spectacular conflagration in this film presumably evolved and expanded in the Wagnerian mythos into his Götterdämmerung, his Twilight of the Gods, and the end of Valhalla. This film remains earthbound. Most of the film is spectacular. The massive sets rival those of \\"Cabiria\\" (1914), which inspired Griffith's \\"Intolerance\\" (1916). Their decoration sets a new benchmark in barbaric splendour. There's a huge cast of scarred, mangy Huns and Art Deco Burgundians. And battles. Battles that never seem to end in fact. Kriemhild is very successful in her plan of revenge. She manages to destroy all around her. Her loyalty to her martyred Siegfried seems not to stem so much from love, or devotion, but from something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth cried out, \\"Unsex me here.\\" She knew she was emotionally unprepared for what she needed to do. But Kriemhild displays no normal human emotions, and certainly nothing one equates with the feminine principle. She is already \\"top full of direst cruelty\\", to borrow Shakespeare's phrase, from the outset. Margarethe Schön and her director convey this with a glower. I don't want to exaggerate, but that glower is virtually the only expression ever to \\"animate\\" Kriemhild's face. It's the ultimate in one-note performances. It's clearly intentional however, not simply a case of poor acting. What we have then on offer is a one-dimensional sketch of an avenging Fury. Some might see Kriemhild as an empowered heroine. I just see the film as misogynistic.","output":"The sentiment of this review is mixed, with both positive and negative aspects. At the beginning, the reviewer expresses excitement and satisfaction about finally seeing the film in a cinema and under ideal conditions. They appreciate the pristine full-length print, the Gothic-script German intertitles with accurate English translation, and the live piano accompaniment. However, soon the reviewer notes that the film's magic did not fully work for them, contributing to a more negative sentiment. They mention that the film has no real relation to Wagner's Ring cycle, which might surprise or disappoint some audience members. Despite this, the reviewer acknowledges positive aspects of the film, such as the familiar elements for those who know Wagner's work, and the grandiose and visually impressive sets that rival those of other historical epics. Additionally, they appreciate the massive cast, the Art Deco Burgundians, the scarred and mangy Huns, and the seemingly never-ending battles. On the other hand, the reviewer expresses disappointment with the character of Kriemhild, describing her as a one-dimensional, vengeful figure motivated more by psychosis than love or devotion. They critique the performance of the actress Margarethe Schön and the character's single-minded portrayal by director Fritz Lang. Furthermore, the reviewer perceives the film as misogynistic due to the depiction of Kriemhild as a cold and relentless avenger with no redeeming qualities. However, they recognize that some viewers might see her as an empowered heroine. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is mixed, containing both positive comments on the film's technical aspects, visual grandeur, and historic inspiration, but also negative viewpoints on the character development and perceived misogyny."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

New York (CNN) -- An Egyptian executive accused of sexually abusing an employee at a luxury hotel in New York pleaded guilty Friday to sex abuse in the third degree and will also face a 5 million lawsuit tied to the case, his attorney said. Mahmoud Abdel-Salam Omar, 74, the chairman of a salt company who once headed an Egyptian bank, had originally been charged with sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment, forcible touching and harassment. He was sentenced to five days' community service, which Omar has already completed. He must also submit his DNA to the state database, said Joan Vollero, a representative for the Manhattan district attorney. \\"What he pled guilty to is less serious than jumping a turnstile in","output":"the New York subway system,\\" said defense attorney Robert Gottlieb. \\"The fact is, Mr. Omar has acknowledged his wrongdoing, expressed his remorse, and taken responsibility for his actions.\\" The victim, a 27-year-old female hotel housekeeper, alleged that Omar grabbed her and forced her to touch him inappropriately during an incident in his room at the Pierre Hotel. The encounter left her frightened and upset, according to the criminal complaint filed by the hotel employee. In addition to the criminal charges, the victim has filed a civil lawsuit against Omar seeking 5 million in damages for the emotional distress, humiliation, loss of dignity, and physical injuries she suffered as a result of the incident. Prosecutors initially sought a more severe punishment, but agreed to the lesser charge given Omar's age, lack of any prior criminal record, and the fact that he admitted guilt and agreed to reach a financial settlement with the victim. \\"While we believe that the initial charges were appropriate in this case, the plea agreement reached today underscores that no person, regardless of their position or status, is above the law in New York City,\\" said Assistant District Attorney Kevin Rooney. The Egyptian Consulate in New York had also been closely following the case, providing support and assistance to Omar and his family since his arrest. With the resolution of the criminal charges, the focus will now shift to the pending civil lawsuit. Legal experts suggest that the guilty plea in the criminal case could have implications for the upcoming civil trial. The admission of guilt could potentially strengthen the victim's case and make it more likely that she might receive a favorable judgment or settlement. Omar's legal team is expected to argue that, while he accepts responsibility for his actions, the 5 million sought by the victim is excessive and unwarranted. The incident has garnered significant attention in both the United States and Egypt due to Omar's high-profile business standing, as well as the fact that it occurred shortly after the high-profile arrest of former International Monetary Fund chief Dominique Strauss-Kahn on similar charges. The cases have sparked conversations around the treatment of hotel workers in the United States and the difficulties faced by employees in reporting and pursuing cases of sexual misconduct perpetrated by guests. Many hotels have taken steps to enhance the security and protection of their employees, including providing panic buttons to summon help in difficult situations. Omar's case serves as a reminder that individuals in positions of power and influence must be held accountable for their actions, regardless of their status or nationality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God.

Mark Duell. PUBLISHED:. 12:07 EST, 2 October 2013. |. UPDATED:. 01:11 EST, 3 October 2013. Guilty: Aqab Hussain (pictured today) went straight into the victims, who were hurled through the air, before the vehicle sped off and left them for dead. Three pedestrians were struck by a car in a deliberate Grand Theft Auto-style revenge attack, a shocking video revealed today. The friends - one of them partially blind - were crossing the road after a night out in Manchester city centre when the Vauxhall Corsa was used as a lethal weapon to knock them over ‘like skittles’. Aqab Hussain, 21 - who was today convicted of four counts of attempted murder - drove straight into the victims, who were hurled through the air, before he sped off and left them for dead. Eyewitness Corey Gordon, 26, who watched the attack from inside his car, later compared it to a sequence from the violent computer game series in which users play the role of car thieves. He said: ‘It was like ten pin bowling where you hit the skittles and they go up in the air. I can only describe it as unreal - a computer game like Grand Theft Auto - as he swerved off line to hit the men. It knocked one of the men at least 7ft into the air.’ Hussain even wobbled his vehicle so he could shake off one of the men who was still on the bonnet, Manchester Crown Court was told. It left Michael Ward, 28, - who was already partially sighted - with skull fractures. He spent 20 days in intensive care after emergency brain surgery and is now paralysed on his right side. The incident occurred after father-of-three Mr Ward, of Bolton, and his friends had gone to the Silks lap dancing club in Manchester city centre, just after midnight on August 21 last year. Five minutes after the party arrived at the club, a group of five men, including Hussain, also entered and bought a Grey Goose vodka bottle from the club for £100 to celebrate the Eid festival. Scroll down for video. Approach: The friends - one of them partially blind - were crossing the road after a night out in Manchester. Deliberate attack: The Vauxhall Corsa was used as a lethal weapon to knock over the three men 'like skittles' When the club closed at 2.15am there was a fight in which a cap was taken from one of Hussain’s friends during horseplay but was handed back. A further row erupted outside during which one of the Hussain’s group was heard saying ‘watch, you just watch yourself’. Minutes later Hussain’s silver Corsa emerged from a side road, turning the wrong way then sped up to 40mph as it mowed down Mr Ward and his three friends as they crossed the road. One stepped back on to the pavement in time and was uninjured, but the other three men were hit by the car. Martin Harris suffered minor injuries and Paul Hulme had a broken leg which needed surgery to insert a metal rod. Mr Ward was carried on the bonnet of the Corsa for several feet as the driver swerved to throw him into the road. He is now unable to use his right hand and she said his cognitive functions including speech had been seriously affected and would leave him dependant on others. Mowed down: Hussain's silver Corsa emerged from a side road, turning the wrong way then sped up to 40mph. Awful: Mr Ward was carried on the bonnet for several feet as the driver swerved to throw him into the road. Ian Metcalfe, prosecuting, said: ‘What other intention could the defendant he have had in driving the way he did other than attempting to murder those who he drove into. 'It was like ten pin bowling where you hit the skittles and they go up in the air. It knocked one of the men at least 7ft into the air' Corey Gordon, witness. ‘The Corsa didn’t stop and the occupants made no attempt to stop or assist. Even at the point of impact with the young men, the driver did nothing to apply his brakes to swerve to avoid the collision - nothing at all to avoid the pedestrians crossing. ‘That vehicle only starts to veer from side to side when it has one of the victims is on the bonnet and veers in an attempt to throw him off the bonnet.’ ‘The only sensible interpretation of the manner the Corsa was driven is the driver, no doubt inflamed by whatever had gone on a couple of minutes before intended to kill. He was deliberately using that vehicle as a lethal weapon.’ Hussain, of Rusholme, Greater Manchester, was arrested on October 11 as he arrived back in Manchester on a flight from Pakistan. Leaving: Hussain had previous convictions for dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident. Likeness: An eyewitness compared the attack to a sequence from the violent computer game series Grand Theft Auto, in which users play the role of car thieves (file picture) He denied driving the car and denied all charges. It emerged he had previous convictions for dangerous driving and failing to stop after an accident. He was remanded in custody to face sentence later. Judge Robert Atherton told him: ‘There will be a substantial prison sentence.’ 'I go and see Michael every day at the hospital and it is deeply upsetting to remember him how he was before the incident and to see how he is now' Mayrose Ward, wife of victim Michael Ward. In a statement issued by police six months after the attack, Mr Ward’s wife Mayrose said: ‘The impact this has had on our lives has been truly devastating and our three children have been left with broken hearts. ‘I go and see Michael every day at the hospital and it is deeply upsetting to remember him how he was before the incident and to see how he is now. Today Rachael Pavion, District Crown Prosecutor for CPS North West said: ‘Aqab Hussain used his car as a weapon, he sought revenge by driving at speed deliberately at the four men with a clear intention to kill. ‘After he struck his victims, he drove from the scene and showed complete disregard for the harm he had caused.’","output":"1.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Bill O’Reilly wants to ‘beat up’ Mayor de Blasio for wanting to tax the rich Bill O’Reilly wants to sock it to Mayor de Blasio for picking on rich folks like him. The FOX News flamethrower threatened to pummel the liberal mayor on Thursday at a fundraiser for a Catholic parish. “I want to beat him up,” a worked-up O’Reilly said before a cheering crowd. O’Reilly was with fellow FOX franchise players Megyn Kelly and Brian Kilmeade at Long Island University’s Greenvale campus when his blood started boiling. What set off O’Reilly was a pre-selected question from the audience, Gawker reported. “Have we reached the point where there are more people on the free ride—for example, the people on the free ride getting welfare—than those who are actually working for a living?” Kilmeade read. It was like waving red in front of a bull. First O’Reilly launched into his regular guy resume about growing up in Levittown. “Today, a lot of Americans, you know, hey, gimme gimme gimme, you know, they’re not willing to pay the price to succeed,” he thundered. “It’s growing, I’m hoping we can reverse that, but it’s growing.” Then Kelly, who recently caused a stir by insisting Santa was white — and only white — chimed in with some boohooing about how de Blasio is trying to punish the wealthy by raising their taxes. “The thing is, you work so hard, and you finally start earning some money, and you have people like de Blasio telling you you’re not paying your fair share, that you’re somehow bad, that you need to pay more, and you haven’t earned it,” Kelly complained. That’s when O’Reilly, who like his FOX colleagues reportedly is paid a seven-figure salary, said he was ready to take on de Blasio. Hizzoner shrugged it off. “Stay classy, Bill,” his spokesman said. It’s not clear how O’Reilly would do in a fistfight with de Blasio. While O’Reilly fancies himself a tough guy, the 6-feet-5-inch mayor is an inch taller and a dozen years younger.","output":"Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly stated during a fundraiser that he wants to \\"beat up\\" Mayor de Blasio due to de Blasio's desire to tax the rich.

We want to find the value of \\"j\\" that makes this equation true:  -285*j + 7546 + 1004 = 0 First, I notice that there are two numbers we can add together easily. Let's add 7546 and 1004: 7546 + 1004 = 8550 Now our equation looks like this: -285*j + 8550 = 0 Our goal is to find \\"j\\", so we need to get \\"j\\" alone on one side of the equal sign. Let's move the 8550 to the other side. To do that, we'll subtract 8550 from both sides: -285*j + 8550 - 8550 = 0 - 8550 Now our equation is: -285*j = -8550 We're almost there! To find \\"j\\", we need to get rid of the -285 that's multiplying it. To do that, we'll divide both sides by -285: (-285*j) / -285 = -8550 / -285 That cancels out the -285 on the left side, leaving us with just \\"j\\": j = 30 And there you have it!

Background: Tarja Soile Susanna Turunen-Cabuli (born 17 August 1977), known professionally as Tarja Turunen or simply Tarja, is a Finnish singer-songwriter. She is a soprano and has a vocal range of three octaves. Turunen studied singing at Sibelius Academy and Hochschule fur Musik Karlsruhe. She is a professional classical lied singer, and the former lead vocalist of the Finnish symphonic metal band Nightwish, which she founded with Tuomas Holopainen and Emppu Vuorinen in 1996. Context: Tarja Turunen was born in the small village of Puhos, near Kitee, Finland. She has an older brother, Timo, and a younger brother, Toni. Her mother Ritva Sisko Marjatta (Hakkarainen) worked in the town administration, and her father Teuvo Turunen is a carpenter. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang the song \\"Enkeli taivaan\\" (the Finnish version of \\"From Heaven Above to Earth I Come\\") in the Kitee church hall at age three. She joined the church choir and started taking vocal lessons. At age six, she started playing piano.  At comprehensive school, Turunen performed as a singer for several projects. Her first piano teacher Kirsti Nortia-Holopainen, \\"Tarja was in a school that had some very musical people. Even then she got to perform a lot. I think she sang in every school function there was.\\" Her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, later explained that, \\"If you gave Tarja just one note, she immediately got it. With the others, you'd have to practice three, four, five times\\". At school she had a tough time, since some girls bullied her because they envied her voice. To solve that problem, Dimov organized projects outside school. At fifteen, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners. In 1993 she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna.  For several years Turunen performed various songs including soul music by Whitney Houston and Aretha Franklin. Later she listened to songs from the classical crossover singer Sarah Brightman, especially the song \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\", and decided to focus on that genre of music. At eighteen, she moved to Kuopio to study at the Sibelius Academy. Question: Was she vocally trained? Answer:","output":"Yes, Tarja Turunen was vocally trained from a young age. Her talent for music was first noted when she sang at the age of three, and she soon joined the church choir and started taking vocal lessons. Throughout her comprehensive school years, she performed as a singer for several projects, and her music teacher, Plamen Dimov, had recognized her exceptional abilities. To provide her with more performance opportunities and deal with bullying issues at school, Dimov organized projects outside of school.  At the age of 15, Turunen had her first major appearance as a soloist at a church concert in front of a thousand listeners. In 1993, she attended the Senior Secondary School of Art and Music in Savonlinna to further develop her musical skills. At the age of 18, she moved to Kuopio to study at the Sibelius Academy, which is one of the most prestigious music institutions in Finland. Additionally, she also studied at the Hochschule für Musik Karlsruhe in Germany. Thus, from her early years in the church choir to her formal education in music academies, Tarja Turunen received extensive vocal training that played a significant role in shaping her successful career as a singer and songwriter."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This involved Pope Gregory VII (pope 1073–85) and Emperor Henry IV, who initially clashed over episcopal appointments, a dispute that turned into a battle over the ideas of investiture, clerical marriage, and simony. The emperor saw the protection of the Church as one of his responsibilities as well as wanting to preserve the right to appoint his own choices as bishops within his lands, but the papacy insisted on the Church's independence from secular lords. These issues remained unresolved after the compromise of 1122 known as the Concordat of Worms.

His attorney John Branca observed that Jackson achieved the highest royalty rate in the music industry to that point: approximately 2 (US4.82 in 2018 dollars) for each album sold. As a result, Jackson earned record-breaking profits from compact disc sales and from the sale of copies of the documentary, The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller, produced by Jackson and John Landis. Funded by MTV, the film sold over 350,000 copies in its first few months. In a market then driven by singles, Thriller raised the significance of albums, yet its multiple hit singles changed perceived notions as to the number of successful singles that could be taken from an individual album. The era saw the arrival of novelties like the Michael Jackson doll, that appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of 12 (US29 in 2018 dollars). Thriller retains a position in American culture; biographer J. Randy Taraborrelli explains, \\"At some point, Thriller stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple\\".At the time of the album's release, a press statement from Gil Friesen, the then President of A&M Records, read that, \\"The whole industry has a stake in this success\\". Time magazine speculated that \\"the fallout from Thriller has given the [music] business its best years since the heady days of 1978, when it had an estimated total domestic revenue of 4.1 billion\\". Time summed up Thriller's impact as a \\"restoration of confidence\\" for an industry bordering on \\"the ruins of punk and the chic regions of synthesizer pop\\". The publication described Jackson's influence at that point as, \\"Star of records, radio,...

Article: The most important factor in controlling your feelings for someone is reducing the amount of time you spend with them, especially time spent alone. Avoid the person as much as you can, if possible. If you can’t completely avoid them, make sure the two of you aren’t spending time together alone.  For example, if this person asks you out for drinks, suggest that you make it a group activity to limit alone time. Instead, surround yourself with people like friends and family who are positive, uplifting, and make you feel great. They should be accepting and supportive of your feelings. Also, they should be contributing to your own visions, and understand that this is your own personal story to live. Keeping up with the person online can still influence your feelings, so get some distance there, too. Unfriend them on your social media profiles. If this seems too drastic, download an app that controls your social media usage altogether—if you can’t log onto Facebook, you can’t stalk their page. Commit to unplugging during the times when you’re most likely to cyber-stalk. You might also get help from smartphone apps like Freedom and SelfControl. You also want to limit their feelings for you, too, if possible. Therefore, it’s best to avoid leading them on. Seemingly harmless compliments, touches, or glances can send the message that you like someone. So, avoid such interactions. If you must interact with them, treat them with polite indifference, sticking to “hi” and “bye.” When you are falling in love with someone, your view of them is often skewed. You can only see what makes this person so great. To control your feelings, develop a more sober and realistic perception of the other person.  No one is perfect. Make a list of why this person isn’t. Review the list whenever you start thinking of them too highly. For instance, if you're dealing with an old flame, you might list out why you broke up with them, including reasons like \\"He lies compulsively\\" or \\"She doesn't prioritize spending time with me.\\" Maybe your reason for wanting to avoid falling in love with this person lies in their relationship status. If this person has a significant other, envision that person’s face or name whenever you’re fantasizing about them. This may help you maintain objectivity. Being in love with someone and acting on those feelings are two very different feelings. Sometimes, no matter what you try, your heart can’t prevent itself from falling for someone. However, if you don’t want to be in a relationship or aren’t ready for love, don’t act on those feelings.  Acknowledge that you like the person and really enjoy their company, but remind yourself that you’re not in the market for love right now. One way to do this is by examining key goals in your life that you would like to accomplish before falling in love again. For instance, maybe you'd like to finish your degree before entering a new relationship or maybe you want to travel the world. What is a summary?","output":"In summary, to control your feelings for someone, it's crucial to reduce the amount of time you spend with them, especially alone. Surround yourself with positive, uplifting people like friends and family. Limit online interactions by unfollowing them on social media or using apps to control your usage. Avoid leading them on and maintain a realistic perception of the person by listing their imperfections. If you still find yourself falling in love, acknowledge your feelings but remind yourself of your personal goals that you want to accomplish before entering a relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Her overbearing mother is at odds with her, arguing that Edna should choose a specific song and wardrobe for the contest. At the contest, Edna swaps dresses with a blue singer named Doris, and even changes her song at the last minute, infuriating her mother, who leaves before seeing Edna win the competition. An excited Edna decides to use her grand prize winnings to record a demo. The studio producer tactfully delivers the painful truth to Edna that not only are girl singers not getting signed, the record companies are trying to get rid of the ones currently on their rosters. However, when Edna tells him that she wrote the song, he is impressed enough to direct her to Joel Milner who takes her under his wing, renames her \\"Denise Waverly\\" and invents a blue-collar persona for her. Milner reworks her song for a male doo-wop group, the Stylettes, as male solo artists are groups are far more marketable. The song becomes a hit. Denise (formerly Edna) moves to New York City and becomes a songwriter in the Brill Building. At a party, she meets the arrogant songwriter Howard Caszatt, and despite an awkward initial meeting they become romantically involved. She also reunites with Doris. Denise offers to and writes a song specifically for Doris and her two girlfriends, persuading Milner to audition and hire the group.  In 1965, Howard and Denise begin writing together; they pen a song called \\"Unwanted Number,\\" based on a young girl's unwanted pregnancy.

Summarize: These are tough times for the 19-nation eurozone, as its recovery from the debt crisis remains anaemic, with persistently high unemployment and weak growth. What are the key issues that will dominate the leaders' talks in Brussels on Thursday and Friday? Avoiding Greek default and Grexit €320bn Greece's debt mountain €240bn European bailout 177% country's debt-to-GDP ratio 25% fall in GDP since 2010 26% Greek unemployment rate Greece is just days away from possible default and empty coffers. Eurozone finance ministers meet again on Wednesday, to decide whether the Greek government's new reform package meets the bailout conditions. That could determine whether the leaders arrive smiling or grim-faced. Agreement would provide only a temporary breathing space. Greece would not crash out of the euro, a bank run could be avoided, but Greece's debt mountain is 177% of GDP - nearly double the country's total annual economic output. A deal would unblock the €7.2bn (£5bn; 8bn) of bailout money that Greece desperately needs. But Greece will need tens of billions of euros more in future, to make its economy viable and pay off its colossal debts. The Greek crisis affects market confidence in the euro. But it is also a clash of visions about Europe. Richer countries such as Germany and the Netherlands demand budgetary rigour and refuse to end up subsidising indebted southern Europeans. The leftist Greek government and many ordinary Greeks reject austerity and the liberal free market agenda. The anti-austerity mood is also strong in Spain and other EU countries hit hard by the debt crisis. Is Greece close to Grexit? Why should I care about Greece? Deepening monetary union EU leaders believe that eurozone stability depends on further integration, co-ordinating economic targets. The debt crisis dramatically exposed how weaknesses in one country could undermine its eurozone partners. But getting there is politically fraught - populists across Europe have made gains in elections by rejecting the \\"ever closer union\\" idea. A blueprint for deeper eurozone integration has been written by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and other top EU officials, including European Central Bank President Mario Draghi. It will be a focus of the talks, and among its proposals are: Treaty change is considered necessary to give a solid legal basis to economic integration. The document suggests, however, that treaty change would be postponed until after general elections in France and Germany in 2017. The UK and other EU states outside the euro - including Denmark and Poland - want the eurozone to prosper, but not if it means a two-tier system with eurozone countries setting the agenda and rules for the single market. Eurozone ministers agree bank deal UK renegotiation UK Prime Minister David Cameron will not want Greece to dominate the summit talks, because he wants to get support among the leaders for EU reforms meaningful enough to persuade a sceptical British public. This summit is his launch pad for renegotiation of the UK's EU membership terms, ahead of the UK in/out referendum promised by the end of 2017. Mr Cameron has had meetings with national leaders individually, on a European tour. He will need to get all 27 other member states to sign up to new arrangements for the UK. The EU principle of free movement of people is non-negotiable - EU leaders have made that clear to Mr Cameron. But there is scope for change in the rules on migrants' benefits - a key issue for the UK Conservatives. Mr Cameron is also expected to push for an opt-out from the EU's \\"ever closer union\\" ambition, and for guarantees that the rights of \\"euro outs\\" will not be watered down - especially in the single market - as eurozone integration advances. Q&A: UK's planned EU referendum Migrant influx EU solidarity is under severe strain because of the surge in migrants fleeing Libya aboard unseaworthy boats bound for Italy. Tensions rose when France blocked hundreds of African migrants at the Italian border. But any re-imposition of border controls would violate the spirit of the EU's Schengen agreement. Greece is also struggling with record numbers of migrants - and the boats will probably keep coming in the summer months. A Mediterranean naval operation has been launched to track people-smuggling networks. The EU wants to get a UN mandate to use force to stop the people-smugglers. The European Commission has drawn up plans to ease the burden faced by Italy and Greece, but the idea of mandatory quotas for moving migrants to other EU countries is not popular. The plan is to relocate 60,000 asylum seekers from Syria and Eritrea, who fled war and/or persecution. Economic migrants would not qualify. France and Germany say the Commission's \\"distribution key\\" for relocating them needs further work. And several East European countries reject mandatory quotas, saying migrants do not want to be told where to live. Who are the Med's migrants? Why is EU struggling with migrants and asylum? Tensions with Russia The EU decided this week to extend the sanctions against Russia until the end of January 2016. So that is unlikely to take up much time at the summit. Russia is still helping the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine with heavy weapons and troops, Western leaders say. Moscow denies that. But the sanctions are hurting the EU too, with Russia blocking imports of Western food. Italy and Greece are among the countries eager to get sanctions eased or lifted. But there has to be progress towards a peace settlement in Ukraine for that to happen. Continuing clashes in eastern Ukraine mean that the rebels and Ukrainian government forces are still far from the targets agreed in the Minsk ceasefire deal.","output":"The eurozone is going through a tough time with high unemployment and weak growth. There are many issues that the leaders need to talk about, such as Greece possibly leaving the euro and needing help with money. There is also a situation with many people from other countries coming to the EU. They need to make plans for how to help these people, but not everyone agrees on the best way to do that."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Act 1: The Beginning Gerard O'Neal, a thirty-five-year-old successful architect, lives a comfortable life in a bustling city. He has two brothers, Declan, the eldest and Jack, the youngest, and two sisters, Siobhan and Laura, the twins. Although they grew up in a close-knit family, the siblings all went their separate ways after their parents, Patrick and Eileen, both passed away in a car accident ten years ago. Act 2: The Family Reunion One day, Gerard receives a letter from their late father's attorney, Mr. Fitzgerald. It turns out Patrick had hidden a secret safe deposit box, which can only be opened by all his children together, and the attorney in charge of it is retiring. Gerard tries to reunite the siblings for the first time in a decade. He manages to convince Declan, a workaholic business owner, Siobhan, an aspiring artist, and Laura, a doting mother of two, to come together. Jack, a recovering addict turned fitness instructor, is the most reluctant, but ultimately joins the group. Act 3: The Inheritance At Fitzgerald's office, the siblings open the safe deposit box, revealing a mysterious key and a cryptic letter from their father, claiming it leads to a hidden treasure that has been in the O'Neal family for generations. Feeling a sense of connection with their deceased parents, the siblings embark on an adventure to find the treasure, which, according to the letter, is located in their ancestral homeland of Ireland. Act 4: Old Wounds and Conflicts As the siblings explore Ireland together, they're forced to confront the unresolved conflicts and complex dynamics that have haunted their relationship for years. Each sibling is holding onto past resentments and baggage that might jeopardize their quest. Gerard, though always considered the peacemaker, finds himself struggling with whether or not he truly wants reconciliation among his siblings or just a quiet life without them. Act 5: The Treasure Finally, after solving all the puzzles and riddles left by their father, they discover the treasure: an old, decrepit house by the Irish coast. Here, Gerard and his siblings learn the truth about their family's history, which was riddled with hardships, tragedies, and triumphs. The house symbolizes their love, unity, and perseverance through the generations. Act 6: Reconciliation and Forgiveness Realizing the journey their father sent them on was more about the time spent reconnecting as a family than any material inheritance, the siblings resolve their conflicts and rebuild their relationships. They decide to use the house as their family's gathering place, turning it into a safe haven for the O'Neal family. Epilogue: A New Chapter Gerard and his siblings return to their individual lives, but their bond remains stronger than ever. They make it a tradition to meet at the house every year, keeping their family history and love alive. The adventure for the treasure gives them a new perspective on life, and their newfound unity allows them to each face the future as a stronger individual."},{"instruction":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Brainstorm a list of options, so you feel like you have options. If you have trouble seeing potential solutions, talk with other people who have experienced a similar situation to the one you're trying to solve. Other people may be able to offer you a different perspective to solving your problem. For example, maybe you've been obsessing over a way to maintain your fitness through a life change. Your challenge could be finding a way to schedule your morning run while still being able to take your new infant to daycare. You might talk to another new parent or offer to take turns with childcare so you can work out. You may feel that obsessing over something or someone has isolated you from friends and family. Re-connect to friends, family, or co-workers who you can explain your situation to. Talking can help you understand the underlying cause of your obsession and having a support network to turn to can reduce your stress. For example, if you're obsessing over an ex after a break up, talk with a friend or family member. Talking with your friend might help you realize that you're obsessed because your ex was the first person to take you seriously in a relationship. It's easy to slip into the routine of obsessing over something if you're not challenging yourself with new things. If you've been meaning to pursue a new hobby or take a class, start doing it. Not only will you take your mind off of your obsession by focusing on a new task or skill, you may also meet new people or learn something new about yourself. New people and new ways of thinking can help you move beyond your obsession. You might realize that you no longer crave whatever the obsession rewarded you with. For example, you might not obsess over a lost job opportunity if you learn a new trade that you actually enjoy more. You might be so focused on obsessing over something going on in your life, that you completely overlook the lives of your friends, family members, or people in your community. Reach out to people who might need your help. Not only will they appreciate it, but you'll realize there's more to life than your obsession. For example, you might tutor at a school, serve at a soup kitchen, or drive an elderly relative to the grocery store.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal?","output":"You haven't provided a list of methods, but I'll provide some common methods and choose the most reasonable one: 1. Use extra flour on the surface and your hands 2. Oil the surface slightly before kneading 3. Keep the surface and dough cold by using ice packs 4. Use a silicone mat for kneading 5. Wet your hands while kneading Evaluating each method: 1. Using extra flour is a common and effective method to prevent dough from sticking. It may change the dough's consistency, but you can adjust the recipe accordingly. 2. Oiling the surface is another option, especially for higher hydration doughs. It doesn't affect dough consistency as much, but it can be messy. 3. Keeping the surface and dough cold is not practical, as it requires a lot of ice packs and may negatively impact the dough development. 4. Using a silicone mat provides a non-stick surface, which can be helpful in preventing dough from sticking. It's a good reusable solution and doesn't alter the dough consistency. 5. Wetting your hands can be helpful for very sticky dough, but not all dough types. Given these options, using a silicone mat (method 4) is the most reasonable choice for accomplishing your goal.

Takeru Kobayashi was arrested at Coney Island after his rival, Joey Chestnut, won the annual Nathan's International Hot Dog Eating Contest. The six-time champion of the contest was trying to make his way on stage after this year's event, according to a representative for Kobayashi and a New York police officer at the Brooklyn precinct booking desk. The incident was not a publicity stunt, Maggie James, Kobayashi's spokeswoman, said Sunday night. \\"He got excited when people chanted his name after the contest .... so he jumped up on the stage because he wanted his fans to see him and (he thought) maybe they would chant, 'Let him eat,'\\" James said, referring to a dispute that kept Kobayashi from the table this year. Currently ranked third,","output":"Kobayashi's absence from the competition was due to his ongoing dispute with Major League Eating (MLE), the organization that sanctions the contest. The disagreement stemmed from MLE's insistence that Kobayashi sign an exclusive contract, which he saw as restrictive and limiting his opportunities outside the competition circuit. Despite his arrest, Kobayashi's popularity did not wane. His fans were outraged by the event organizers' decision to exclude him from the contest and were vocal in their support. Social media was ablaze with #FreeKobi hashtags, and many called for the MLE's negotiation terms to be revised. Following his release, Kobayashi chose to pursue new avenues to showcase his talent. He participated in various eating contests outside the MLE's domain and established a significant presence on YouTube and other social media platforms, racking up millions of views as he tackled incredible food challenges. Realizing the valuable publicity and fanbase that Kobayashi brought to their competitions, the MLE eventually decided to extend an olive branch. After some long negotiations, they reached a compromise, allowing Kobayashi to compete in their contests while retaining his freedom to explore other opportunities. Both parties were satisfied with the outcome, and Kobayashi returned to the Nathan's International Hot Dog Eating Contest the following year. The rivalry between him and Joey Chestnut continued to intensify, as did the excitement of their fans. Both athletes pushed themselves to the edge of their abilities, making the contest even more thrilling and closely watched. In the climactic final face-off between the two legends, Kobayashi managed to regain his title in an awe-inspiring display of speed, skill, and determination. As he stood on stage, the crowd chanting his name in unison, Kobayashi took a moment to thank his fans, acknowledging their undying support and the role they played in bringing him back to the contest that had first made him famous. The story ends on a high note, with Kobayashi's triumphant return cementing his legacy as one of the greatest competitive eaters of all time. More than just a series of contests, this story also highlights the importance of standing up for oneself, the value of perseverance, and the power that comes from the unwavering support of fans. From his conflicts with MLE to his ultimate victory, Kobayashi's story serves as an inspiring example of a true champion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Stephen Arthur Stills (born January 3, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist best known for his work with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Beginning his professional career with Buffalo Springfield, he composed one of their few hits \\"For What It's Worth,\\" which became one of the most recognizable songs of the 1960s. Other notable songs he contributed to the band were \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You Stills was involved with the musician Judy Collins from 1968 to 1969 and wrote the song \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" for her. He dated actress and singer-songwriter Nancy Priddy who was the inspiration for his Buffalo Springfield song \\"Pretty Girl Why\\". He also had a short-term relationship with Rita Coolidge, as had Graham Nash, which apparently led to the initial breakup of CSN, in 1970. During a Manassas tour in France, Stills met and married his first wife, the singer-songwriter Veronique Sanson. Their son Christopher was born in 1974. They divorced in 1979. In 1976, Stills told Rolling Stone, \\"My hearing has gotten to be a terrible problem. If I keep playing and touring the way I have been, I'll go deaf.\\" In 1988, he married the Thai model Pamela Anne Jordan, with whom he had a daughter, Eleanor. His third wife is Kristen Hathaway (Kristen Stills), whom he married in 1996.  Stills's son, Justin Stills, was born in 1972 to Harriet Tunis. Justin was critically injured while snowboarding on Mt. Charleston, just outside Las Vegas, in 1997. An episode of Discovery Health's documentary series Trauma: Life in the ER featured his treatment and recovery. Another son, Henry, has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome  and is profiled in the 2007 documentary Autism: The Musical. Stills's daughter Eleanor is a photographer and graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Since Eleanor's graduation, she has been responsible for all recent Crosby, Stills & Nash photography. Stills has another daughter, Alex, who attends Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. His son Chris and daughter Jennifer are both recording artists. His youngest son, Oliver Ragland, was born in 2004 and named in honor of Neil Young, whose maternal family name is Ragland.  Like all four members of CSNY, Stills has long been involved in liberal causes and politics. In 2000, he served as a member of the Democratic credentials committee from Florida during the Democratic National Convention, and was a delegate in previous years.  The comic book series Scott Pilgrim features a character by the name of Stephen Stills, referred to as \\"the Talent\\" by the band he shares with the title character. The character also plays an acoustic guitar and sings, and is often portrayed wearing the kind of western shirts that is part of Stills's standard wardrobe.

Africa's collision with Europe formed the Mediterranean Sea, cutting off the remnants of the Tethys Ocean. Sea level changes exposed the land-bridge between Alaska and Asia. Near the end of the Pliocene, about 2.58 million years ago (the start of the Quaternary Period), the current ice age began.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who died in Toledo, Spain? is inside the article: Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 –  7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting., can you guess it ?

My preconception was that it was another in a long line of cheesy sci-fi flicks that the 1950's was noted for. How wrong I was. Big studio, big budget and big production values make this a strong contender, at least visually, for the best sci-fi film coming out of the era. I qualify with the word visually, because \\"War Of The Worlds\\" is a lot darker and scarier than \\"Forbidden Planet\\", and probably fits the mold better as a foray into alien territory. What impressed me immediately was the color rendition of the cinematography, followed by the intricacy and scope of detail involved in Dr. Morbius' (Walter Pidgeon) home and laboratory. But that was only the prelude to the icing on the cake, the labyrinthine underground that served as the Krell stronghold. It appeared that Krell technology was even more advanced than say, that of \\"Star Wars\\". Which made me consider, audiences for this movie back when it was released probably sat in the same kind of awe that theater goers experienced in 1977 with SW, or in 1986 with \\"Aliens\\". Watching it on a large screen TV in my living room offered me the same effect, and I'm fairly resistant to hyperbole. It's not too much of a stretch to imagine \\"Forbidden Planet\\" as a direct antecedent of the 'Star Trek' TV series; Gene Roddenberry himself stated that the movie had a great impact on his vision for the show. Followers of that short lived series will readily recognize plot elements used here that turned up in 'Star Trek'. I had to do a double take when the men of United Planets Cruiser C57-V headed for a transporter room, while the conundrum presented to Robby that created an impossibility to respond was an element used at least two or three times in the ST series. Where the movie definitely took a cerebral turn had to do with the whole idea of 'monsters from the Id'. That Morbius himself was using his subconscious mind to defend Altaire IV was certainly a unique concept for 1956, when every other sci-fi flick of the time was dealing with Martians or other grotesque space creatures. The film worked it's subtle magic on this viewer by helping me understand that Morbius was the protector of Altaire IV some time before Commander Adams (Leslie Nielsen) explained it. You know, looking at the calendar, the year 2200 isn't that far off. This movie may be the one that actually gets it right relative to exploring and living on other planets. I think though, that they'll have to come up with a sleeker looking version of Robby. What is the sentiment of this review?

Also the pronouns (\\"us\\", \\"we\\") has been kept in the sentence as \\"нам\\" and \\"мы\\".  The words \\"future events\\" have been translated as \\"будущих событиях\\", and \\"going to organize\\" has been translated as \\"собираемся организовать\\". These phrases translated to Russian keep the original intention and context, ensuring the listener or reader understands the information in the same way a person speaking English would.  Additionally, the Russian language usually doesn't use articles, so words like \\"it\\" and \\"the\\" were not directly translated in this case. The overall structure of Russian sentences adheres more to the general meaning than to the literal word-for-word translation.  In general, maintaining the structure close to the original English sentence and adequate translation of verb forms and pronouns ensures the fidelity of translation. Also, adherence to the specific features of Russian syntax in terms of the absence of articles contributes to the fluency and accuracy of the translation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

College English teacher Jay Scrivner, of California, was out for an early morning surf at his regular spot in Humboldt Bay, Eureka - a known shark ground where a friend of his, Scott Stephens, almost died last year. Scrivner had been in the water about two hours, with friends and other surfers around, when something just hit him.

The 45-year-old father of two was out for his usual early morning surf session at Humboldt Bay when the unexpected encounter occurred. Surrounded by friends and fellow surfers, Scrivner suddenly felt a strong impact on his leg.  Quickly realizing that he was being attacked by a Great White Shark, the experienced surfer relied on his instincts to fend off the ocean's most notorious predator. Channeling his inner caveman, Scrivner began punching at the shark and let out a powerful, guttural scream in an attempt to scare the beast away. His courageous actions proved successful, as the Great White retreated, leaving a shaken but alive Scrivner to be pulled from the water by his fellow surfers. The incident serves as a harrowing reminder of the dangers that can lurk beneath the surface in this popular surfing destination near the Californian town of Eureka."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Options:  -- Use pliers to force them closed.  -- Use tweezers to force them closed.","output":"To accomplish the goal of closing the metal rings in chainmail, it would be more sensible to use pliers rather than tweezers to force them closed. Both pliers and tweezers have their specific uses and advantages; however, pliers are better suited for the task of working with metal rings due to several reasons: 1. Strength and durability: Pliers are typically made of more robust materials, such as steel, which allows for greater strength and durability during use. In comparison, tweezers are often made of lighter materials, like stainless steel, aluminum, or even plastic. This may cause them to bend or break when attempting to close metal rings, especially if those rings are made of a tough or thick metal. 2. Appropriate grip: Pliers provide a better grip on the metal rings, which is necessary to provide adequate force to close the rings without slipping. Tweezers generally have a smaller and more delicate grip surface, which might not hold the metal rings as securely. This could lead to difficulty in applying the required pressure to close the rings properly. 3. Leverage: Pliers have longer handles than tweezers, which allows the user to apply more force with less effort. The longer handles provide better leverage, making it much easier to close the metal rings. On the other hand, tweezers have short handles, which may lead to the user requiring more effort and potentially causing hand strain when trying to close the rings. 4. Variability: Pliers come in various sizes and styles, including needle-nose pliers and flat-nose pliers, which can be useful for different types of chainmail projects. Depending on the size and shape of the metal rings, one can choose the most appropriate set of pliers. Tweezers tend to be limited in size and design variations, which may not be suitable for all chainmail projects. 5. Multipurpose use: Pliers can be used for various tasks in chainmail creation, such as opening and closing the rings and even cutting or adjusting their size. Tweezers, on the other hand, are more specialized for smaller tasks, such as handling tiny components or beads and might not be as versatile in chainmail work. In conclusion, using pliers to close the metal rings in chainmail is a more practical and efficient approach. Pliers provide the necessary strength, durability, grip, leverage, and versatility to work effectively with metal rings, whereas tweezers would likely be insufficient for this task due to their limitations in grip strength, leverage, and general applicability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: World leaders from nearly 200 countries have signed an important historic agreement to fight global climate change. The agreement came after two weeks of talks between the leaders at the 21st Conference in Paris, France. As part of the Paris agreement, countries said they would cut down on pollution However, according to the terms of the deal, countries that don't do this will not be punished, or fined. Instead,the document is meant to show that governments around the world take climate change seriously and are willing to work together to fight global warming. World leaders have met many times to discuss climate change. But, the 21st Conference of Parties, or COP21, which began on November 30 in Paris, was the first time they agreed on a global, legal pact  . Before the conference, each nation was asked to create plans on how to reach the shared goal. The pact that was signed allows countries to decide the best way to cut down their gas pollution. No matter how they decide to go green, each country must report honestly on all of their efforts. Every five years, nations must look at the work they've done and submit new plans on how they will improve over the next five years. In the pact, the countries pledge to limit the amount of greenhouse gases emitted  by human activity to the levels that trees,soil and oceans can absorb naturally. It urges countries to spend trillions of dollars on creating new energy sources, like solar and wind power. It also requires countries to raise at least  100 billion each year to help developing countries. However, critics of the pact say it is not detailed enough, and doesn't include specifics about how the plan will be enforced and how improvements will be measured. The pact does include one large, specific goal: how countries will aim to keep global temperatures from rising more than 3. 60degF(20degC) by 2100. Nonetheless,the agreement is considered by many world leaders to be a major victory. The U. N. has been working more than two decades to convince governments to work...

It is crucial for individuals to understand the importance of being conscious of their surroundings, engaging with both global and local issues, and making well-informed decisions. Awareness includes various aspects: personal development, environmental consciousness, social dynamics, and understanding our responsibilities as members of society. Personal development starts with self-awareness. It involves acknowledging our strengths and weaknesses, setting realistic goals, and working to achieve them. Improving our knowledge, skills, and abilities enables us to make rational decisions and enhance our lives. By cultivating good habits and nurturing a growth mindset, we become more resilient, adaptive, and empathetic. Furthermore, environmental consciousness plays a vital role in our collective well-being. We must recognize the impact human activities have on the planet and strive to minimize our ecological footprint. Conserving energy and water, reducing waste, embracing recycling, and supporting renewable energy sources are practical steps we can take to protect the environment. It is our shared responsibility to preserve Earth's natural resources, biodiversity, and ecosystems for current and future generations. Next, understanding social dynamics in today's interconnected world is essential for maintaining harmony and fostering collaboration between diverse communities. We need to educate ourselves about social issues, empathize with those who face marginalization or discrimination, and engage in informed discussions. By celebrating cultural differences and valuing unique perspectives, we can work towards more inclusive and equitable societies. Finally, as members of society, we have responsibilities towards each other and the world at large. We must uphold the values of fairness, respect, and empathy, and be accountable for our actions. Civic engagement, participating in volunteer initiatives, and supporting charitable causes are some ways to contribute positively to society. By being active, informed citizens, we can help shape public policies and advocate for positive change. In conclusion, waking up and being more aware is a multidimensional endeavor that encompasses personal growth, environmental care, social understanding, and civic responsibility. By embracing these principles, we can collectively work towards sustainable growth, social progress, and a better world for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Just got my copy of this DVD two disc set and while not perfect, I found the overall experience to be a fun way to waste some time. I have to say right up front that I am a huge fan of Zombie movies, and I truly think that the fine people who made these films must be too. I also have a soft spot for people who are trying, sometimes against all odds, to live a dream. And again, these people are doing it. Is this some award-winning collection of amazing film? No. Not even close. But for what they do on their meager budgets, these films should be recommended. For me, the bottom line is always, was I entertained? Did I have a good time with this movie? And here the answer to both was \\"Yes.\\" The first in the series is also the most raw. It opens with some kind of accident at a nuclear facility and people melt down or something. Cut to some years later and a new housing community is built over the old reactor site. Some kids making a video fall into a hole and find themselves trapped in the bottom levels of the facility. They get rescued, but the hole is not sealed and the people from the opening start lumbering out of the hole. Soon, the whole town is overtaken by the undead. And these zombies are fun. They go from cool rot makeup to the cheapest slap on white-face ever, but they are fun. The whole movie culminates in a showdown between the final survivors of the area and the undead, with our heroes going into the reactor's lower levels to take out the flesh eating zombies and seal the hole forever! Pretty cheesy, but I think it was meant to be. Still, it moves very fast, has buckets of gruesome effects and really tries to have some style. The acting is uneven, but a few good performances shine through and one really should listen to the commentary track. I went back and watched it again with that on and found it to be a good bit of information on the trials and fun that the crew and cast experienced on the movie. Director Todd Sheets seems pretty proud of this, his first film, but also has no delusions. He knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he does show respect to people involved. Also, Sheets has a great sense of humor and some humble integrity that others could learn from in the movie field. The behind the scenes of Zombie Bloodbath is pretty fun as well. I felt it was almost as entertaining as the film it was made for. There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news stories about the film from some major places like CNN, FOX and MTV. Over all, a fun little film that is VERY rough around the edges, but still had me laughing and enjoying the ride! I have seen many DV films, and some shot of video films, and many are quite dull, but this one really wasn't. While newer DV films are technically superior, they just aren't fun! Overall, this is a solid, if a bit flawed, release with plenty of extras and TONS of gore and splatter. While not breaking any grand rules of move making, I found the series to be fun and always a laugh, so I give this set a solid recommendation.

Finally, the reviewer expresses disappointment in the overall direction the restaurant is going. They mention that they \\"enjoy eating at local places, non-chains\\" and are \\"very disappointed in the direction this restaurant is going.\\" This indicates that the reviewer's dissatisfaction goes beyond just the service and the quality of the food; it also pertains to the perceived shift in the restaurant's values and focus. The fact that they specifically mention enjoying local, non-chain restaurants suggests that they feel Leticia's may be losing some of its authentic, locally-focused charm. In summary, the sentiment of this review is largely negative, with the reviewer expressing dissatisfaction in several areas such as service, food quality, and the overall direction the restaurant is taking. There is also a sense of nostalgia and disappointment as the reviewer reflects on their past positive experiences at Leticia's and laments the current state of the establishment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Going back to school is a very exciting event for my two boys. It means getting new school bags and books, and seeing friends again after the summer holiday. My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers. As a result, many parents prevented their children from going to school. One of six children in this country did not attend primary school in 2009. Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items  are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores. They sit on the ground and lay their items on the ground or they have a small table to sell their goods. The bags cost between 10 and 20, while clothes and shoes cost between 20 and 30. I found all the things I needed for my sons and even bought something for myself. I spent about 50 on each of them, including school uniforms. At the end of the day, we returned to our home carrying many shopping bags filled with items that made my children happy and excited to go back to school. I just hope this school year will be a peaceful one.

We did this package that included VIP seating, unlimited hookah, a picture for the celebrant and admission for 10 people for 250.  I had already spoken with someone over the phone and they said it would be ok for us to get the package. And when we got there, they acted like \\"what package?!\\" We ended up talking to the manager and when we showed the money, they remembered that they did have this package. We walked thru the metal detectors and were seated on three couches up front near the stage. It was almost 1am and there were a handful of people. I guess it was couples night and there were a handful of couples tryna get they're \\"freak on\\" I guess. When they came to ask what flavor hookah we wanted, they said they only had two flavors left. So we got those two flavors, mint & fruit punch.

Five years ago, when he was nineteen, he finished middle school. He didn't like any subjects except playing when he was at school. Of course he learned nothing and the bosses wouldn't use a man like him. He has to stay at home, but doesn't do any housework, only watches TV or lies on bed. It makes his parents angry. They want him to study something, he always think it difficult and doesn't listen to them. One day Robert was walking near a bookshop while some young men were talking about the writers. He heard the publishing house pays the writers a lot. He became interested in it. As soon as he got home, he began to write. But he couldn't write anything. At last he bought a book and copied a story. Then he posted it to the publishing house. He waited for nearly half a year, but didn't get any answers. He had to ask an editor on the telephone, \\"Have you read my story yet, sir?\\" \\"Yes,\\" said the editor, \\"I had read it before you were born! \\" Question: His parents are angry with Robert because   _   . Options: A: he wouldn't find any work B: he didn't study hard before C: he's too lazy to do any housework D: he isn't polite to them Answer:","output":"The article conveys that Robert's parents are angry because of several reasons. To pinpoint the correct answer to the question \\"His parents are angry with Robert because _ .\\", let's dissect the details of the article. Option A: \\"he wouldn't find any work\\" - The article states that Robert does not find a job because \\"he learned nothing and the bosses wouldn't use a man like him\\". While his unemployment might be frustrating for his parents, the text does not directly say they are angry because of this reason. Option B: \\"he didn't study hard before\\" - The article shows that Robert wasn't fond of academic studies. He only liked playing while he was in school and \\"of course he learned nothing\\". Even though his parents wanted him to study, it does not explicitly express that they're angry due to his lack of studying in the past.  Option C: \\"he's too lazy to do any housework\\" - This is the closest potential answer according to the context in the text. The article states that Robert has to stay at home, however, he \\"doesn't do any housework, only watches TV or lies on bed\\" which makes his parents angry. This statement directly connects his laziness in doing housework and his parents' anger. Option D: \\"he isn't polite to them\\" - The text does not mention any instance where Robert is impolite to his parents. In conclusion, while all of the options might indirectly describe reasons that could possibly upset Robert's parents, Option C: \\"he's too lazy to do any housework\\" is the only detail in the article that explicitly states why Robert's parents are angry.

In their retreat, they find a German bunker manned by elderly Pvt. Mirus (John Carlisle) and young Pvt. Neumann (Andrew-Lee Potts) who had been left to defend the bunker under orders from Area Command to wait until relieved. Schenke confronts Heydrich about why the group didn't counter-attack the Americans, claiming that there couldn't have been that many of them. Mirus expands on the history of the area, revealing that victims of the Black Plague were massacred on the orders of a stranger, who influenced the townspeople to turn against one another. Low on ammunition, the men are haunted by bad dreams, memories and the feeling that something about the area just isn't right. As the night proceeds, strange tunnels are found beneath the bunker and the situation in the bunker becomes increasingly tense. Pvt. Schenke (Andrew Tiernan) wants to explore the tunnels but Lt. Krupp (Simon Kunz) orders against it. Later, Mirus sneaks down into the tunnels and a curious Pfc. Kruezmann (Eddie Marsan) follows him. When they are discovered to be missing, Lt. Krupp believes they've deserted and orders a pursuit. Interrogation of Neumann reveals that Mirus had been wandering off into the tunnels for several weeks and treats the tunnels as his property, as if something is down there that Mirus doesn't want him to know about. Cpl. Baumann (Jason Flemyng) discovers a set of plans for the complex while Cpl. Ebert (Jack Davenport) finds a danger sign.

Question: Information:  - The Chinese Civil War was a civil war in China fought between forces loyal to the Kuomintang (KMT)-led government of the Republic of China, and forces loyal to the Communist Party of China (CPC). The war began in August 1927, with Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Northern Expedition, and essentially ended when major hostilities ceased in 1950. It can generally be divided into two stages; the first being from 1927 to 1937, and the second being from 1946 to 1950 with the Second Sino-Japanese War separating them. The war was a major turning point in modern Chinese history, with the CPC gaining control of almost the entirety of Mainland China, establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) to replace the KMT's Republic of China (ROC). It also caused a lasting political and military standoff between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, with the ROC in Taiwan and the PRC in mainland China both officially claiming to be the legitimate government of all of China.  - University College London (UCL) is a public research university in London, England, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. It is the largest postgraduate institution in the UK by enrollment and is regarded as one of the world's leading multidisciplinary research universities. Established in 1826 as London University by founders inspired by the radical ideas of Jeremy Bentham, UCL was the first university institution to be established in London, and the first in England to be entirely secular and to admit students regardless of their religion. UCL also makes the contested claims of being the third-oldest university in England and the first to admit women. In 1836 UCL became one of the two founding colleges of the University of London, which was granted a royal charter in the same year. It has grown through mergers, including with the Institute of Neurology (in 1997), the Royal Free Hospital Medical School (in 1998), the Eastman Dental Institute (in 1999), the School of Slavonic and East European Studies (in 1999), the School of Pharmacy (in 2012) and the Institute of Education (in 2014). UCL has its main campus in the Bloomsbury area of central London, with a number of institutes and teaching hospitals elsewhere in central London and a satellite campus in Doha, Qatar. UCL is organised into 11 constituent faculties, within which there are over 100 departments, institutes and research centres. UCL operates several culturally significant museums and manages collections in a wide range of fields, including the Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology and the Grant Museum of Zoology and Comparative Anatomy, and administers the annual Orwell Prize in political writing. In 2015/16, UCL had around 38,300 students and 12,000 staff (including around 7,100 academic staff and 840 professors) and had a total income of £1.36 billion, of which £530 million was from research grants and contracts.

This week, we tell about the planet's surprising motion among the stars.  For thousands of years, people have recognized that planets travel among the stars. The planets generally follow the path taken by the Sun through the sky. The Sun's path is called the ecliptic. The groups of stars along the ecliptic are called the Zodiac.  The motion of the planets can be confusing at times. Everyone knows the Sun rises in the east and sets in the west. But this is caused by the turning motion of the Earth. Planets generally move from west to east.  However, Mars will appear to move backward for about two months this year. This happens because the Earth is overtaking Mars on its way around the Sun. Mars began its backward, or westward, motion on May 11th, It will start moving eastward again on July 19th.  Mars' apparent motion has been a mystery to astronomers for hundreds of years. Most early theories of the solar system argued that the Sun and planets turned around the Earth. But the sudden westward motion of Mars presented a problem. Why would Mars move west for two months when it nears \\"opposition\\"? In 1543, a Polish church worker named Nicolas Copernicus published a different theory. His theory said the Earth and planets moved around the Sun in perfectly circular orbits. Copernicus' theory was simpler. But his Sun - centered system still did not explain the observed motion of Mars very well. Finally, a German mathematician named Johannes Kepler published a complete theory of the motion of the planets in 1619. He had carefully studied the motion of Mars for many years. Johannes Kepler discovered that the planets do not move in circular orbits around the sun. Instead, they travel in flattened orbits called ellipses. Mars' elliptical orbit is the cause of its unusual brightening this year and its apparent large size. During the next several weeks, you can see for yourself why the mysterious motion of Mars has...

They searched and identified the boy and then posted his personal information including the address and pictures online. Over the weekend, his school's website was hacked, and reporters flooded into his home in the city of Nanjing. Besieged by reporters, the child's mother offered a formal apology for her son's behavior. \\"We want to apologize to the Egyptian people and to people who have paid attention to this case across China.\\" the boy's mother told the local newspaper.

Earlier this month, Chinese Vice Premier Wang Yang addressed: \\"Uncivilized behavior of some of tourists is giving this country a bad reputation abroad.\\" The discussion about Chinese quality was carried out on many media. On the bright side, Egypt government described the damage to the temple as superficial and could be restored and they would forgive the boy. While the act of Ding Jinhao symbolizes a national shame, meanwhile, many people concern about the child's development and wish he could return to anonymity once more. \\"The boy has known his mistake and cried all night.

Money was tight that year and Toby's parents had told him they would not be able to afford a holiday. Instead of dreaming about foreign travel, he had been reading a book, Letter to New Zealand, where the author explains what happens in an envelope's journey from England to the other side of the world. As they neared their house, Toby asked his mum, Sabine, if he could write a letter to New Zealand. After a few more steps he was struck by an even better idea. \\"Can I write a letter to every country in the world?\\" Sabine says she often wonders what would have happened if she had replied differently that day. \\"It was just one of those typical questions that five-year-olds have,\\" she says. \\" If he had asked me in the evening when I was tired, I might have refused. But as parents you realize there's a lot of power in just allowing kids to have a go. Also, it seemed a nice way to do some armchair exploration. So I told him\\" Let's see how far you get.\\" The answer was very far indeed. Toby has since written and posted letters to all 193 UN mumber states, as well as numerous other bad-conditioned areas with comforting ones. To date he has written 681 letters- the best of which have been selected to appear in a new book called Dear World, How Are You?- although so productive is Toby' pen that the number will have risen by the time you read this. \\"Writing these letters has made me realize that the world isn't actually all that big,\\" he says with a grin. In the future, part of him would like to be a musical director to turn his beloved Star Wars into a ballet.

A:","output":"This review depicts the product in an unflattering light. Several negative experiences and observations are mentioned by the reviewer, which collectively contribute to the unfavorable impression of the product.  Firstly, the reviewer highlights the issue of the initial product receiving in a damaged condition, which is likely to raise doubts regarding the packaging, shipping or manufacturing quality. This aspect creates the impression that the product might not be as durable or robust as it is supposed to be for outdoor activities like camping. Secondly, the reviewer mentions their bad experience of dropping the product while using it, which resulted in shattering it into numerous pieces. This situation brings attention to a potential lack of resilience and sturdiness needed under real-life usage conditions, especially for adventurous or physically demanding activities. Furthermore, the reviewer questions the product's suitability for camping, pointing to inexplicable durability issues despite being designed for such purposes. This statement undermines the product's effectiveness and validity in fulfilling its intended purpose and is a strong indicator of customer dissatisfaction. Lastly, the reviewer provides a specific recommendation to stick with stainless steel mirrors for non-stationary uses, which implies that the reviewed product is inferior compared to traditional alternatives. This comparison further discredits the product's value and desirability. In conclusion, this review portrays the product negatively and diminishes its reputation by emphasizing various shortcomings and failures experienced by the reviewer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: Horses will use their back and front legs in different ways to indicate how they are feeling. Horses can inflict serious injury with their legs, so understanding how your horse uses his legs to communicate will be very important for your personal safety.  Your horse will paw or stamp the ground with his front legs when he is feeling impatient, frustrated, or uncomfortable.  Splayed (spread out) front legs indicates that your horse is getting ready to run or bolt. It could also mean that your horse has medical issues that prevents him from standing properly; your veterinarian will be needed to diagnose the underlying cause.  Lifting either one front leg or back leg signals a threat. If you see your horse doing this, step back to a safe distance; a horse kick can cause serious injury.  Your horse may cock his back leg by resting the front edge of his hoof on the ground and lowering his hip. This indicates that he is relaxed.  Your horse will sometimes engage in Bucking behavior, which is when he raises his back legs in the air. This is often playful behavior (sometimes accompanied by grunting and squealing), but can also indicate uncertainty and fear, especially if he's being ridden for the first time.   Rearing up is another dual-sided behavior. It can signal playfulness in foals in the field but, if it is an angry stallion in fight mode, it can be a sign of fear when the horse cannot escape the situation. You can understand how your horse is feeling by looking at him as a whole to see how he moves and stands. For example, if your horse’s back is raised, he could be sore from having the saddle on him for a long time.  Rigid muscles and stiff movements can mean that your horse is nervous, stressed, or in pain. If you are not sure why your horse looks rigid or stiff, your veterinarian can conduct various behavioral and medical tests (dental exam, lameness exam) to determine the cause.  Trembling is a sign of fear. Your horse may tremble to the point of wanting to run or fight. If he does this, give him plenty of space and time to calm down. He may also need to be desensitized to his fear; an experienced veterinary behaviorist can help your horse overcome his fear.  Your horse may swing his hindquarters to indicate that he’s getting ready to kick; move away quickly if he starts doing this. If your horse is female, she may swing her hindquarters to indicate that she is in heat and trying to get the attention of a male horse. Horses have a range of noises that they will make to communicate different things. Understanding what these different noises mean will help you better understand what your horse is trying to communicate with you and other horses.  Your horse will neigh for several reasons. He may neigh to indicate anxiety or distress; this will be a very high-pitched sound and could be accompanied by a lowered tail and flickering ears. He may also neigh to acknowledge his presence. A confident neigh will sound like a bugle and will be accompanied by a slightly lifted tail, forward-pricked ears. A nicker is a soft, throaty sound. To make this sound, your horse will keep his mouth closed while producing the sound from his vocal chords. A mare will sometime use this sound with her foal. Your horse may also make this sound when he knows that it’s almost feeding time. This is usually a friendly sound. Squeals can be a display of threat. Two horses who are meeting each other for the first time may squeal at each other. Squeals can also be a sign of playfulness, such as when your horse is bucking. Your horse will snort by inhaling quickly and then exhaling through his nose. With this sound, he could be signaling that he is alarmed when another animal has come too close to him. He could also be indicating that he's excited about something. Be aware that the act of snorting can get horses worked up; you may need to calm him down if this happens. Just like people, your horse will sigh to express relief and relaxation. The sighs are different for each each emotion: relief–deep inhale, then a slow exhale through the nose or mouth; relaxation–lowered head with an exhalation that makes a fluttering noise. Groans can indicate different things. For example, your horse may groan if he's in pain during riding (eg, landing hard after a jumping a fence, his rider thuds heavily in the saddle). He might also groan when he's happily exercising without pain. Groaning could also indicate more serious medical issues, such as constipation or gastric pain due to ulcers. If you have trouble determine why your horse is groaning, consult a horse expert. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses how horses use their legs and various noises to communicate their feelings, emotions, and intentions. It highlights the importance of understanding these signals for the safety of both the horse and its handler. The article describes different leg gestures, such as pawing, splayed legs, lifting legs, cocking back legs, bucking, and rearing, and their respective meanings. It also covers various horse sounds like neighing, nickering, squealing, snorting, sighing, and groaning, each conveying different messages. Recognizing and interpreting these signals can help in managing the horse's behavior, addressing potential health issues, and building a stronger bond between the horse and its handler."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We can, however, generate a few different hypotheses regarding what might happen next or possible consequences of the event, but it is essential to note that these hypotheses are not definitive conclusions. These hypotheses should be based on a reasonable connection to the provided context. Hypothesis 1: Justin's car will require significant repairs or replacement. Reasoning: In the context, it is mentioned that Justin's car made a loud noise, and after pulling over and examining the vehicle, he discovered that his engine was blown. This indicates that there will be a need for repairs or replacement. Hypothesis 2: Justin may experience some inconvenience due to the incident. Reasoning: Since Justin's car has broken down during his trip, he had to call for help and wait to be picked up. This suggests that he might face some inconvenience and delay in his plans due to the breakdown. Hypothesis 3: Justin might seek assistance from friends, family, or professional services for his car repair. Reasoning: As stated in the context, Justin called for help after his car broke down. This implies that he would likely be looking for support from either friends, family, or professional services to help him with his car repair and get back on the road.

Teams are placed into tables, placing them in order according to points accrued. Most commonly, each team plays every other team in its league at home and away in each season, in a round-robin tournament. At the end of a season, the top team is declared the champion. The top few teams may be promoted to a higher division, and one or more of the teams finishing at the bottom are relegated to a lower division. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What could happen to the top few teams at the end of the season?","output":"At the end of a domestic season, a number of outcomes could happen to the top few teams in each league, depending on the specific structure and rules of their respective league systems. Here are the most common scenarios: 1. Championship and Title: The team finishing at the top of the league table is crowned the champion of the division and often receives a trophy. This is seen as a major achievement in club football, and it is a great source of pride for the players, coaching staff, and fans. 2. Promotion: In many countries with multi-tier league systems, the top few teams (usually two or three) earn promotion to a higher division for the following season. This allows clubs to progress upwards through the football hierarchy and potentially reach the highest level in their country's league system. Promotion can provide significant financial rewards and an opportunity to compete against stronger teams. Sometimes, playoffs involving the top few teams are conducted to determine promotions. 3. Qualification for Continental Competitions: Top teams in many leagues also qualify for international club competitions, such as the UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League (in Europe), the Copa Libertadores (in South America), the CAF Champions League (in Africa), the AFC Champions League (in Asia), and the Concacaf Champions League (in North America, Central America, and the Caribbean). Participating in these tournaments offers clubs the opportunity to compete at a higher level, increase their fan base, and earn extra revenue. 4. Financial Rewards: Finishing positions in the league table often correlate with significant financial rewards. Sponsorships, television rights, and other revenue streams usually increase for teams in higher positions, helping to strengthen the club's financial position in the long run. 5. Prestige and Attraction of New Talent: Teams that finish near the top of the league are more likely to attract new players, retain their current talent, and garner respect in the football world. A strong league finish can help teams build a more competitive squad, enhance their reputation, and create a solid foundation for sustainable success. 6. Enhanced Fan Support and Engagement: A successful season can lead to increased fan engagement, better home game attendance, and growing product sales. This positive feedback loop helps clubs generate more funds and strengthens their connection with supporters. In summary, the top few teams at the end of a season can expect increased prestige, financial rewards, promotion to higher divisions, and qualification for continental competitions, depending on the specific rules and structure of their respective league systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"\\"Arrive early\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it directly relates to the concept of the baby coming unexpectedly. It implies that the baby was born before the expected due date, which is a common reason for a baby to be considered as arriving unexpectedly. The other options do not directly address the unexpected nature of the baby's arrival and are therefore less relevant or plausible in this context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person Lennon become involved with in a protest? from the following article ?  In 1970, Lennon and Ono went through primal therapy with Arthur Janov in Los Angeles, California. Designed to release emotional pain from early childhood, the therapy entailed two half-days a week with Janov for four months; he had wanted to treat the couple for longer, but they felt no need to continue and returned to London. Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine. Eager for a major commercial success, Lennon adopted a more accessible sound for his next album, Imagine (1971). Rolling Stone reported that \\"it contains a substantial portion of good music\\" but warned of the possibility that \\"his posturings will soon seem not merely dull but irrelevant\\". The album's title track later became an anthem for anti-war movements, while the song \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" was a musical attack on McCartney in response...
