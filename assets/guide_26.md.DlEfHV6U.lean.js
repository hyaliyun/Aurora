It is known that a is the sum of a number and its reciprocal, so it must be greater than or equal to 2:    [    a geq 2    ]    Equality holds if and only if operatorname{tg} x = operatorname{ctg} x = 1. 2. To find prime numbers, we use the identity:    [    operatorname{tg}^3 x + operatorname{ctg}^3 x = (operatorname{tg} x + operatorname{ctg} x) left( operatorname{tg}^2 x - operatorname{tg} x cdot operatorname{ctg} x + operatorname{ctg}^2 x right)    ]        Using the substitution a = operatorname{tg} x + operatorname{ctg} x, we get:    [    operatorname{tg}^3 x + operatorname{ctg}^3 x = a left( (operatorname{tg} x + operatorname{ctg} x)^2 - 3 operatorname{tg} x cdot operatorname{ctg} x right)    ] 3. Evaluate (operatorname{tg} x + operatorname{ctg} x)^2:    [    (operatorname{tg} x + operatorname{ctg} x)^2 = a^2    ] 4. Knowing that operatorname{tg} x cdot operatorname{ctg} x = 1, the formula simplifies:    [    operatorname{tg}^3 x + operatorname{ctg}^3 x = a left( a^2 - 3 right)    ] 5. If a is a positive integer such that a geq 2, a^2 - 3 is also a positive integer. For the product a cdot left(a^2 - 3right) to be a prime number, one factor must be 1, and the other must be the prime itself. 6. Thus, a = p (a prime number) and a^2 - 3 = 1:    [    p^2 - 3 = 1 implies p^2 = 4 implies p = 2    ] 7. If a = 2, then operatorname{tg} x + operatorname{ctg} x = 2. 8.

Case Analysis 1. **Case 1: The angle angle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} contains no other points inside it (i.e., n=3)**:     - In this case, we are dealing with a triangle, and the sought angle alpha is angle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3}.     - The interior angles of a triangle sum up to pi, and each angle in an equilateral triangle is frac{pi}{3}.     - Therefore, alpha = angle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} leqslant frac{pi}{3}. 2. **Case 2: The angle angle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} contains n-3 points inside it**:     - This angle angle A_{1} A_{2} A_{3} will be split into n-2 smaller angles by the n-3 points inside it.     - Thus, there must be some part of this angle, let's denote it by alpha_0, with:         [         alpha_0 leqslant frac{frac{pi(n-2)}{n}}{n-2} = frac{pi}{n}.         ]     - Therefore, in general, alpha leq frac{pi}{n}. # Conclusion - To achieve equality in both cases, two conditions are required:     1.

First, we need to calculate the volume of water displaced by the boat when the man gets on it.

Putting these into the inequality we get: [ frac{1}{3} leq m leq 1 ] However, in combination with our first condition that m > 0, and since the problem requires the solution set to be all real numbers, we must only consider the range where the inequality strictly holds true and where there are no roots at all, i.e., for m > 1. Therefore, combining both conditions, we get that the range for m must be m in left(frac{1}{3}, +inftyright).

Hence, the maximum value of -left(y - frac{1}{2}right)^2 + frac{1}{4} occurs when left(y - frac{1}{2}right)^2 = 0, which simplifies to y = frac{1}{2}.  Thus, the maximum value is frac{1}{4}, which occurs at y = frac{1}{2}, i.e., x = log_3left(frac{1}{2}right). Conclusion: Thus, the maximum value of 3^x - 9^x over all real numbers x is boxed{frac{1}{4}}, occurring at x = log_3left(frac{1}{2}right)."},{"instruction":"What two digits need to be added to the right of the number 2013 to make the resulting sixdigit number divisible by 101?

Now, we have the standard form of a circle's equation, which is (x-h)^2+(y-k)^2=r^2, where (h,k) is the center of the circle and r is the radius. So, the center of our circle is at the point (1,-2), and the radius is sqrt{6}.

If the distance is less than the radius, the origin is inside the circle; if the distance is equal to the radius, the origin is on the circle; and if the distance is greater than the radius, the origin is outside the circle. The distance d from the origin (0,0) to the center (1,-2) of the circle is calculated by the distance formula: d=sqrt{(0-1)^2+(0+2)^2}=sqrt{1+4}=sqrt{5}.

Let's denote the speed of the first train as ( V_1 ) (in km/hr) and the speed of the second train as ( V_2 ) (in km/hr). We are given that ( V_2 = 80 ) km/hr. The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is ( 220 ) m + ( 280.04 ) m = ( 500.04 ) m. We need to convert this distance to kilometers because the speed is given in km/hr. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so the distance in kilometers is: ( 500.04 ) m = ( frac{500.04}{1000} ) km = ( 0.50004 ) km The time taken for the trains to cross each other is given as 9 seconds. To convert this time to hours, we divide by 3600 (the number of seconds in an hour): ( 9 ) sec = ( frac{9}{3600} ) hours = ( 0.0025 ) hours Now, we can use the formula for relative speed: Relative Speed = ( frac{Total Distance}{Time} ) Plugging in the values we have: ( V_1 + V_2 = frac{0.50004}{0.0025} ) ( V_1 + 80 = frac{0.50004}{0.0025} ) To find ( V_1 ), we need to calculate the right side of the equation: ( frac{0.50004}{0.0025} = 200.016 ) km/hr Now, we can solve for ( V_1 ): ( V_1 = 200.016 - 80 ) ( V_1 = 120.016 ) km/hr Therefore, the speed of the first train is approximately boxed{120.016}  km/hr."},{"instruction":"( 2 ^ 3 * 1! + 4 ^ 3 * 2! + 6 ^ 3 * 3! + . . . . . + x ^ 3 * y! ) = ?

To find ( theta ), notice that:     [     cos(theta/2) = frac{R}{R + R/2} = frac{2}{3}     ]     - Thus, ( theta ) is given by:     [     theta = 2 cos^{-1}left(frac{2}{3}right)     ]     - Since (frac{2}{3} < frac{1}{sqrt{2}}), ( theta ) is more than ( 90^circ ) or ( frac{pi}{2} ) radians. 4. **Spiraling strategy**:     - The spacecraft spirals around the planet, reducing its altitude progressively.     - This gives a helical path, ensuring overlapping of successive circular paths. 5. **Overlap and coverage**:     - Let's take the overlap to be ( frac{2}{3} ) of the spot diameter.     - Each revolution advances the track by ( frac{pi}{6} ). 6. **Calculations for distances and speed**:     - When circling the equator, the circumference of the planet is ( 2pi R ).     - The height of the spiral is such that the distance covered with each revolution must allow discovery of the alien.     - If the planet’s radius is ( R = 1 ) unit and the spacecraft speed ( v = 1 ) unit per time unit.     - The helical path taken by the spacecraft covers a distance per revolution at the equator which equals ( 2 pi times 1.5 ) units ( = 3pi ) units.     - Adding the small forward advance ( pi/6 ) gives a total path per revolution of ( 3pi + frac{pi}{6} = frac{19pi}{6} ). 7. **Speed advantage**:     - Alien’s allowable distance per revolution since ( v > 10u ) is:     [     frac{19 pi u}{6v} = frac{19u pi}{6 times 10u} = frac{19 pi}{60}     ]     - Since ( frac{19pi}{60} < frac{2pi}{3} ), the spacecraft traps the alien as the reduced area around the south pole continuously shrinks due to the spaceship's greater speed and effective coverage. # Conclusion The detailed plan and path coverage ensure that ( v > 10u ) implies the spacecraft will trap the alien and find it.

The wall dimensions in centimeters are: - Length: 8 m = 800 cm - Height: 6 m = 600 cm - Width: 22.5 cm The volume of the wall can be calculated as: Volume_wall = Length_wall * Height_wall * Width_wall Volume_wall = 800 cm * 600 cm * 22.5 cm Volume_wall = 10800000 cm³ Now, let's calculate the volume of one brick without the height (since the height is what we're trying to find). We have the length and width of the brick: - Length_brick = 25 cm - Width_brick = 11.25 cm The volume of one brick (without the height) is: Volume_brick_without_height = Length_brick * Width_brick * Height_brick Since we don't know the height, we'll leave it as a variable (h): Volume_brick_without_height = 25 cm * 11.25 cm * h We know that 6400 bricks are needed to build the wall, so the total volume of all the bricks will be equal to the volume of the wall. Therefore: 6400 * Volume_brick_without_height = Volume_wall 6400 * (25 cm * 11.25 cm * h) = 10800000 cm³ Now we solve for h: 6400 * (25 cm * 11.25 cm) * h = 10800000 cm³ 6400 * 281.25 cm² * h = 10800000 cm³ 1800000 cm² * h = 10800000 cm³ Now we divide both sides by 1800000 cm² to find h: h = 10800000 cm³ / 1800000 cm² h = 6 cm So the height of each brick is boxed{6}  cm."},{"instruction":"Determine the equation of the ellipse which passes through the points P(1, frac{sqrt{3}}{2}) and Q(2, 0).","output":"Let's assume the equation of the ellipse to be of the form mx^2 + ny^2 = 1.

If f is a direct proportion function, then m = _______; if f is an inverse proportion function, then m = _______; if f(x) is a power function, then m = _______.","output":"- For a function to be a direct proportion function, it should have the form f(x) = kx, where k is a constant. Thus, the function must be linear and pass through the origin (0,0). In the given function f = x^{m^2} - 2, the function will be a direct proportion function if the -2 is eliminated and the power of x is 1, making m^2 = 1. Therefore, m = pm1. Hence, when f is a direct proportion function, m = boxed{pm1}. - An inverse proportion function has the form f(x) = frac{k}{x}, where k is a constant. To express the function f = x^{m^2} - 2 in this form, the exponent of x must be -1 (because it's in the denominator), and the -2 must be eliminated. This means m^2 = -1, which is not possible for real numbers (as squaring a real number cannot give a negative result). However, if we disregard the -2 and focus on the requirement that x must be in the denominator, then m^2 should be -1, which implies m = -1 given that we are looking for an exponent. Hence, when f is an inverse proportion function, m = boxed{-1}. - A power function has the form f(x) = kx^n, where k is a constant, and n is a real number. The given function f = x^{m^2} - 2 is already in the power function form, as long as k and n are not dependent on x. Since -2 is a constant and does not affect the classification of a power function, we can disregard it here. The exponent m^2 can be any real number. Therefore, there isn't a restriction on m for f(x) to be a power function aside from it being a real number. In the context of the previous parts of the question and the provided solution, it can be understood that the answer here is meant to be m = pmsqrt{n}, where n is the exponent in the standard form of a power function.

If the line AB is lowered to be horizontal (thus forming an angle x), the line AC takes the position A'D, moving away from point C to D. What is the length of CD? To solve for the length of CD, we start by analyzing the problem and the given geometric transformations. 1. **Identify and Define Points and Lines:**    - Let A'B' = AB with A' inside the quadrilateral.    - When AB is rotated around point B by an angle x, A moves to A'.    - Line AC, initially at C, moves to position A'D. 2. **Relate Coordinates and Transformations:**    - Assume initial coordinates: ( A = (0, 0) ), ( B = (a, 0) ), where a is the length of AB.    - Point M lies directly above A: ( M = (0, b) ), b being the length AM.    - Point C lies somewhere on the line MN: ( C = (c, b) ). 3. **Apply Rotation to Point A:**    - Rotation of A by angle x around B: New coordinates ( A' = left(a cos(x), a sin(x)right) ).    - Since A'B = AB, the coordinates remain consistent considering any possible orientation. 4. **Determine Coordinates of D:**    - The line A'C before movement converts to A'D after rotation.    - Horizontal distance moved by C to D is CD.    - ( A = (0, 0) rightarrow A' = (a cos(x), a sin(x)) ). 5. **Calculate CD:**    - Initial coordinates of C: ( (c, b) ).

One calculation approach on transforming C movements horizontally due to rotation includes a geometric shift:    [    CD = c cdot cos(x)    ] 6. **Conclusion:**    Detailed comparison and application of coordinate shift, leading to:    [    CD = AC cdot cos(x)    ]    Using given assumptions,    - CD simplifies functionally to the distance formula.

Prove that any pile of stones can then be divided into piles of single stones.","output":"1. **Initial Setup**: We are given a definition where similar sizes mean that the sizes differ by at most a factor of two. We need to show that any initial collection of piles can be transformed into one single pile by combining piles whose sizes are similar. 2. **Consider the Reverse Process**: Instead of starting with one pile and breaking it down, visualize the reverse process. Assume we initially have several individual piles, each containing exactly one stone. The goal is to combine these individual piles into one single pile of size ( n ), where ( n ) is the total number of stones. 3. **Combining Process**: At any step, we can combine two piles of sizes ( x ) and ( y ) (where ( x leq y )) to form a new pile of size ( x + y ). This is valid under the condition that ( x ) and ( y ) are similar sizes, i.e., ( x leq y leq 2x ). 4. **Maintaining Similar Sizes**:     - Since we are starting with piles of size 1 (where all piles are similar), assume we always pick the smallest piles to combine.     - Each time we combine two piles, say sizes ( x ) and ( y ) (with ( x leq y )), the resulting pile will have size ( x + y ).      - The new pile size ( x + y ) must be less than or equal to ( 2y ), hence still meeting the requirement of similar sizes (as ( y leq 2x )). 5. **Inductive Argument**:     - We start with ( n ) piles of size 1.     - Combining pairs of piles gradually reduces the number of piles while ensuring that all resulting piles maintain the condition of similar sizes.     - The process continues, maintaining the invariant that no pile will differ from the other by more than a factor of two. 6. **Reaching the Final Pile**:     - This combining will eventually reduce the number of piles until only one pile remains.     - Since at every stage the combined pile size respects the similar size condition, the final pile formed is of size ( n ). Thus, the initial collection of piles can indeed be transformed into one single pile of size ( n ) by iteratively combining piles of similar sizes.

Therefore, ( O ) is also the orthocenter of the medial triangle. 4. **Key Statement**:     It suffices to prove that the reflections of any line through the orthocenter of a triangle, taken with respect to the sides of the triangle, concur at a single point. 5. **Proof Strategy**:     - When ( gamma = 90^circ ), reflections ( h_a ) and ( h_b ) overlap. Thus, the statement is trivially true in this case.     - For an acute angle ( gamma ) or an obtuse angle, represent the line situations using diagrams as above. 6. **Angle Analysis and Reflection Composition**:     - Consider the reflections ( O_a ), ( O_b ), and ( O_c ) across the respective sides. These points lie on the circumcircle ( k ).      - When we reflect ( h ) over two sides sequentially, it equates to a rotation about the vertex by an angle ( 2alpha ).     - Consequently, ( h_c ) maps to ( h_b ) or similar mappings under specific compositions of reflections. 7. **Circular Argument**:     - If ( P ) denotes the intersection of ( h_b ) and ( h_c ), by properties of the circumcircle, angle properties can confirm that they intersect at a point on ( k ).     - In any configuration considered, whether lines intersect within the span of medians or triangle sides, the reflections intersect at a common point. 8. **Conclusion**:     The reflections of any line passing through the circumcenter taken with respect to the medians concur at a single point on the circumcircle.

Then, we find the derivative of f(x) to understand its behavior:    f'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x - 1}{x}. 2. **Analyze the derivative to determine the function's behavior:**    - For 0 < x < 1, f'(x) < 0 because the numerator (x - 1) is negative and the denominator x is positive. This means the function is decreasing on the interval (0, 1).        - For x > 1, f'(x) > 0 since both the numerator and denominator are positive, indicating the function is increasing on the interval (1, +infty). 3. **Evaluate the function at specific points to find sign changes:**    - At x = e^{-2}, we have f(e^{-2}) = e^{-2} - ln e^{-2} - 2 = e^{-2} + 2 - 2 = e^{-2} > 0.        - At x = 1, f(1) = 1 - ln 1 - 2 = 1 - 0 - 2 = -1 < 0.

With tan A = frac{sqrt{3}}{3}, and knowing the basic tangent values, we can determine that A = frac{pi}{6}. Therefore, the measure of angle A is boxed{frac{pi}{6}}.

The principle of inclusion-exclusion states that for any two sets, the size of their union is equal to the sum of the sizes of the individual sets minus the size of their intersection. Let C be the number of buyers who purchase cake mix, and let M be the number of buyers who purchase muffin mix. The number of buyers who purchase either cake mix or muffin mix or both is the total number of buyers minus those who purchase neither, which is 100 - 27 = 73 buyers.

Consider the coordinates for a better visualization, taking point P at the origin for simplicity.    - If P is at (0, 0, 0), then:      - Point X is in one plane, say (a, a, 0) because it forms a 45^circ angle with PB in the plane of M.      - Point Y is in the other plane which is perpendicular, so (0, a, a) because it forms a 45^circ angle with PB in the plane of N. 5.

We recognize that 2^{log_4 3} can be rewritten using the property of exponentials and logarithms:  2^{log_4 3} = (4^{frac{1}{2}})^{log_4 3} = 4^{frac{log_4 3}{2}} = 3^{frac{1}{2}} = sqrt{3},  since 4^{frac{1}{2}} is the square root of 4, which is 2, and raising four to the logarithm base 4 of three halves is the square root of 3 because the logarithm and the exponential functions are inverse functions. Similarly, for 2^{-log_4 3}, using the property that x^{-1} = frac{1}{x}, we have:  2^{-log_4 3} = frac{1}{2^{log_4 3}} = frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = sqrt{frac{1}{3}}.  Adding these two terms together, we get:  sqrt{3} + sqrt{frac{1}{3}} = sqrt{3} + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}.  To combine these terms under a single radical, we can rationalize the denominator:  sqrt{3} + frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{sqrt{3}cdotsqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} + frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{3}{sqrt{3}} + frac{1}{sqrt{3}} = frac{4}{sqrt{3}}.  To express this without a radical in the denominator, we multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt{3}:  frac{4}{sqrt{3}} cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}.  Therefore, the expression simplifies to:  2^a + 2^{-a} = boxed{frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}}."},{"instruction":"The equation of the line that passes through point P(2, 0) and is parallel to the line x  2y + 3 = 0 is __________.","output":"Given that the slope of the line x - 2y + 3 = 0 is frac{1}{2} (since if we rewrite the equation in slope-intercept form, it becomes y = frac{1}{2}x + frac{3}{2}), any line parallel to it must have the same slope.

This means the new average age is A + 1.75. The total age of the 12 men before the women were included is 12 * A. When the three men are removed, their ages (18, 26, and 35) are subtracted from the total age, and the ages of the three women are added. Let's denote the sum of the ages of the three women as W. The new total age of the group (now including the three women) is (12 * A) - (18 + 26 + 35) + W. Since the average age of the group increased by 1.75 years when the women joined, the new average age is (A + 1.75). The new total age of the group is therefore 12 * (A + 1.75). Setting the two expressions for the new total age equal to each other, we get: (12 * A) - (18 + 26 + 35) + W = 12 * (A + 1.75) Now we can solve for W: W = 12 * (A + 1.75) - (12 * A) + (18 + 26 + 35) W = 12A + 21 - 12A + 79 W = 21 + 79 W = 100 The sum of the ages of the three women is 100 years. To find the average age of the women, we divide the total age by the number of women: Average age of women = W / 3 Average age of women = 100 / 3 Average age of women ≈ 33.33 years Therefore, the average age of the three women is approximately boxed{33.33}  years."},{"instruction":"w many of the divisors of 9! are larger than 8!?","output":"Let d divide 9!, and suppose d > 8!.

Prove that it is impossible to perform ( frac{n^3}{4} ) or more such moves.","output":"Let ( M ) be a set of ( n geq 4 ) points in the plane, with no three points collinear, initially connected by ( n ) segments such that each point in ( M ) is the endpoint of exactly two segments. We need to prove that it is impossible to perform ( frac{n^3}{4} ) or more moves where each move replaces two intersecting segments ( AB ) and ( CD ) with the segments ( AC ) and ( BD ). Consider the following definitions and observations: 1. **Red Lines**: A red line connects two points in ( M ). Since no three points of ( M ) are collinear, each red line uniquely determines a pair of points in ( M ). 2. **Counting Red Lines**: There are precisely ( binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} ) red lines, and since ( n geq 4 ), the count of red lines is less than (frac{n^2}{2}). 3. **Value of a Segment**: Define the value of a segment as the number of red lines intersecting it in its interior. The value of a set of segments is the sum of the values of its elements. Our goal is to prove that ( (i) ) the initial value of the set of segments is less than ( frac{n^3}{2} ) and ( (ii) ) each step decreases this value by at least 2. # Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Initial Value of Segments**:    - To demonstrate the initial value of segments is less than ( frac{n^3}{2} ), observe that each segment is intersected by at most ( frac{n^2}{2} ) red lines. This upper bound is derived from the fact that for a segment between two points, there could be at most ( frac{n}{2} ) other segments intersecting it.    - Since we have ( n ) segments, the total value ( V ) is given by:      [      V leq n cdot frac{n^2}{2} = frac{n^3}{2} - O(n^2)      ] 2. **Value Decrease by Steps**:    - Suppose we have two segments ( AB ) and ( CD ) intersecting at a point ( S ). We replace them by ( AC ) and ( BD ).    - Let ( X_{AB} ) be the set of red lines intersecting ( AB ) in its interior. Define ( X_{AC}, X_{BD}, ) and ( X_{CD} ) similarly. We need to show:      [      |X_{AC}| + |X_{BD}| leq |X_{AB}| + |X_{CD}| - 2      ]    - Consider the set intersections:      [      |X_{AC} cup X_{BD}| + 2 leq |X_{AB} cup X_{CD}|      ]          Each red line intersecting ( AC ) or ( BD ) must intersect ( AS ) or ( SC ) and similarly for segments from ( B ) to ( D ), which are counted in ( X_{AB} cup X_{CD} ). Additionally, ( AB ) and ( CD ) are counted only once in the union of new intersections ( AC ) and ( BD ). 3. **Intersection Analysis**:    - Next, analyze the intersections depth-wise:      [      |X_{AC} cap X_{BD}| leq |X_{AB} cap X_{CD}|      ]    - If a red line intersects both ( AC ) and ( BD ), it must intersect at least one segment from ( A ) to ( B ) or ( C ) to ( D ), implying it's counted in ( X_{AB} cap X_{CD} ). 4. **Combining Results**:        - Combining the union and intersection results, we confirm that each step decreases the value by at least 2:      [      |X_{AC}| + |X_{BD}| leq |X_{AB}| + |X_{CD}| - 2      ] # Conclusion: Since we start with a total segment value ( V < frac{n^3}{2} ) and each step decreases this value by at least 2, it is impossible to perform ( frac{n^3}{4} ) or more such moves.

We need to show that there are at least ( k+1 ) distinct numbers in the set ( {a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + a_i mid i = 1, 2, dots, n} ). 2. **Assumption:**    Suppose for contradiction that there are at most ( k ) distinct sums in the set ( {a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + a_i} ). 3. **Combination Argument:**    - There are at most ( binom{k}{3} ) ways to choose 3 distinct numbers from ( k ) distinct elements.    - Hence, there are at most ( binom{k}{3} ) distinct sets of the form ({a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + a_i}).    - Since ( n > binom{k}{3} ), it follows that:      [      n > binom{k}{3}      ]    - Therefore, due to the Pigeonhole Principle, there exist indices ( i neq j ) such that:      [      {a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + a_i} = {a_j + b_j, b_j + c_j, c_j + a_j}      ] 4. **Uniqueness Argument:**    - The set ( {a_i, b_i, c_i} ) is uniquely determined by the sums ( {a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + a_i} ).    - Therefore, if ( {a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + a_i} = {a_j + b_j, b_j + c_j, c_j + a_j} ), it must be that:      [      {a_i, b_i, c_i} = {a_j, b_j, c_j}      ]    - This results in a contradiction because ( a_i, b_i, c_i ) are all distinct, and hence:      [      {a_i, b_i, c_i} neq {a_j, b_j, c_j}      ] 5. **Conclusion from Contradiction:**    - The assumption that there are at most ( k ) distinct sums leads to a contradiction.    - Consequently, there must be at least ( k+1 ) distinct sums in the set ( {a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + a_i} ). 6. **Validation with an Example:**    - To show that the statement is not always true when ( n = binom{k}{3} ), consider the set ( S = {3^0, 3^1, 3^2, ldots, 3^{k-1}} ).    - For each subset of three elements from ( S ), we get sets like ( {a_i + b_i, b_i + c_i, c_i + a_i} ).    - If the sums are constructed as shown:      [      (3a + 3b - 3c)/2 = (3r + 3s - 3t)/2      ]      - Here, the uniqueness of the base-3 representation ensures that the set equality holds:        [        {a, b, c} = {r, s, t}        ]      - For example, using distinct numbers in base 3, it can be shown that:        - ( a_i, b_i, c_i ) remain distinct, but:          [          (3a + 3b + 3t) = (3r + 3s + 3c)          ]          - Under suitable conditions, the sets match resulting in:            [            {a, b, t} = {r, s, c}            ]        - Therefore, the counterexample provides cases where ( n = binom{k}{3} ). # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The statement is indeed true for } n > binom{k}{3}, text{ and a counterexample shows it is not always true for } n = binom{k}{3}.} ]"},{"instruction":"the rectangular coordinate system xOy, the parametric equations of curve C are given by begin{cases} overset{x=1+2costheta }{y=1+2sintheta }end{cases} (where θ is the parameter).

Out of 20 cubes, some are made of aluminum, and the others are made of duralumin (which is heavier). How can you determine the number of duralumin cubes using exactly 11 weighings on a two-pan balance without weights? To solve this problem, we need to devise a strategy that guarantees the ability to differentiate between the aluminum and duralumin cubes within the given constraints. 1. **Initial Weighing Split:**    - Place one cube on each pan of the balance.       [      text{Pan 1: } C_1 quad text{Pan 2: } C_2      ] 2. **Analyze the Outcome of the First Weighing:**    - **Case 1:** One of the cubes is heavier.      If the balance tips, one cube is heavier, so one cube is aluminum ( A ) and the other is duralumin ( D ). Without loss of generality, let's assume ( C_1 ) is aluminum and ( C_2 ) is duralumin.      - Place both ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) on one pan and compare them with the remaining pairs of cubes.

Verify the ( k )-th pair by re-weighing two cubes from the first ( k )-th pairs again:      [      text{Pan 1: } C_i quad text{Pan 2: } C_j quad text{for } i, j = 3, 4, ldots, 2k + 2      ]      Ensure consistency.

Let A(x_1, y_1) and B(x_2, y_2). Then, f'(x_1) = a + cos x_1 - sin x_1 and f'(x_2) = a + cos x_2 - sin x_2. Since the tangent lines at points A and B are perpendicular, f'(x_1)f'(x_2) = -1. Thus, a^2 + [(cos x_1 - sin x_1) + (cos x_2 - sin x_2)]a + (cos x_1 - sin x_1)(cos x_2 - sin x_2) + 1 = 0. Let m = cos x_1 - sin x_1 and n = cos x_2 - sin x_2. Then, m, n in [-sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}]. So, a^2 + (m + n)a + mn + 1 = 0. The discriminant is Delta = (m + n)^2 - 4mn - 4 = (m - n)^2 - 4. Hence, 0 leq (m - n)^2 - 4 leq 4, and 0 leq sqrt{(m - n)^2 - 4} leq 2. When m - n = pm 2sqrt{2}, we have m + n = 0, and a = frac{-(m + n) pm sqrt{(m + n)^2 - 4mn - 4}}{2} = frac{-(m + n) pm sqrt{(m - n)^2 - 4}}{2}. Therefore, -1 leq a leq 1. In conclusion, the range of values for the real number a such that there exist two distinct points, A and B, on the graph of y = f(x) where the tangent lines at points A and B are perpendicular to each other is boxed{[-1, 1]}. This problem involves finding the derivative of the given function, setting up the coordinates of points A and B, and substituting them into the derivative. By setting the derivatives at points A and B equal to -1 and solving for a, we obtain a quadratic equation in terms of a. Using linear programming concepts, we find the range of values for a. The key to solving this problem is determining the range of a from the roots of the quadratic equation.

Is it true that the sides are equal?","output":"# Problem: Biinkov A.D: In a hexagon, the angles are equal, three main diagonals are equal to each other, and the six remaining diagonals are also equal among themselves. Is it true that the sides of the hexagon are equal? To address the problem, let's carefully analyze the given hexagon ABCDEF with equal angles and specified diagonal properties. Here is a detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Identifying the Hexagon**:    Consider a hexagon ABCDEF with all angles equal, i.e., angle A = angle B = angle C = angle D = angle E = angle F. 2. **Construction**:    Assume that the sides are not all equal. Specifically, the sides are equal in an alternating fashion: AB = CD = EF ne BC ne DE ne FA. 3. **Diagonal Properties**:    According to the problem, there are three main diagonals (e.g., AC, CE, and EA) that are equal to each other and the remaining six diagonals (such as AD, BE, etc.) are also equal among themselves. 4. **Analysis of Smaller Diagonals**:    The small diagonals (those not spanning three vertices) can be shown equal by considering triangles formed between them. For instance, triangle ABC cong triangle FDE by SSA criteria:    - AB = DE (assumed),    - angle ABC = angle FDE (because all angles are equal in a regular hexagon),    - BC = DE (by diagonal equality). 5. **Main Diagonals**:    To show the main diagonals' equality, consider quadrilateral diagonals intersecting at centers of opposite sides. For instance, the diagonals forming trapezoids like ACDF:    - Since angle A = angle D and opposite sides are parallel, AC = DF (by symmetry and equal opposite angles). 6. **Conclusion and Verification**:    Given all these properties, if we fill in further geometric properties and lengths imposed by alternating equal sides, we'll see that these align with the condition:    - Given properties and equal angles, the pattern ensures that diagonals fall within the assumed properties. Thus, the only conclusion possible is that any construction of such hexagon inherently has an alternating condition but doesn't necessarily imply all sides being equal. # Conclusion The conclusion that the sides of the hexagon are **not** necessarily equal given only the angle and diagonal properties is correct. boxed{text{False}}"},{"instruction":"Given overrightarrow{a}=({1,0,1}), overrightarrow{b}=({1,2,3}), overrightarrow{c}=({2,4,6}), which of the following conclusions is correct?

Since there are 19 scientists who did not receive the Wolf Prize, and we know that N_W = N_W' + 3, we can set up the following equation: N_W + N_W' = 19. Substituting N_W' with N_W - 3, we get: N_W + (N_W - 3) = 19, 2N_W - 3 = 19, 2N_W = 22, N_W = 11. Now we know that there are 11 Nobel laureates who did not receive the Wolf Prize. We can now find the number of Wolf laureates who are also Nobel laureates (W_N) by subtracting N_W from the total number of Nobel laureates: W_N = 29 - N_W, W_N = 29 - 11, W_N = 18.

So, the point of tangency is left(0,1right). - The derivative of f(x) is found as follows:     [   {f'}left(xright)=frac{d}{dx}left[left(x+1right)e^{x}right] = e^{x}+ left(x+1right)e^{x} = left(x+2right)e^{x}   ] - The slope of the tangent line at x=0 is:     [   k = {f'}left(0right) = left(0+2right)e^{0} = 2   ] - Using the point-slope form of the equation of a line, y-y_1=m(x-x_1), with (x_1, y_1)=(0, 1) and m=2, we get:     [   y-1=2(x-0) implies y = 2x+1   ]    Thus, the equation of the tangent line is boxed{y=2x+1}.

It is known that each red bead has neighbors of different colors, and in any segment of the necklace between two green beads, there is at least one blue bead. What is the minimum number of blue beads that can be in this necklace? (The beads in the necklace are arranged cyclically, meaning the last bead is adjacent to the first.)","output":"Consider the necklace consisting of 175 beads of red, blue, and green colors. We are given two constraints: 1. Each red bead has neighbors of different colors. 2. Every segment of the necklace between two green beads contains at least one blue bead. We need to find the minimum number of blue beads.  Step-by-step breakdown: 1. **Identify the essential pattern within segments of beads:**    Any group of 6 consecutive beads must contain at least one blue bead. This is because:    - If there are more than one green bead within the block, it would necessitate a blue bead between them as per the given condition.    - If there were 5 red beads in the block, three of these red beads would be consecutive, and this would violate the condition that each red bead has neighbors of different colors. 2. **Verify by assumption:**    Let's assume there are no more than 4 red beads in each block of 6 beads. This leaves room for at least one bead to be blue to avoid the situation described above. Thus, ANY 6-member segment must at least have one blue bead. 3. **Divide the necklace:**    Fix a blue bead and divide the rest of the beads into 29 segments of 6 beads each.    - From the above point, we know that each of these segments must contain at least one blue bead.    - Therefore, we have one extra blue bead fixed initially, leading to a minimum of 1 + 29 = 30 blue beads. 4. **Construct an example configuration:**    To ensure 30 blue beads is sufficient, we can construct a pattern that fits the constraints:        Here is one example of a valid configuration. Each segment contains alternative:            text{KKZKKS; KKZKKS; ...; KKZKKS (29 times); S}        Each block has either 2 or 3 red beads, maintaining no red bead with neighbors of the same color. Also, every section between two green beads has at least one blue bead, and there are exactly 30 blue beads in total (1 from the fixed blue bead and 29 from each segment). Therefore, the minimum number of blue beads required is (boxed{30})."},{"instruction":"how many ways can a 1 times 2 domino tile completely cover, without any overlaps or gaps, the 2unit wide border around an 8 times 8 chessboard? (Two coverings are considered different if they appear differently as shown in the figure.)","output":"1. **First, let's establish the base cases and inductive hypothesis for covering a 2 times n rectangular strip with 1 times 2 dominoes:**    We assert that a 2 times n rectangle can be covered in F_{n+1} ways, where F_{n+1} is the (n+1)-th term in the Fibonacci sequence, defined by F_1 = 1, F_2 = 1, and F_{k+2} = F_{k+1} + F_k for k geq 1. 2. **Verification of smallest rectangles:**        - For n = 1: A 2 times 1 rectangle can only be covered by a single vertical 1 times 2 domino, which gives F_2 = 1 way.    - For n = 2: A 2 times 2 rectangle can be covered either by two vertical dominoes or two horizontal dominoes, giving F_3 = 2 ways. 3. **Inductive step:**    Assume the statement is true for all rectangles of width up to 2 times k, where k < n. We need to show it's also true for 2 times n rectangles.    Consider placing a domino in the bottom left corner of a 2 times n rectangle:        - If the domino is vertical, it covers two squares in the first column. The remaining part is a 2 times (n-1) rectangle, which can be filled in F_n ways by the induction hypothesis.        - If the domino is horizontal, another horizontal domino must be placed above it to completely cover the first two rows. The remaining part is then a 2 times (n-2) rectangle, which can be filled in F_{n-1} ways by the induction hypothesis.    Summing the two cases, we get:    [    F_{n+1} = F_n + F_{n-1}    ] 4. **Conclusion of the inductive proof:**    By the principle of mathematical induction, a 2 times n rectangle can be covered in F_{n+1} ways. 5. **Application to the given problem:**    The problem asks for the number of ways to cover an 8 times 8 chessboard border with width 2 using 1 times 2 dominoes without overlaps or gaps.    Breaking the border into manageable sections, each side of the 8 times 8 board, originally having length 8, will be modified due to domino placements at the corners. 6. **Analysis of possible configurations:**    Each side can independently be:    - 2 times 8    - 2 times 9 (by extending due to a corner domino)    - 2 times 10 (by extending further due to both corners being occupied similarly)    We must account for the fact that no two adjacent sides can both be extended to 2 times 10. 7. **Combining configurations and Fibonacci numbers:**    Count configurations respecting the corner constraints:        - Two sides being 2 times 10 and the others 2 times 8: Can be arranged in 2 ways.    - One side being 2 times 10, two sides 2 times 9, and one side 2 times 8: Can be arranged in 12 ways (by choosing side 2 times 10 in 4 ways and the 2 times 8 in 3 ways).    - All sides being 2 times 9: Can be arranged in 2 ways due to rotational symmetry.     8. **Calculate the total number of configurations using Fibonacci values:**    If n = 8, F_{9} = 34, F_{10} = 55, and F_{11} = 89:    [    2 + 2 cdot F_{11}^2 cdot F_{9}^2 + 12 cdot F_{11} cdot F_{10}^2 cdot F_{9} + 2 cdot F_{10}^4 = 2 + 2 cdot 89^2 cdot 34^2 + 12 cdot 89 cdot 55^2 cdot 34 + 2 cdot 55^4    ]    Plugging in the Fibonacci numbers:    [    = 2 + 2 cdot 7921 cdot 1156 + 12 cdot 89 cdot 3025 cdot 34 + 2 cdot 9150625     ]    [    = 2 + 2 cdot 9150625 + 912 cdot 10346 + 18301250    ]    [    = 146458404    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{146458404} ]"},{"instruction":"To understand the situation of the students in a certain class participating in physical exercise on May 27, 2023, a random sample of 5 students from the class was surveyed.

Let (M), (N), (P), and (O) be the midpoints of sides (AB), (BC), (CD), and (DA) respectively. 2.

Analyze areas:    - Given (Q) and (Q') have equal areas, this parity suggests symmetry properties.    - (E) and (F) divide the diagonals (AC) and (BD) respectively.    - If one diagonal does not divide the quadrilateral into equal areas, the other must. 9. Thus, consider:    - If a midpoint of (AC) (which is (X)) does not align symmetrically, then the symmetric considerations on surface areas of formed shapes ensure one of (AC) or (BD) must bisect one of the formed areas. 10. Symmetry and midpoint characteristics ensure:    - Either (AC) or (BD) must divide the quadrilateral (ABCD) into two equal parts. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Either AC or BD divides ABCD into two parts of equal area.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Professor Gamble decides to buy a lottery ticket where he must pick six different integers from 1 to 49.

The process involves detailed combinations of product evaluation but for simplification allows a reduction by considering only ensuring the exponents meet the necessary conditions (pairs of the same number for squares, triples of the same or different compatible numbers for cubes). 3. **Valid Combinations Count**: The complexity of combinations can be simplified by considering primary case evaluations,     - Squares example: (2^2 cdot 2^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 3^2 cdot 5^2 cdot 5^2)      - Cubes example: (2^3 cdot 3^3 cdot 3^3 cdot 7^2 cdot 7^2 cdot 5^2)      Assuming simplification and focusing on just how to form valid combinations, this could result in a limited, distinct set of valid ticket combinations due to cube-square compatibility. 4. **Probability Estimation**: If we assume an approximate distribution of valid combinations as found, and if there are such n valid combinations, the probability that Professor Gamble’s ticket is the winning one (assuming the winning ticket obeys the same rule) would be frac{1}{n}.

Since there is no constant term in the equation (i.e., it is of the form y=kx where k=2), the graph of this function passes through the origin (0,0). Additionally, because the relationship is linear and directly proportional, the graph is a straight line.

(1) The supermarket needs 430 yuan to purchase 15 kilograms of type A oranges and 20 kilograms of type B oranges, and 212 yuan to purchase 10 kilograms of type A oranges and 8 kilograms of type B oranges. Find the values of a and b.   (2) The supermarket decides to purchase a total of 100 kilograms of type A and type B oranges per day (both quantities are integers), with an investment of no less than 1160 yuan and no more than 1168 yuan. What are the possible purchasing plans for the supermarket? Which plan yields the maximum profit, and what is the maximum profit in yuan?","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Finding the Cost Prices of Type A and B Oranges Given the equations from the problem statement, we have two equations based on the cost and quantity of oranges: 1. For 15 kilograms of type A and 20 kilograms of type B oranges, the cost is 430 yuan: [15a + 20b = 430] 2. For 10 kilograms of type A and 8 kilograms of type B oranges, the cost is 212 yuan: [10a + 8b = 212] Solving these equations simultaneously, we get: - Multiplying the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of b equal: [20a + 16b = 424] - Subtracting this from the first equation to eliminate b: [(15a + 20b) - (20a + 16b) = 430 - 424] [15a - 20a + 20b - 16b = 6] [-5a + 4b = 6] - Rearranging and solving for a and b with the original equations, we find: [a = 10, quad b = 14] Thus, the cost prices of type A and B oranges are boxed{a = 10} yuan per kilogram and boxed{b = 14} yuan per kilogram, respectively.  Part 2: Finding the Possible Purchasing Plans and Maximum Profit Let x be the kilograms of type A oranges purchased, so (100-x) kilograms of type B oranges are purchased. The total investment is between 1160 yuan and 1168 yuan, leading to the inequalities: [10x + 14(100 - x) geq 1160] [10x + 14(100 - x) leq 1168] Solving these inequalities for x gives: [10x + 1400 - 14x geq 1160] [-4x geq -240] [x leq 60] And, [10x + 1400 - 14x leq 1168] [-4x leq -232] [x geq 58] Therefore, 58 leq x leq 60, meaning x can be 58, 59, or 60. The profit function, w, based on selling and cost prices is: [w = (16 - 10)x + (24 - 14)(100 - x) = 6x + 10(100 - x) = 1000 - 4x] Since w decreases as x increases, the maximum profit occurs at the minimum value of x, which is 58. Substituting x = 58 into the profit function gives: [w = 1000 - 4(58) = 1000 - 232 = 768] Therefore, the possible purchasing plans are: - Plan 1: Purchase 58 kilograms of type A oranges and 42 kilograms of type B oranges. - Plan 2: Purchase 59 kilograms of type A oranges and 41 kilograms of type B oranges. - Plan 3: Purchase 60 kilograms of type A oranges and 40 kilograms of type B oranges.

If no discount was offered and the shopkeeper earned a profit of 150%, then the selling price (SP) would be: SP = CP + Profit SP = 100 + 150% of 100 SP = 100 + 150 SP = 250 Now, let's consider the case where the shopkeeper offers a 5% discount. The selling price after the discount would be 95% of the no-discount selling price: SP with discount = 95% of 250 SP with discount = 0.95 * 250 SP with discount = 237.50 The profit earned with the 5% discount would be the selling price with the discount minus the cost price: Profit with discount = SP with discount - CP Profit with discount = 237.50 - 100 Profit with discount = 137.50 Now, to find the percentage of profit earned with the 5% discount, we use the formula: Percentage of Profit = (Profit with discount / CP) * 100% Percentage of Profit = (137.50 / 100) * 100% Percentage of Profit = 1.375 * 100% Percentage of Profit = 137.5% So, the percentage of profit earned with the 5% discount is boxed{137.5%} ."},{"instruction":"East and west are two opposite directions.

Let's denote the angle between overset{→}{a} and overset{→}{b} as θ. 3. **Calculating the Magnitude of overset{→}{b}**: The magnitude of a vector is given by the formula | overset{→}{b} | = sqrt{x^2 + (2sqrt{3})^2}. However, since the projection of overset{→}{b} in the direction of overset{→}{a} is 2, we can use the dot product to find the magnitude of overset{→}{b}. The dot product of two vectors is given by overset{→}{a} cdot overset{→}{b} = |overset{→}{a}| |overset{→}{b}| cos theta. In this case, |overset{→}{b}| cos theta = 2. Substituting the given values, we get (1 cdot x + sqrt{3} cdot 2sqrt{3}) = 2 cdot |overset{→}{b}|, which simplifies to x + 6 = 2 |overset{→}{b}|. Solving for |overset{→}{b}| gives us |overset{→}{b}| = frac{x + 6}{2}.

By choosing specific values for k, we can identify particular isoclines:    - When k = -1:            frac{y - x}{y + x} = -1            Simplifying, we get:            y - x = -(y + x)                  y - x = -y - x                  2y = 0                  y = 0            Thus, the isocline for k = -1 is y = 0.    - When k = 0:            frac{y - x}{y + x} = 0            Simplifying, we get:            y - x = 0                  y = x            Thus, the isocline for k = 0 is y = x.    - When k = 1:            frac{y - x}{y + x} = 1            Simplifying, we get:            y - x = y + x                  -x = x                  x = 0            Thus, the isocline for k = 1 is x = 0. 5. Considering the \\"inverted\\" equation:        frac{dx}{dy} = frac{y + x}{y - x}        We can see that for the isocline y = -x:        y + x = 0        Meaning:        frac{dx}{dy} rightarrow infty        The integral curves have vertical tangents at all points on this line. 6.

Note that the assertion remains invariant if we multiply ( a_{k} ) and the corresponding ( b_{k} ) by any power of two. To construct the required ( {b_{i}} ) sequence, consider scaling each ( a_{i} ) by powers of two such that all resulting numbers fall into the interval ([1, 2)).

Therefore, statement A, which suggests the parabola opens downwards, is incorrect.  **Statement B**: To determine if the graph intersects the x-axis, we look at the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation formed by setting y=0. Rewriting the equation in standard form gives us y=x^{2}-4x+1-3=x^{2}-4x-2. The discriminant Delta is calculated as Delta = (-4)^{2} - 4cdot1cdot(-2) = 16 + 8 = 24. Since Delta > 0, the graph intersects the x-axis at two points, contradicting statement B. **Statement C**: For a parabola that opens upwards, as x moves away from the vertex on either side, y increases. Given the vertex form y=left(x-2right)^{2}-3, the axis of symmetry is x=2. Therefore, when x < 2, y actually decreases as x increases, making statement C incorrect. **Statement D**: The vertex form of a parabola is given by y=a(x-h)^{2}+k, where (h,k) is the vertex. For the given function y=left(x-2right)^{2}-3, it is clear that the coordinates of the vertex are (2, -3). This matches statement D exactly.

The intersection points of circle k_b with circle k will be the foot of the height from B, denoted as B'. 3. **Identify Parallel Lines:**    Draw a parallel line through A' (the midpoint from the third vertex A to the BC side) which intersects the height line BB' at point D. This relationship ensures that the section also maintains the properties of height ratio and proportional distance from points.

Prove that the leading coefficient of the polynomial ( N_d cdot P(x) ) is an integer. 1. **Definition and Lemma:**    - A polynomial ( P(x) ) is called integral if ( P(k) ) is an integer for any integer ( k ).    - We need to prove that if polynomials ( P(x) ) and ( P'(x) ) are integral with ( deg P(x) = d ), then the leading coefficient of ( N_d cdot P(x) ) is an integer.     Lemma:    **Lemma**: Let ( P(x) ) be an integral polynomial of degree ( d ). Then all coefficients of the polynomial ( d! cdot P(x) ) are integers.    **Proof of Lemma**: Consider the polynomial    [    Q(x) = sum_{i=0}^{d} P(i) cdot frac{(x-0)(x-1) cdots (x-(i-1))(x-(i+1)) cdots (x-d)}{(i-0)(i-1) cdots (i-(i-1))(i-(i+1)) cdots (i-d)}    ]    This polynomial ( Q(x) ) has degree at most ( d ) and its values coincide with the corresponding values of ( P(x) ) at points ( x = 0, 1, 2, ldots, d ). This implies that the polynomial ( P(x) - Q(x) ) has degree at most ( d ) and has ( d+1 ) roots, therefore, it is zero, i.e., ( P(x) = Q(x) ). (The above formula is a particular case of the Lagrange interpolation formula.)    Notice that in the formula above, in the ( i )-th term, the denominator is equal to ( (-1)^{d-i} i!(d-i)! ), which is a divisor of ( d! ) since:    [    frac{d!}{i!(d-i)!} = C_{d}^{i}    ]    Therefore, when multiplying each term by ( d! ), we get a polynomial with integral coefficients. 2. **Inductive Step for Proof:**    - We use induction on ( d ).    - **Base case:** For ( d=0 ), the statement is trivially true as ( P(x) ) is a constant polynomial and ( N_0 = 1 ).    - **Inductive step:** Assume the result holds for all bi-integer polynomials of degree ( d-1 ). Consider a bi-integer polynomial ( P(x) ) of degree ( d ) with leading coefficient ( a ).    - If ( d ) is not a prime number, then ( N_d = d cdot N_{d-1} ). Notice that the polynomial ( Delta P(x) = P(x+1) - P(x) ) is also a bi-integer polynomial of degree ( d-1 ) with leading coefficient ( a cdot d ). By the induction hypothesis, ( N_{d-1} cdot a cdot d ) is an integer, which implies ( N_d cdot a ) is an integer, as required.    - If ( d ) is a prime number, then ( N_d = N_{d-1} ). Assume ( N_d cdot a ) is not an integer. This implies that the denominator of ( a ) (in its reduced form) is divisible by ( d ). Consider the polynomial:    [    Q(x) = N_d cdot P(x) - N_d cdot a cdot (x-1)(x-2) cdots (x-d)    ]    Note that ( Q(x) ) has integer values at integer points, meaning ( Q(x) ) is integral and its degree is less than ( d ). By the lemma, the polynomial ( N_d cdot P'(d) ) is an integer. Parametrize ( N_d cdot P'(d) ) as follows:    [    c = Q'(d) + frac{t}{d} cdot (d-1)(d-2) cdots (d-(d-1))    ]    The first term is a fraction whose denominator is not divisible by ( d ), and the second term divides ( d ).

Since 3000 is a multiple of 1000, we can use the factors of 1000:    The factors of 1000 exist in two groups:    - Multiples of 3 remain less than 1000 (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500 remain after multiplying by 3 except 500)    - Multiples of 3000 itself.        Taking factors of 1000 that are not multiplicative with 3:    [    (1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500)     ]    Factors less than 1000 multiplying by 3, thus 14 extra (not including 500 already counted up). Hence there are (15 + 14 = 29). **Case 4: The leading digit is 4** 1. We need to find integers of the form (4000 + n) where (1 leq n leq 999). 2.

Thus, (n) must be a positive factor of 4000 that is less than 1000. The prime factorization of 4000 is (2^5 times 5^3). Calculating the factors: - Powers of 2 less than 1000: (2^5 = (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32)).

What is this percentage?","output":"To find the percentage probability of the quarterback completing at least one pass after throwing the ball twice, we can use the complement rule. The complement rule states that the probability of an event happening at least once is equal to 1 minus the probability of it not happening at all. Let's denote the probability of a completed pass as P(completed) and the probability of an incomplete pass as P(incomplete). We know that P(completed) = 3/10, so P(incomplete) = 1 - P(completed) = 1 - 3/10 = 7/10. If the quarterback throws the ball twice, the probability of both throws being incomplete is P(incomplete)^2 = (7/10)^2 = 49/100. Therefore, the probability of getting at least one completed pass in two throws is 1 - P(both incomplete) = 1 - 49/100 = 51/100.

Therefore, set B can be written as B={x|xleqslant -1 text{ or } xgeqslant 1}. **Step 3: Find the Intersection of Sets A and B** The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted as Acap B, is the set that contains all elements that are common to both A and B. Looking at the elements of set A and the ranges of set B, we can see that the elements -1 and 3 are present in both sets.

According to a geometric property, the three points of intersection (distinct from (O)) of these three circles are the vertices of a triangle whose circumcircle has radius (r) and whose orthocenter is (O).    - Use the property that the triangle formed by the centers (O_1, O_2, O_3) of these circles and the medial lines of (triangle O_1 O_2 O_3) correspond to the main construction properties required. 2. **Using the above theorem:**    - Given points (A), (B), and (C), we need to determine point (D) such that (ABCD) forms a parallelogram. 3. **Drawing Circles:**    - Draw two circles of radius (r) centered at (A) and (B) respectively. These circles will intersect at points (M) and (N).    - Draw another circle of the same radius (r) centered at (B) passing through (C). Let the intersections with previous circles be (E) and (F). 4. **Locate Intermediate Vertices:**    - The points (E) and (F) where the circles intersect will help in locating the fourth vertex (D).    - Draw a circle centered at (C) with radius (r) that passes through (E).    - Similarly, draw another circle centered at (C) with radius (r) passing through (F). 5. **Intersection for Fourth Vertex:**    - The two circles centered at (C) will intersect at points and mark one of these intersections as (D).  Verification: Verify that: 1. The points (A), (E), (F), and (D) lie on a single circle (center (O_2)). 2. Given (AB perp EF) and (CD perp EF) as well as (AB = CD = O_1 O_2), the configuration confirms (D) as the needed vertex. Using this method with five circles, the final vertex (D) of the parallelogram (ABCD) can be constructed accurately without directly measuring angles or lengths. # Conclusion: The fourth vertex (D) of the parallelogram (ABCD) can be found by intersecting circles as described.

We can find the maximum value m by evaluating f(x) at x = 1:  m = f(1) = - (1 - 1)^2 + 1 + a = 1 + a  For the minimum value n, we need to consider the values of f(x) at the endpoints of the interval [0, 3], since the vertex of the parabola (x=1) is included in this interval, and we have already determined the value at the vertex is the maximum.

This plane will be used as the base for our construction. 2. **Formation of eight triangles**: On the plane alpha, we arrange eight equilateral triangles. These triangles will serve as the bases of the eight pyramids we need to construct.     - Four of these triangles are marked with black lines.    - The other four triangles are marked with red lines. 3. **Construct pyramids on black-lined triangles**: Define a common vertex above the plane alpha. This point will be the apex of the four pyramids with bases being the triangles marked with black lines. Let's denote this apex as P_{above}.  4. **Construct pyramids on red-lined triangles**: Define another common vertex below the plane alpha. This apex will be shared by the four pyramids with bases being the triangles marked with red lines. Let's denote this apex as P_{below}. 5. **Touching properties**: By this arrangement:    - The black-based pyramids will touch each other by their faces at P_{above}.    - The red-based pyramids will also touch each other by their faces at P_{below}.    - Each black-lined triangle shares a side with a red-lined triangle on the same plane alpha. Thus, the respective pyramids based on these triangles will touch each other by a polygonal face formed by the shared edges of the triangles. 6. **Verification of face-touching among all**:    - By having the triangles share sides in the plane alpha, the black pyramids and red pyramids will each share one common triangle with their immediate neighbors.    - This ensures the fulfillment of the condition that each pair of pyramids touches each other by a face, accounting for all eight pyramids in the configuration.

This implies ( 2^alpha mid X^2 + (Y-1)(Y+1) ). Since ( Y equiv 1 pmod{2^alpha} ), we have ( Y-1 equiv 0 pmod{2^alpha} ) and ( Y+1 equiv 2 pmod{2^alpha} ).

Several people observed him during his journey: each stayed exactly one hour and noted that Léo moved exactly one meter. At any moment during the day, there was at least one observer. What is the greatest distance that Léo could have traveled?","output":"1. **Define observatory period**: Let us denote the time interval during which Léo the snail is observed by any observer as 8 AM to 6 PM. This total time duration is 10 hours.    2. **Analyzing the overlapping observers**: The problem specifies that several people observed Léo and each observer stayed for exactly one hour and noticed that Léo moved one meter during that hour. We need to calculate the maximum possible distance Léo could have traveled under these conditions, keeping in mind there must always be at least one observer present at any given moment. 3. **Maximizing the distance**: To maximize the distance, let us consider the implication of having multiple observers. If three observers, o_1, o_2, and o_3, are present at the same moment, then considering their arrival hours h_1 < h_2 < h_3, observer o_2 does not contribute additional unobstructed distance for Léo since o_2 overlaps with o_3. Therefore, we can formulate it such that:     - Fewer overlaps provide a higher independent mileage for Léo.     - Supposing there are two overlapping observers, o_1 arriving at h_1 and o_2 at h_2, with h_1 < h_2 < h_1 + 1. Léo can move independently:       [       1 text{ meter from } h_1 text{ to } h_2, text{ another } 1 text{ meter from } h_1 + 1 text{ to } h_2 + 1.       ]     - Thus, Léo travels a maximum of 2 meters within the period of h_1 to h_2 + 1. 4. **Optimizing observer distribution**: Based on the calculated maximum observable distance, let us now consider a more efficient observer distribution.     - Introducing small intervals where observers could be replaced such that the observer o_1 arriving at hour h_1 is replaced by o_3 (arrival h_3) and o_4 (arrival h_4) such that:       [       o_3 text{ arrives at } h_2 + epsilon, quad o_4 text{ arrives at } h_2 + 1 + epsilon text{ where } epsilon = frac{h_3 - h_2 - 1}{2}.       ] 5. **Calculating revised distance travel**:     - Substituting o_1 with o_3, o_4, Léo is effectively observed during:       [       1 text{ meter from } h_2 text{ to } h_3, quad 1 text{ meter between } h_2 + 1 text{ to } h_4, quad 1 text{ meter between } h_4 text{ to } h_3, quad 1 text{ meter between } h_4 + 1 text{ to } h_3 + 1.       ]     - This yields a comprehensive distance of 4 meters within the interval h_2, h_3 + 1. 6. **Combining all non-overlapping periods**:     - Ensuring there are no more than two observers at any time and considering each observer viewing Léo exclusively over their hour maximizes the traveled distance.     - For 10 hours, if no overlaps are generated, and each 1-hour interval observer is replaced for better optimization, Léo can travel 2 meters for each replacement period overlapping half-hours included. 7. **Summarizing distance calculation**:     - If 9 extended periods of slightly over 1 hour are arranged to accommodate travel, the maximum distance reached is:       [       2 + 2 cdot 8 = 18 text{ meters}.       ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{18 text{ meters}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given two sets A={3,log_{2}a} and B={a,b}.

Since 2 is the common element in sets A and B, we deduce that b must also be 2 to satisfy A cap B = {2}. Therefore, the set B will contain the numbers 4 and 2.  Hence, the set B is B = {4, 2}.

This problem explores inductive reasoning and computation, making it rather challenging. To begin, we can try listing the first few terms of the sequence:  a_1 = -1,  a_2 > a_1 implies that a_2 = -1 + |a_{2}-a_1| = -1 + 2^1 = 1.  For a_3, since {a_{2n-1}} is decreasing, we must have a_3 < a_1. Thus: a_3 = a_2 - |a_{3}-a_2| = 1 - 2^2 = -3.  Similarly, for a_4, since {a_{2n}} is increasing, we have a_4 > a_2. Thus: a_4 = a_3 + |a_{4}-a_3| = -3 + 2^3 = 5.  Continuing this pattern, we notice that for each odd-index term, the sequence decreases and each even-index term, the sequence increases. The difference between consecutive terms is thus given by: a_{n+1} - a_n = (-1)^{n+1} cdot 2^n. Next, we'll use \\"accumulated summation\\" to find the general term.

(1 in S), and for any (x, y in S), we have (x + y, xy in S). 2. There exists a subset (P) of (S) such that every element in (S setminus {1}) can be uniquely represented as the product of some elements in (P) (with multiplication allowed to be repeated but order irrelevant). 1. Consider the set (S = {f(pi) mid f text{ is a polynomial with integer coefficients and } f(x) > 0 text{ for any } x > 0}). 2. We first verify that this set (S) satisfies condition (1):    - Clearly, since the constant polynomial (f(x) = 1) is positive for all (x), we have (1 in S).        - If (f(x)) and (g(x)) are two polynomials that are positive for all (x > 0), then their sum (f(x) + g(x)) and product (f(x) g(x)) are also polynomials that are positive for all (x > 0). Therefore, (f(pi) + g(pi) in S) and (f(pi) g(pi) in S). 3. Next, we verify that (S) satisfies condition (2):    - Let (P) be the set of polynomials in (mathbb{Z}[x]) such that each polynomial is irreducible (cannot be factored further into non-constant polynomials with integer coefficients) and positive for all (x > 0).    - Consider any element (f(pi) in S). By polynomial factorization, we can write (f) as a product of irreducible polynomials (f = f_1 f_2 cdots f_n) where each (f_i) is irreducible.    - It follows that (f(pi) = f_1(pi) f_2(pi) cdots f_n(pi)) where each (f_i(pi) in P) since each (f_i) is a member of (P).    - To show uniqueness, suppose there are two factorizations (f(pi) = f_1(pi) f_2(pi) cdots f_n(pi)) and (f(pi) = g_1(pi) g_2(pi) cdots g_m(pi)).      Since (f_1 f_2 cdots f_n - g_1 g_2 cdots g_m) has (pi) as a root, and (pi) is transcendental (not algebraic), it must be that (f_1 f_2 cdots f_n = g_1 g_2 cdots g_m). By the factorization uniqueness theorem in (mathbb{Z}[x]), ({g_1, g_2, ldots, g_m}) is just a rearrangement of ({f_1, f_2, ldots, f_n}).    Therefore, such (P) guarantees that each element in (S setminus {1}) has a unique factorization into elements of (P), satisfying condition (2). 4. Finally, note that since the polynomial (f(x) = x) is positive for (x > 0), then (pi in S). Thus, (S) contains (pi), which is not an integer.

Being more explicit:    - If ( a equiv 1  (text{mod} 5) ), then ( a^2 equiv 1^2 equiv 1  (text{mod} 5) ).    - If ( a equiv 2  (text{mod} 5) ), then ( a^2 equiv 2^2 equiv 4  (text{mod} 5) ).    - If ( a equiv 3  (text{mod} 5) ), then ( a^2 equiv 3^2 equiv 9 equiv 4  (text{mod} 5) ).    - If ( a equiv 4  (text{mod} 5) ), then ( a^2 equiv 4^2 equiv 16 equiv 1  (text{mod} 5) ).

In any such orientation, there must be at least one vertex ( v_i ) that has no incoming edges (i.e., it is a source). This is because if every vertex had an incoming edge, there would be a cycle, contradicting the acyclic property.    For each vertex ( v_i ), let ( f_i(G) ) denote the number of acyclic orientations of ( G ) where ( v_i ) is a source. Clearly,     [    f(G) = sum_{i=1}^n f_i(G)    ]    Now, consider the graph ( G - v_i ). Any acyclic orientation of ( G - v_i ) can be extended to an acyclic orientation of ( G ) by adding ( v_i ) as a source. Therefore,     [    f_i(G) leq f(G - v_i)    ]    Summing over all vertices ( v_i ), we get:    [    f(G) = sum_{i=1}^n f_i(G) leq sum_{i=1}^n f(G - v_i)    ]    This completes the proof for part (a). # Part (b) 1. **Statement of the Problem:**    Let ( e ) be an edge of the graph ( G ). Denote by ( G' ) the graph obtained by omitting ( e ) and merging its two endpoints into one vertex. We need to prove that:    [    f(G) = f(G - e) + f(G')    ] 2. **Proof:**    Consider an acyclic orientation of ( G ). There are two cases to consider:    - The edge ( e ) is not part of any cycle in ( G ).    - The edge ( e ) is part of a cycle in ( G ).    For the first case, removing ( e ) from ( G ) does not affect the acyclic property of the remaining graph. Thus, the number of acyclic orientations of ( G ) where ( e ) is not part of any cycle is ( f(G - e) ).    For the second case, if ( e ) is part of a cycle, then contracting ( e ) into a single vertex in ( G ) results in a graph ( G' ). The number of acyclic orientations of ( G ) where ( e ) is part of a cycle is ( f(G') ).    Therefore, the total number of acyclic orientations of ( G ) is the sum of the acyclic orientations where ( e ) is not part of any cycle and where ( e ) is part of a cycle:    [    f(G) = f(G - e) + f(G')    ]    This completes the proof for part (b). # Part (c) 1. **Statement of the Problem:**    We need to prove that for each ( alpha > 1 ), there exists a graph ( G ) and an edge ( e ) such that:    [    frac{f(G)}{f(G - e)} < alpha    ] 2. **Proof:**    Consider the following graph ( G ) on ( n + 2 ) vertices: take two vertices ( v_x ) and ( v_y ) and join them by an edge ( e ). Then for ( 1 leq i leq n ), draw exactly two edges from ( v_i ), one to ( v_x ) and one to ( v_y ). We take ( e = v_xv_y ).    We want:    [    frac{f(G)}{f(G - e)} = frac{f(G - e) + f(G')}{f(G - e)} = 1 + frac{f(G')}{f(G - e)}    ]    to get arbitrarily close to 1. We established above that ( f(G') ) represents the number of acyclic orientations of ( E - e ) for which any orientation of ( e ) keeps the graph cycle-free. For our ( G ), this is clearly ( 2^n ); if for any vertex ( v ne v_x, v_y ) the edges ( vv_x ) and ( vv_y ) pointed in opposite directions, we could orient ( v_xv_y ) in such a way that ( vv_xv_y ) would be a cycle.    On the other hand, ( f(G - e) ) represents the total number of acyclic orientations of ( E - e ). We claim this equals ( 2 cdot 3^n - 2^n ). For each of the two possible orientations of ( e ), the number of acyclic orientations of ( E - e ) for which the chosen orientation of ( e ) keeps the graph cycle-free is ( 3^n ), since we can orient the pair of edges ( vv_x, vv_y ) in all but one way (the way which would make ( vv_xv_y ) a cycle). It is easy to see that this is both necessary and sufficient for ( G ) to be acyclic. However, we have overcounted those orientations of ( E - e ) for which either orientation of ( e ) will keep the graph cycle-free; we just established that this number is ( 2^n ). Then:    [    frac{f(G)}{f(G - e)} = 1 + frac{2^n}{2 cdot 3^n - 2^n}    ]    For ( n ) sufficiently large, the second term gets as close to 0 as we like, so for all ( alpha > 1 ) such a graph exists.

The sum (S) of the first (n+1) terms of a geometric series is given by:    [    S = a frac{1-r^{n+1}}{1-r}    ]    Plugging in our values (a = frac{1}{5}), (r = 4), and (n = 2019), we get:    [    S = frac{1}{5} frac{1-4^{2020}}{1-4} = frac{1}{5} frac{1-4^{2020}}{-3} = -frac{1-4^{2020}}{15} = frac{4^{2020} - 1}{15}    ]    This gives us:    [    sum_{k=0}^{2019} frac{4^k}{5} = frac{4^{2020} - 1}{15}    ] 3. **Applying the Floor Function:**    Applying the property of the floor function and pairing terms:    [    left[frac{4^k}{5}right] + left[frac{4^{k+1}}{5}right] = 4^k - 1 text{ because } frac{4^k}{5} + frac{4^{k+1}}{5} = frac{4^k}{5} + frac{4 cdot 4^k}{5} = frac{5 cdot 4^k}{5} = 4^k    ]    Therefore, rearranging and summing over (k) from 0 to 2019:    [    sum_{k=0}^{2019}left[frac{4^k}{5}right] + sum_{k=0}^{2019}left[frac{4^{k+1}}{5}right] = sum_{k=0}^{2019} (4^k - 1)    ]    Observe that the sequence (left[frac{4^{2019}}{5}right]) term appears once more than others, hence:    [    sum_{k=0}^{2019}left[frac{4^k}{5}right] = frac{4^{2020}-1}{15} - left(sum_{k=1}^{2019} 1 right)    ] 4. **Subtracting the Additional Sums:**    The extra sums represent the total subtraction of integers less than or equal to each term.

Suppose there exists an odd integer ( n ) such that for all integers ( x, y, z ) with ( x + y + z = 0 ), the expression (frac{x^n + y^n + z^n}{2}) is a perfect square.     Let's choose ( x = 2 ), ( y = -1 ), and ( z = -1 ). Then we have:    [    x + y + z = 2 + (-1) + (-1) = 0    ]    Substituting these values into the expression, we get:    [    frac{2^n + (-1)^n + (-1)^n}{2} = k^2    ]    Simplifying, we obtain:    [    frac{2^n + 2(-1)^n}{2} = k^2    ]    [    2^{n-1} + (-1)^n = k^2    ]    Since ( n ) is odd, we can write ( n = 2i + 1 ) for some nonnegative integer ( i ). Thus, we have:    [    2^{(2i+1)-1} + (-1)^{2i+1} = 2^{2i} - 1 = (2^i)^2 - 1 = k^2    ]    However, for ( i > 0 ), there is no solution because perfect squares other than 0 and 1 differ by more than 1. Therefore, the only possible solution for ( i = 0 ) is ( n = 1 ). Hence, for odd ( n ), ( n = 1 ) is the only solution. 2. **Case 2: ( n ) is even**    Now, consider the case where ( n = 2i ) is even. We need to show that for integers ( x, y, z ) with ( x + y + z = 0 ), the expression (frac{x^4 + y^4 + z^4}{2}) is always a perfect square.    Given ( x + y + z = 0 ), we can write ( z = -x - y ). Substituting this into the expression, we get:    [    frac{x^4 + y^4 + (-x-y)^4}{2}    ]    Expanding ((-x-y)^4), we have:    [    (-x-y)^4 = (x+y)^4 = x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{x^4 + y^4 + (x+y)^4}{2} = frac{x^4 + y^4 + x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + y^4}{2}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{2x^4 + 4x^3y + 6x^2y^2 + 4xy^3 + 2y^4}{2} = x^4 + 2x^3y + 3x^2y^2 + 2xy^3 + y^4    ]    Notice that:    [    x^4 + 2x^3y + 3x^2y^2 + 2xy^3 + y^4 = (x^2 + xy + y^2)^2    ]    which is a perfect square since ( x^2 + xy + y^2 ) is an integer. Therefore, ( n = 4 ) is a solution. 3. **Uniqueness of ( n = 4 ) for even ( n )**    We now prove that ( n = 4 ) is the only solution for even ( n ). Consider ( (x, y, z) = (2, 2, -4) ). We need to show that:    [    frac{2^{2i} + 2^{2i} + 4^{2i}}{2} = frac{4^i + 4^i + 16^i}{2} = k^2    ]    has a unique integer solution ( i = 2 ). Rewriting, we get:    [    2k^2 = 2(4^i) + 4^i(4^i) = 4^i(2 + 4^i)    ]    [    k^2 = 4^i left(1 + frac{4^i}{2}right)    ]    Since ( 4^i ) is a perfect square, we must have:    [    1 + frac{4^i}{2}    ]    be a perfect square ( c^2 ). Thus:    [    c^2 = 1 + frac{4^i}{2}    ]    [    c^2 - 1 = (c+1)(c-1) = frac{4^i}{2} = frac{2^{2i}}{2} = 2^{2i-1}    ]    Notice that ( c+1 ) and ( c-1 ) are positive integers differing by 2, and their product is a perfect power of 2. The only powers of 2 that differ by 2 are ( 2^1 ) and ( 2^2 ). Therefore, there is a unique solution ( c = 3 ), and from there, we get the unique solution ( i = 2 ), and ( n = 4 ). We conclude that if ( n ) is odd, ( n = 1 ) is the only solution, and if ( n ) is even, ( n = 4 ) is the only solution.

Applying the given bounds: [ |x| + |y| < frac{varepsilon}{2} + frac{varepsilon}{2} = varepsilon ] Thus, [ |f(x, y)| < varepsilon ] 5. Hence, we conclude that for any (varepsilon > 0), there exists a (delta > 0) (specifically (delta = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} varepsilon)) such that for all ((x, y)) with (sqrt{x^2 + y^2} < delta), ( |f(x, y)| < varepsilon ). 6.

Over 5 days, this amounts to: 175 sheets/day * 5 days/week = 875 sheets of single-sided paper per week per class. Each class also uses 75 sheets of double-sided paper per day.

Hence, x_j > x_i.    - If a_j < a_i, then the longest decreasing subsequence starting at a_j must be longer than that starting at a_i. Hence, y_j > y_i.    Given that i < j and a_i, a_j are distinct (because they are part of the sequence {1, 2, 3, ldots, 101}), either a_j > a_i or a_j < a_i must occur, contradicting x_i = x_j or y_i = y_j. 6. **Conclusion**:    Thus, the assumption that x_k leq 10 and y_k leq 10 for all k must be false.

Therefore, the relative speed (Vr) when they cross each other is: Vr = V1 + V2 = 12 meters/second + 6 meters/second = 18 meters/second The total distance to be covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths, which is: Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 120 meters + 120 meters = 240 meters Now, we can calculate the time (T) it takes for them to cross each other using the formula: Time = Distance / Relative Speed T = Total distance / Vr T = 240 meters / 18 meters/second T = 13.33 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{13.33}  seconds for the two bullet trains to cross each other when traveling in opposite directions."},{"instruction":"Use the method of contradiction to prove: When 9 balls are each painted either red or white, no matter how they are painted, there will be at least 5 balls of the same color.

Since the cube has 6 faces, after at most 6 moves, Anton will see one face again. Hence, there is a number (a leq 6), such that the movement of the cube repeats every (a) moves. This is because the cube can only have 6 different top faces, and after 6 moves, one of these faces must repeat. 2. **Case Analysis:**    We will consider three cases based on the direction of the (a^{text{th}}) move relative to the first move.    - **Case 1: The (a^{text{th}}) move is going south.**      - If the first move is north, and the (a^{text{th}}) move is south, then after (2a) moves, the cube returns to its starting position.       - Therefore, the set of squares the cube touches is at most (2a leq 12), which is less than 25. This is a contradiction because the cube cannot cover all 25 squares of the (5 times 5) area.    - **Case 2: The (a^{text{th}}) move is going east or west.**      - If the first move is north, and the (a^{text{th}}) move is east or west, then after (4a) moves, the cube returns to its starting position.      - Therefore, the set of squares the cube touches is at most (4a leq 24), which is less than 25. This is a contradiction because the cube cannot cover all 25 squares of the (5 times 5) area.    - **Case 3: The (a^{text{th}}) move is going north.**      - If the first move is north, and the (a^{text{th}}) move is also north, then the cube will always move north at the (ka^{text{th}}) move ((k in mathbb{N})).      - Let ((a,b)) be the coordinates of the starting square and ((a+p, b+q)) be the coordinates after (k) moves. It is obvious that (|p| + |q| leq 6) because the cube can only move a maximum of 6 steps in any direction.      - The (ka^{text{th}}) move will always place the cube on ((a+kp, b+kq)). Now, notice that the cube cannot touch all 4 corner squares of the (5 times 5) square because it is constrained by the maximum distance it can travel, which is 6 steps. This is a contradiction because the cube cannot cover all 25 squares of the (5 times 5) area. 3. **Conclusion:**    Since all three cases lead to a contradiction, we conclude that the cube cannot cover any (5 times 5) square on the infinite chessboard.

The solution involves defining a concept called disorder and proving specific properties about it. Here is the detailed step-by-step breakdown of the solution:  Step 1: Define Disorder First, define the disorder of a permutation. The disorder is the number of pairs (i, j) such that (1 leq i < j leq n) but i occurs after j in the permutation. These pairs are referred to as out-of-order pairs.  Step 2: Types of Moves and Disorder Invariance Note that the given moves ensure that disorder is invariant under those moves since these moves only alter the relative positions of the three involved elements.  Step 3: Initial Consideration of (1, n) Pair Consider the pair (1, n). Moves cannot change the relative order of this pair because neither 1 nor n can be the median of the three selected elements; hence, disorder with respect to (1, n) remains unchanged.  Step 4: Establish Lower Bound on Number of Sets To establish a lower bound, observe that to break a permutation into disjoint sets, any two elements of a set need to be reachable from each other by allowed moves while preserving the disorder and the (1, n) pair constraint. This requires at least (2 binom{n-1}{2} + 2) sets, corresponding to permutations maintaining distinct disorders and the order of the (1, n) pair.  Step 5: Disorder Reachability Lemma **Lemma 1:** - _There exists a permutation with disorder (d) for any (0 leq d leq binom{n}{2})._ **Proof:** - Start with the identity permutation (disorder 0), then perform adjacent swaps to transition to any state up to full reverse permutation (maximum disorder (binom{n}{2})) with each swap increasing disorder by exactly 1.  Step 6: Generate (binom{n-1}{2} + 1) Distinct Permutations Construct (binom{n-1}{2} + 1) permutations of (2, 3, ldots, n) each with a unique disorder from 0 to (binom{n-1}{2}). Prepending 1 to these permutations ensures distinct disorders, and their reverses yield another unique set of disorders ranging from ( n-1 ) to ( binom{n}{2} ).  Step 7: Upper Bound Construction Construct an upper bound by categorizing permutations into sets based on disorder and the order of the (1, n) pair. If (1, n) is in order, disorder ranges from 0 to (binom{n-1}{2}). If out of order, disorder ranges from (n-1) to (binom{n}{2}).  Step 8: Lemma for ( n ) Adjacent Algorithm **Lemma 2:** - _A sequence of moves can transform a permutation to have ( n ) at either the start or the end_. **Proof:** - Through an iterative process using lexicographic ordering, move adjacent elements so that ( n ) is eventually positioned at either extremity.  Step 9: Inductive Argument for Permutations of ( n - 1 ) Apply induction: - For ( n leq 4 ), verify directly. - For general ( n ), suppose permutations with the same disorder and order of (1, n-1) can be aligned by sequences of moves:   - Use Lemma 2 to reduce the problem to ( n-1 ) elements and apply induction.   - Resolve any discrepancy by specific sequences ensuring consistent disorder while preserving (1, n-1) order. # Conclusion: By combining these steps, we know that any two permutations with the same disorder and the order of (1, n) can be transformed into each other through permissible moves.

Let us begin by manipulating the equation (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2). 3. Consider starting with the expression:    [    x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2    ] 4. Add and subtract (2x(x - z)) within the right-hand side, then rewrite:    [    x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + t^2 + 2x(x + y) - 2x(z + t)    ] 5.

It is a basic question that requires computational and problem-solving skills. There are two cases: (1) If (1,1) is the point of tangency, we calculate the derivative of the function f(x) at x=1 to find the slope of the tangent line, and then use the point-slope form to write the equation of the tangent line. (2) If (1,1) is not the point of tangency, we assume the coordinates of the point of tangency, substitute the assumed x-coordinate into the derivative function to represent the slope of the tangent line, write the equation of the tangent line using the assumed coordinates and the slope, substitute the coordinates of the original point into the tangent line equation to simplify and find the x-coordinate of the point of tangency, substitute the x-coordinate into the curve equation to find the y-coordinate of the point of tangency, and thus obtain the slope of the tangent line. Finally, write the equation of the tangent line using the slope and the coordinates of the point of tangency. **Solution** (1) If (1,1) is the point of tangency, the slope of the tangent line is given by k=3times1^{2}=3. Hence, the equation of the tangent line in point-slope form is y-1=3(x-1), which simplifies to boxed{3x-y-2=0}. (2) If (1,1) is not the point of tangency, let P(x_{0},x_{0}^{3}) be the point of tangency.

The number with the digits reversed is overline{yx}, which can be expressed as 10y + x. 3. According to the problem, when the number 10x + y is divided by 10y + x, the quotient and the remainder are equal. Let r represent both the quotient and the remainder. We write the equation as follows:    [    10x + y = (10y + x)r + r    ] 4. Simplifying the above equation, we get:    [    10x + y = r(10y + x + 1)    ] 5. We need to find values of x and y such that 1 leqslant r < 10. Let's consider different values for r.  Case r = 1: 6. When r = 1, the equation becomes:    [    10x + y = (10y + x) + 1    ]    Simplifying this equation, we get:    [    10x + y = 10y + x + 1 implies 9x - 9y = 1 implies x - y = frac{1}{9}    ]    Since x and y are integers, frac{1}{9} is not an integer. Thus, there is no solution for r = 1.  Case r = 2: 7. When r = 2, the equation becomes:    [    10x + y = 2(10y + x + 1)    ]    Simplifying this equation, we get:    [    10x + y = 20y + 2x + 2 implies 8x = 19y + 2 implies 8x = 16y + 3y + 2    ]    Here, 3y + 2 must be divisible by 8.

Substituting y back into the equation 8x = 19y + 2, we get:    [    8x = 19 cdot 2 + 2 implies 8x = 40 implies x = 5    ]    Therefore, the number is 52.  Case r = 3: 8.

We will approach this problem in a structured way:  Step 1: Setting up the auxiliary grid 1. **Assign Grid Units**: Let each cell on the checkerboard have sides of length 1. 2. **Mark Centers**: Mark the center of the starting cell and the centers of all cells that the rook can reach. 3. **Draw Parallel Lines**: Draw blue lines parallel to the grid lines through these centers. This results in an auxiliary blue grid divided into cells of side length n.  Step 2: Establishing Properties of the Auxiliary Polygon 4. **Polygon Representation**: When the rook moves from cell A to cell B, connect the centers of these cells with segments. These segments form a closed polygon whose vertices lie on the auxiliary blue grid. 5. **Area Calculation**: The area of this polygon is a multiple of n^2 (let's denote it as A = a cdot n^2), and its perimeter is a multiple of 2n since the moves are exactly n cells either vertically or horizontally.  Step 3: Evaluating Areas with respect to White and Black Cells 6. **Black Cell Overlay**: If we trace the rook’s path making n-sized steps, black strips will form around the white area inside.    - At each right angle interior vertex (90^circ), black strips overlap by one quarter cell.    - At each 270^circ angle (giving a concave decomposition), a quarter of a cell inside the polygon does not get covered by the black strip. 7. **Counting Vertices**: For every complete traversal, the net balance of 90^circ and 270^circ vertices will ensure the accurate bounding of the area remnants in the grid.  Proof using Induction (Alternative Approach): 8. **Induction Base Case**: For n=2, forming a minimum perimeter square (i.e., 4(n+1) = 12 for n=2), the white cells inside is (n-1)^2 = 1, yielding a remainder of 1. 9. **Inductive Hypothesis**: Assume the result holds for rook paths forming a polygon with perimeter P > 4(n+1). Let's examine the periphery and simplify by interpreting multiple intervals of rook paths which all stay within similar containing properties. 10. **Simplification**: If minimal intervals exist between a set of boundary vertices, and they truncate back within a smaller grid multiple, the encompassing area (both black framed and internal) conforms to the modulo structure. 11. **Conclusion of White Area Count**: The overall nested structure, through several dissected paths returning to base forming smaller valid outlines, ensures our induction ensures each decrement stays evaluatively within bounds, reaffirming the total number of interior white cells modulo n.

For the condition p to be true, the quadratic x^2 + mx + 1 = 0 must have two distinct negative roots. This means that both the discriminant must be greater than zero, and the sum and product of roots (given by Vieta's formulas) must be negative. The discriminant D of x^2 + mx + 1 = 0 is m^2 - 4(1)cdot(1) = m^2 - 4. For two distinct roots, D > 0: m^2 - 4 > 0, m^2 > 4, m > 2 quad text{or} quad m < -2.  However, we need both roots to be negative. The sum of the roots is given by -frac{b}{a} = -frac{m}{1} = -m, and the product of the roots is frac{c}{a} = frac{1}{1} = 1. For both roots to be negative, the sum must also be positive (-m > 0), which implies m < 0. This is contradictory to m > 2. Therefore, we only consider m < -2. Next, we consider condition q. For q to be false (for the equation 4x^2 + 4(m - 2)x + 1 = 0 to have real roots), the discriminant D must be non-negative: D = [4(m-2)]^2 - 4(4)(1) = 16m^2 - 64m + 64 - 16 geq 0, 16m^2 - 64m + 48 geq 0.

Since p and q cannot both be true, we must exclude the intersection of the ranges where both p and q are true. From p, we had m < -2, which does not overlap with any true values from q.

Our given conditions are:    - If (A) reports to (B) and (B) reports to (C), then (C) reports to (A).    - No administrator reports to themselves.     2. **Graph Representation**:    - Represent the administrators as a graph (G) where each vertex represents an administrator, and there is an edge between (A) and (B) if one reports to the other (either (A) reports to (B) or (B) reports to (A)).        - Assume initially that the graph is connected, meaning any two vertices have a path between them. 3. **Walk and Cycles in the Graph**:    - Assign weights to edges based on the direction of reporting: (A rightarrow B) is assigned (+1) and (B rightarrow A) is assigned (-1).    - Define the \\"value\\" of a walk as the sum of these weights. 4. **Cycle Value**:    - We claim that for any cycle in the graph, its value (sum of weights) must be divisible by 3:      - Suppose a counterexample exists with the minimum number of edges and value (v) not divisible by 3.      - If any two consecutive weights in the cycle are both (+1) (say from (A) to (B) and (B) to (C)), it implies (A) reports to (B), (B) to (C), and hence (C) to (A). This replaces the sequence (A rightarrow B rightarrow C) by (A rightarrow C) with a weight of (-1), reducing the cycle and contradicting the minimal counterexample.      - Similarly, two consecutive (-1) weights are handled, leading to similar contradictions.          - Therefore, weights in any minimal cycle alternate between (+1) and (-1), effectively making every cycle sum to 0, divisible by 3. 5. **Vertex Value Assignment**:    - Fix a starting vertex (P). For any vertex (Q), define its \\"value\\" as the remainder of the sum of weights of a walk from (P) to (Q) modulo 3. This is possible since any walk from (P) to (Q) differing value by a cycle would still be congruent to 0 modulo 3. 6. **Group Formation**:    - Define (X) as the set of vertices with value 0, (Y) with value 1, and (Z) with value 2.    - For every edge (A rightarrow B) meaning (A) reports to (B), the value relationship ensures:      - If (A in X), then (B in Y).      - If (A in Y), then (B in Z).      - If (A in Z), then (B in X). 7. **Disconnected Graph Cases**:    - If the graph is not connected, let each connected component (C_i) be independently partitioned into (X_i), (Y_i), and (Z_i).    - Combine these as (X = cup X_i), (Y = cup Y_i), and (Z = cup Z_i). 8. **Conclusion**:    - Thus, we have partitioned the set of all administrators into three disjoint sets (X), (Y), and (Z) such that the reporting structure follows the given conditions.

Here are the sequences to consider and steps based on logical placement to fill the grid: 1. **Four-digit numbers ending with 0:**     We know that any complete four-digit number ending with 0 can only be \`410\` (for three digits). Therefore, locate this sequence vertically. 2. **Five-digit specific placement:**     Since \`A\`, \`B\`, \`C\`, \`D\`, \`E\` represents positions within the sequence, let's deduce the values step by step using given logic:     - Constrain sequences such that position \`E\` can only be \`4\` as we see the placement of \`40\` vertically in some positions. 3. **Verify formation based on sequences ending with 0 and beginning with specific numbers:**     - Numbers like \`102\`, \`2224\`, \`202\`, \`0022\` etc., naturally fall into positions along vertical or horizontal paths given their order constraints.

Therefore, the equation of the tangent line to f(x) at x=1 is given by y - (e - 1) = 1 cdot (x - 1), which simplifies to y = x - 1 + e - 1, or in standard form, x - y + e - 2 = 0. So, the equation of the tangent line is boxed{x - y + e - 2 = 0}. (2) To prove that |f(x)-1| < a for 0 < |x| < ln (1+a), we first express |f(x) - 1| as |f(x) - 1| = left| frac{e^{x} - 1 - x}{x} right| = frac{|e^{x} - 1 - x|}{|x|}. Let varphi(x)=e^{x}-1-x. Then, the derivative varphi'(x) = e^{x} - 1. As varphi'(x)>0 if and only if x>0, varphi(x) is decreasing on (-infty, 0) and increasing on (0, infty). Thus, varphi(x) geqslant varphi(0) = 0, which means e^{x} - 1 - x geqslant 0 for x neq 0. For 0 < |x| < ln(1+a), we need to show that (e^{x} - 1 - x) < a|x|. Splitting into two cases based on the sign of x, let's consider: - for 0 < x < ln(1+a), we need to prove e^{x} - 1 - (1+a)x < 0 (Ⅰ), - for -ln(1+a) < x < 0, we need to prove e^{x} - 1 - (1-a)x < 0 (Ⅱ).

To prove (Ⅰ) and (Ⅱ), it suffices to show that g(x) is decreasing in (0, ln(1+a)) and h(x) is increasing in (-ln(1+a), 0). For 0 < x < ln(1+a), we have g'(x) = e^{x} - (1+a). Since e^{ln(1+a)} = 1+a, we have g'(x)=e^{x}-(1+a) < e^{ln(1+a)}-(1+a)=0, which implies that g(x) is decreasing in the interval (0, ln(1+a)). For -ln(1+a) < x < 0, we have h'(x) = e^{x} - (1-a). Since e^{-ln(1+a)} = frac{1}{1+a}, we have h'(x) = e^{x} - (1-a) > e^{-ln(1+a)} - (1-a) = frac{1}{1+a} - (1-a) = frac{a^{2}}{1+a} > 0, indicating that h(x) is increasing in the interval (-ln(1+a), 0).

This is a significant alteration as it excludes the sum of divisors being solely 1 + sqrt{i} + i, considering additional divisors. 3. Since i = n^2 for some integer n and n is a composite number, the factors of n (excluding 1 and n itself) contribute to extra divisors of i.

We aim to show that one digit can be removed to form a (2m)-digit number that satisfies the \\"fair\\" condition. 4. **Setup variables**:     - Let the original ((2m+1))-digit number be (d_1d_2d_3 ldots d_{2m+1}).    - Define even positions (as 2nd, 4th, ..., 2m-th positions) and odd positions (as 1st, 3rd, ..., (2m-1)-th and (2m+1)-th positions). 5. **Count even and odd digits**:    - Let (E_{even}) and (O_{even}) denote the number of even and odd digits in the even positions, respectively.    - Let (E_{odd}) and (O_{odd}) denote the number of even and odd digits in the odd positions, respectively.    - Hence, in a ((2m+1))-digit number, we have the following total counts:      - (E_{total} = E_{even} + E_{odd})      - (O_{total} = O_{even} + O_{odd})    - Since (E_{total} + O_{total} = 2m+1), (E_{total}) and (O_{total}) cannot both be equal (since (2m+1) is odd). 6. **Parity and balance**: Since we require (2m) digits post removal, by removing one digit, we aim for:    - (E_{new_total} + O_{new_total} = 2m): Here (E_{new_total}) and (O_{new_total}) will need to balance according to the counts in new even and odd positions. 7. **Case analysis**:    - If (E_{total} > O_{total}): There exists at least one digit we can remove to reduce (E_{total}) by one to balance even and odd counts across positions.    - If (O_{total} > E_{total}): Similarly, there exists at least one digit we can remove to reduce (O_{total}) by one for balance. 8. **Confirmation through examples**:    - For a specific example (like 12345 from the problem statement):      - The process involves verifying each digit and its impact on parity balance. 9. **Conclusion**: Through the inherent properties of parity (even/odd) and the structure of digit positions, removing one appropriate digit from any ((2m+1))-digit number can always yield a (2m)-digit number satisfying the given fair conditions.

The cost function is: [w = 80m + 40(80 - m) = 40m + 3200] Since the coefficient of m in the cost function is positive (40 > 0), the cost w increases as m increases.

To convert kmph to m/s, we multiply by (1000 m / 1 km) and divide by (3600 s / 1 hour): Speed of the first train in m/s = 50 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) = (50 * 1000) / 3600 = 50000 / 3600 ≈ 13.89 m/s Speed of the second train in m/s = 82 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) / (3600 s / 1 hour) = (82 * 1000) / 3600 = 82000 / 3600 ≈ 22.78 m/s The relative speed of the two trains = 13.89 m/s + 22.78 m/s = 36.67 m/s The time taken to cross each other is 6 seconds.

Consider two circles Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2} that intersect at points A and B.     2. Let C and D be the points where a common tangent to both circles touches Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2}, respectively.     3. Define line segment CD as the line joining points C and D, and let M be the point where line AB cuts CD.     4. Line AB is known as the radical axis of the two circles Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2}. By definition, the radical axis of two circles is the locus of all points that have equal power with respect to both circles.     5. To understand the concept of power, let’s define the power of a point ( P ) with respect to a circle ( Gamma ). The power of point ( P ) with respect to circle ( Gamma ) (with radius ( r ) and center ( O )) is given by:    [    mathcal{P}_{Gamma}(P) = OP^2 - r^2    ] 6. For point M on the radical axis ( AB ), we have:    [    mathcal{P}_{Gamma_{1}}(M) = mathcal{P}_{Gamma_{2}}(M)    ]     7. This implies that the power of M with respect to circle Gamma_{1} is equal to the power of M with respect to circle Gamma_{2}. 8. Since MC and MD are both tangent segments from M to the circles Gamma_{1} and Gamma_{2} respectively, their lengths must be equal. Therefore, we have:    [    MC^2 = MD^2 implies MC = MD    ] 9. Because M splits CD into two equal segments where MC = MD, it follows that M is the midpoint of CD. 10. Thus, the point M, which is the intersection of lines AB and CD, divides the line segment [CD] into two equal parts. # Conclusion: [ boxed{(A B)  text{cutts}  [CD]  text{at its midpoint}} ]"},{"instruction":"heater charges  12 for seats in the orchestra and  8 for seats in the balcony . on a certain night , a total of 380 tickets were sold for a total cost of  3,320 . how many more tickets were sold that night for seats in the balcony than for seats in the orchestra ?","output":"Let's denote the number of orchestra tickets sold as ( O ) and the number of balcony tickets sold as ( B ).

The total cost of the tickets is 3,320: [ 12O + 8B = 3,320 ] We can solve this system of equations to find the values of ( O ) and ( B ).

First, let's set ( x = 0 ) in the given equation: [ f(x f(y)) = f(x y^2) - 2 x^2 f(y) - f(x) - 1 ] 2.

Ratio frac{x-2}{x^2-x} tends to 0 as x approaches infinity, indicating one horizontal asymptote at y=0. - **Oblique Asymptotes**: No oblique asymptotes because the degree of the polynomial in the numerator is less than that in the denominator.

Can we reach a situation where there are 2018 piles, each with 2018 chips?","output":"\`\`\`markdown 1. **Initial Setup:**    Let’s begin by examining the initial conditions. We have 2018 piles where the (i)-th pile consists of (p_i) tokens, where (p_i) is the (i)-th prime number. The sequence of prime numbers begins as follows:    [    p_1 = 2, , p_2 = 3, , p_3 = 5, , p_4 = 7, , ldots, , p_{2018} , text{is the 2018-th prime number}    ] 2. **Movement Analysis:**    We are allowed to perform two types of operations:    - **Separation:** Split a pile into two and add one token to one of the resulting piles.    - **Fusion:** Merge two piles and add one token to the resulting pile. 3. **Parity Changes:**    Let’s explore how these operations affect the parity (odd or even status) of the number of piles containing an even number of tokens.    a. **Initial Parity:**       The initial pile configuration has exactly one pile with an even number of tokens, since the only even prime is (p_1 = 2).       Thus, initially, the number of piles with an even number of tokens is 1 (which is odd).    b. **Separation Operation:**       Suppose a pile with (n) tokens is split into two piles with (k) and (n-k) tokens. We then add 1 token to one of these piles:       - If (n) is even, then (k) and (n-k) are both even or both odd. Each split and the addition of one token to one pile results in the new configuration:                  - Adding 1 to an even pile (even+1 = odd) or an odd pile (odd+1 = even) ensures exactly one pile changes parity (even remains the same, odd).       Conclusion: The parity of the number of piles with even tokens remains odd.    c. **Fusion Operation:**       Merge two piles containing (a) and (b) tokens respectively and then one token is added:       - If both (a) and (b) are even or odd, (a+b) is even.       - Adding one token to an even value yields an odd pile.       Conclusion: The parity of the number of piles with even tokens remains odd. 4. **Final Condition:**    The final goal is to achieve the state where there are 2018 piles of 2018 tokens each:    - Since 2018 is an even number, achieving this situation implies 2018 piles with tokens, all of which are even. 5. **Conclusion:**    However, as stated, the number of piles with an even number of tokens must remain odd regardless of operations performed. Therefore, it is not possible to transform the initial situation (odd parity) into the desired final situation (even parity) because the operations allowed do not permit a change in this parity.

For the second purchase: 180x + 120y = 8100 Solving this system, we start with the first equation: 100x + 150y = 7000 quad text{(i)} And the second equation: 180x + 120y = 8100 quad text{(ii)} Multiplying equation (i) by 6 and equation (ii) by 5 to eliminate y, we get: 600x + 900y = 42000 900x + 600y = 40500 Subtracting these equations, we find: -300x = -1500 implies x = 25 Substituting x = 25 into equation (i): 100(25) + 150y = 7000 implies 2500 + 150y = 7000 implies 150y = 4500 implies y = 30 Therefore, the cost per bag of brand A zongzi is boxed{25} yuan, and the cost per bag of brand B zongzi is boxed{30} yuan.  Part 2: Minimizing the Total Cost for 300 Bags Let m represent the number of bags of brand B zongzi purchased, and (300 - m) represent the number of bags of brand A zongzi. The total cost W can be expressed as: W = 25(300 - m) + 30m = 7500 + 5m Given that 300 - m leqslant 2m, we have m geqslant 100. Since 5 > 0, W increases as m increases. Therefore, to minimize W, we set m = 100: W = 5 times 100 + 7500 = 8000 Thus, to minimize the total cost, the supermarket should purchase boxed{100} bags of brand B zongzi and boxed{200} bags of brand A zongzi, resulting in a total cost of boxed{8000} yuan."},{"instruction":"Given a sector with a radius of 4cm and an arc length of 12cm, find the area of the sector.","output":"To calculate the area S of the sector, we use the sector area formula:  S = frac{1}{2} times text{arc length} times text{radius}  Substitute the given values into the formula:  S = frac{1}{2} times 12 times 4   S = 6 times 4   S = 24  So, the area of the sector is boxed{24 text{ cm}^2}.

First, let's find the work rates of P and Q individually. Person P takes 4 hours to complete the job, so P's work rate is 1 job per 4 hours, or 1/4 of the job per hour. Person Q takes 6 hours to complete the job, so Q's work rate is 1 job per 6 hours, or 1/6 of the job per hour. When P and Q work together, their work rates add up. So, the combined work rate is: (1/4) + (1/6) = (3/12) + (2/12) = 5/12 of the job per hour. Now, to find out how long it will take for them to complete the job together, we take the reciprocal of their combined work rate: 1 / (5/12) = 12/5 hours.

Prove this if the triangle is rightangled.","output":"1. We first present a visual and intuitive proof that the centroid (center of mass) of a triangle is at the intersection of its medians. This proof can be applied to any triangle, not just right triangles. 2. Consider a triangle  triangle ABC, as shown in Figure 151. Suppose the triangle is made entirely of very thin, uniform-density wires placed parallel to side AC. We can see that the centers of mass of these wires lie along the median BM. 3. Similarly, using the same logic, we can show that the center of mass must also lie along the median AN. 4. Therefore, the centroid of the triangle  triangle ABC must lie at the intersection of its medians. Let's now establish this rigorously using a geometric approach. 5. Consider the right triangle  triangle ABC with CB = a and CA = b (refer to Figure 152). We divide CB into n equal segments at points C_1, C_2, ldots, C_{n-1}. Draw lines parallel to CA through these points meeting AB at points D_1, D_2, ldots, D_{n-1}. 6. On each segment C_i D_i, build rectangles with height frac{a}{n}. Denote the areas of these rectangles as S_1, S_2, ldots, S_{n-1} and their centroids as B_1, B_2, ldots, B_{n-1}. 7. We need to find the centroid, Z^{(n)}, of the shaded polygon formed by these rectangles. 8. Note that: C_1 D_1 = frac{b}{n}, quad C_2 D_2 = 2 frac{b}{n}, ldots, quad C_{n-1} D_{n-1} = frac{(n-1) b}{n}  9. Therefore, the areas can be expressed as: S_1 = frac{a b}{n^2}, quad S_2 = frac{2 a b}{n^2}, ldots, quad S_{n-1} = frac{(n-1) a b}{n^2}  10. Let x_1, x_2, ldots, x_{n-1} be the distances from the centroids of these rectangles to line BC. Then: x_1 = frac{1}{2} C_1 D_1 = frac{1}{2} frac{b}{n}, quad x_2 = frac{1}{2} C_2 D_2 = frac{1}{2} frac{2 b}{n}, quad ldots, quad x_{n-1} = frac{1}{2} frac{(n-1) b}{n}  11. Let x^{(n)} be the distance from the centroid, Z^{(n)}, of the shaded polygon to line CB. Using the formula for the weighted average of the distances: x^{(n)} = frac{S_1 x_1 + S_2 x_2 + ldots + S_{n-1} x_{n-1}}{S_1 + S_2 + ldots + S_{n-1}}  12. Substituting the values, we get: x^{(n)} = frac{sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{i a b}{n^2} cdot frac{i b}{2 n}}{sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{i a b}{n^2}} = frac{sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{i^2 a b^2}{2 n^3}}{sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{i a b}{n^2}} = frac{frac{a b^2}{2 n^3} sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2}{frac{a b}{n^2} sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i}  13.

Let y^{(n)} be the distance from the centroid, Z^{(n)}, of the shaded polygon to line BD. Then: y^{(n)} = frac{S_1 y_1 + S_2 y_2 + ldots + S_{n-1} y_{n-1}}{S_1 + S_2 + ldots + S_{n-1}}  17. Substituting the values, we get: y^{(n)} = frac{sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{i a b^2}{n^3} cdot frac{(2i+1) a}{2 n}}{sum_{i=1}^{n-1} frac{i a b}{n^2}}  18. Using summation formulas: sum_{i=1}^{n-1} (2i+1)i = 2sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i^2 + sum_{i=1}^{n-1} i = frac{(n-1) n (2n-1)}{3} + frac{(n-1)n}{2}  19. We get: y^{(n)} = left(frac{2a}{2n} + frac{a}{2n}right) frac{1+frac{3}{4}}{frac{1}{2}} = frac{a}{3}left(2+frac{1}{2n}right) When n approaches infinity: x^{(n)} rightarrow frac{b}{3}, quad y^{(n)} rightarrow frac{2a}{3}  20. The point Z approaches the point inside the triangle at a distance of frac{b}{3} from BC and frac{2a}{3} from BD which is the centroid. This property uniquely characterizes the centroid of triangle ABC as the intersection of its medians. Hence, the centroid of  triangle ABC is the point of intersection of its medians, which is the theorem we aimed to prove. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence a_n is denoted as S_n.

Let's begin by analyzing part (a).     Given the quadrilateral prism A B C D A_1 B_1 C_1 D_1 with the base as a rhombus A B C D where BD = 12 and angle B A C = 60^circ.     Diagonals of a rhombus bisect each other at right angles, and divide the rhombus into four congruent right-angled triangles. Hence, the diagonal bisect BD into BD/2 = 12/2 = 6.     Since angle BAC = 60^circ, we can use trigonometry to find the side length of the rhombus. The diagonals split the rhombus into 4 right triangles, each with:     [     text{opposite side} = 6, quad text{and} quad angle = 30^circ     ]     Therefore,     [     AC = 2 times (6 tan 30^circ) = 2 times (6 times frac{1}{sqrt{3}}) = 4sqrt{3}     ]     Given that a sphere is passing through vertices D, A, B, B_1, C_1, and D_1, the circle formed by the intersection of the sphere with the plane through points A_1, B_1, and C_1 will have a radius equal to the side of the rhombus, that is 4sqrt{3}.     The area of the circle given its radius r is:     [     text{Area} = pi r^2 = pi (4sqrt{3})^2 = pi times 16 times 3 = 48 pi     ]     Concluding part (a):     [     boxed{48 pi}     ] 2. For part (b), we need to find the angle angle A_1 C B.         Consider O as the center of the sphere. Since O is the center of the sphere, all radii OA, OB, and OC are equal.     Dropping a perpendicular from O to the plane of the rhombus ABCD at point H. Triangles OHA, OHB, and OHD are congruent because they share angle OH and the hypotenuse OA, OB, OD.     This makes H equidistant from A, B, and D, thus forming equilateral triangles around H, meaning H is the point at which the diagonals intersect, i.e., H coincides with C.     OC then is perpendicular to the plane ABCD and OA_1 is perpendicular to the plane A_1B_1C_1D_1, therefore making the diagonal A_1C the prism height.     Consequently:     [     angle A_1 C B = 90^circ     ]     Concluding part (b):     [     boxed{90^circ}     ] 3. Finally, for part (c), let's find the volume of the prism given that the sphere's radius is 8.         In the right-angled triangle AOC, with hypotenuse AO = 8 and leg AC = 4sqrt{3}, we find the remaining leg OC:     [     AOC: 8^2 = (4sqrt{3})^2 + OC^2 implies 64 = 48 + OC^2 implies OC^2 = 64 - 48 = 16 implies OC = 4     ]     Thus, the height of the prism equals 2 times OC = 8.

We need to show that (M_1M_2M_3M_4) forms a parallelogram, and determine its area properties. 3. **Understanding Reflections:**    Reflecting (M) across the midpoint of a segment yields a point on the opposite side of that midpoint at the same distance from the midpoint as (M).

Accept if the oracle returns \\"yes\\", otherwise reject.    - **Proof that ( S ) is Sparse**:      Let ( p_i(n) ) be the polynomial bounding the number of strings of length ( n ) in ( S_i ). Define ( p(n) ) as a polynomial such that ( p(n) > p_i(n) ) for all ( 1 leq i leq k ) and for all ( n in mathbb{N} ). For any ( n geq k ), the number of strings in ( S ) of length ( n ) is bounded by ( k cdot p(n-k) ), which is a polynomial. 2. **Equivalence of (textbf{P}) and (textbf{P}_{bad-angel})**    - **Claim**: (textbf{P} = textbf{P}_{bad-angel}).    - **Proof**:      If ( L in textbf{P}_{bad-angel} ), there exists a polynomial time algorithm ( A ) that computes the angel string ( alpha_n ) for any length ( n ). We also have a polynomial time Turing Machine ( M' ) that decides membership in ( L ) given ( x ) and ( alpha_n ).      To decide ( L ) in polynomial time:      1. Given an input ( x ), compute its length ( n ).      2. Use the algorithm ( A ) to compute the angel string ( alpha_n ).      3. Simulate ( M' ) on input ( (x, alpha_n) ).      Since all steps are polynomial time, ( L in textbf{P} ). Hence, (textbf{P} = textbf{P}_{bad-angel}). 3. **Existence of Sparse Set ( S_L ) for ( L in textbf{P}_{angel} )**    - **Claim**: For any language ( L in textbf{P}_{angel} ), there exists a sparse set ( S_L ) and a deterministic polynomial time Turing Machine ( M ) with oracle access to ( S_L ) that can decide ( L ).    - **Proof**:      Let ( {alpha_n}_{n in mathbb{N}} ) be the sequence of angel strings for ( L ). Let ( alpha_n = a_1a_2ldots a_{p(n)} ).      Define ( S_L ) as the set containing prefixes of the angel strings:      [      S_L = bigcup_{n in mathbb{N}} {1^n0a_1, 1^n0a_1a_2, ldots, 1^n0a_1a_2ldots a_{p(n)}}.      ]      - **Sparsity of ( S_L )**:        For each ( n ), we add ( p(n) ) strings of lengths ranging from ( n+2 ) to ( n+p(n)+1 ). The number of strings of length ( n+p(n)+1 ) is bounded by ( p(n) ), ensuring ( S_L ) is sparse.      - **Description of ( M )**:        Given an input ( x ) of length ( n ):        1. Initialize an empty string ( alpha ).        2.

Simulate the Turing Machine ( M' ) on input ( (x, alpha) ).      Since ( M ) makes polynomially many queries to the sparse set ( S_L ) and each query is polynomial time, ( M ) decides ( L ) in polynomial time.

Since A includes numbers from 2 to just below 5, and B includes numbers from just above 3 to 10, the overlap between the two sets is from just above 3 to just below 5. Therefore, Acap B = (3,5). - **Acup B** is the set of elements that are in A, B, or both. Since A covers numbers from 2 to just below 5, and B extends from just above 3 to 10, combining these sets gives us all numbers from 2 to 10, but not including 10. Therefore, Acup B = [2,10). - **(complement _{R}A)cap B** involves finding the complement of A in the real numbers, complement _{R}A, which consists of all real numbers not in A, and then finding the intersection of this set with B. Since A goes from 2 to just below 5, its complement will include all numbers less than 2 and all numbers 5 and above. Intersecting this with B (numbers just above 3 to 10) gives us the numbers from 5 to 10, not including 10. Therefore, (complement _{R}A)cap B = [5,10).

For any overlap to occur, a must be greater than 2. Therefore, for Acap C neq varnothing, a must be greater than 2, which gives us a gt 2. Thus, the range of a is (2, +infty).

This leads to the first condition:    [    n^2 equiv 0 pmod{4}.    ]    This implies that n must be even because if n is odd, then n^2 will be odd and cannot be divisible by 4. However, not all even numbers are sufficient. 2. **Coloring argument**:    Color the n times n grid like a chessboard, such that alternate squares are colored black and white. This results in an equal number of black and white squares as the grid size, n times n, is even. 3. **Types of T-shaped pieces**:    Since rotations are allowed, there are essentially two types of T-shaped pieces with respect to their coverage of black and white squares:    - Type 1: Covers 3 white squares and 1 black square.    - Type 2: Covers 3 black squares and 1 white square.

Nous traitons d'abord le cas d'une année non bissextile, car le cas d'une année bissextile se traite de manière similaire.  Étape 1: Analyse du jour correspondant au 12 du mois Nous devons déterminer comment les jours de la semaine se déplacent au fil des mois. Si un mois commence un certain jour, nous voulons savoir quel jour de la semaine sera le 12 de ce mois. Pour simplifier les calculs, nous cherchons donc combien de jours se sont écoulés depuis le début de l'année jusqu'au 12 du mois. Pour qu'un mois ait un vendredi 12, le premier jour de ce mois particulier doit correspondre à un lundi. En effet, si le 1er du mois est un lundi, alors le 12 de ce mois sera un vendredi.  Étape 2: Calcul des décalages mensuels Nous devons déterminer le décalage de jours de la semaine d'un mois à l'autre, sachant qu'un décalage de 7 jours signifie revenir au même jour de la semaine. - Janvier a 31 jours, donc le 1er février est 3 jours après le jour de la semaine du 1er janvier (car (31 equiv 3 mod 7)). - Février a 28 jours (non bissextile), donc le 1er mars est 3 jours après le 1er février ((28 equiv 0 mod 7), ceci reste le même; donc (3 + 0 = 3)). - Mars a 31 jours, donc le 1er avril est 3 jours après le 1er mars ((31 equiv 3 mod 7); décalage total (3+3 = 6)). - Avril a 30 jours, donc le 1er mai est 1 jour après le 1er avril ((30 equiv 2 mod 7); décalage total (6+2 = 1)). - Mai a 31 jours, donc le 1er juin est 3 jours après le 1er mai ((31 equiv 3 mod 7); décalage total (1+3 = 4)). - Juin a 30 jours, donc le 1er juillet est 2 jours après le 1er juin ((30 equiv 2 mod 7); décalage total (4+2 = 6)). - Juillet a 31 jours, donc le 1er août est 3 jours après le 1er juillet ((31 equiv 3 mod 7); décalage total (6+3 = 2)). - Août a 31 jours, donc le 1er septembre est 3 jours après le 1er août ((31 equiv 3 mod 7); décalage total (2+3 = 5)). - Septembre a 30 jours, donc le 1er octobre est 2 jours après le 1er septembre ((30 equiv 2 mod 7); décalage total (5+2 = 0)). - Octobre a 31 jours, donc le 1er novembre est 3 jours après le 1er octobre ((31 equiv 3 mod 7); décalage total (0+3 = 3)). - Novembre a 30 jours, donc le 1er décembre est 2 jours après le 1er novembre ((30 equiv 2 mod 7); décalage total (3+2 = 5)). - Décembre a 31 jours, donc le 1er janvier de l'année suivante est 3 jours après le 1er décembre ((31 equiv 3 mod 7); décalage total (5+3 = 8 equiv 1 mod 7)).

The remainder when a multiple of y is divided by 9 is 6. What is the multiple of y?","output":"Let's denote the multiple of y as ky, where k is an integer. Since y divided by 9 leaves a remainder of 5, we can express y as: y = 9n + 5, where n is a non-negative integer. Now, when ky is divided by 9, the remainder is 6. We can express this as: ky = 9m + 6, where m is a non-negative integer. Substituting the expression for y into the equation for ky, we get: k(9n + 5) = 9m + 6 Expanding the left side, we have: 9kn + 5k = 9m + 6 Since 9kn is a multiple of 9, it will not affect the remainder when divided by 9. Therefore, we can focus on the terms that will affect the remainder: 5k ≡ 6 (mod 9) Now we need to find the smallest positive integer k such that 5k leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9. We can test values of k starting from 1: For k = 1, 5(1) = 5, which leaves a remainder of 5 (not 6). For k = 2, 5(2) = 10, which leaves a remainder of 1 (not 6). For k = 3, 5(3) = 15, which leaves a remainder of 6. Therefore, the smallest k that satisfies the condition is 3. So the multiple of y that leaves a remainder of 6 when divided by 9 is 3y. To confirm, we can substitute y = 9n + 5 into 3y: 3y = 3(9n + 5) = 27n + 15 When 27n + 15 is divided by 9, the term 27n is divisible by 9 and will not affect the remainder.

There are three scenarios where exactly one company gets no interns, and for each of these, there are 2^5 ways of assigning the students (since the remaining students can now choose between only the two companies). However, by subtracting these cases, we have also subtracted too much in the cases where two companies have no interns. Since there are three possible pairs of companies that could have no interns, and in each of those cases, there is only 1 way to assign all students to the remaining company, we must add back in these 3 cases. Let's calculate this using the numbers: - Total unrestricted ways to assign students: 3^5 = 243 - Subtract cases with one empty company: 243 - 3(2^5) = 243 - 3 times 32 = 243 - 96 = 147 - Add back cases with two empty companies: 147 + 3 = 150 So the number of different possible assignment plans, where each company has at least one intern, is boxed{150}."},{"instruction":"Find all real solutions to the equation: [ frac{1}{(x  2)(x  3)} + frac{1}{(x  3)(x  4)} + frac{1}{(x  4)(x  5)} = frac{1}{8}. ]","output":"We start by expressing each term using partial fractions: [ frac{1}{(x - 2)(x - 3)} = frac{1}{x - 3} - frac{1}{x - 2}, ] [ frac{1}{(x - 3)(x - 4)} = frac{1}{x - 4} - frac{1}{x - 3}, ] [ frac{1}{(x - 4)(x - 5)} = frac{1}{x - 5} - frac{1}{x - 4}. ] Substituting these into the original equation, we get: [ left(frac{1}{x - 3} - frac{1}{x - 2}right) + left(frac{1}{x - 4} - frac{1}{x - 3}right) + left(frac{1}{x - 5} - frac{1}{x - 4}right) = frac{1}{8}. ] This simplifies to: [ frac{1}{x - 5} - frac{1}{x - 2} = frac{1}{8}. ] Multiplying through by 8(x - 5)(x - 2) to clear the denominators, we get: [ 8(x - 2) - 8(x - 5) = (x - 5)(x - 2). ] Expanding and simplifying, [ 8x - 16 - 8x + 40 = x^2 - 7x + 10, ] [ 24 = x^2 - 7x + 10. ] Rearranging, [ x^2 - 7x - 14 = 0. ] This factors as: [ (x - 7)(x + 2) = 0. ] Thus, the solutions are: [ boxed{7, -2}. ]"},{"instruction":"Ana and Bonita were born on the same date in different years, n years apart.

The possible amounts in quarters are 0, 25, 50, or 75 cents because a quarter is worth 25 cents, and George is getting change less than a dollar. If he needs 3 more pennies to meet the amount, the possible totals are:    - 0 + 3 = 3 cents    - 25 + 3 = 28 cents    - 50 + 3 = 53 cents    - 75 + 3 = 78 cents 2. **Understanding the dimes condition**: George can also receive dimes and the rest in pennies.

This implies that the exponents ( x_i ) and ( y_i ) in the representations ( a = 3^{x_1}5^{y_1} ), ( b = 3^{x_2}5^{y_2} ), ( c = 3^{x_3}5^{y_3} ), and ( d = 3^{x_4}5^{y_4} ) must all be distinct.

The number of ways to choose 4 distinct values from 7 is given by the binomial coefficient:    [    binom{7}{4}    ]    Since we need to choose 4 distinct values for both ( x ) and ( y ), the total number of ways to choose these values is:    [    left( binom{7}{4} right)^2    ] 4. **Ensuring No Divisibility**:    Given the chosen values, we need to ensure that none of the numbers divide each other.

This ordering of ( x )-values forces the ( y )-values to be in strictly decreasing order ( y_1 > y_2 > y_3 > y_4 ) to ensure that none of the numbers divide each other. 5. **Calculating the Number of Ways**:    The number of ways to choose 4 distinct values from 7 is:    [    binom{7}{4} = 35    ]    Therefore, the total number of ways to choose the ( x )-values and ( y )-values is:    [    left( binom{7}{4} right)^2 = 35^2 = 1225    ] 6. **Conclusion**:    Since the ordering of ( x )-values uniquely determines the ordering of ( y )-values, there is exactly 1 way to arrange the ( y )-values for each choice of ( x )-values.

Part (b): ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 95 ) 1. **Observation of Relationship:**        - Since ( 95 = 5 cdot 19 ), flips of 95 disks can be broken down into five flips of 19 disks.    - We can represent any sequence of flips using a binary sequence of length 1977 (given by ( 1995 - 19 + 1 )). 2. **Binary Representation:**        - Let's define an 1977-element binary sequence ( (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{1977}) ) where ( a_i = 1 ) means an odd number of flips for the 19-disk segment starting at position ( i ). 3. **Restricted Configurations:**        - Each possible sequence of flips corresponds to one of ( 2^{1977} ) configurations.    - However, the total number of possible configurations of disks is ( 2^{1995} ). 4. **Impossibility of Reaching All Configurations:**        - Since ( 2^{1977} ll 2^{1995} ), not all configurations can be achieved.    - There exist configurations that cannot be transformed to all disks showing the red side up. 5. **Specific Example:**        - Consider the configuration where the last disk is blue, and all others are red.    - Each disk's color change depends on even or odd nature of flip count. Trying to change the first disk to red implies the last disk cannot be flipped an odd number of times while keeping count consistent for other disks. 6. **Conclusion for Part (b):**        - Therefore, it's impossible to transform all configurations to all disks showing the red side up using ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 95 ).    - The statement is false for ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 95 ). # Final Conclusion - For ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 94 ):   [ boxed{text{True}} ] - For ( m = 19 ) and ( n = 95 ):   [ boxed{text{False}} ]"},{"instruction":"From the vertices of a regular 27gon, seven are chosen arbitrarily.

For each pair ((a_i, a_j)), we can compute the mean:    [    frac{a_i + a_j}{2}    ]    Since we are working modulo 27, we need to consider these means modulo 27. 6. **Pigeonhole principle application:**    We now have 7 original vertices and 21 means, making a total of 28 numbers:    [    a_1, a_2, ldots, a_7, frac{a_1 + a_2}{2}, frac{a_1 + a_3}{2}, ldots, frac{a_6 + a_7}{2}    ]    Since there are only 27 possible residues modulo 27, by the pigeonhole principle, at least two of these 28 numbers must be congruent modulo 27. 7. **Conclusion:**    If two of the original vertices (a_i) and (a_j) are congruent modulo 27, they are the same vertex, which is not possible since all chosen vertices are distinct. Therefore, the congruence must occur between one of the original vertices and one of the means, or between two means. This implies that either:    - There exists an isosceles triangle (if (frac{a_i + a_j}{2} equiv a_k pmod{27})), or    - There exists an isosceles trapezoid (if (frac{a_i + a_j}{2} equiv frac{a_k + a_l}{2} pmod{27})).

We need to determine the maximum number of these regions that a single line can intersect. 2. **Analyzing the Intersection:**    A line can only transition from one region to another by crossing at least one plane of the tetrahedron. Each plane of the tetrahedron represents a boundary between regions. 3. **Maximum Transitions:**    Since a tetrahedron has four faces or planes, a line can intersect at most these four planes. If we choose a line that is neither parallel to any of these planes nor intersecting any edges of the tetrahedron, then it could potentially cross all four planes. 4. **Detailed Calculation:**    - Let's consider a line entering a region initially.    - It crosses the first plane, transitioning to a new region (2 regions encountered so far).    - It crosses the second plane, transitioning to another region (3 regions encountered so far).    - It crosses the third plane, transitioning to another region (4 regions encountered so far).    - Finally, it crosses the fourth plane, entering a new region (5 regions encountered so far).    Hence, the maximum number of regions a line can intersect is five. 5. **Finding a Suitable Line:**    To understand how a line can intersect exactly these four planes:    - Choose a point ( P ) inside one of the tetrahedron's faces, for instance, face ( BCD ).    - The lines (AB), (AC), and (BC) divide the plane ( ABC ) into 4 regions. Selecting a point ( Q ) in the region not containing the triangle ( ABC ) and ensuring ( Q ) does not lie on the plane containing the selected point and ( D ).    - The line ( PQ ) will thus intersect all four planes of the tetrahedron without being parallel to any plane and without intersecting the tetrahedron's edges. 6. **Conclusion:**    The calculation and geometric construction show that a line can intersect at most five regions divided by the planes of the tetrahedron.

In total, during the period of healthy eating, he ate 264 buns and 187 pears. How many days did Matvey follow his healthy diet?","output":"1. Let's denote the number of days Matvey followed this diet as n.  2. Define the number of buns Matvey ate on the first day as b_1 and the number of pears as p_1. 3. Each subsequent day, he ate one less bun and one more pear than the previous day. Therefore, on the n-th day he ate b_1 - (n-1) buns and p_1 + (n-1) pears. 4. We are given that the total number of buns Matvey ate over n days is 264, and the total number of pears is 187.

Now we subtract the total number of pears from the total number of buns:    [    264 - 187 = 77    ] 8. If Matvey eats one fewer bun and one more pear each day, the difference between buns and pears stays constant, equal to ((b_1 - (p_1 + (n-1))) = b_1 - p_1 - (n-1)):    [    77 = n(b_1 - p_1 - (n-1))    ] 9.

Therefore, ( K ) must intersect every column and every row. 4. **Define ( f(x) )**: Let (ell_{alpha}) denote the line ( x = alpha ), and let ( f(x) ) denote the length of the line segment ( K cap ell_x ) for ( x in (0, n) ).

Therefore, ( f(x) > 1 ) can only occur in one interval ((i, i+1)) for some integer ( i ). 7. **Bounding the area**:    - Draw two lines, ( l_i ) and ( l_{i+1} ), through ((i, 1)) and ((i+1, 1)) respectively that are tangent to ( f ).    - Let ( L ) be the triangle formed by ( l_i, l_{i+1} ), and the ( x )-axis.

Comparing this triangle with the box ((0, n) times (0, 1)) and using similar triangles to bound the area, it can be shown that (int_{a}^{b} f(x) , dx < n). 8. **Contradiction**: This contradicts the assumption that (text{Area}(K) ge n).

(An opposite edge pair consists of two edges that include all four vertices of the tetrahedron.)","output":"Proof: 1. **Acknowledging the Necessary Condition:**    We know from the literature on tetrahedrons (refer to the article mentioned) that if the sums of the lengths of opposite edges are equal for all three pairs (a necessary condition), then the tetrahedron has an edge-incircle. This is a known consequence of the edge-incircle's existence. 2. **Restating the Problem:**    Suppose we are given that the sums of the lengths of opposite edges of the tetrahedron are equal, i.e.,    [    a + a' = b + b' = c + c'.    ]    We need to prove that this condition is also sufficient to ensure the existence of an edge-incircle. 3. **Edge-Incircle Implication:**    It is evident that if a tetrahedron has an edge-incircle, each face of the tetrahedron has an incircle. Therefore, any two such incircles in the different planes of the tetrahedron must touch each other. Our goal is to show that this touching condition holds based on the provided edge length equality condition. 4. **Analysis of Touching Circles:**    Let us consider the tetrahedron with vertices labeled ( A, B, C, D ) and examine the triangles ( ABC ) and ( ACD ). We focus on the incircles ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) of these triangles:    - Let ( M ) and ( N ) be the tangency points of the respective incircles ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) with the edge ( AC ).    - Let the semiperimeters (half of the perimeter) of ( triangle ABC ) and ( triangle ACD ) be ( s_1 ) and ( s_2 ), respectively. 5. **Tangency Conditions:**    The distances of the tangency points from vertex ( A ) can be expressed in terms of the semiperimeters and the opposite edge lengths as:    [    begin{aligned}    &AM = s_1 - a = frac{b' + (c' - a')}{2},     &AN = s_2 - c = frac{b' + (a - c)}{2}.    end{aligned}    ] 6. **Equal Differences:**    Given the condition ( a + a' = b + b' = c + c' ), the following equalities hold in the tangency points:    [    begin{aligned}    &AM = frac{b' + (c' - a')}{2},     &AN = frac{b' + (a - c)}{2}.    end{aligned}    ] 7. **Conclusion of Tangency:**    Since the differences in the tangent points expressions are equal, it follows that:    [    AM = AN,    ]    indicating that ( M ) and ( N ) are the same point. Therefore, ( k_1 ) and ( k_2 ) touch at this common point ( M = N ). 8. **Generalization:**    This argument holds for any such incircle pair within the tetrahedron, proving that all four incircles corresponding to the tetrahedron's faces touch each other in pairs. 9. **Existence of the Common Sphere:**    Since all face-incircles touch pairwise, they lie on the same sphere. Therefore, this sphere, called the edge-incircle, touches all the edges of the tetrahedron. 10. **Final Implication:**     Since the necessary and sufficient conditions are satisfied, we conclude that the given edge length equality in the tetrahedron guarantees the existence of an edge-insphere (edge-incircle). # Conclusion: The tetrahedron indeed has an edge-incircle if and only if the sums of the lengths of opposite edges are equal for all three pairs, thereby satisfactorily proving the given statement.

We solve this system of linear equations by using the elimination or substitution method. We can subtract the second equation from the first equation to get:    [    (A + 3B - 5C) - (A + B + C) = 0     2B - 6C = 0     B - 3C = 0 implies B = 3C    ] 7.

This gives us: [a cdot ab < b cdot ab] Simplifying, we get: [a^2 < b^2] Since ab > 0, dividing both sides by ab (which is positive and thus preserves the inequality direction) gives: [frac{a^2}{ab} < frac{b^2}{ab}] Simplifying further, we obtain: [frac{a}{b} < frac{b}{a}] Taking the reciprocal of both sides (which reverses the inequality because both fractions are negative) yields: [frac{1}{a} > frac{1}{b}] Thus, option A is correct. **Option B: a^2 > b^2** Given a < b < 0, taking the square of both a and b (which is a non-decreasing function for all real numbers) gives: [a^2 > b^2] This is because, in the negative number range, a smaller number (further from zero) squared becomes larger than a larger number (closer to zero) squared. Thus, option B is correct. **Option C: ac^2 > bc^2** This option depends on the value of c. When c=0, we have: [ac^2 = 0] [bc^2 = 0] Thus, ac^2 = bc^2, making option C incorrect because it does not hold for all values of c. **Option D: ab > b^2** Given a < b < 0, multiplying both sides of the inequality by b (which is negative, thus reversing the inequality direction) gives: [ab > b^2] This is because multiplying by a negative number reverses the inequality. Thus, option D is correct. Therefore, the correct options are A, B, and D.

First, we determine the total number of ways to choose 4 articles of clothing out of the drawer. There are 6 shirts, 7 pairs of shorts, and 8 pairs of socks, making a total of (6 + 7 + 8 = 21) articles.    - The total number of combinations for choosing 4 articles from 21 is (binom{21}{4}). Using the formula for combinations, (binom{n}{k} = frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}), we find (binom{21}{4} = frac{21 times 20 times 19 times 18}{4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 5985). 2. Next, calculate the combinations where the selection includes exactly two shirts, one pair of shorts, and one pair of socks:    - Ways to choose 2 shirts from 6: (binom{6}{2} = 15)    - Ways to choose 1 pair of shorts from 7: (binom{7}{1} = 7)    - Ways to choose 1 pair of socks from 8: (binom{8}{1} = 8)    - Therefore, the total favorable outcomes are (15 times 7 times 8 = 840). 3.

Here are the steps required: 1. **Identify Parameters**:    - Each side of the rhombus has length (5).    - The lengths of the diagonals are such that one diagonal's half is not greater than 6 and the other half is not smaller than 6. 2. **Express Diagonal Halves**:    - Let the lengths of the diagonals of the rhombus be (2a) and (2b) where (a leq b). 3. **Diagonal Relationship**:    - According to the properties of the rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. So, we use the Pythagorean theorem on half diagonals in each right triangle formed:      [      a^2 + b^2 = 25 quad ( text{as } 5^2 = 25)      ]    - Solving for (b), where (b) is the longer half diagonal:      [      b = sqrt{25 - a^2}      ] 4. **Sum of Halves**:    - We need to find the maximum sum of the two halves of the diagonals (a + b).

This means that for any quadratic residue ( b in mathbb{F}_p ), ( b-c ) must also be a quadratic residue. 5. **Implication of the assumption**: If ( b ) is a quadratic residue, then ( b-c ) being a quadratic residue implies that the set of quadratic residues is closed under subtraction by ( c ).  6. **Contradiction**: Consider the set of quadratic residues modulo ( p ). There are exactly ( frac{p-1}{2} ) quadratic residues and ( frac{p-1}{2} ) non-residues. If every quadratic residue ( b ) implies ( b-c ) is also a quadratic residue, then ( c ) must map residues to residues and non-residues to non-residues. However, this would imply that ( c ) acts as a permutation on the set of residues and non-residues, which is not possible because it would mean that all elements of ( mathbb{F}_p ) are quadratic residues, contradicting the fact that there are non-residues. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, our assumption must be false. Hence, there exists an ( a in mathbb{F}_p ) such that ( a+c ) is a quadratic residue while ( a ) is not.

Any integer (a_i) is congruent to one of (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ) or (8 mod{9}).        However, for any integer (a_i):    - If (a_i equiv 0 pmod{3}), then (a_i^3 equiv 0^3 equiv 0 pmod{9}).    - If (a_i equiv pm1 pmod{3}), then (a_i^3 equiv (pm1)^3 equiv pm1 pmod{9}).        Thus, the cube of an integer when taken modulo 9 can only possibly be (0, 1,) or (-1). 2. **Argument by contradiction:**    Suppose none of (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4,) and (a_5) are divisible by (3). This means every (a_i equiv pm1 pmod{3}).    Because of the nature of cubes discussed above, we have:    - Each (a_{i}^{3} pmod{9}) will also be congruent to (pm1 pmod{9}). 3. **Sum of cubes analysis:**        Let’s denote the sum of the cubes as (S = a_{1}^{3} + a_{2}^{3} + a_{3}^{3} + a_{4}^{3} + a_{5}^{3}):        If none of (a_i)'s are divisible by 3:        (a_{1}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9})     (a_{2}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9})     (a_{3}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9})     (a_{4}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9})     (a_{5}^{3} equiv pm1 pmod{9}) 4. **Considering combinations:**    If we take the sum (S):    - When we sum five terms each (pm1), the possible results are ( pm5) or (pm3) modulo 9.    - There is no combination where the sum can be 0 modulo 9 when choosing (pm1) suitably. 5. **Conclusion:**    If (S equiv 0 pmod{9}), this contradicts our earlier observation since summing (pm1) five times cannot yield 0 modulo 9.

Define a transformation called \\"re-sticking\\" which involves cutting a triangle ABC along its median AM and reassembling the resulting triangles ABM and ACM along the segments BM and CM into a new triangle with sides AB, AC, and 2AM. # Detailed Steps and Explanation: 1. **Definition and Notation**:    - We define our elementary triangle Delta as having sides 1, 1, and sqrt{2}.    - We propose a re-sticking operation which conserves the area and the property of integer sides in squared length. 2. **Re-sticking and Properties**:    - A re-sticking operation on any elementary triangle delta produces another elementary triangle due to the following:      - The area remains frac{1}{2}.      - From the formula for the length of the medians AM = frac{1}{2} sqrt{2b^2 + 2c^2 - a^2}, we infer that the squares of the sides remain integers.    3. **Procedure to Obtain Delta**:    - Any triangle delta that has an obtuse angle can be cut along the median from the obtuse angle vertex, yielding two triangles with reduced maximum side lengths.    - Repeating this operation eventually yields a right or acute triangle since the squares of integer sides ensure that the side lengths are reduced systematically.    - Specifically, when the resulting triangle's largest possible side is unit length, and the triangle must be a right triangle with side lengths 1, 1, and sqrt{2} (our elementary Delta). 4. **Inverse Re-sticking**:    - Since any triangle delta can be converted to Delta via re-sticking, the reverse is also true. Hence, Delta can be converted back into any delta through similar operations. 5. **Wrapping a Square**:    - Define a triangle as a wrapper if it can encase a square of side frac{1}{2} such that any two points on a side of this square can be aligned with two points on the triangle sides equidistant from the mid-point.    - The elementary triangle Delta can wrap the square as described by the median lines parallel to the original sides.    6. **Generalization**:    - Suppose the triangle delta = ABC is a wrapper, with AM as one of its medians.    - By assuming A as a reference point and folding all points along BC equidistantly from M, we ensure that the configuration provides for a perfect wrap. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The triangle } delta text{ can be transformed and wrapped around a square of area } frac{1}{4} text{ using re-sticking operations.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Julie is reading a 120page book.

This means that the remaining pages after today's reading are ( 42 times 2 = 84 ) pages. So, the number of pages she read today is ( 108 - 84 = 24 ) pages. Now, we need to find the ratio of the number of pages she read today to the number of pages she read yesterday. The number of pages she read today is 24, and the number of pages she read yesterday is 12. The ratio is ( frac{24}{12} = 2 ).

Since the wind resistance varies between 3 mph and 5 mph, we can take the average of these two values to estimate the effect of wind resistance on his speed: Average wind resistance = (3 mph + 5 mph) / 2 Average wind resistance = 8 mph / 2 Average wind resistance = 4 mph Since wind resistance slows him down, we need to add this to his average speed to find out how much faster he needs to go to compensate for the wind resistance: Speed needed to compensate for wind resistance = Average speed + Average wind resistance Speed needed to compensate for wind resistance = 36 mph + 4 mph Speed needed to compensate for wind resistance = 40 mph However, Timmy already knows he needs to go 40 mph to make it to the top of the ramp without considering wind resistance.

Determine, in terms of  n , the maximal possible number of colours that are present.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We are given an ( n times n times n ) cube composed of ( n^3 ) unit cubes, each painted with one color. For each ( n times n times 1 ) box (in any of the three possible orientations), we consider the set of colors present in that box. We need to determine the maximal possible number of colors that can be present under the condition that for every set in any group, the same set appears in both of the other groups. 2. **Construction:**    Assign coordinates to the cubes. We put the color in ((a,b,c)) in ((c,a,b)) and ((b,c,a)) as well for distinct integers (a, b, c). For distinct integers (a, b), we also put the color in ((a,a,b)) in ((b,b,a)), the color in ((a,b,a)) in ((b,a,b)), and the color in ((b,a,a)) in ((a,b,b)). If two cells don't fit any of these cases, we give them different colors. This yields the needed number of colors. 3. **Verification of Construction:**    Consider the color of any cube with (x) coordinates equal to (a), where (a) is any integer. Our construction guarantees there must be a cube with (y) coordinate equal to (a) as well as a cube with (z) coordinate equal to (a) both sharing the same color; furthermore, any cube with that color must have one of its coordinates equal to (a). By symmetry, any set of colors in a box satisfies the constraint so the construction works. 4. **Bounding the Number of Colors:**    We loosen the constraint by allowing cells to be empty, i.e., not be assigned any color at all. We prove with induction on (n ge 1). The base case is trivial.    - **Base Case:**      For (n = 1), the cube is (1 times 1 times 1) and contains only one color. This is trivially true.    - **Inductive Step:**      Assume the statement is true for (n = k). Now consider an ( (n+1) times (n+1) times (n+1) ) cube. Remove an ( (n+1) times (n+1) times 1 ) box, an ( (n+1) times 1 times (n+1) ) box, and a ( 1 times (n+1) times (n+1) ) box that have the same set of colors. This removes at most ( (n+1)^2 ) colors. Also, make any remaining cells with colors that were part of the removed set of cells blank. Then the resulting ( n times n times n ) cube still satisfies the restrictions and induct down. 5. **Summing the Colors:**    The maximal number of colors is given by the sum of squares of the first (n) integers:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} i^2 = frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}    ] The final answer is (boxed{frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}})"},{"instruction":"triangle ABC, the lengths of sides a and b are the two roots of the equation x^{2}5x+2=0, and angle C=60^{circ}.

Point O is the point that divides the segment XY into two equal parts. So,    [    O = frac{X + Y}{2}    ] 3. Next, consider the points X_1 and Y_1 which are symmetric to X and Y respectively with respect to the other point. Specifically,    [    X_1 = 2Y - X quad text{and} quad Y_1 = 2X - Y    ] 4. Now we have the points X, Y, O, X_1, and Y_1 on the line. Note that each of X_1 and Y_1 is also precisely defined relative to X and Y. 5. Given that the line is colored in two colors, either each of the points O, X_1, or Y_1 will share the same color as X and Y, or they will have a different color. 6. Consider the following cases:    - **Case 1**: One of the points O, X_1, or Y_1 is colored the same as X and Y.       - If O is colored red (the same color as X and Y), then X, O, and Y form the required triplet of red points because O is the midpoint of XY.      - If X_1 is colored red, consider the point X_1. Now the points X, Y, and X_1 include the points symmetric to each other, and by construction, they are equidistantly placed.      - If Y_1 is colored red, the reasoning follows similarly: The symmetric placement, together with X and Y, ensures that X, Y, and Y_1 meet the requirements if considered symmetrically.    - **Case 2**: All three points O, X_1, and Y_1 are colored the different color (let's say blue).       - In this scenario, consider the points X, O, and X_1. Because O and X_1 are blue, a similar construction involving symmetries guarantees that O's coloring and numeric placement fulfill the objective. By analyzing these cases, we conclude that whatever the layout of colors, at least one configuration will comprise three collinear points A, B, and C such that B is the midpoint of AC and all the points A, B, and C share the same color.

Let ( n ) be the number of white triangles in the division of the convex 2017-gon. Therefore, there will be ( 3n ) sides of the white triangles because each triangle has 3 sides. 2.

Given that the 2017-gon's each side must be a part of one of the black triangles, we need to account for these sides within our general discussion of the triangles' arrangement. 3. Consider the total number of sides in this triangulation. There will be ( 3n ) white edges and ( 2017 ) black edges in total. 4. We also know that each black triangle will share its edges with either other black triangles or white triangles and the total number of sides of these triangles can be expressed as ( 3n + 2017 ) because:    - ( 3n ) comes from the white triangles.    - ( 2017 ) comes from the sides of the 2017-gon which must be edges of some black triangles. 5.

(3) Prove that a^{2}3b > 0 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for f(x) to have three distinct zeros.","output":"(1) The derivative of the function f(x)=x^{3}+ax^{2}+bx+c is f'(x)=3x^{2}+2ax+b.   Therefore, the slope of the tangent line to y=f(x) at the point (0,f(0)) is k=f'(0)=b.   Since the tangency point is (0,c), the equation of the tangent line is y=bx+c.   [boxed{y=bx+c}] (2) Let a=b=4, then f(x)=x^{3}+4x^{2}+4x+c.   By setting f(x)=0, we obtain -c=x^{3}+4x^{2}+4x.   Consider the function g(x)=x^{3}+4x^{2}+4x and its derivative g'(x)=3x^{2}+8x+4=(x+2)(3x+2).   When x > -frac{2}{3} or x < -2, we have g'(x) > 0 and thus g(x) is increasing;   When -2 < x < -frac{2}{3}, we have g'(x) < 0 and g(x) is decreasing.   Thus, g(x) attains its maximum value at x=-2, which is 0, and   g(x) attains its minimum value at x=-frac{2}{3}, which is -frac{32}{27}.   For f(x) to have three distinct zeros, it must hold that -frac{32}{27} < -c < 0,   which solves to 0 < c < frac{32}{27}.   Therefore, the range for c is (0, frac{32}{27}).   [boxed{c in left(0, frac{32}{27}right)}] (3) To prove: If f(x) has three distinct zeros, it implies the graph of f(x) intersects the x-axis at three different points.   This means that f(x) has three monotonic intervals,   which in turn implies that the derivative f'(x)=3x^{2}+2ax+b intersects the x-axis at two points.   One can deduce that the discriminant Delta > 0, which is 4a^{2}-12b > 0, simplifying to a^{2}-3b > 0.   If a^{2}-3b > 0, then the derivative f'(x)=3x^{2}+2ax+b intersects the x-axis at two points.   But when c=0 and a=b=4, which satisfies a^{2}-3b > 0,   we have f(x)=x(x+2)^{2}, whose graph intersects the x-axis at (0,0) and (-2,0). In this case, f(x) has only two distinct zeros.

What time will it take to pass a platform of 250 m long?","output":"To calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the platform, we first need to determine the total distance the train needs to cover. This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform. Length of the train = 480 m Length of the platform = 250 m Total distance to cover = Length of the train + Length of the platform Total distance to cover = 480 m + 250 m = 730 m Next, we need to convert the speed of the train from km/hr to m/s to be consistent with the distance units (meters). Speed of the train = 60 km/hr To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s Speed of the train in m/s = 60 km/hr * (1000 m / 3600 s) Speed of the train in m/s = 60 * (1000 / 3600) Speed of the train in m/s = 60 * (5 / 18) Speed of the train in m/s = 16.67 m/s (approximately) Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the platform using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time to pass the platform = Total distance to cover / Speed of the train in m/s Time to pass the platform = 730 m / 16.67 m/s Time to pass the platform ≈ 43.8 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{43.8}  seconds for the train to pass the platform."},{"instruction":") Can a sphere of a certain radius intersect the faces of some regular tetrahedron to form circles with radii 1, 2, 3, and 4? b) The same question for a sphere with a radius of 5.","output":"**(a)** The question is whether a sphere of a particular radius can intersect the faces of a regular tetrahedron to form circles of radii 1, 2, 3, and 4.  1. **Initial Setup**: Consider a regular tetrahedron. 2. **Sphere Radius**: Let's start with a sphere that intersects the tetrahedron's faces at circles of radii greater than 4. 3. **Adjusting the Sphere's Radius**:     - Gradually reduce the radius of the sphere such that circles of radius 4 are formed on at least one face of the tetrahedron.      - This is achieved by moving one of the tetrahedron's faces farther from the center of the sphere while maintaining the regularity of the tetrahedron. 4. **Ensuring Irregularity of the Circle Radii**:     - Continue adjusting the remaining faces similarly.     - This ensures that circles of radius 3, 2, and 1 are formed on the other faces without changing the fact that the tetrahedron remains regular. 5. **Conclusion**: By successively adjusting the faces, it is possible to achieve the desired circle radii on all four faces. **(b)** Now, consider the sphere with radius 5. 1. **Sphere and Tetrahedron Alignment**: Let the sphere center be denoted as (O) and the radius be 5.  2. **Inscribing the Sphere**: Enclose this sphere within a regular tetrahedron. 3. **Identifying Contact Points**: Identify the points on the sphere where it touches the faces of the tetrahedron. 4. **Constructing the Tetrahedron**:     - For each point of contact, draw a plane perpendicular to the radius passing through these points.     - These planes intersect the sphere forming circles. 5. **Circle Radii**: It must be demonstrated that these planes intersect the sphere to form circles of radii 1, 2, 3, and 4. 6. **Ensuring Non-Intersection**:     - Ensuring these circles do not intersect: This is necessary so each circle's plane contributes to forming a tetrahedron face.     - Consider the scenario where circles of radius 3 and 4 might touch: Note that these circles would only touch if the angles between the corresponding radii were perpendicular (forming a right triangle with sides 3, 4, and 5). However, because the actual angles are obtuse in this setup, the circles will not intersect. **Conclusion**: Thus, a sphere can be used to form circles of radii 1, 2, 3, and 4 on the faces of a regular tetrahedron in both provided scenarios.

Given that:    [    O_1 O_2 = r_1 + r_2 = 23 + 46 = 69,    ]    [    O_1 O_3 = r_1 + r_3 = 23 + 69 = 92,    ]    [    O_2 O_3 = r_2 + r_3 = 46 + 69 = 115,    ]    triangle ( triangle O_1 O_2 O_3 ) is a right triangle, where ( O_1 O_2 ) is perpendicular to ( O_1 O_3 ). 3. Next, assign a coordinate system where ( O_1 ) is at the origin ((0, 0)), ( O_2 ) is at ((69, 0)), and ( O_3 ) is at ((0, 92)). 4. The coordinates of point ( C ) are ((x, y)). We then have the following distances from ( C ) to ( O_1 ), ( O_2 ), and ( O_3 ):    [    CO_1 = r_1 + R = 23 + R,    ]    [    CO_2 = r_2 + R = 46 + R,    ]    [    CO_3 = r_3 + R = 69 + R.    ] 5. Use the distance formula to set up equations for ( x ) and ( y ):    [    sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 23 + R,     ]    [    sqrt{(x - 69)^2 + y^2} = 46 + R,    ]    [    sqrt{x^2 + (y - 92)^2} = 69 + R.    ] 6. Solving these equations involves squaring each one to eliminate the square roots. Start with the first two equations:    [    x^2 + y^2 = (23 + R)^2,    ]    [    (x - 69)^2 + y^2 = (46 + R)^2.    ] 7. Expand and substitute the first equation into the second:    [    (x - 69)^2 + y^2 = 46^2 + 92R + R^2,    ]    [    (x - 69)^2 + (23 + R)^2 - x^2 = 46^2 + 92R + R^2,    ]    [    x^2 - 138x + 69^2 + (23 + R)^2 - x^2 = 46^2 + 92R + R^2,    ]    [    -138x + 4761 + 529 + 46R + R^2 = 46^2 + 92R + R^2,    ]    [    -138x + 5290 + 46R = 2116 + 92R,    ]    [    -138x = 2116 + 46R - 92R - 5290,    ]    [    -138x = -3174 - 46R,    ]    [    x = frac{3174 + 46R}{138},    ]    [    x = frac{1587 + 23R}{69}.    ] 8. Similarly, solving another pair of squared equations gives:    [    sqrt{x^2 + (y - 92)^2} = 69 + R,    ]    leads to    [    y^2 - 184y + 8464 = 4761 + 48R + 4R^2,    ]    Combine and simplify:    [    y^2 - 184y + 3703 = 3R^2 + 144R.    ] 9. Finally, solving for (x) and (y) once again involving re-substitution yields:    [    23R^2 + 132rR - 36r^2 = 0,    ] 10.

We know there are 22 white, 5 yellow, 6 red, and 9 purple balls. So the total number of red and purple balls is 6 + 9 = 15. The probability that a ball chosen at random will be neither red nor purple is 0.75. This means that the probability of choosing a red or purple ball is 1 - 0.75 = 0.25. Since there are 15 red and purple balls, and the probability of choosing one of them is 0.25, we can set up the following equation: (15 / 60) = 0.25 Now, we want to find the number of green balls, which means we want to find the number of balls that are not red or purple. We can calculate the total number of balls that are not red or purple by subtracting the number of red and purple balls from the total number of balls: Total not red or purple = Total balls - Red balls - Purple balls Total not red or purple = 60 - 15 Total not red or purple = 45 Since the probability of choosing a ball that is neither red nor purple is 0.75, we can say that 0.75 of the total number of balls are not red or purple: 0.75 * 60 = 45 We already know that there are 22 white and 5 yellow balls, so the number of green balls can be found by subtracting the number of white and yellow balls from the total number of balls that are not red or purple: G = Total not red or purple - White balls - Yellow balls G = 45 - 22 - 5 G = 18 Therefore, there are boxed{18}  green balls in the bag."},{"instruction":"What is the hundreds digit of (20!15!)? textbf{(A) }0qquadtextbf{(B) }1qquadtextbf{(C) }2qquadtextbf{(D) }4qquadtextbf{(E) }5","output":"To find the hundreds digit of (20! - 15!), we need to analyze the factorials and their properties modulo 1000. 1. **Factorial Properties**:    - n!

Let's break down the solution step by step. 1. **Identify the form of ( m ):**    We are given a hint that ( m ) should be of the form ( 13k + 1 ) and ( m neq 8191 ). This suggests that ( m ) is a prime number of the form ( 13k + 1 ). 2. **Understand the significance of 8191:**    Notice that ( 8191 = 2^{13} - 1 ). This is a Mersenne prime, which means it is a prime number of the form ( 2^p - 1 ) where ( p ) is also a prime number. 3. **Use properties of divisors:**    Since ( 8191 = 2^{13} - 1 ), it follows that ( 8191 ) divides ( 2^{13k} - 1 ) for any integer ( k ). This is because ( 2^{13k} - 1 ) can be factored as ((2^{13})^k - 1), and by the properties of exponents and divisors, ( 2^{13} - 1 ) divides ((2^{13})^k - 1). 4. **Apply Fermat's Little Theorem:**    Fermat's Little Theorem states that if ( p ) is a prime number and ( a ) is an integer not divisible by ( p ), then ( a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). For our purposes, let ( a = 2 ) and ( p = m ). Since ( m ) is a prime number, we have:    [    2^{m-1} equiv 1 pmod{m}    ]    This implies that ( m ) divides ( 2^{m-1} - 1 ). 5. **Combine the results:**    We need ( dfrac{2^{m-1} - 1}{8191m} ) to be an integer. From the above steps, we know:    - ( 8191 ) divides ( 2^{13k} - 1 )    - ( m ) divides ( 2^{m-1} - 1 )    For ( m = 13k + 1 ), we have:    [    2^{m-1} - 1 = 2^{13k} - 1    ]    Since ( 8191 ) divides ( 2^{13k} - 1 ) and ( m ) divides ( 2^{m-1} - 1 ), it follows that ( dfrac{2^{m-1} - 1}{8191m} ) is an integer. 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, for any prime number ( m ) of the form ( 13k + 1 ) where ( m neq 8191 ), the expression (dfrac{2^{m-1} - 1}{8191m}) is an integer.
