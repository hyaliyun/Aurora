Prove that there exist two mutually perpendicular lines l and l^{*} that divide the shape Φ into four parts of equal area.","output":":   Part (a): 1. **Setting Up the Problem**:     - Let us consider a plane with two convex shapes Phi_1 and Phi_2.      - We need to prove that there exists a line l that simultaneously divides both Phi_1 and Phi_2 into two regions of equal area. 2. **Choosing a Coordinate System**:     - Select a direction O X on the plane to serve as a reference for measuring angles.     - Any direction O Y can be defined by an angle alpha, which is measured counterclockwise from O X (Fig. 160). 3. **Finding Division Line for Phi_1**:     - For each angle alpha, there is a unique line l(alpha) parallel to the direction O Y that divides the area of Phi_1 into two equal parts. 4. **Area Considerations of Phi_2**:     - Suppose this line l(alpha) divides Phi_2 into two parts with areas S_1(alpha) (right of l(alpha)) and S_2(alpha) (left of l(alpha)):       [       S_1(alpha) - S_2(alpha) > 0       ] 5. **Changing the Angle**:     - If we replace alpha by alpha + 180^circ, the line l(alpha + 180^circ) coincides with l(alpha) but has an opposite direction.

Part (b): 1. **Defining the Convex Shape**:     - Let Phi be any convex figure on the plane.      - We have to prove that there exist two mutually perpendicular lines l and l^{*} that divide Phi into four regions of equal area. 2. **Choosing a Coordinate System**:     - Select a direction O X as the initial reference direction. An angle alpha is measured from O X to generate the parallel direction O Y. 3. **Finding the First Division Line**:     - For each direction O Y (defined by angle alpha), there exists a unique line l(alpha) parallel to O Y that divides the area of Phi into two equal parts. 4. **Finding the Perpendicular Division Line**:     - There is also a unique line l^{*} perpendicular to l(alpha) (that is, direction O X becomes O Y and vice versa), which also divides the area of Phi into two equal parts. 5. **Area Considerations**:     - Let S_1(alpha), S_2(alpha), S_3(alpha), S_4(alpha) be the areas of the four parts created by the intersection of l(alpha) and l^{*}:       [       S_1(alpha) + S_2(alpha) = S_3(alpha) + S_4(alpha)       ]       [       S_1(alpha) + S_4(alpha) = S_2(alpha) + S_3(alpha)       ]       Therefore:       [       S_2(alpha) = S_4(alpha) quad text{and} quad S_1(alpha) = S_3(alpha)       ] 6. **Finding Equal Division**:     - To ensure the four regions are equal, it must hold that S_1(alpha) = S_2(alpha). Assume for now S_1(alpha) > S_2(alpha):       [       S_1(alpha) - S_2(alpha) > 0       ] 7. **Rotating the Division Lines**:     - Rotating l(alpha) and l^{*} by 90^circ results in new lines.       [       S_1(alpha + 90^circ) = S_2(alpha), quad S_2(alpha + 90^circ) = S_1(alpha)       ]       [       S_1(alpha + 90^circ) - S_2(alpha + 90^circ) = S_2(alpha) - S_1(alpha) < 0       ] 8. **Application of Intermediate Value Theorem**:       There exists some angle alpha_0 for which:       [       S_1(alpha_0) - S_2(alpha_0) = 0       ] 9. **Conclusion for Part (b)**:     - Therefore, the mutually perpendicular lines l(alpha_0) and l^{*}(alpha_0) divide Phi into four equal parts. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"A man said to his son, I am some times as old as you were when I was as old as you are.

This is because if ( x ) were divisible by ( p ), then ( x equiv 0 pmod{p} ) and ( x^2 equiv 0 pmod{p} ), leading to ( x^2 + 1 equiv 1 pmod{p} ), which is not divisible by ( p ). 3. **Applying Fermat’s Little Theorem:**    By Fermat’s Little Theorem, for any integer ( a ) where ( p ) does not divide ( a ), we have:    [    a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}.    ]    In our case, we consider ( a = x ).

Does there exist a subset A of M such that every element in M can be uniquely represented as the sum of a finite number of distinct elements from A?","output":"The problem is to determine whether there exists a subset ( A ) of ( M ), where ( M ) is the set of all rational numbers in the open interval ((0,1)), such that every element in ( M ) can be uniquely expressed as a finite sum of distinct elements from ( A ). To solve this, let's first assume there exists such a subset ( A ). Then we obtain the following conditions: 1. For every ( a in A ), there does not exist ( b in A ) such that ( frac{a}{2} < b < a ). 2. Additionally, ( A ) has a maximum element, say ( a_1 ). After removing ( a_1 ), the set ( A ) still has a maximum element, say ( a_2 ). From our assumptions, we know ( a_2 leq frac{a_1}{2} ). Let's explore these conditions further:  Step-by-step detail: i) Suppose ( a_2 < frac{a_1}{2} ). Define ( m = frac{a_1}{2} - a_2 ). Consider the number ( a_1 - m ). By our assumption, it should be expressible as a sum of distinct elements from ( A ). However, ( a_1 - m ) would be: [ a_1 - m = a_1 - (frac{a_1}{2} - a_2) = frac{a_1}{2} + a_2 ] Since ( a_2 ) and any further elements would have to be strictly less than ( a_2 ), thus: [ a_2 + a_3 + a_4 + cdots leq a_2 + frac{a_2}{2} + frac{a_2}{2^2} + cdots ] Using the infinite geometric series sum formula on the right-hand side, we find: [ a_2 + frac{a_2}{2} + frac{a_2}{4} + cdots = 2 a_2 ] As a result, [ a_1 - m = frac{a_1}{2} + a_2 < a_1 - 2m ] Given that: [ 2a_2 < a_1 - m ] This leads to a contradiction, hence this case ( a_2 < frac{a_1}{2} ) is not possible. ii) If ( a_2 = frac{a_1}{2} ), we need to consider ( a_3 ) and its relationship to ( frac{a_2}{2} ). If ( a_3 < frac{a_2}{2} ), we can similarly lead to a contradiction, as done in (i). Consequently, this forces the pattern: ( a_n = frac{1}{2^{n-1}} a_1 ), for ( n = 1, 2, 3, ldots ). Finally, let's prove ( frac{1}{3} a_1 ) cannot be represented as a sum of a finite number of distinct elements of ( A ): Suppose, [ frac{1}{3}a_1 = a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + cdots + a_{i_m} = a_1 sum_{j=1}^{m} frac{1}{2^{i_j - 1}} ] This implies: [ frac{1}{3} = sum_{j=1}^{m} frac{1}{2^{i_j-1}} ] This is a limited sum of terms of the form ( frac{1}{2^{i_j-1}} ), yielding a finite decimal, contradicting the fact that ( frac{1}{3} ) is not a finite sum of such powers.

The mouse jumped 20 inches farther than the frog, so the mouse's initial jump distance is: 29 inches + 20 inches = 49 inches However, the mouse encountered an obstacle that reduced its jump by 5 inches, so the mouse's actual jump distance is: 49 inches - 5 inches = 44 inches The squirrel jumped 7 inches less than the mouse, so the squirrel's initial jump distance is: 44 inches - 7 inches = 37 inches The squirrel faced a 2-inch obstacle, so its actual jump distance is: 37 inches - 2 inches = 35 inches Now, to find out how much farther the mouse jumped than the grasshopper, considering the obstacles they encountered, we subtract the grasshopper's actual jump distance from the mouse's actual jump distance: 44 inches (mouse) - 16 inches (grasshopper) = 28 inches The mouse jumped boxed{28}  inches farther than the grasshopper, considering the obstacles they encountered."},{"instruction":"Sally has a gold credit card with a certain spending limit, a platinum card with twice the spending limit of the gold card, and a diamond card with three times the spending limit of the gold card.

The platinum card has twice the spending limit of the gold card, so its limit is 2G. The diamond card has three times the spending limit of the gold card, so its limit is 3G. Initially, Sally has a balance on her gold card that is 1/3 of G, which is G/3. On her platinum card, she has a balance that is 1/6 of 2G, which simplifies to G/3 (since 2G/6 = G/3). On her diamond card, she has a balance that is 1/9 of 3G, which simplifies to G/3 (since 3G/9 = G/3). When Sally transfers the entire balance from her gold card to her platinum card, the new balance on the platinum card becomes G/3 (initial balance) + G/3 (transferred balance) = 2G/3. Then, she transfers half of the new balance on the platinum card to her diamond card. Half of 2G/3 is 2G/3 divided by 2, which is G/3. After transferring G/3 to the diamond card, the remaining balance on the platinum card is 2G/3 (previous balance) - G/3 (transferred balance) = G/3. The spending limit on the platinum card is 2G, and the remaining balance after the transfers is G/3. To find the portion of the limit on the platinum card that remains unspent, we subtract the remaining balance from the limit: Unspent limit on platinum card = Limit - Balance Unspent limit on platinum card = 2G - G/3 To subtract these, we need a common denominator, which is 3: Unspent limit on platinum card = (2G * 3/3) - G/3 Unspent limit on platinum card = 6G/3 - G/3 Unspent limit on platinum card = (6G - G)/3 Unspent limit on platinum card = 5G/3 Now, to find the portion of the limit that remains unspent, we divide the unspent limit by the total limit: Portion unspent = (5G/3) / (2G) Portion unspent = (5/3) / 2 Portion unspent = 5/3 * 1/2 Portion unspent = 5/6 So, after the transactions, boxed{5/6}  of the limit on the platinum card will remain unspent."},{"instruction":"triangle (ABC), the angle bisectors of angles (A) and (B) intersect at point (M).

We can use some fundamental properties about points lying on angle bisectors. 1. **Bisector Property**:     - Points on the bisector of an angle are equidistant from the sides of the angle. Formally, if a point lies on the bisector of angle BAC, then it is equidistant from AB and AC.      - Similarly, if a point lies on the bisector of angle ABC, then it is equidistant from BA and BC. 2. **Application to Point M**:     - Since M is the intersection of the angle bisectors of angle A and angle B, we know that M is equidistant from the sides AC and AB (from the bisector of angle A) and it is equidistant from the sides AB and BC (from the bisector of angle B). 3. **Equidistance from All Sides**:     - Since M is equidistant from AC and AB, and also equidistant from AB and BC, we conclude that M is equidistant from all three sides AC, AB, and BC. 4. **Conclusion from Equidistance**:     - A point that is equidistant from all three sides of a triangle must lie on the angle bisector of the third angle as well. Hence, if M is equidistant from AC, AB, and BC, it must lie on the bisector of angle C. Therefore, the point M lies on the bisectors of all three angles of triangle ABC.

Imagine a square grid on the plane where the diagonal of each square is (m). Since the diagonal is the maximum distance within a square, each square can contain at most 2 points of the given set (as any pair of points in a square must be at most (m) apart). 4. Let (Q) be one of the given points. Draw a circle centered at (Q) with radius (M). No point outside this circle can be within distance (M) of (Q), because (M) is the maximal distance. 5.

From each of these points, we draw perpendiculars to all the lines formed by connecting the remaining four points in pairs. What is the maximum number of intersection points of these perpendiculars, excluding the given five points?","output":"1. **Identifying the number of lines:**     The given five points in a plane are pairwise connected by lines. The total number of these lines can be calculated using the combination formula for choosing 2 points out of 5:     [     binom{5}{2} = frac{5 cdot 4}{2 cdot 1} = 10.     ]     Therefore, there are 10 lines connecting the 5 points. 2. **Calculating the perpendiculars:**          For each of the 10 lines, three perpendiculars can be drawn from the remaining three points.     Thus, the total number of perpendiculars is:     [     10 cdot 3 = 30.     ]     These perpendiculars are distinct based on the given conditions. 3. **Finding intersections of perpendiculars:**          Consider pairs of lines from the original 10 lines. Each pair of lines (where each line is perpendicular to three other lines) will have 9 intersection points:     [     3 cdot 3 = 9.     ]     The number of ways to choose 2 lines out of 10 is given by (binom{10}{2}):     [     binom{10}{2} = frac{10 cdot 9}{2 cdot 1} = 45.     ]     Thus, the total number of intersections is:     [     45 cdot 9 = 405.     ] 4. **Correcting for intersections at original given points:**     Each original point is the intersection of all perpendiculars from that point. Each point has 6 such perpendiculars (drawn to the lines connecting the remaining 4 points, with combinations (binom{4}{2} = 6)):     [     binom{4}{2} = frac{4 cdot 3}{2 cdot 1} = 6.     ]     For each original point (5 points), there are:     [     binom{6}{2} = frac{6 cdot 5}{2 cdot 1} = 15.     ]     So, the total number of intersections at the original points is:     [     5 cdot 15 = 75.     ] 5. **Correcting for intersections at orthocenters of triangles:**     Each triangle formed by selecting 3 out of 5 points has an orthocenter. The total number of such triangles is also (binom{5}{3} = 10):     [     binom{5}{3} = frac{5 cdot 4 cdot 3}{3 cdot 2 cdot 1} = 10.     ]     Each orthocenter will have the perpendiculars intersecting and every triangle has 3 such perpendiculars:     [     10 cdot 2.     ]     Thus, the number of reductions due to orthocenters is:     [     10 times 2 = 20.     ] 6. **Final Calculation:**          The maximum number of intersection points of the perpendiculars, after accounting for the intersections at original points and orthocenters, is:     [     405 - 75 - 20 = 310.     ]          Hence, the maximum number of distinct intersection points of these perpendiculars, not considering the original five points, is:     [     boxed{310}.     ]"},{"instruction":"Mikey had 356.0 leaves.

If Jack will weigh 180 pounds in approximately 45 months, that means he will lose an additional 198 - 180 = 18 pounds. The total weight Jack will have lost from his starting weight to when he reaches 180 pounds is 24 + 18 = 42 pounds. Now, we know that it will take Jack 45 months to lose 42 pounds. To find the average monthly weight loss, we divide the total weight loss by the number of months: 42 pounds / 45 months = 0.9333 pounds per month (approximately). Now we can calculate how many months it took Jack to lose the 24 pounds: 24 pounds / 0.9333 pounds per month = 25.7143 months (approximately).

The key is to transform the given equation into a problem of finding the intersection points of two functions and then using the derivative to investigate these points on the interval. Let's consider the equation xln x - kx + 1 = 0 as a function of x and rewrite it as: ln x + frac{1}{x} = k. Define the function f(x) = ln x + frac{1}{x}. To find the conditions for which the equation xln x - kx + 1 = 0 has two distinct real roots in the interval left[frac{1}{e}, eright], we need to determine when the horizontal line y = k intersects the graph of f(x) at two distinct points within the interval. To find where the function f(x) has extrema, we take its derivative, f'(x) = frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{x^2}. Setting f'(x) = 0 to find the critical points, we get frac{1}{x} - frac{1}{x^2} = 0 implies x = 1. Now, we examine the behavior of f'(x) on intervals. For x in left[frac{1}{e}, 1right), we have f'(x) < 0, which means f(x) is decreasing, and for x in left[1, eright), we have f'(x) > 0, indicating that f(x) is increasing. The minimum value of the function f(x) is at x = 1: f(1) = ln 1 + frac{1}{1} = 1. The maximum value can be obtained by evaluating f(x) at the endpoints of the interval: fleft(frac{1}{e}right) = lnleft(frac{1}{e}right) + e = -1 + e, f(e) = ln e + frac{1}{e} = 1 + frac{1}{e}. For the equation xln x - kx + 1 = 0 to have two distinct real roots in the interval left[frac{1}{e}, eright], the range of k must satisfy the condition that y = k intersects the graph of f(x) between its minimum and maximum values.

We can represent the students as vertices in a graph, and each match between two students as an edge between two vertices.

This is maximized when ( |A| = 22 ).    - Therefore, the number of edges is ( 22 cdot (2017 - 22) = 22 cdot 1995 = 43890 ). In both cases, the maximum number of edges is 43890.

We will focus on proving that there exists a vertex ( B_j ) (( j = 2 ) or ( 3 )) such that ( XY < AB_j ). 2. **Step 2: Connecting point ( X ) to point ( Y ) and evaluating angles**    Consider line segment ( AY ). The diagram reveals that either ( angle AYB_2 ) or ( angle AYB_3 ) must be larger than or equal to a right angle (i.e., ( angle AYB_2 geq 90^circ ) or ( angle AYB_3 geq 90^circ )). 3. **Step 3: Extending the line and finding the intersection**    Extend the line ( AY ) to intersect the line segment ( B_1B_3 ) (or ( B_1B_2 )) at point ( T ).

We start with the given recurrence relation for the sequence ( (a_n) ):    [    a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + sqrt{a_{n+1} + a_n}    ] 2.

From the above definition, we re-write the recurrence relation expressions as follows. Using the form ( b_{n+1} ) for clarity, we get:    [    (a_{n+2} + a_{n+1}) = b_{n+1}^2    ]    Since:    [    a_{n+2} = a_{n+1} + b_n    ]    We substitute ( a_{n+2} ):    [    (a_{n+1} + b_n) + a_{n+1} = b_{n+1}^2    ] 4.

This implies that the sequence ( (b_n) ) is also strictly increasing:    [    b_{n+1} > b_n    ] 7. Since ( b_n ) is strictly increasing:    [    b_{n}^2 < b_{n+1}^2 < (b_{n}+1)^2    ] 8.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:     [     a_k = frac{a_{k-p} + a_{k+p}}{2}     ] 10. Therefore, the term (a_k) is indeed the arithmetic mean of the terms (a_{k-p}) and (a_{k+p}).

If the ycoordinate of the midpoint of segment PQ is 1, find the maximum area of triangle OPQ.","output":"(Ⅰ) Since point A lies on parabola C and |AO|=|AF|=frac{3}{2}, we have that the distance from A to the origin O and the distance from A to the focus F are equal. Therefore, the length from the vertex of the parabola (origin) to the focus is equal to frac{p}{2}, and the additional length from the focus to the point A on the curve is frac{p}{4}. Thus, the total distance frac{p}{4} + frac{p}{2} = frac{p}{4} + 2 cdot frac{p}{4} = 3 cdot frac{p}{4} = frac{3}{2}. This gives us p = 2. As a result, the equation of parabola C is x^2 = 4y. (Ⅱ) Now let's consider a straight line with the equation y = kx + b that intersects the parabola at points P and Q. Substituting the line equation into the parabola's equation, we get x^2 - 4kx - 4b = 0. Let P(x_1, y_1) and Q(x_2, y_2). Then we have x_1 + x_2 = 4k, giving us y_1 + y_2 = 4k^2 + 2b. Given that the midpoint of PQ has the y-coordinate equal to 1, 2k^2 + b = 1. The area S of the triangle OPQ can be expressed as half the product of base (the length of segment PQ) and altitude (the y-coordinate of P or Q, in this case b). Using the midpoint theorem for the segment, the length of PQ is sqrt{(x_1 - x_2)^2 + (y_1 - y_2)^2}, which simplifies to sqrt{16k^2 + 16b}. So we can express the area as S = frac{1}{2} cdot b cdot sqrt{16k^2 + 16b} = bsqrt{2 + 2b} = sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{b^3 + b^2}, where 0 < b leq 1 because the midpoint must lie above the x-axis and on or below the parabola. Let's define y = b^3 + b^2. Differentiating this with respect to b gives us y' = 3b^2 + 2b, which is always positive for b > 0.

By completing the square on the right-hand side, we have:    [    f(x^2) = f(x)^2 - 2x f(x) = (f(x) - x)^2 - x^2    ]    Hence,    [    f(x^2) + x^2 = (f(x) - x)^2    ] 2. **Symmetry and Considering Negatives:**    Notice that the left-hand side ( f(x^2) + x^2 ) is invariant under the transformation ( x mapsto -x ). Therefore, we also have:    [    f((-x)^2) + (-x)^2 = (f(-x) + x)^2    ]    Since ( f(x^2) = f((-x)^2) ), we get:    [    (f(-x) + x)^2 = (f(x) - x)^2    ] 3. **Solving the Symmetric Condition:**    From the symmetric condition, we have two possibilities:    [    f(-x) + x = f(x) - x quad text{or} quad f(-x) + x = -(f(x) - x)    ]    The second case ( f(-x) + x = -(f(x) - x) ) implies ( f(-x) = -f(x) ), which is impossible since ( f ) takes positive values.

Yet the point B_{1} has n lines, thus for the remaining points, possible lines reduce:    [    (k - n) n    ]    These contributions come from two segregating parts:        - Total lines considering max points from mathrm{A}:    [    k(3m-k)    ]    - Additional lines among rest points from B_{1} scenario are less critical contributions but less max points:      [      (k-n)n      ] 6. **Combining both segments:**    Thus, the complete relation can be formed as:    [    left(-n-frac{k}{2}right)^{2} + frac{3}{4}(k-2m)^2 + 3m^{2} leq 3m^{2}    ]    The total number of line segments possible satisfying these properties:    [    left( -n - frac{k}{2} right)^{2} - frac{3}{4}(k - 2m)^2 geq 1 rightarrow numbers  sum  cannot exceed 3m^{2}    ] 7. **Contradiction arises:**    Given that our original hypothetical assumes maximum points unlikely:    [    3m^{2} yields 3m^{2} + 1    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    Our assumption that no tetrahedron exists implies falsely leading contradiction, thus proving there must exist at least 1 tetrahedron:     [boxed{text{The given points form at least one tetrahedron}}]"},{"instruction":"Simplify frac {1}{2}(2 overrightarrow {a}+8 overrightarrow {b})(4 overrightarrow {a}2 overrightarrow {b}) Options: A: 3 overrightarrow {a}3 overrightarrow {b} B: 3 overrightarrow {b}3 overrightarrow {a} C: 6 overrightarrow {a}3 overrightarrow {b} D: 6 overrightarrow {b}3 overrightarrow {a}","output":"From the given problem, we have frac {1}{2}(2 overrightarrow {a}+8 overrightarrow {b})-(4 overrightarrow {a}-2 overrightarrow {b}) = overrightarrow {a}+4 overrightarrow {b}-4 overrightarrow {a}+2 overrightarrow {b} = -3 overrightarrow {a}+6 overrightarrow {b} Therefore, the original expression equals 6 overrightarrow {b}-3 overrightarrow {a}.

Clearly, we may assume P is nonconstant with a positive leading coefficient. Fix P and fix constants n_0, c > 0 such that ( c = P(n_0) > 0 ). We are going to prove that infinitely many terms of the sequence are at most c. We start with the following lemma. **Claim:** For each integer n geq 2, there exists an integer r = r(n) such that: - For any prime p which is at most n, we have (nu_p(P(r))=nu_p(c)). - We have: [ c cdot prod_{text{prime } p leq n} p leq r leq 2c cdot prod_{text{prime } p leq n} p ] **Proof of the Claim:** This follows by the Chinese Remainder Theorem: for each ( p leq n ) we require ( r equiv n_0 pmod{p^{nu_p(c)+1}} ), which guarantees ( nu_p(P(r)) = nu_p(P(n_0)) = nu_p(c) ). Then there exists such an r modulo prod_{p leq n} p^{nu_p(c)+1} as needed. Assume for contradiction that all a_i are eventually larger than c. Take n large enough that n > c and r = r(n) has a_r > c. Then consider the term a_r: 1. Using the conditions in the lemma, it follows that there exists a prime p_n > n which divides ( a_r = operatorname{gcd}(P(r), tau(P(r))) ) (otherwise, a_r, which divides P(r), is at most c). 2. As p_n divides tau(P(r)), this forces P(r) to be divisible by (at least) q_n^{p_n-1} for some prime q_n. 3. For the small primes p at most n, we have nu_p(P(r)) = nu_p(c) < c < n leq p_n - 1. It follows that q_n > n. 4. Ergo: [     P(r) geq q_n^{p_n-1} > n^n. ] In other words, for large enough n, we have the asymptotic estimate: [ begin{aligned}     n^n & < P(r) = O(1) cdot r^{deg P}          & = O(1) cdot c^{deg P} cdot prod_{text{prime }p leq n} p^{deg P}          & < O(1) cdot n^{deg P cdot pi(n)} end{aligned} ] where pi(n) denotes the number of primes less than n. For large enough n, this is impossible since the primes have zero density: [     lim_{n to infty} frac{pi(n)}{n}=0. ] **Remark:** For completeness, we outline a short elementary proof that: [     lim_{n to infty} frac{pi(n)}{n} = 0. ] For integers ( M > 0 ) define: [     delta(M) := prod_{p leq M} left(1 - frac{1}{p}right). ] Then (pi(n) < delta(M) n + prod_{p leq M} p), so it suffices to check that: [     lim_{M to infty} delta(M) = 0. ] But: [ begin{aligned}     frac{1}{delta(M)} & = prod_{p leq M} left(1 - frac{1}{p}right)^{-1}                          & = prod_{p leq M} left(1 + frac{1}{p} + frac{1}{p^2} + ldotsright)                          & geq 1 + frac{1}{2} + cdots + frac{1}{M} end{aligned} ] which diverges for large M.

We are interested in finding the probability of drawing at least one blue ball from Box A, which can be represented as event A. This event includes the cases where either one or two blue balls are drawn, thus A = A_{1} cup A_{2}, and since A_{1} and A_{2} are mutually exclusive events, we can add their probabilities to find P(A). - The probability of drawing exactly one blue ball (A_{1}) involves choosing 1 blue ball out of 4 and 1 red ball out of 2. The total ways to draw 2 balls out of 6 is the denominator:   P(A_{1}) = frac{{C}_{4}^{1}{C}_{2}^{1}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} - The probability of drawing exactly two blue balls (A_{2}) involves choosing 2 blue balls out of 4. No red balls are chosen in this case:   P(A_{2}) = frac{{C}_{4}^{2}{C}_{2}^{0}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} Combining these probabilities gives us the total probability of drawing at least one blue ball from Box A: P(A) = P(A_{1}) + P(A_{2}) = frac{{C}_{4}^{1}{C}_{2}^{1}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} + frac{{C}_{4}^{2}{C}_{2}^{0}}{{C}_{6}^{2}} = frac{14}{15} Therefore, the probability of drawing at least one blue ball from Box A is boxed{frac{14}{15}}.

We call such a chamber isolated in the group. 2. **Count the one-way tunnels:**     - Number the chambers and assume that (a_{k}) one-way tunnels lead away from the (k)-th chamber.      - There are (binom{25}{2} - 50 = 250) one-way tunnels.     - Therefore, (a_{1} + ldots + a_{25} = 250), because each one-way tunnel leads out of exactly one chamber. 3. **Calculate unconnected groups:**     - The (k)-th chamber is isolated in exactly (binom{a_{k}}{3}) groups of four, so there are at least       [       X = binom{a_{1}}{3} + binom{a_{2}}{3} + ldots + binom{a_{25}}{3}       ]       unconnected groups of four. 4. **Minimize (X):**     - We claim that (X) assumes the smallest possible value if all (a_{k}) are the same size.      - If ( r - 2 geq s geq 0 ), then a quick calculation shows:       [       binom{r}{3} + binom{s}{3} > binom{r-1}{3} + binom{s+1}{3} Longleftrightarrow (r-1)(r-2) > s(s-1)       ]       and the latter is true by assumption.

Using the identity:    [    tan frac{alpha}{2} = frac{r}{s-a}, quad tan frac{beta}{2} = frac{r}{s-b}, quad cot frac{gamma}{2} = frac{s-c}{r}    ]    We get:    [    sum_{text{cyc}} frac{r}{s-a} cdot frac{r}{s-b} cdot frac{s-c}{r} = sum_{text{cyc}} frac{r(s-c)}{(s-a)(s-b)}    ] 7. **Using the AM-GM inequality:**    Applying the AM-GM inequality:    [    sum_{text{cyc}} frac{r(s-c)}{(s-a)(s-b)} geq 3 sqrt[3]{frac{r(s-a) cdot r(s-b) cdot r(s-c)}{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}} = 3 sqrt[3]{frac{r^3}{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}}    ] 8. **Final comparison:**    Since ( r leq frac{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}{s} ), we have:    [    3 sqrt[3]{frac{r^3}{(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)}} geq sqrt{3}    ]    This completes the proof.

We can approach this problem using a recursive method similar to the Fibonacci sequence. 1. **Define the problem recursively:**    Let ( f(n) ) be the number of valid ways to color a strip of length ( n ). We can observe that:    - If the last section is red, the first ( n-1 ) sections can be colored in any valid way, which is ( f(n-1) ).    - If the last section is white, the second last section must be red (to avoid two consecutive whites), and the first ( n-2 ) sections can be colored in any valid way, which is ( f(n-2) ).    Therefore, the recurrence relation is:    [    f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2)    ] 2. **Base cases:**    - For ( n = 1 ), there are 2 ways to color the strip: either red or white. So, ( f(1) = 2 ).    - For ( n = 2 ), there are 3 ways to color the strip: red-red, red-white, or white-red. So, ( f(2) = 3 ). 3. **Compute ( f(n) ) for ( n = 9 ):**    Using the recurrence relation and the base cases, we can compute the values step by step:    [    begin{align*}    f(3) &= f(2) + f(1) = 3 + 2 = 5     f(4) &= f(3) + f(2) = 5 + 3 = 8     f(5) &= f(4) + f(3) = 8 + 5 = 13     f(6) &= f(5) + f(4) = 13 + 8 = 21     f(7) &= f(6) + f(5) = 21 + 13 = 34     f(8) &= f(7) + f(6) = 34 + 21 = 55     f(9) &= f(8) + f(7) = 55 + 34 = 89    end{align*}    ] Thus, the number of ways to color the strip of 9 sections such that no two consecutive sections are white is ( 89 ).

Let us consider two shapes: a square ABCD and a rectangle AB_1C_1D_1 with equal perimeters and a shared vertex ( A ). 2. We aim to show that the point (O) where the diagonals of the rectangle intersect is equidistant from the sides (AB) and (BC) of the square. 3. From the problem, it follows that AB_1 + AD_1 = AB + AD. Since AB = AD for a square, we have BB_1 = DD_1. 4. Now consider the perpendiculars from (O) to the sides (AB) and (BC), denoted as (OM) and (OK), respectively. 5. Point (O) being the midpoint of (B_1D_1), implies:    [    OM = frac{1}{2}AD_1     ]    since (OM) is the midline in triangle (AB_1D_1).     6. To find (OK), note that:        [    OK = frac{1}{2}AB_1 - BB_1.    ]    Given that (BB_1 = DD_1) and (AD=AB):        [    OK = frac{1}{2}AB_1 - BB_1 = frac{1}{2}(AB + BB_1) - BB_1 = frac{1}{2}AD_1.    ] 7. Thus, we have shown that (O) is equidistant from (AB) and (BC), meaning point (O) lies on the diagonal (BD) of the square (ABCD). **Second method:** 1. Choose a Cartesian coordinate system such that the shared vertex (A) of the square (ABCD) and rectangle (AB_1C_1D_1) is at the origin ((0,0)), and both figures lie in the first quadrant.     2. Then, the coordinates of the vertices of the rectangle and the square are:         [    B_1(0, b), quad C_1(a, b), quad D_1(a, 0)    ] 3. The point (O), where the diagonals of the rectangle intersect, has coordinates:        [    Oleft(frac{a}{2}, frac{b}{2}right)    ] 4. The diagonal (BD) of the square is represented by the equation:        [    x + y = c    ]    where (c) is the side length of the square.     5. Given the perimeters are equal, we have:        [    2(a + b) = 4c quad Rightarrow quad c = frac{a}{2} + frac{b}{2}    ] 6. Substituting (c) into the equation of the diagonal, we get:        [    x + y = frac{a}{2} + frac{b}{2}    ] 7. Plugging in the coordinates of (O):        [    left(frac{a}{2}, frac{b}{2}right)    ]    verifies:        [    frac{a}{2} + frac{b}{2} = frac{a}{2} + frac{b}{2}    ] 8.

Since 2k_0 is an integer (because k_0 is an integer and the set of integers is closed under multiplication), we can say that x can also be represented in the form of elements in B, which is x = frac{k}{3} + frac{1}{2}, where k = 2k_0. Therefore, every element in C can be found in B, which means C subseteq B. 2. **Checking if B subseteq A:** Given x in B, we have x = frac{k_1}{3} + frac{1}{2} for some k_1 in mathbb{Z}.

We will use the example of a hexagonal prism to demonstrate the solution. 1. **Vertices, Edges, and Faces Calculation:**     - A hexagonal prism has two hexagonal bases, each with 6 vertices, and 6 rectangular faces connecting corresponding vertices of the two hexagons.     - Therefore, the total number of vertices ( V ) is:       [       V = 6 text{ (vertices on top)} + 6 text{ (vertices on bottom)} = 12       ]     - The number of edges ( E ) consists of:         - 6 edges on the top hexagon,         - 6 edges on the bottom hexagon,         - 6 edges connecting the corresponding vertices of the top and bottom hexagons.       Hence, the total number of edges ( E ) is:       [       E = 6 + 6 + 6 = 18       ]     - The number of faces ( F ) includes:         - 2 hexagonal faces,         - 6 rectangular faces.

Prove that A_1, B_1, and C_1 are the midpoints of the sides of triangle ABC. 1. We begin by recalling some relationships involving the tangents from a point to the incircle and excircles of a triangle. For a triangle ABC, the semiperimeter is denoted by s = frac{a+b+c}{2}, and the distances from the vertices to the points where the incircle touches the sides are s - a, s - b, and s - c. Therefore:     [     AE_2 = AE_3 = s - a, quad BE_1 = BE_3 = s - b, quad CE_1 = CE_2 = s - c     ] 2. Similarly, for the excircle opposite the side c:     [     AG_2 = AG_3 = s - b, quad BG_1 = BG_3 = s - a, quad CG_1 = CG_2 = s     ] 3. Using the properties of similar triangles and the tangential segments, we find relationships for perimeter equivalency. For example, considering circles inscribed in triangles formed by the midpoints, we denote various points and distances accordingly on Figure 1. 4. Given that the perimeter of smaller triangles formed by A_1, B_1, C_1 being equal to half the perimeter of ABC, we write the relationships for the sides of triangles involving midpoints F_1, F_2, F_3:         [     E_1F_1 = s - F_2F_3 quad text{where } E_1 text{ is the point of tangency}     ]     [     EF_1 = s - CF_1 quad text{where } E text{ is the touchpoint for the excircle}     ]     Since CF_1 = F_2F_3, we deduce that E_1 = E, confirming the tangents and circles touch similarly at specified points. 5. Consider geometrically addressing the equivalence of the smaller triangles. If A_1, B_1, C_1 are not midpoints, by calculating areas and tangential relationships, equivalency fails unless they lie at the midpoints. 6.

We aim to find the maximum number of numbers that could remain on the board under such a condition. 3. Observe that the difference between any two even numbers is even, and the difference between any two odd numbers is also even. The difference between an even and an odd number is odd. Therefore, if we only consider the odd numbers, the difference between any two odd numbers will be even. 4.

Therefore, the total diagonal of square PQRS is: [ 5 + 2 times frac{5sqrt{3}}{2} = 5 + 5sqrt{3}. ] Since square PQRS is formed with its diagonal being rotated 90 degrees and every side equalling this value, the area of square PQRS is: [ text{Area} = frac{1}{2} times (5 + 5sqrt{3})^2 = frac{1}{2} times (25 + 50sqrt{3} + 75) = frac{1}{2} times (100 + 50sqrt{3}) = 50 + 25sqrt{3}. ] Thus, the area of PQRS is boxed{50 + 25sqrt{3}}."},{"instruction":"Blossom measures three rooms in her house.

The total percentage of his income spent on household items and medicines is 50% + 15% = 65%. The remaining percentage of his income, which he saves, can be calculated as follows: Savings = I - (Household expenses + Medicine expenses + Clothes expenses) 9000 = 90000 - (0.50 * 90000 + 0.15 * 90000 + Clothes expenses) 9000 = 90000 - (45000 + 13500 + Clothes expenses) 9000 = 90000 - 58500 - Clothes expenses 9000 = 31500 - Clothes expenses Now, let's solve for the Clothes expenses: Clothes expenses = 31500 - 9000 Clothes expenses = 22500 Now, to find the percentage of income spent on clothes, we divide the Clothes expenses by the total income and multiply by 100: Percentage spent on clothes = (Clothes expenses / I) * 100 Percentage spent on clothes = (22500 / 90000) * 100 Percentage spent on clothes = 0.25 * 100 Percentage spent on clothes = 25% So, Ajay spends boxed{25%}  of his income on buying clothes."},{"instruction":"Simplify frac{5}{4y^{4}} cdot frac{4y^{3}}{3}.","output":"Firstly, rewrite frac{5}{4y^{-4}} as frac{5y^4}{4}.

In the Heavenly Stems and Earthly Branches chronology system, a heavenly stem and an earthly branch are paired in order, with the heavenly stem first and the earthly branch last.

We use the formula for remainder to find the position in the cycle:    [    67 mod 10 = 7    ]    This means we move 7 positions back in the cycle of heavenly stems from \\"Gui\\". Counting backwards from \\"Gui\\" (10th position), we reach \\"Bing\\" as the heavenly stem for the establishment year. 2. **Earthly Branches Cycle**: The earthly branches cycle every 12 years. Since 2023 is also the \\"Gui Mao\\" year, and \\"Mao\\" is part of the earthly branches, we calculate the branch for the establishment year similarly by going back 67 years. We use the formula for remainder to find the position in the cycle:    [    67 mod 12 = 7    ]    This means we move 7 positions back in the cycle of earthly branches from \\"Mao\\". However, there seems to be a mistake in the standard solution regarding the earthly branch calculation. Since \\"Mao\\" is the earthly branch in 2023, and we are calculating based on the cycle, the correct approach should focus on finding the branch 67 years prior, not directly stating it as \\"Shen\\" without showing the calculation from \\"Mao\\". Given the cycles and the mistake in the standard solution's explanation for the earthly branch, we correct the approach as follows: - Since \\"Mao\\" is the 4th branch in a 12-year cycle, and we know 67 mod 12 = 7, we should correctly identify the branch for the establishment year by counting backwards from \\"Mao\\", or correctly adjust the explanation to align with the calculation for a 67-year difference.

(All prisoners know that there are 2 red and 3 green hats in total and they are all good at mathematics.)","output":"Let's analyze the situation step-by-step to determine the color of the first prisoner's hat. 1. **Initial Setup:**    - The warden has 2 red hats and 3 green hats.    - The prisoners are put in a row:      - The first prisoner cannot see any hats.      - The second prisoner can see the hat of the first prisoner.      - The third prisoner can see the hats of both the first and the second prisoner. 2. **Silence of the Third Prisoner:**    - Consider the third prisoner who can see the hats of both the first and second prisoners.    - If the third prisoner sees two red hats, he would instantly know his own hat must be green (because the total number of red hats is 2).    - However, the third prisoner remains silent. This implies he does not see two red hats. Therefore, at least one of the first two prisoners must be wearing a green hat. 3. **Silence of the Second Prisoner:**    - Now consider the second prisoner who can only see the hat of the first prisoner.    - Since the third prisoner was silent, the second prisoner deduces that the third does not see two red hats.    - If the first prisoner had a red hat and the second prisoner was silent, it suggests uncertainty on the part of the second prisoner regarding the second red hat. The second prisoner would remain silent only if he sees a green hat on the first prisoner or if both are uncertain. 4. **Conclusion of the First Prisoner:**    - Given that both the second and third prisoners remained silent, the first prisoner (who sees no hats) must deduce the situation.    - The silence of the second prisoner indicates that the hat of the first prisoner cannot be red. If it had been red, the second prisoner would conclude his own hat must be green (since there would only be one red left unaccounted for, and seeing a red on the first prisoner means he must be green).

For any cell on the board, the number of cells sharing at least one common vertex and having the same color as the given cell is odd. We need to determine all pairs of natural numbers ( m ) and ( n ) for which this condition is possible. # Analysis: 1. **Definitions and Initial Setup:**    - Let's call cells sharing a common vertex as \\"neighboring cells.\\"    - We need to prove that either ( m ) or ( n ) must be even to satisfy this board coloring condition. 2. **Construct an Example with Even Dimensions:**    - Assume ( m ) is even (the same argument applies if ( n ) is even).    - Paint the rows alternately in blocks of two rows: The first and second rows in black, third and fourth rows in white, fifth and sixth rows in black, and so forth. This creates 2-row stripes of uniform color.    - Consider a stripe of dimensions ( 2 times n ):      - Corner cells of this stripe have exactly 3 neighboring cells of the same color.      - Non-corner cells of this stripe have exactly 5 neighboring cells of the same color.      - Since all counts are odd, this setup satisfies the given condition for the board. 3. **Proving No Solution Exists for Odd Dimensions:**    - Assume both ( m ) and ( n ) are odd.    - The total number of cells on the board is odd.    - Hence, the number of cells of one color (say black) is also odd.    - Let's denote the set of black cells by ( mathcal{B} ).

This allows us to calculate the lengths of segments FG, EF, and EG based on the geometry of the cube and the given information that E, F, and G are midpoints of A_{1}B_{1}, BB_{1}, and BC respectively. 1. **Calculating FG:** Since G is the midpoint of BC and F is the midpoint of BB_{1}, the segment FG forms a right triangle with the side BB_{1} and half of BC. Therefore, FG = sqrt{a^2 + a^2} = sqrt{2}a. 2. **Calculating EF:** Similarly, EF is the diagonal of the face A_{1}B_{1}B_{1}B, where E and F are midpoints, making EF also equal to sqrt{2}a. 3. **Calculating EG:** For EG, since E is the midpoint of A_{1}B_{1} and G is the midpoint of BC, EG is a space diagonal of a rectangular box with dimensions a, 2a, and a. Thus, EG = sqrt{a^2 + (2a)^2 + a^2} = sqrt{6}a. With these lengths, we can calculate the cosine of angle EFG using the law of cosines: [ cos angle EFG = frac{EF^2 + FG^2 - EG^2}{2 times EF times FG} = frac{2a^2 + 2a^2 - 6a^2}{2 times sqrt{2}a times sqrt{2}a} = -frac{1}{2} ] This calculation shows that angle EFG = 120^{circ} and, by the properties of triangles, angle EGF = 30^{circ}. Therefore, we have angle EFG = 4angle EGF. - **Option A:** boxed{text{A}} is correct because angle EFG = 4angle EGF. - **Option B:** Since the plane EGF is parallel to the plane CD_{1}B_{1}, and considering the geometry of the cube, the plane EGF indeed makes equal angles with each face of the cube. Therefore, boxed{text{B}} is correct. - **Option C:** Given that FG and ED_{1} are not in the same plane, it's clear that points E, F, G, D_{1} are not coplanar, making option C incorrect. - **Option D:** The distances from C and D_{1} to the plane EFG are equal because CD_{1} is parallel to the plane EFG.

R = frac{c}{2sin C} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{2 times frac{sqrt{3}}{2}} = 2. Therefore, the radius of the circumcircle of triangle ABC is boxed{2}.  Part (2): Finding the range of values for frac{c}{{a+b}} Using the Law of Sines, we establish: 1. frac{b}{sin B} = frac{a}{sin A} = frac{c}{sin C} = 4. This allows us to express a+b as: 2. a+b = 4sin A + 4sin (frac{2π}{3}-A) = 4sin A + 4(frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos A + frac{1}{2}sin A) = 6sin A + 2sqrt{3}cos A = 4sqrt{3}sin (A+frac{π}{6}). Given A in (0, frac{2π}{3}), we find that: 3. A+frac{π}{6} in (frac{π}{6}, frac{5π}{6}), which implies sin (A+frac{π}{6}) in (frac{1}{2}, 1]. Therefore, the range of a+b is: 4. a+b in (2sqrt{3}, 4sqrt{3}]. Finally, the range of frac{c}{{a+b}} is: 5. frac{c}{a+b} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{4sqrt{3}sin(A+frac{π}{6})} in [frac{1}{2}, 1). Thus, the range of values for frac{c}{{a+b}} is boxed{[frac{1}{2}, 1)}."},{"instruction":"Given that alpha is an angle in the fourth quadrant, and cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight) = frac{4}{5}, then tanalpha = ______.","output":"Since alpha is an angle in the fourth quadrant, and cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight) = -sinalpha = frac{4}{5}, it follows that sinalpha = -frac{4}{5}.

This is only possible if the common ratio, q, of the geometric sequence is negative. Thus, we have: [q < 0] 2. **Condition ② Analysis:** Given |a_{n}| > |a_{n+1}|, it indicates that the absolute value of each term is decreasing as n increases. For a geometric sequence, this means the absolute value of the common ratio, |q|, must be less than 1 to ensure the magnitude of each subsequent term decreases. Therefore: [|q| < 1] Combining the conclusions from the analysis of both conditions, we find that the common ratio q must satisfy: [-1 < q < 0] 3. **Constructing an Example:** To construct a specific example that satisfies both conditions, let's choose a_{1} = 1 (the first term of the sequence) and q = -frac{1}{2} (a common ratio that is negative and whose absolute value is less than 1). The general formula for the n-th term of a geometric sequence is given by: [a_{n} = a_{1} cdot q^{n-1}] Substituting a_{1} = 1 and q = -frac{1}{2}, we get: [a_{n} = 1 cdot left(-frac{1}{2}right)^{n-1} = left(-frac{1}{2}right)^{n-1}] Therefore, the general formula for a geometric sequence that satisfies both given conditions can be represented as boxed{left(-frac{1}{2}right)^{n-1}}.

For each (i) from 1 to 2010, we define (d_{i} = |a_{i} - i|), which measures the absolute difference between the element (a_{i}) and its position (i) within the sequence. 2. **Objective**: We need to determine if it is possible for the values (d_{i}) to be pairwise distinct.  3. **Observation**: Since the (a_i) are distinct integers from 1 to 2010 and must occupy every position exactly once, the (d_i) are absolute values of the differences between these positions and their corresponding values. Thus, (d_i) will vary between 0 and 2009 inclusive. 4. **Distinct Values Assumption**: If the (d_i) are all distinct, they must constitute the entire set ({0, 1, 2, ldots, 2009}). 5. **Sum of (d_i)**:     - Let's sum all (d_i): (d_1 + d_2 + ldots + d_{2010}).     - If (d_i) covers all values from 0 to 2009 exactly once, their sum would be:       [       sum_{i=0}^{2009} i = frac{2009 cdot 2010}{2}       ]       Using the arithmetic series sum formula (sum_{i=0}^{n} i = frac{n(n+1)}{2}). 6. **Sum Modulo 2 Analysis**:     - Calculate the sum modulo 2:       [       sum_{i=0}^{2009} i = frac{2009 cdot 2010}{2}       ]     - Simplifying:       [       2009 cdot 1005       ]     - Since 2009 is odd and 1005 is odd, their product (2009 times 1005) is odd. 7. **Parity Argument**:     - The sum of an odd number of odd terms:       [       frac{2009 cdot 2010}{2} equiv 1 pmod{2}       ] 8. **Contradiction**: The sum of the differences modulo 2 must inherently be an integer, but our analysis shows that it is textit{odd} when instead it would need to be even to maintain the pairwise distinctness of (d_{i}). # Conclusion: Given the modular arithmetic leads to a contradiction, it is not possible for the (d_i) values to be pairwise distinct.

The direction of a line can be described by a vector (a, b, c), indicating steps along each axis. 3. **Valid Vector and Point Calculations**:    Since we require exactly three points per line, the maximum valid values for a, b, c are adjusted to avoid reaching outside the grid. Considering small maximum bounds of the grid, the range for a, b, c narrows to {-1, 0, 1}—preventing the vector from extending out of bounds.     4. **Iterating Through Points and Vectors**:    Starting from each point (i, j, k), increment by vectors (a, b, c) only if this results in three distinct points (i + a, j + b, k + c) and (i + 2a, j + 2b, k + 2c) all remaining within the grid.     5. **Eliminating Symmetry and Redundancy**:    Due to symmetric properties, several starting points and vectors could describe the same line.

Adding the time it took him to become a chief (8 years) and the time to become a master chief (10 years), we get 8 + 10 = 18 years. After becoming a master chief, he spent another 10 years in the military. Therefore, the total time he spent in the military is 18 years + 10 years = 28 years.

For what value of x will the probability of driving through both intersections on Dolgoe highway without stopping at the traffic lights be the highest? What is this maximum probability?","output":"1. We start by defining the probability of passing through each traffic light without stopping:     - The probability of passing through the intersection with Ulitsa Uzka is given by:     [     P_1 = frac{x}{x + 30}     ]     where ( x ) is the duration (in seconds) the light permits movement on Shosse Dolgoe, and 30 seconds is the time allocated for movement on Ulitsa Uzka. 2.

Therefore, without loss of generality, we can treat multiple numbers in sets (A), (B), and (C) as one instance of a number. 3. **Arranging the Numbers**:    - The number 6, which is in set (D), will be our pivot since it has the most restrictive adjacency condition: it must be placed next to numbers in set (A).    - **Positions for 6**:      - The table has 9 cells, and the central cell in a (3 times 3) table has the highest number of adjacent cells (4). Thus, we need to explore the possible ways to arrange numbers such that the 6 is only adjacent to elements of set (A). 4. **Exploring Table Configurations**:    - When 6 (set (D)) is surrounded by numbers in set (A), the remaining numbers from sets (B) and (C) fill the rest of the cells.    - Note that the problem statement mentions multiple configurations:      - **Configuration Types**:        - **Three Adjacent Cells**: When 6 is in the center.        - **Two Adjacent Cells**: When 6 is on the edge but not a corner.        - Arrangements involving flipping and rotating these configurations to cover all unique layouts. 5. **Counting Arrangements**:    - Given that the arrangements can be rotated 90°, 180°, and 270°, this leads to multiple distinct arrangements.    6. **Permutations**:    - Since we initially simplified our problem by treating (3! cdot 3! cdot 2!) configurations as one group,    - The total number of distinct configurations from the previous steps is multiplied by (3! cdot 3! cdot 2!):      [      3! = 6, quad 3! = 6, quad 2! = 2      ]      Thus:      [      28 text{ distinct arrangements} times 6 times 6 times 2 = 2016      ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{2016} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the plane vectors overrightarrow{a}=(x,1) and overrightarrow{b}=(2,3).

Now, let's calculate the actual yield of H2O: The actual yield is given as 80% of the theoretical yield.

How many rooms need to be booked to accommodate all the fans?","output":":  1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We need to accommodate a group of 100 football fans in a hotel, with specific constraints:      - Each room can house up to 3 people.     - Fans must be grouped based on their support for one of three teams and by gender.     - Fans of different teams or different genders cannot share a room. 2. **Classifying the Fans:**    We will classify the fans into six distinct groups:    - Men supporting team A    - Women supporting team A    - Men supporting team B    - Women supporting team B    - Men supporting team C    - Women supporting team C 3. **Dividing Fans Equally:**    Since each room can contain a maximum of 3 people, we need to consider the possible remainders when the number of fans in each group is divided by 3. 4. **Handling Remainders:**    If any group has a remainder when divided by 3, we must allocate additional rooms accordingly:    - If the remainder is 1, we need 1 more room for that leftover fan.    - If the remainder is 2, we need 1 more room for those two fans. 5. **Mathematical Calculation:**    - Let each group have \`n\` fans.    - If each group is perfectly divisible by 3, no extra rooms are needed beyond the division.        To ensure no group has a remainder of 2 or 1 without accommodating those remainders in extra rooms:    Summing up the possible cases:    [    n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + n_5 + n_6 = 100    ]    Each (n_i) is the number of fans in each group.    If ( n_i ≡ 1 (mod 3) ) or ( n_i ≡ 2 (mod 3) ), then we must accommodate those remainders.     6. **Case Analysis:**    Consider the distributions:    - Case 1: All groups perfectly divisible by 3:      - ( sum_{i=1}^{6} (n_i mod 3) = 0 )      - No extra rooms needed beyond the basic allocation.      - E.g., (16, 16, 16, 16, 16, 20) (sum is 90)    - Case 2: Some groups have remainders:      - Each remainder that is 1 or 2 adds an integral amount to sum up perfectly.      - Typically, when adjusting for (sum mod 3 =0) 7. **Final Calculation and ensuring enough rooms:**        - Minimum rooms needed:    [    begin{cases}      text{If sum} equiv 0, needs 30-33 rooms (divided accurately in all cases).      text{Additional rooms} leq 3, as maximal leftover sum is 12 (additional room adjustments).    end{cases}    ] 8. **Concluding Number Analysis:**        Given:    Total additive results from 88 or accurate leftover sum:    The maximal needed: boxed{37}"},{"instruction":"f vector a=(1,x) and b=(2x+3,x) are perpendicular, where xinmathbb{R}, then |ab| equals (    ) A: 2 or 0 B: 2 sqrt{5} C: 2 or 2 sqrt{5} D: 2 or 10","output":"**Analysis** This question examines the coordinate representation of perpendicular vectors and the method of solving for the unknown x using equations.

When Pipe A and the leak are both working at the same time, the effective rate at which the tank is being filled is the rate of Pipe A minus the rate of the leak. Since it takes 4 hours to fill the tank with both the leak and Pipe A working, we can write the following equation: [ frac{1}{T} - frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{4} ] Here, ( frac{1}{T} ) represents the rate at which Pipe A fills the tank (the part of the tank filled in one hour), and ( frac{1}{4} ) represents the rate at which the leak empties the tank (the part of the tank emptied in one hour). The right side of the equation, ( frac{1}{4} ), represents the effective rate at which the tank is being filled when both Pipe A and the leak are working.

So we can write the following equations: 0.80X = 42 0.70X = 49 From the first equation, we can find the value of X: 0.80X = 42 X = 42 / 0.80 X = 52.50 Now we can use the value of X to find the share of w.

Let the reflection of O over e be denoted as O'. The reflected circle will be denoted as k'.    2. **Verify Intersection Points:**    - If the original circle k intersects the line e, then the points of intersection are invariant under reflection over e. Hence, the same points will be on the reflected circle k'.    - If the original circle k is tangent to the line e, the point of tangency remains the same after reflection.    - If the original circle k does not intersect the line e, then the reflected circle k' also does not intersect the line e. 3. **Construct Points O':**    - The point O' is the reflection of O over e. To find O', use the property that O' lies on two circles:      - A circle centered at A with radius equal to the distance OA.      - A circle centered at B with radius equal to the distance OB.    - The intersection point of these two circles, different from O, is the reflection point O'. 4. **Draw Reflected Circle k':**    - Once O' is determined, draw the circle k' centered at O' with radius equal to the radius of circle k. 5. **Intersecting Circles:**    - The intersection points of circle k and its reflection k' are the same as the intersection points of the original circle k with the line e. # Conclusion: The points of intersection between the original circle k and the line e are the same as the points of intersection between circle k and its reflection k'.

Since Tim has 10 gray-bottomed socks and 8 white-bottomed socks, he has a total of 10 + 8 = 18 socks. The number of ways to choose 2 socks from these 18 is given by the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Thus, the total number of ways to pick 2 socks is binom{18}{2} = frac{18!}{2!(18-2)!} = frac{18 times 17}{2 times 1} = 153. Next, we calculate the number of ways Tim can pick a matching pair of socks. For the gray-bottomed socks, there are binom{10}{2} = frac{10!}{2!(10-2)!} = frac{10 times 9}{2 times 1} = 45 ways to pick 2 out of 10. For the white-bottomed socks, there are binom{8}{2} = frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = frac{8 times 7}{2 times 1} = 28 ways to pick 2 out of 8. To find the total number of ways to pick a matching pair, we add the ways to pick gray-bottomed pairs to the ways to pick white-bottomed pairs: 45 + 28 = 73. Finally, the probability that Tim picks a matching pair of socks is the ratio of the number of ways to pick a matching pair to the total number of ways to pick any 2 socks.

Here’s a detailed step-by-step explanation: 1. **Express 14 as ( 13 + 1 ):**    We start by writing:    [    14 = 13 + 1    ] 2. **Expand ( (13 + 1)^n ) using the Binomial Theorem:**    According to the Binomial Theorem, we have:    [    (13 + 1)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} cdot 13^k cdot 1^{n-k}    ]    Since ( 1^{n-k} = 1 ), this simplifies to:    [    (13 + 1)^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} binom{n}{k} cdot 13^k    ] 3. **Reduce modulo 13:**    In modulo 13 arithmetic, all terms containing ( 13 ) as a factor disappear because ( 13 equiv 0 mod 13 ). Therefore, each term ( 13^k ) for ( k geq 1 ) will be 0 modulo 13.

Without loss of generality, let A_4(2) = begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0  a_{21} & a_{22} & a_{23} & a_{24}  a_{31} & a_{32} & a_{33} & a_{34}  a_{41} & a_{42} & a_{43} & a_{44} end{pmatrix}, where sigma_{ij} can be either 0 or 1.

Worker C's work rate is 1 job per 6 hours, or 1/6 of the job per hour. To find the combined work rate, we add the individual work rates together: Combined work rate = Worker A's rate + Worker B's rate + Worker C's rate Combined work rate = (1/4) + (1/10) + (1/6) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 4, 10, and 6 is 60. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 60: Worker A's rate = (1/4) = (15/60) Worker B's rate = (1/10) = (6/60) Worker C's rate = (1/6) = (10/60) Now we can add the fractions: Combined work rate = (15/60) + (6/60) + (10/60) Combined work rate = (15 + 6 + 10) / 60 Combined work rate = 31/60 This means that together, workers A, B, and C can complete 31/60 of the job in one hour.

The first player starts by coloring a square (18 times 18) in one of the corners of the board, specifically along the longer side of the rectangle, ensuring that the axis of symmetry of the square matches the axis of symmetry of the board in such a way that the remaining uncolored board breaks into two symmetric parts.     - Let the board be labeled with coordinates where the origin (0,0) is at the top-left corner.     - The (18 times 18) square would then occupy positions ((1,1)) to ((18,18)). 3.

The existing board's remaining symmetry allows the first player to maintain strategy symmetry because the unfilled portion is symmetric with respect to the original bisecting axis. 5. From this point on, each move by the second player can be mirrored by the first player with respect to the central axis, effectively ensuring that any move the second player makes is counteracted. 6. The second player cannot color any cell on their turn which would prevent a symmetric cell move for the first player since the initial coloring has ensured a larger symmetrical division. 7. Therefore, the strategy for the first player is simply to:     - Initially color a (18 times 18) block to establish the symmetrical remainder.     - Then, for each subsequent move of the second player, mirror that move symmetrically across the main axis of the uncolored portion of the board. 8. Following this strategy ensures the first player will have the last possible cell to color. 9.

Since k is coprime with 6, we know that phi(k), Euler's totient function of k, provides the order modulo k of any integer coprime to k. 2. **Setting Up the Congruences**:    Consider n equiv -1 pmod{phi(k)}.

Therefore, the overall external surface area before modifications is:    [    6 times 16 = 96 text{ square meters}    ] 2. **Determine the area removed and exposed by the holes**:    Each hole is a square of 2 meters on a side but only goes to a depth of 1 meter. Thus, each hole on a face removes 2^2 = 4 square meters. With six holes, the total area initially removed is:    [    6 times 4 = 24 text{ square meters}    ]    However, since these holes do not breach through, this removed area doubles as the internal faces of the holes are exposed.

Given two lines l_{1}: y=3x+m and l_{2}: y=3x+n, for a rectangle to be formed by their intersections with the circle, the center of the circle must be equidistant from both lines. This is because the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other and are equal in length, and in this case, the center of the circle acts as the midpoint of the diagonal.

Therefore, the volume ( V ) of the box is given by:        [    V = (a - 2x)^2 cdot x    ] 3. **Expression for Volume in Terms of ( x )**:    [    V(x) = (60 - 2x)^2 cdot x    ] 4. **Simplify the Volume Function**:    [    V(x) = (60 - 2x)^2 cdot x = (3600 - 240x + 4x^2)x = 3600x - 240x^2 + 4x^3    ] 5. **Find the Critical Points**:    - To find the maximum volume, we need to take the derivative of ( V(x) ) and set it to zero:        [    V'(x) = frac{d}{dx} (3600x - 240x^2 + 4x^3)    ]    Calculating the derivative:    [    V'(x) = 3600 - 480x + 12x^2    ]    Set the derivative to zero to find the critical points:    [    3600 - 480x + 12x^2 = 0    ]    Simplifying:    [    12x^2 - 480x + 3600 = 0    ]    Divide by 12:    [    x^2 - 40x + 300 = 0    ]    Solve the quadratic equation using the quadratic formula ( x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ):    [    x = frac{40 pm sqrt{1600 - 1200}}{2} = frac{40 pm 20}{2}    ]    So we find two solutions:    [    x_1 = frac{60}{2} = 30 quad text{and} quad x_2 = frac{20}{2} = 10     ] 6. **Check Feasibility of Critical Points**:    - If ( x = 30 ), then ( a - 2x = 60 - 60 = 0 ), which is not feasible for the box.    - Therefore, ( x = 10 ) cm is the only feasible solution. 7. **Second Derivative Test**:    - To confirm ( x = 10 ) gives a maximum, we use the second derivative:    [    V''(x) = frac{d}{dx} (3600 - 480x + 12x^2) = -480 + 24x    ]    At ( x = 10 ):    [    V''(10) = -480 + 240 = -240     ]    Since ( V''(10) < 0 ), the function has a local maximum at ( x = 10 ). # Conclusion: Thus, the side length of the squares to be cut out is: [ boxed{10 , text{cm}} ]"},{"instruction":"Jenna is buying concert tickets for her group of five friends.

What percentage of the normal price does the scalper initially offer the tickets for?","output":"Let's break down the costs of the tickets Jenna and her friends have to pay: 1. Jenna buys two tickets from the concert website for 50 each, so that's 2 * 50 = 100. 2. One of Jenna's friends gets a discounted ticket through her job for 60% of the normal price. Since the normal price is 50, the discounted ticket costs 60/100 * 50 = 30. 3. Now, let's denote the percentage of the normal price that the scalper initially offers as P%. The scalper offers to sell two tickets at this percentage of the normal price, but Jenna gets 10 off the total payment. So, the cost of the two tickets from the scalper before the 10 discount is 2 * (P/100) * 50. After the 10 discount, the cost of the two tickets from the scalper is 2 * (P/100) * 50 - 10. 4.

The problem statement provides:    - The second brother ate half of his caramels, so he must have had 2x in total (since he ate x caramels and had x left).    - The fourth brother ate as many caramels as the other three combined. Hence, the fourth brother ate (y + x + y) = 2y + x caramels. 3. Initially, there were 26 caramels and they were distributed among the four brothers. 4. Therefore, the total number of caramels eaten can be written as:    [    y + x + y + (2y + x) = 2x + 4y    ] 5. Since they ate 26 caramels in total, the remaining are:    [    26 - (2x + 4y) = 4x    ] 6.

Since x and y are positive integers, and not equal to 1, we need to test possible values for x and y under these constraints. 8. Since 3x + 2y = 13, and 3x + 2y is an odd number, 3x must also be odd, implying x must be odd. 9.

This proves that sin alpha + cos alpha > 1 is true when alpha is a first quadrant angle, showing that it is a sufficient condition.  Necessity: Given that sin alpha + cos alpha > 1, we explore whether alpha being a first quadrant angle is necessary: 1. From the given inequality, we consider the implications:    [    (sin alpha + cos alpha)^2 = 1 + 2sin alpha cos alpha > 1.    ]     2. This leads to the conclusion that 2sin alpha cos alpha > 0, which implies that both sin alpha and cos alpha must be either positive or negative together. 3. Since sin alpha + cos alpha > 1, it rules out the possibility of alpha being in the third quadrant where both sine and cosine are negative. 4. Thus, for sin alpha + cos alpha > 1 to hold, we require sin alpha > 0 and cos alpha > 0. 5. This condition is satisfied only when alpha is a first quadrant angle, proving that it is a necessary condition.  Conclusion: Since being a first quadrant angle is both a necessary and sufficient condition for sin alpha + cos alpha > 1, the correct choice is: [ boxed{text{C: Necessary and sufficient condition}} ]"},{"instruction":"ABC is an acuteangled triangle.

Hence, (XY parallel BC).     - By similarity, ( frac{PY}{BP} = frac{PX}{CP} ). 7. **Use parallelism and ratios for further deductions:**     - Since (HQ parallel CX), we get ( frac{QQ'}{HQ'} = frac{PX}{CP} ).     - Similarly, since (BY parallel HR), we obtain ( frac{RR'}{HR'} = frac{PY}{BP} ). 8. **Conclude the necessary parallelism:**     - Therefore, ( frac{QQ'}{HQ'} = frac{RR'}{HR'} ), implying that (QR parallel Q'R'). 9. **Conclude the tangency proof:**     - Since the triangle configuration asserts (QR) being parallel to (Q'R') and (PR'HQ') forms a rectangle due to right angles and stated equalities, we can deduce that the circle using (PH) as the diameter indeed touches (BC) tangentially at (H).

At the beginning of the game, there is one stick. The first player breaks this stick into two parts. The players take turns breaking any of the existing sticks into two parts. If, after breaking a stick, a player can form one or more separate triangles from all the existing sticks (each triangle exactly from three sticks), then that player wins. Which of the players (first or second) can guarantee a win regardless of the actions of the other player? 1. **Understanding the Triangular Inequality Condition**:    We note that a triangle can only be formed if the sum of any two sides is greater than the third side. If a player can manage to have three sticks that don't adhere to the triangular inequality, no triangle can be formed. 2. **Initial Setup**:    Let the first player's name be Petya, and the second player's name be Vasya. Initially, there's only one stick. 3. **First Player's Strategy**:    Petya, the first player, breaks the stick into two equal parts each say of length ( l/2 ):    [    text{Initial stick} rightarrow {l/2, l/2}    ] 4. **Second Player's Move**:    When it's Vasya's turn, he can break one of the ( l/2 ) sticks into two parts. Regardless of how he splits the stick, let the resulting pieces be ( a ) and ( b ) where ( a + b = l/2 ):    [    text{Possible scenarios} rightarrow {a, b, l/2}    ] 5. **Subsequent Turns**:    Petya now faces a situation where three sticks of lengths ( a, b, l/2 ) are present. Since ( a leq b leq l/2 ), no single pair of these lengths can form a sum greater than ( l/2 ). Thus, no triangle can be formed:    [    a + b = l/2 text{ and } a leq b leq l/2 implies a + b leq l/2 implies text{No triangle constraint}    ] 6. **Ensuring Symmetry**:    Petya ensures that he mirrors any move made by Vasya such that he always ends up with two symmetric sets of stick lengths. If Vasya were to break any stick again, Petya mimics the action on a corresponding symmetric stick. This leads to configurations maintaining the non-triangle forming arrangement. 7. **Winning Move**:    Petya utilizes the redundant nature of summing operations where, after breaking the sticks, the total number of sticks will be symmetrical in nature. Specifically, for ( n ) rounds of this process, where ( n ) being odd, Petya will always have the capability to dictate the configuration by breaking the last stick such that they still can't form valid triangles. # Conclusion: The first player, Petya, can ensure a win regardless of Vasya’s actions by maintaining symmetrically equal distributions of stick lengths after every turn, effectively preventing the formation of triangles under all circumstances. \`\`\` boxed{text{First player}} \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"For any real number m, the line (m1)x+(2m1)y=m5 always passes through a fixed point __________.","output":"To find the fixed point that the line (m-1)x+(2m-1)y=m-5 always passes through, regardless of the value of m, we can re-write the equation in terms of m: (m-1)x + (2m-1)y = m - 5 This can be rearranged to group the m terms together: (x+2y-1)m - (5 - x - y) = 0 Now, we see that this equation will hold true for all real numbers m if and only if the coefficients of m and the constant term are both zero.

This differs from a square grid where each square shares sides with four neighbors. 2. **Coloring Strategy**: We need to find the least number of colors such that no adjacent hexagons share the same color. From graph theory and the Four Color Theorem, we know that four colors are sufficient to color any planar map. However, due to the hexagon's 6-side adjacency, we need to test if fewer than four colors might suffice. 3. **Experiment with Fewer Colors**:    - **Two Colors**: Attempting to alternate colors like a chessboard fails, as every hexagon meets three others in a single loop, causing a conflict.    - **Three Colors**: Assign colors A, B, and C to the hexagons in repeating rows. The first row could be A-B-C, the second row B-C-A, and the third C-A-B and so on. This pattern avoids any two adjacent hexagons having the same color. 4. **Conclusion**: Three colors are necessary and sufficient to ensure no two adjacent hexagons share the same color, as shown by the pattern and failure of two-color tessellation. boxed{text{Three colors are required}}"},{"instruction":"The farmer had 127 apples.

This can be simplified by first squaring both sides to get rid of the square root: frac{(x - 1)^2 + y^2}{|2 - x|^2} = frac{1}{2}. Assuming x neq 2 (to avoid division by zero), this further simplifies to (x - 1)^2 + y^2 = frac{1}{2}(2 - x)^2. Expanding out the terms yields x^2 - 2x + 1 + y^2 = frac{1}{2}(4 - 4x + x^2).

Determine the proportion of sales for the 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM time slot based on the given sales amount (25,000 RMB). Assume that the histogram provided a visual representation suggesting that the sales from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM are a certain multiple of the sales from 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM.  2.

Let's begin by defining the function f(k), which represents a natural number k after performing the given operation. Specifically, for a natural number k, where k can be factored into primes as k = p_1 p_2 cdots p_n, we compute:    [    f(k) = p_1 + p_2 + cdots + p_n + 1.    ] 2. We next observe the inequality:    [    a + b leq ab quad text{for } a geq 2 text{ and } b geq 2.    ]    Using this inequality, we can show:    [    f(k) leq k + 1.    ] 3. Consider the case where k is odd and f(k) is also odd. If f(f(k)) and subsequent operations continue to yield odd numbers, this creates a finite decreasing sequence of odd numbers, eventually reaching a smallest odd number. At this point, the next application of f yields an even number, suggesting that k is even at some point in the sequence. 4. Let us assume k is even. We consider the following examples:    - For k = 2:      [      f(2) = 3, quad f(3) = 4, quad f(4) = 5, quad f(5) = 6, quad f(6) = 6, quad f(6) = 6, ldots,      ]      resulting in the sequence:      [      3, 4, 5, 6, 6, 6, cdots      ]    - For k = 4:      [      f(4) = 5, quad f(5) = 6, quad f(6) = 6, quad f(6) = 6, ldots,      ]      resulting in the sequence:      [      4, 5, 6, 6, 6, cdots      ]    - For k = 6:      [      f(6) = 6, quad f(6) = 6, quad f(6) = 6, ldots,      ]      resulting in the sequence:      [      6, 6, 6, cdots      ] 5. Now, consider the case when k is an even number such that k geq 8. We show:    [    begin{aligned}    f(k) &= 2 + p_2 + cdots + p_n + 1     &leq 3 + p_2 p_3 cdots p_n     &= 3 + frac{k}{2}     &< k.    end{aligned}    ]    Therefore,    [    f(k) leq k - 1.    ] 6. It follows that:    [    f(f(k)) leq k.    ]    Thus, the sequence {k, f(k), f(f(k)), ldots} only takes values within the interval [1, k+1], ensuring that some value in the sequence must repeat.

We need to prove that there exist two different faces with a common vertex that have the same number written on them.  Steps: 1. **Vertices and Face Distribution**:      - Assign each vertex a number from 1 to 12 because an icosahedron has 12 vertices.     - Let ( S_k ) be the sum of the numbers written on the faces meeting at vertex ( k ). Each vertex connects with 5 faces due to the nature of the icosahedron. 2. **Aggregate Sum Calculation**:     - Each face contribution is counted with each of its three vertices.     - Therefore, the aggregate sum of the numbers, accounting for multiplicity, is three times the actual sum of the numbers on the faces:      [      S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{12} = 3 times 39 = 117.      ] 3. **Average Sum per Vertex**:     - Since there are 12 vertices, the average sum ( frac{S_1 + S_2 + cdots + S_{12}}{12} ) must be calculated as:      [      text{Average sum per vertex} = frac{117}{12} approx 9.75.      ] 4. **Minimum Sum Condition**:     - Each face has non-negative integer numbers, and the smallest possible sum of 5 different non-negative integers is:      [      0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 , (text{from the smallest such numbers on 5 faces meeting at one vertex}).      ] 5. **Contradiction**:     - Since the average sum per vertex should be at least 10 (from the minimum sum condition), there is a contradiction because the calculated average sum per vertex is less than 10.     - This implies that there must be a vertex where the sum of the face numbers surrounding it has to be strictly less than 10, which is impossible by the stated assumptions of the smallest sum. 6. **Conclusion**:     - Therefore, our initial assumption that no two faces sharing a vertex have the same number must be incorrect.     - Hence, there exist at least two different faces that share a common vertex and have the same number written on them.

Step 1: Establish the lower bound for mathrm{k}  We start by proving that: [ mathrm{k} geq leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor ] Consider an n-vertex complete graph mathrm{K}_n which is edge 3-colored. Let the colors be labeled as 1, 2, and 3. Assume partitioning the n vertices into three disjoint sets mathrm{A}, mathrm{B}, and mathrm{C} such that: [ |mathrm{A}| = |mathrm{B}| = leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor ] Next, undertake coloring based on these sets: - Color the edges within mathrm{A} with color 1. - Color the edges within mathrm{B} with color 2. - Color the edges within mathrm{C} with color 3. - Color the edges between mathrm{A} and mathrm{B} with color 2. - Color the edges between mathrm{B} and mathrm{C} with color 3. - Color the edges between mathrm{C} and mathrm{A} with color 1. If we want to turn all edges into color 1, the remaining sets subjected to recoloring will involve mathrm{B} and mathrm{A}. The edges that were initially color 2 (between mathrm{A} and mathrm{B}) must be adjusted. Hence, the minimum number of edges to be recolored to ensure a connected graph in uniform color would be at least |mathrm{B}| = leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor.  Step 2: Show that mathrm{k} = leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor is sufficient  We will use mathematical induction on mathrm{n} to establish that mathrm{k} = leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor suffices. **Base Case:** For n = 3, the statement is trivially true since leftlfloor frac{3}{3} rightrfloor = 1. Recoloring one edge would suffice to connect the remaining graph uniformly. **Inductive Step:** Assume for mathrm{n'} = mathrm{n} -1 (where mathrm{n} geq 4), the minimum number of edges mathrm{k'} required is leftlfloor frac{mathrm{n'-1}}{3} rightrfloor. Now we will prove for n vertices: 1. If in mathrm{K}_n, there exists at least one vertex, mathrm{v}, such that all edges from mathrm{v} share the same color, the entire mathrm{K}_n graph being that color is connected, establishing our base case. 2. If such a vertex mathrm{v} does not exist in mathrm{K}_n, this means each vertex is connected by at least two different colors.  **Case 1:** If from any vertex mathrm{v}, it emits edges of just three colors, based on the inductive hypothesis, it follows that with leftlfloor frac{n-1}{3} rightrfloor leq leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor recycles would ensure a single-color connected graph. **Case 2:** If each vertex spans through edges marked by exactly two distinct colors; let's define sets: - mathrm{A}: all vertices with edges in only colors 1 and 2. - mathrm{B}: vertices for colors 2 and 3,  - mathrm{C}: vertices for colors 1 and 3. Without loss of generality, assume |mathrm{A}| leq |mathrm{B}| leq |mathrm{C}|. Then |mathrm{A}| leq leftlfloor frac{n}{3} rightrfloor. If mathrm{B} isn't empty, adjust connections in mathrm{A} to match with mathrm{B} using third color making entire mathrm{C}-connected via mathrm{Bcup A}.

Considering four tetrahedra, each having one of the vertices of the original tetrahedron, and the other vertices being the marked points lying on the edges emanating from this vertex, prove that the volume of each of the considered tetrahedra does not exceed one-eighth of the volume of the original tetrahedron.  1. **Geometric Configuration**:    Let A_1, A_2, A_3, A_4 be the vertices of the original tetrahedron. On each edge A_iA_j, a point B_{ij} is marked. 2. **Tetrahedra Formation**:    We are to form four tetrahedra such that each one of them has A_i as one of the vertices and the other three vertices are the marked points B_{ij} (j neq i). 3. **Volume Ratio Calculation**:    According to the given problem, the ratio of the volume of each new tetrahedron to the volume of the original tetrahedron is determined by the product of the ratios of the marked points on the edges connected to the fixed vertex. 4. **Ratio Derivation**:    Let's say the tetrahedron we are considering has A_1 as one vertex and B_{12}, B_{13}, B_{14} as the other three vertices.        This new tetrahedron shares a trihedral angle at vertex A_1, common with the original tetrahedron. According to a known geometric property (referencing task 3.1), the volume ratio of two tetrahedra sharing a common trihedral angle is the product of the ratios of the dividing points on the corresponding edges.        So, if A_iA_j = a and the marked point B_{ij} divides the edge as A_iB_{ij} = x and A_jB_{ij} = a - x, then the ratio of lengths for edge A_iA_j is given by frac{x}{a} and frac{a-x}{a}. 5. **Volume Ratio Expression**:    Each edge A_iA_j has a marked point B_{ij} dividing it into two parts. For example, for the edge A_1A_2, the ratio is:    [    frac{A_1B_{12}}{A_1A_2} times frac{A_2B_{12}}{A_2A_1} = frac{x}{a} times frac{a-x}{a} = frac{x(a-x)}{a^2} leq frac{1}{4}    ]    because the maximum value of frac{x(a-x)}{a^2} is frac{1}{4} when x = frac{a}{2}. 6. **Combining the Length Ratios**:    Each tetrahedron is formed by three ratios corresponding to three edges originating from one vertex (e.g., A_1). Hence, the volume ratio for a tetrahedron with a vertex A_1 is:    [    text{Volume ratio} = frac{x(a-x)}{a^2} times frac{y(a-y)}{a^2} times frac{z(a-z)}{a^2} leq left(frac{1}{4}right)^3 = frac{1}{64}    ] 7. **Summing the Ratios**:    As the tetrahedron has 6 edges, thus the product of the ratios for all 4 tetrahedra is:    [    left(frac{1}{4}right)^6 = left(frac{1}{64}right) cdot 4 = frac{1}{16} < frac{1}{8}    ] 8. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, each tetrahedron formed by fixing a vertex and using three marked points on edges does not have a volume exceeding one-eighth of the volume of the original tetrahedron.

Initially, all a_i are 0. We make these changes for m = 1, 2, ldots, n. 2. **Divisor analysis:**    To determine when a value a_i is toggled, we need to count the number of times i is a multiple of m:    [    text{Number of times } a_i text{ is changed} = text{Number of divisors of } i.    ] 3. **Divisors of non-squares:**    For any non-square integer (i), the divisors come in pairs:    [    d times frac{i}{d} = i,    ]    except when (i) is a perfect square, in which case one of the divisors in the pair is repeated (i.e., (sqrt{i})). Thus:    - If (i) is not a perfect square, it has an even number of divisors.    - If (i) is a perfect square, it has an odd number of divisors. 4. **Final values of a_i:**    - Each time (i) is a multiple of (m), (a_i) is toggled.    - If (i) has an even number of divisors, it will be toggled an even number of times, so it ends as 0.    - If (i) has an odd number of divisors, it will be toggled an odd number of times, ending as 1.

The problem statement can be reframed in terms of minimizing the number of visible pairs of birds that stop on a circle.

Imagine if we move all birds from any point B to A. This simplification helps us to deal with fewer points. 3. **Critical Positioning**:     - Let’s assume we need to distribute birds in such a way that maximizes the number of visible pairs. For this to happen, minimize the pairs sharing a small arc (< 10^circ).      - The maximum angle between adjacent points on a circle can be found in a regular polygon with evenly spaced points. Since 360 degrees shared uniformly should be considered acceptable, this will be a scenario where the distribution of birds ensures they mutually obstruct vision optimally. 4. **Maximizing Unseen Birds**:     - If we consider a 35-gon (polygon with 35 vertices), each central angle being 360^circ / 35 = approx 10.285^circ. Thus any bird will not see another bird on adjacent vertices. 5. **Counting Possible Configuration**:     - In this 35-gon, let's denote the vertices as A_1, A_2, ..., A_{35}. Distributing birds here such that each vertex holds at most one bird ensures minimal mutual visibility.     - But ensuring more than one bird per vertex maximizes unseen conditions. 6. **Bird Distribution to Minimize Visibility**:     - Distributing so x_1, x_2, ..., x_{35} are in such a way that their difference is minimized (|x_i - x_j| leq 1 for i neq j). 7. **Final Calculation of pairs**:     - Let's solve pairs for approximately 20 positions harboring 4 birds and 15 positions with 5 birds.     - This common distribution can be computed into pairs with combinatorial calculations: ( binom{4}{2} = 6 ) and ( binom{5}{2} = 10 ) pairs.     - Thus the sum: 20 times 6 + 15 times 10 = 120 + 150 = 270. **Conclusion**: Thus, the minimum number of mutually visible bird pairs is: [ boxed{270} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that point O is the center of the inscribed circle of triangle ABC.

From the volume relation, we can solve for x:    [    x = frac{a^3}{4 S_{A_1MD}}    ] 8. Next, we need to find the side lengths of triangle A_1MD:    - The length of A_1D is:      [      left| A_1D right| = a sqrt{2}      ]    - The length of A_1M is:      [      left| A_1M right| = frac{a sqrt{5}}{2}      ]    - The length of DM is:      [      left| DM right| = frac{3a}{2}      ] 9. Using the cosine rule to find cos varphi:    [    cos varphi = frac{A_1D^2 + A_1M^2 - DM^2}{2 cdot A_1D cdot A_1M}    ]    On solving, we get:    [    cos varphi = frac{1}{sqrt{10}}    ] 10. Therefore, varphi = arccos left( frac{1}{sqrt{10}} right). 11. Next, we find the area S_{A_1MD} using the lengths previously calculated:    [    S_{A_1MD} = frac{1}{2} times left| A_1D right| times left| DM right| times sin(angle A_1DM)    ]    Using the found side lengths and cos(angle A_1DM), we simplify to get:    [    S_{A_1MD} = frac{3}{4}a^2    ] 12. Substituting S_{A_1MD} back into the equation for x:    [    x = frac{a^3}{4 times frac{3}{4}a^2} = frac{a}{3}    ] # Conclusion: The angle varphi and the distance x between the lines CK and A_1D are: [ boxed{arccos left( frac{1}{sqrt{10}} right) , frac{a}{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"Tom used 3.5 batteries on his flashlights, 15.75 in his toys, 7.25 in his remote controllers, 4.8 in his wall clock, and 3.4 in his wireless mouse.

Tommy's home is now worth 25% more than P, so the current value of his home is P + 0.25P, which equals 1.25P. When Tommy sells his home, he uses the proceeds to buy a new house that costs 500,000. He takes a loan for 75% of the new house's cost, which means he pays 25% of the new house's cost with the money he got from selling his first house. So, 25% of the new house's cost is equal to the current value of his first house (1.25P). 0.25 * 500,000 = 1.25P 125,000 = 1.25P To find the original price P that Tommy bought his first house for, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.25: P = 125,000 / 1.25 P = 100,000 Tommy bought his first house for boxed{100,000} ."},{"instruction":"Ruiz receives a monthly salary of 500.

However, the sum of the absolute values of these differences is at least the same as the sum without absolute values because absolute values can only maintain or increase the magnitude of terms, never decrease it. 7.

Suppose ( f(x) = kx ).     - Then, by substituting ( f(x) = kx ) into the equation ( f(a+b) ), we have:         [         f(a+b) = k(a+b) = ka + kb = f(a) + f(b)         ]     - Thus, the given condition ( f(a+b) = f(a) + f(b) ) holds.

If air leaks out at a constant rate, how long does it take for all three punctures to work together to make the tire flat?","output":"To solve this problem, we can use the concept of rates of work. Each puncture is doing the \\"work\\" of deflating the tire, and we can find the combined rate at which they deflate the tire when they are all working together. Let's denote the rates of the punctures as follows: - The rate of the first puncture is 1/9 (it can deflate the tire in 9 minutes, so it does 1/9 of the job per minute). - The rate of the second puncture is 1/6 (it can deflate the tire in 6 minutes, so it does 1/6 of the job per minute). - The rate of the third puncture is 1/12 (it can deflate the tire in 12 minutes, so it does 1/12 of the job per minute). To find the combined rate, we simply add the individual rates together: Combined rate = (1/9) + (1/6) + (1/12) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 9, 6, and 12 is 36. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 36: (1/9) = (4/36) (1/6) = (6/36) (1/12) = (3/36) Now we can add them together: Combined rate = (4/36) + (6/36) + (3/36) Combined rate = (4 + 6 + 3) / 36 Combined rate = 13/36 This means that all three punctures together can deflate the tire at a rate of 13/36 of the tire per minute. To find out how long it takes for the tire to be completely deflated, we need to find out how many minutes it takes for the combined rate to complete 1 job (deflating the tire completely). Since the rate is 13/36 per minute, we can set up the equation: (13/36) * time = 1 job To solve for time, we divide both sides by the rate (13/36): time = 1 / (13/36) time = 36 / 13 time = 2.76923077...

This range is also within the brother's range, which starts at 60 kg. Since the average of the different probable weights is 68 kg, we can assume that the weights are symmetrically distributed around this average within the common range. The common range is from just above 66 kg to 69 kg, so the average is likely to be centered in this range. Since 68 kg is within this range and is the average, it suggests that the distribution of probable weights is likely to be from 67 kg to 69 kg (68 is the midpoint of this range). However, the upper limit according to the brother's opinion is not affected by the average weight.

Therefore, the product of all numbers on the board does not change with each operation. 2. **Sum Increasing Argument:**     Now, let's demonstrate that the total sum of the numbers on the board strictly increases with each operation (except in a special case):          Assume we pick ( a ) and ( b ) such that ( a leq b ) and replace them with ( g = gcd(a, b) ) and ( ell = mathrm{lcm}(a, b) ).          - If ( g = a ), then ( ell = b ), and the numbers ( a ) and ( b ) are replaced by themselves, indicating no change.     - However, in the general case where ( g < a ), we get:              [         g < b         ]                  Because ( g ) is a divisor of both ( a ) and ( b ), it must be less than or equal to each unless we're in the special case where ( g = a ).          3. **Analysis of the Sum Change:**     We need to calculate the difference in sums:          Initially, the sum is ( a + b ).

The change in the sum:     [     (g + ell) - (a + b) = g + mathrm{lcm}(a, b) - a - b     ]          Now, using ( a cdot b = g cdot ell ), we rewrite ( ell ):     [     ell = frac{a cdot b}{g}     ]          Substitute ( ell ):     [     g + mathrm{lcm}(a, b) = g + frac{a cdot b}{g}     ]          The difference:     [     left( g + frac{a cdot b}{g} right) - (a + b) = frac{g^2 + a cdot b - g cdot a - g cdot b}{g}     ]          Simplify:     [     frac{g^2 + a cdot b - g cdot a - g cdot b}{g} = frac{(a-g)(b-g)}{g}     ]          Notice:     [     frac{(a-g)(b-g)}{g} > 0     ]     Because ( a > g ) and ( b > g ), meaning ( (a-g) ) and ( (b-g) ) are positive.     This shows the sum strictly increases in each step.      4. **Bounded Sum Argument:**     Since each number on the blackboard is a product of the initial numbers' factors and their maximum cannot exceed their product, the sum cannot increase without limit.

Therefore, ( n equiv 0, 1, 2, text{or } 7 pmod{7} ). Note that:    - n equiv 0 pmod{7} Rightarrow n = 7k    - n equiv 1 pmod{7} Rightarrow n = 7k + 1    - n equiv 2 pmod{7} Rightarrow n = 7k + 2    - n equiv 7 pmod{7} Rightarrow n = 7k + 7 (reduces to n = 7k as it cycles back to the residue 0)    Thus, there are **3 possible residues modulo 7**, which are 0, 1, and 2 when considering modulo 7 within the context of n being distinct. 2. **Divisibility by 11:**    Similarly, for the product to be divisible by 11, one of the terms must be divisible by 11. Therefore, ( n equiv 0, 1, 2, text{or } 7 pmod{11} ). Thus, there are **4 possible residues modulo 11**: 0, 1, 2, and 7. 3. **Divisibility by 13:**    For the product to be divisible by 13, one of the terms must be divisible by 13. Thus, ( n equiv 0, 1, 2, text{or } 7 pmod{13} ). Hence, there are **4 possible residues modulo 13**: 0, 1, 2, and 7. Now, we combine these conditions using the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT): 4. **Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem:**    There are 4 times 4 times 3 = 48 possible combinations of residues modulo 11, 13, and 7. For n within the range 1 leq n leq 1001, each combined residue set corresponds to a unique solution by CRT.        - For 1 leq n leq 1001, there are 48 solutions.    - For 1002 leq n leq 2017, we need to realize that we can fit another full cycle of 1001 numbers from 16 up to 2017.    Since 2017 - 1 = 2016 provides us two full ranges of 1001 each, this means:    - For n in the additional range from 1002 to 2001, there are another 48 solutions.    - Similarly, for n from 1003 to 2017, another possibility range remains about part of the established periodic intervals. Hence, allowing each combination gets covered distinctly:     Therefore, there are 96 solutions within 1 leq n leq 2017. 5. **Checking for 1 leq n leq 15:**     Lastly, we need to consider the small range separately:    - For 1 leq n leq 15, visibly n =1, 2, 7 work having verifying the product inclusive of 0 moduli.

This will map each triangle's vertices to the midpoints of the sides of the quadrilateral formed by the midpoints.    - Given that the centroids of the triangles split each median of their respective triangles by (2:1), the points of intersection of the medians (centroids) will also maintain an ordered structure. 5. **Parallelogram Verification:**    - According to the properties of homothety and the configuration of the medians intersecting at these centroids, we need to show that (G_1G_2G_3G_4) forms a parallelogram.    - Since the diagonals of the quadrilateral intersect at (O), we know from the midpoint theorem that each pair of midpoints of the sides of the triangles (which are bisected by the diagonals) will form parallel intermediate lines. 6. **Conclusion:**    - As a consequence of the midpoints being vertices of a parallelogram, the transformation by homothety centered at (O) and applied to the initial quadrilateral ensures similar properties for the intersection points of medians of the four triangles.    - This guarantees that the points of intersection of the medians form a parallelogram.

The solution to this problem follows the formula:     [     F_2(n) = frac{n(n+1)}{2} + 1     ] 2. **Analysis for Planes in Space:**     Now, let n planes divide space into F_3(n) regions.

Given the adherence to intersections conditions (each three intersecting at a unique point), each added plane splits some of these regions into two.      3. **Formulating the Recursive Relation:**     When adding the (n+1)-th plane, the additional regions formed correspond to the above scenario of lines in a plane.

Since the month begins with a Sunday, there will be 5 Sundays in that month. The remaining days of the month are 30 - 5 = 25 days. The average number of visitors on the other days (non-Sundays) is given as 240. The total number of visitors in the month can be calculated by adding the total visitors on Sundays and the total visitors on the other days. Total visitors on Sundays = ( S times 5 ) Total visitors on other days = ( 240 times 25 ) The average number of visitors per day for the entire month is given as 285, and the total number of days is 30. So, the total number of visitors in the month is ( 285 times 30 ). Now we can set up the equation: ( S times 5 + 240 times 25 = 285 times 30 ) Let's solve for ( S ): ( 5S + 6000 = 8550 ) ( 5S = 8550 - 6000 ) ( 5S = 2550 ) ( S = frac{2550}{5} ) ( S = 510 ) Therefore, the library has an average of boxed{510}  visitors on Sundays."},{"instruction":"Mary's income is 60 percent more than Tim's income, and Tim's income is some percent less than Juan's income.

Mary's income is 64.00000000000001% of Juan's income: M = 0.6400000000000001J Since both expressions represent Mary's income, we can set them equal to each other: 1.60T = 0.6400000000000001J Now, we want to find out what percent less Tim's income is compared to Juan's income. To do this, we need to express Tim's income as a percentage of Juan's income. From the equation above, we can solve for T in terms of J: T = (0.6400000000000001J) / 1.60 T = 0.4J This means that Tim's income is 40% of Juan's income.

Specifically, we can consider the possible remainders of x, y, and z when divided by 3.  2. **Remainder Analysis:**    Each integer when divided by 3 yields one of the remainders: 0, 1, or 2. Thus, the possible cases for (x, y, z) mod 3 are:    [    (x, y, z) equiv (0, 0, 0), , (0, 0, 1), , (0, 0, 2), , (0, 1, 1), , ldots, , (2, 2, 2) pmod{3}    ] 3. **Case Analysis for (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) mod 3:**    Consider the product (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) modulo 3:    - If x equiv y pmod{3} and y equiv z pmod{3}, then x equiv z pmod{3}. In this scenario, (x - y) equiv 0, (y - z) equiv 0, and (z - x) equiv 0, making (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) equiv 0 pmod{3}.    - If all three x, y, and z are distinct modulo 3, then x, y, z yield distinct remainders, e.g., (0, 1, 2). In such cases, the product (x - y)(y - z)(z - x) when considered under different combinations (like 0-1, 1-2, 2-0), result in non-zero values modulo 3.

Let ( b_i ) be represented in base-3. Since ( b_i in C ), it contains only digits 0 and 2. 4. Consider the largest summand ( 2 cdot 3^k ) in the base-3 representation of ( b_i ).

The progressions ( A_i ) for ( i ge t+1 ) must cover a residue class ( r < 2^{k_1} ) modulo ( 2^{k_1} ) not covered by ( A_i ) for ( i le t ). 4. Since each residue class modulo ( 2^{k_i} ) for ( i ge t+1 ) is contained in a single residue class modulo ( 2^{k_1} ), the union of several ( A_i ) for ( i ge t+1 ) forms a progression ( {2^{k_1}m + r mid m ge 0} ). 5.

Splitting the progressions into those with even and odd ( b_i ), we find that the union of even ( b_i ) forms the set of even integers, and the union of odd ( b_i ) forms the set of odd integers. 7.

Let's denote the sequence by a_1, a_2, a_3, ldots, a_{1978}. **Step 1: Observing coprime property** - Remember, if two numbers (x) and (y) are coprime, ( text{gcd}(x, y) = 1 ). This means they share no common factors other than 1. **Step 2: Considering consecutive numbers** - Notice if (a_i) and (a_{i+1}) for (i = 1, 3, 5, ldots, 1977) are coprime (they must be, since they are adjacent), and  - Similarly, (a_i) and (a_{i+2}) for (i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, 1976) must also be coprime (since they are one position apart). **Step 3: Even and odd distinction** - Since the total count 1978 includes both even and odd numbers:   - There are 989 even numbers and 989 odd numbers. Let’s create specific segments of the sequence to consider: - If we place two consecutive even numbers or two consecutive odd numbers next to each other, they can't be coprime (because they share 2 as a common factor). - For example, placing two even numbers adjacent (2k) and (2m) results in (text{gcd}(2k, 2m) = 2). # Conclusion: - Thus, if we attempt to place all 1978 numbers in such a way, we must violate the stipulated conditions about coprimeness at some point, as we can't have all pairs of numbers, both adjacent and one step apart, meeting this condition effectively. Therefore, it is impossible to arrange the numbers from 1 to 1978 so that any two adjacent or one-apart numbers are mutually prime.

Since Jangshe bought 7 pieces of clothing and we know the price of two of them, there are 5 pieces left that are all the same price. The total cost of the two pieces we know is ( 49 + 81 = 130 ). The total cost of the 7 pieces is 610, so the cost of the remaining 5 pieces is ( 610 - 130 = 480 ). Since these 5 pieces are all the same price, we divide the total cost of these 5 pieces by 5 to find the price of one piece: ( x = frac{480}{5} = 96 ). Since the price must be a multiple of 5 and 96 is not a multiple of 5, we need to adjust our calculation. It seems there might have been a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-calculate the total cost of the remaining 5 pieces: The total cost of the 7 pieces is 610, and we subtract the cost of the two known pieces: ( 610 - 130 = 480 ). Now, we divide 480 by 5 to find the price of one of the other pieces: ( x = frac{480}{5} = 96 ). 96 is indeed a multiple of 5, so the price of one of the other pieces is boxed{96} ."},{"instruction":"Which of the following statements is incorrect?

Notably we use the identity that cos(pi - theta) = -cos(theta) for any angle theta. Hence, we can rewrite the numerator: cos(pi - 2alpha) = -cos(2alpha). The formula for double-angle identity of cosine, which is cos(2alpha) = cos^2(alpha) - sin^2(alpha), can be applied next: -cos(2alpha) = -(cos^2(alpha) - sin^2(alpha)) = sin^2(alpha) - cos^2(alpha). Moreover, we can utilize the formula for sine and cosine differences, sin(alpha) - cos(alpha) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(sin(alpha - frac{pi}{4})), to simplify the denominator: sin(alpha - frac{pi}{4}) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(sin(alpha) - cos(alpha)). Inserting these simplifications into the original equation yields: frac{sin^2(alpha) - cos^2(alpha)}{frac{sqrt{2}}{2}(sin(alpha) - cos(alpha))} = -frac{sqrt{2}}{2}. After multiplying both sides by frac{sqrt{2}}{2}, we get: frac{sin^2(alpha) - cos^2(alpha)}{sin(alpha) - cos(alpha)} = -1. It simplifies further to: sin(alpha) + cos(alpha) = -frac{1}{2}. Now we can square both sides: (sin(alpha) + cos(alpha))^2 = left(-frac{1}{2}right)^2, sin^2(alpha) + 2sin(alpha)cos(alpha) + cos^2(alpha) = frac{1}{4}. Recognizing that sin^2(alpha) + cos^2(alpha) = 1 and 2sin(alpha)cos(alpha) = sin(2alpha), we can substitute and isolate sin(2alpha): 1 + sin(2alpha) = frac{1}{4}.

Let us use an indicator function I_{2k} which indicates whether the total score is a tie at step 2k.

The eccentricity ( e ) of the hyperbola is defined as:    [    e = frac{c}{a} = frac{sqrt{3}a}{a} = sqrt{3}    ] # Conclusion: The eccentricity of the given hyperbola is: [ boxed{sqrt{3}} ]"},{"instruction":"Calculate the distance between the points (2,6) and (5,2).","output":"We begin by substituting into the distance formula.

Begin by understanding the problem: We need to place ( n ) pairs of parentheses around ( n+1 ) letters in such a way that within each pair of parentheses, there occurs either a pair of adjacent letters, a letter and an expression enclosed in another pair of parentheses, or a pair of expressions enclosed in parentheses. 2. We are tasked with proving that the number of different ways to place the parentheses is equal to the ( n )-th Catalan number ( C_n ). 3. Consider a ( n+2 )-gon (a polygon with ( n+2 ) sides). Place the ( n+1 ) letters on the sides of this polygon in clockwise order, leaving one side free. This setup helps visualize the placement of the parentheses structure around the letters. 4. Draw non-intersecting diagonals of the ( n+2 )-gon to divide it into triangles. Each arrangement of such triangulation corresponds uniquely to a valid arrangement of the parentheses. 5. Each diagonal in the polygon represents a pair of parentheses that encloses a sub-expression formed by the letters on the adjacent sides of the diagonal. We match each sub-expression to a valid placement of parentheses within the ( n+1 ) letters. 6. In general, if given a diagonal in the polygon, it determines a pair of parentheses in the string. The segments of the polygon divided by the diagonal will correspond to substrings or sub-expressions enclosed by these parentheses. 7. If the diagonal divides a triangle into a smaller ( (k+2) )-gon and an ( (n-k+1) )-gon, then the number of ways to place the parentheses in each of these segments is determined by the Catalan numbers ( C_k ) and ( C_{n-k-1} ) respectively.  8.

This relation is precisely the recurrence that defines the Catalan numbers, which inherently counts the ways to triangulate an ( n+2 )-gon and thus the ways to correctly place the parentheses. 10.

We need to analyze these conditions to determine which of the given conclusions is correct. Firstly, the condition f(x)=fleft(frac{2pi}{3}-xright) implies that the graph of f(x) is symmetric about the line x=frac{pi}{3}. This is because for each x and its corresponding point frac{2pi}{3}-x, they share the same function value, indicating reflectional symmetry. The condition -f(x)=f(pi-x) suggests that the graph of f(x) is also symmetric about the point left(frac{pi}{2}, 0right). Specifically, for each x and its corresponding point pi-x, their function values are negatives of each other, which is characteristic of point symmetry. Given the smallest positive period of f(x) is greater than frac{pi}{2}, we can express this period as frac{2pi}{omega}, which leads to the inequality 0<omega<4. From the symmetry conditions and period, we derive omega=3 by equating frac{pi}{2}-frac{pi}{3} to frac{1}{4}timesfrac{2pi}{omega}, solving to find omega=3. Therefore, the function simplifies to f(x)=2sin(3x+varphi). Considering the condition 3timesfrac{pi}{2}+varphi=kpi (kin Z) and knowing 0<varphi<pi, we solve for varphi to find varphi=frac{pi}{2}. Thus, the function further simplifies to f(x)=2sinleft(3x+frac{pi}{2}right)=2cos(3x), which is an even function due to the properties of the cosine function. Analyzing the given options: - A: At x=frac{pi}{3}, f(x)=2cos(pi)=-2, indicating a minimum value, not maximum. Hence, A is incorrect. - B: The smallest positive period of f(x) is indeed frac{2pi}{3}, due to the omega=3 finding. Hence, B is correct. - C: Since f(x)=2cos(3x) is an even function, C is correct. - D: For xin(0,frac{pi}{3}), 3xin(0,pi), and since the cosine function is monotonically decreasing in this interval, f(x)=2cos(3x) is also monotonically decreasing, not increasing.

Notice that:    [    x^2 - 17 equiv 0 pmod{2}    ]    Simplifying,    [    x^2 equiv 17 pmod{2}    ]    Since ( 17 equiv 1 pmod{2} ),    [    x^2 equiv 1 pmod{2}    ]    It's clear that if ( x ) is an odd integer, ( x^2 equiv 1 pmod{2} ) (since ( 1 times 1 = 1 mod 2 )). Therefore, ( x = 1 ) works for ( n = 1 ). 2. **Inductive Step:**    Assume that for some ( n geq 1 ), there exists an integer ( x ) such that:    [    x^2 - 17 equiv 0 pmod{2^n}    ]    This implies:    [    x^2 - 17 = k cdot 2^n    ]    for some integer ( k ).

Let’s compare the fractions ( frac{n_1}{d_1} ) and ( frac{n_2}{d_2} ):    [    frac{n_1}{d_1} = frac{10^{1984} + 1}{10^{1985}} = frac{10^{1984}}{10^{1985}} + frac{1}{10^{1985}} = 0.1 + frac{1}{10^{1985}}    ]    [    frac{n_2}{d_2} = frac{10^{1985} + 1}{10^{1986}} = frac{10^{1985}}{10^{1986}} + frac{1}{10^{1986}} = 0.1 + frac{1}{10^{1986}}    ]     4. Notice that:    [    0.1 + frac{1}{10^{1985}} quad text{is greater than} quad 0.1 + frac{1}{10^{1986}}    ]    This is because:    [    frac{1}{10^{1985}} > frac{1}{10^{1986}}    ] # Conclusion: Given the comparison above, the first fraction ( frac{10^{1984} + 1}{10^{1985}} ) is greater than the second fraction ( frac{10^{1985} + 1}{10^{1986}} ).
