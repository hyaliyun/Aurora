The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Since it is impossible to change the length of the array in some languages, you must instead have the result be placed in the first part of the array nums. More formally, if there are k elements after removing the duplicates, then the first k elements of nums should hold the final result. It does not matter what you leave beyond the first k elements. Return k after placing the final result in the first k slots of nums. Do not allocate extra space for another array. You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.","output":"It seems like you're looking for a way to solve this problem in a programming language. Here's a Python solution that follows your constraints: \`\`\`python def removeDuplicates(nums):     if not nums:         return 0     k = 0     for i in range(1, len(nums)):         if nums[i] != nums[k]:             k += 1             nums[k] = nums[i]     return k + 1 \`\`\` This function works by iterating over the array and comparing each element to the previous unique element (initially the first element of the array). If the current element is different, it increments \`k\` and replaces the element at the new \`k\` index with the current element. This ensures that the first \`k\` elements of the array are unique. The function finally returns \`k + 1\`, which is the number of unique elements. Remember to test this function with your specific inputs to ensure it works as expected."},{"instruction":"given an interest rate of 8%, should an investment account that focuses on big tech companies (ie. apple, microsoft, google, tesla, etc.) use borrowed money to invest?","output":"As an AI assistant, I can provide some general information to consider when deciding whether to use borrowed money to invest in a big tech companies-focused investment account. However, please note that I am not a financial advisor, and it is always recommended to consult with a professional before making any investment decisions. Using borrowed money, also known as leverage, can potentially amplify both gains and losses. Here are a few factors to consider: 1. Risk tolerance: Borrowing money to invest increases the risk involved. If the investment performs well, the returns can be higher, but if it performs poorly, the losses can also be magnified. Consider your risk tolerance and ability to handle potential losses. 2. Interest rate: If the interest rate on the borrowed money is higher than the expected return on the investment, it may not be financially beneficial to use borrowed funds. In your case, with an 8% interest rate, it is important to assess whether the potential returns from the investment can outweigh the cost of borrowing. 3. Market conditions: Big tech companies can be volatile, and their stock prices can fluctuate significantly. It is important to consider the current market conditions and the potential risks associated with investing in these companies. 4. Diversification: Investing solely in big tech companies can be risky, as it concentrates your investments in a specific sector. Diversification across different industries and asset classes can help mitigate risk. Ultimately, the decision to use borrowed money to invest in a big tech companies-focused investment account depends on your individual financial situation, risk tolerance, and investment goals. It is advisable to consult with a financial advisor who can provide personalized advice based on your specific circumstances."},{"instruction":"Given an OAuth Discover endpoint like the following, how do you validate an access token with Ruby on Rails? https://gmsconnectapp.b2clogin.com/gmsconnectapp.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1a_signup_signin/.well-known/openid-configuration","output":"To validate an access token in Ruby on Rails, you can use the \`OpenId Connect\` library, which is a popular Ruby library for working with OAuth and OpenID Connect flows. Here's an example of how you can use it to validate an access token: 1. Add the \`openid-connect\` gem to your Gemfile: \`\`\` gem 'openid-connect', '~> 2.0' \`\`\` 2. Run \`bundle install\` to install the gem. 3. In your Rails controller, you can use the \`OpenIdConnect::Client\` class to validate the access token. Here's an example of how you can do it: \`\`\` class MyController < ApplicationController   def validate_token     # Create an OpenId Connect client instance     client = OpenIdConnect::Client.new(     # Set the client ID and secret for the GMS Connect app     client_id = 'your_client_id'     client_secret = 'your_client_secret'     # Set the token endpoint URL     token_url = 'https://gmsconnectapp.b2clogin.com/gmsconnectapp.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1a_signup_signin/.well-known/openid-configuration'     # Validate the access token     response = client.validate_token(token: 'your_access_token')     if response.success?       # The access token is valid, do something here     else       # The access token is invalid, handle the error here     end   end end \`\`\` In this example, you need to replace \`your_client_id\` and \`your_client_secret\` with the actual client ID and secret for your GMS Connect app. You also need to replace \`your_access_token\` with the access token you want to validate. The \`validate_token\` method returns a \`Response\` object, which contains information about the validation result. If the access token is valid, the response will have a \`success?\` method that returns \`true\`. If the access token is invalid, the response will have an error message in the \`error\` key. You can use this method in your controller to validate the access token before performing any actions that require it. For example, you could use it in a \`before_action\` filter to ensure that the access token is valid before allowing the user to access a protected resource. Note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify it to fit your specific use case. Additionally, you should make sure to handle errors and edge cases appropriately to ensure that your application is robust and reliable."},{"instruction":"Given an object and a part, decide whether the object has that part.

It is rather tasteless, has good solubility in liquids, and doesn't change much texturewise. In homemade spice mixes, the popular filler solution are dried breadcrumbs of a very small size (like breadcrumbs for schnitzel breading). They are noticeable, because the mix gets gritty, but the consensus among those who do it is that this is a feature, not a bug. They could also slightly thicken a wet dish (soup, stew), but present no problem when strewn over dry food. You can also use a nut flour made of nuts without much of an own taste, like apricot kernels or low quality overdried almonds.

Example Output: You can get a hand-crank meat grinder for about 30 or so and a manual sausage stuffer for about the same Example Input: CONTEXT: Maybe! There's one big potential issue: panini presses are hinged differently. There's a bit of variation exactly how, but the effect is that the entire top can lift up, so that it can press down flat on whatever you stick in there. Waffle irons are just designed to be filled, so they hinge at the back. If your sandwich is much smaller than the waffle iron, you can put it in the front part (as far from the hinge as possible), and it won't matter too much, but if it takes up a decent fraction of the area, it'll be squeezed pretty tight at the back compared to the front. This will probably make it cook unevenly, and depending on what you've got in there, might squeeze things out.Some panini presses also have better temperature controls than waffle irons, but that's probably not as much of a concern.So I'd give it a shot and see how it works, plan on possibly flipping your sandwich around halfway through, and don't be too upset if it's not pretty!(rfusca's comment above is also good - if you're able to take off the hinge, you'd avoid the whole problem.)  <sep>  Q: Can I use a waffle iron as a Panini press?

Solution is here: Experiment with the amount of water (but keep it low) Explanation: Here the follow-up question asks about a way to make the bread softer. The answer (Experiment with the amount of water) is mentioned in the passage. Now, solve this: CONTEXT: Yes, it can go bad.It's pretty much the same as the way flour can go bad: the fats can go rancid. Grains are mostly starch, but they contain enough fat for rancidity to be a noticeable problem. There's a huge amount of variability in how long that takes, though. If it's airtight and kept in a cool, dark place, it'll last much longer than the best before date. But if it's been exposed to air, light, or heat, it can go pretty fast, perhaps even before the best before date.So, smell it. If you detect any unpleasant smells, you probably don't want to eat it.

Solution: If the polenta doesn't have any noticeable odor, it doesn't necessarily mean that it's safe to eat. Since polenta is a high-carbohydrate food, it can continue to ferment and produce gases even after it's been stored for a while. If the polenta is not giving off any smell, it might still be slightly rancid or stale. To be on the safe side, it's best to cook a small amount of the polenta to taste before serving it. This will help you determine if it's still good to eat or not. Even if it doesn't have a strong smell, it might still have an unpleasant taste or texture if it's gone bad.

A: If you dredge it in seasoned cornmeal, then pan fry it, you get none of the slime that is common to okra  Will it still cook quickly? CONTEXT: To prevent the sticking, you might want to use a spray oil, maybe even just on the foil before you put the vegetables and potatoes on. It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective. Another spray over the top will make them brown a little more nicely and may even prevent a little drying out. Alternatively, you can just toss them all in a bowl with a small amount of oil; it really doesn't take much, and I'd hardly describe it as \\"covering with a lot of oil.\\"As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them. Broccoli and onions both roast very nicely, but you definitely want to pull it out before it starts browning/burning too much. If you slice the potatoes thinly enough, they'll cook in roughly the same amount of time as the broccoli and onions. So if things are getting overcooked, just don't leave them in the oven as long.You can also always try covering them. Another sheet of foil over the top will trap a fair amount of moisture, letting them steam a bit and probably preventing some burning as well.(I suppose it's also possible that it's all drying out because you're cooking them too slowly, so they have plenty of time for moisture to escape, but that seems less likely given the way you described things.)  <sep>  Q: Looking to bake side dishes, how do I stop problems with dryness A: As for preventing things from drying out, first and foremost, don't overcook them  Q: Is there any way to keep stuff from sticking to tin foil?

A: It's a tiny amount of oil, not enough to make things noticeably greasy, but will be pretty effective  Is there anything else I could use? CONTEXT: Yes, it can go bad.It's pretty much the same as the way flour can go bad: the fats can go rancid.

The particular order of the dishes has changed with the times and with theories of how meals should be served. The book Arranging the Meal by Flandrin describes the history of these changing fashions.There has been a debate since classic Greek times of when to have, or even whether to have, a salad course. The Greeks suggested eating after the meal to help with the ensuing drinking. The British were having it before the meal in the 1600s. By the 1800s French meals served Ã  la russe placed the salad close to the end of the meal, a tradition kept up to today.

Put it in right at the end of cooking, once everything else is properly cooked and just heat enough so it is warmed through.It comes down to whether you are wanting to achieve the same flavours though - if you are, maybe you could try what I would call single cream (not sure what it would be called in the US), and thicken the sauce with a bit of cornflour mixed with cold water.  <sep>  Q: Can Creme Fraiche be substituted for Heavy Cream in a Cream Sauce?

The advantage of the minimal disturbance method is that the strands of the meat give the burger structural strength. It also gives a pure beef flavor as you aren't adding anything to it. The mix up method breaks up the strands of meat which come out of the grinder which makes patties more fragile, however flavorings are distributed evenly. Some people add binding agents like egg and breadcrumbs to hold it together when using the mix up method in which case it becomes more of a flat meatball than a burger. My personal preference is the minimal disturbance method as it is fast, the patties hold together, and I like the flavor of pure beef. After forming the patties I salt them on both sides.

I recall some inventive insults in the bar scene, for example, which are the sort of things he does say in the books as a result of his unshakeable confidence in dealing with people he has to fight. He really doesn't mind getting physical as he know he will win, so insulting his adversaries and goading them is a typical strategy.

Unlike his wild card of an elder brother, Tommen is gentler and more prone to manipulation by his new bride. The Lannisters impeccable image has also been shattered. They failed to prevent the assassination of their king in the midst of his own wedding day, and the suspected assassin is the king's Lannister uncle. Not only do they look incompetent, they are divided among themselves. On the other hand, the Tyrells' situation is much stronger now. Tommen is already wrapped around Margaery's pretty little finger, and she knows that the assassination was orchestrated in part by her own family. In Margaery's eyes, the Lannisters look disoriented and lost. Putting on a show trial for one of their own, whom she knows is innocent of any wrongdoing. Whatever power Cersei held over Margaery has now been diminished. <sep>  Q: What was Margaery's motivation to call Cersei 'sister' again?

Q: CONTEXT: The Michael Bay Spin I'm joking, but as far as I can tell the technique doesn't really have a name. All that's happening is that the camera is moving around subjects in the foreground, and the background appears to move quicker thanks to the simple fact that it's further away. The reason I refer to it as the Michael Bay Spin is that director Michael Bay has used this exact shot (with different actors/locations, of course) in a lot of his films. In fact, the inclusion of that shot in Hot Fuzz is a direct reference to Michael Bay - Bad Boys II (directed by Bay) is bought up earlier on in the film, and if I remember correctly, the shot in question is actually shown to the audience while Nicholas Angel and Danny watch the film at Danny's house.  <sep>  Q: What is this camera effect used in Hot Fuzz?

In that film, Wolverine does something he regrets heavily, and it is the basis for his character arc in The Wolverine. So to fully appreciate this film, you should watch X-Men 3. But to fully appreciate X-Men 3, you should see X-Men and X-Men 2, since it's a sequel to those, and a continuation of those stories. You can skip X-Men: First Class, as it has no bearing on The Wolverine. And you should skip X-Men Origins: Wolverine for the many reasons critics described back when it was released (it also doesn't have much bearing on The Wolverine). Alternatively, if you're familiar with the X-Men from the comics, and are aware of some of the key storylines that occurred there, you can read this spoiler to get up to speed: In X-Men 3, Jean Grey is taken over by the Phoenix.

Being Spider-Man moves him further and further way from his own life (family, friends, college, work and, most importantly, Mary Jane). He subconsciously wants to stop being Spider-Man. After the talk with the doctor he realizes he has a choice, and we can see the confrontation of this yearning of a simple life with MJ against his guilt of not using his powers for good, which is represented by Uncle Ben in the car scene: MJ gets abducted because of her relationship to Peter (not Spider-Man), so in spite of his choice of not being with her to spare her from being used against Spider-Man, they get to her anyway, and the only way to save her is to be Spider-Man. Here both goals become aligned: wanting MJ and wanting to be Spider-Man are now the same thing.

Paragraph: As the criminal case moves toward possible trial this year, related pending lawsuits reflect a battle over blame. A look at where things stand: THE ALLEGATIONS  The Columbus-area Mount Carmel Health System determined William Husel ordered excessive doses for nearly three dozen patients over several years, though it said the doses likely weren’t what caused six of those deaths. Reviewers found that in many cases, the drugs were accessed by overriding a dispensing system. Husel was fired in December 2018, weeks after a concern was raised. Mount Carmel later said three patients died during those weeks after receiving excessive doses he ordered. ___ CRIMINAL CASE  Last June, Husel was charged with murder in 25 deaths and pleaded not guilty in one of the biggest cases of its kind ever brought against a U.S. health care professional. He was charged only in cases involving 500 to 2,000 micrograms of the powerful painkiller fentanyl – doses so unusually large that prosecutors said it indicated an intent to snuff out lives. His initial lawyer said Husel was providing comfort care to dying patients, not trying to kill them. Husel’s current lawyers in the criminal case — including Florida-based Jose Baez, who is known for successfully defending high-profile clients such as Casey Anthony and Aaron Hernandez — haven’t said much publicly about his motives. Husel’s lawyers in civil cases contend that he provided appropriate care and that Mount Carmel misled the public about what happened. Mount Carmel publicly apologized, tightened its drug policies, fired other employees and changed leadership but has stood by its investigation and subsequent decisions. “There is nothing more important to us than our patients’ safety and their trust in us — and we will do everything in our power to continue to improve,” it said in an emailed statement Tuesday. Trial for Husel, 44, is currently scheduled for June. _____ LOTS OF LAWSUITS  More than 30 lawsuits have been filed against Mount Carmel in the matter, and it has agreed to more than 13 million in related settlements so far. Husel and Mount Carmel unsuccessfully argued the remaining lawsuits should be put on hold until the criminal case is resolved. Husel also has filed lawsuits. One against Mount Carmel and its parent company, Michigan-based Trinity Health, alleges defamation. Another against Trinity and its insurer seeks to force them to cover costs of his defense in the criminal case, just as in civil cases against him. _____ FORMER COLLEAGUES  Authorities aren’t prosecuting those who administered the drugs, though they have faced other fallout. Mount Carmel said it fired 23 nurses, pharmacists and managers after its internal investigation. Ten of Husel’s former colleagues recently sued Mount Carmel for defamation and, in some cases, wrongful termination. The group of mostly nurses decried a “ false narrative of an evil rogue doctor and his complicit staff” and said the spread of that narrative damaged their lives and livelihoods regardless of whether they were fired. Three pharmacists and 25 nurses still face potential disciplinary action from their respective state boards and have administrative hearings scheduled in the coming months. Husel is in line for one, too, after the Ohio State Medical Board suspended his license. It hadn’t previously disciplined him. ___ Follow Franko on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/kantele10.

Q: Paragraph: The advent of various technologies enabling contact with emergency services (or easier identification during such an event) has not quelled interest in core functions of long-standing institutions such as 911 and the Emergency Alert System (EAS). A side effect of the advancement of gadgets and networks into our daily lives is lingering concern those devices will one day fail us; even the cellular phone was (in the not-so-distant past) eyed with some skepticism by first responders. Accordingly, the notion police or paramedics are best summoned via landline due to its long-developed and trustworthy capabilities remains despite the popularity and ubiquitousness of mobile phones. Landlines are are thought to make it easier to track down a person in need of assistance — and in films or on television, mobiles seem to regularly fail in moments of high tension (clip contains some profanity):  Various versions of that rumor have circulated in both the United States and the United Kingdom, dating back to at least 2006. The rumor’s functionality exists on at least two levels: one cautioning against inadvertently summoning the police (leading at best to embarrassment and at worst, actual harm), and another reassuring people (inaccurately) that even if you cannot complete a call for help, the cavalry will eventually arrive all the same. The latter notion is one where belief in the claim presents a risk, suggesting that one need only knock a landline off its receiver to eventually summon first responders. We contacted the Federal Communications Commission, which referred us to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA): As The Voice of 9-1-1™, NENA is on the forefront of all emergency communications issues. The association serves its members and the greater public safety community as the only professional organization solely focused on 9-1-1 policy, technology, operations, and education issues. With more than 9,000 members in 48 chapters across the United States and around the globe, NENA promotes the implementation and awareness of 9-1-1, as well as international three-digit emergency communications systems … Through the association’s efforts to provide effective and efficient public safety solutions, NENA strives to protect human life, preserve property, and maintain the security of our communities. A NENA representative told us he was unfamiliar with the rumor, adding that to the best of his knowledge a “presented dial tone will time out and the line will become inaccessible to inbound calls.”  (Or, to put it another way, a “busy signal.”)  Until the mid-2000s, mobile phones were largely considered a secondary form of contact to be used sparingly in the absence of a landline, and fixed-location phones were often inadvertently or (perhaps more often) deliberately left “off the hook” to disable incoming calls — a not uncommon occurrence, as one New York Times writer lamented in 2012: But there was also another part of the Friday night ritual — very likely the most important part. “Nick, go and take the phone off the hook,” my father would command. I’d excitedly rush into the hallway, lift up the phone receiver, and toss it to the floor. Then, I’d race back into the living room before showtime. As the opening credits for the movie began, the phone left off the hook would echo in the hall: Beep. Beep. Beep. Beep … and then, silence. No way to answer the phone, and no way to leave a message, meant that no one could get through. And rightly so: it was movie night, after all. Claim: A landline disengaged from its cradle will eventually self-dial 911. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the claim \\"A landline disengaged from its cradle will eventually self-dial 911\\" contradicts the evidence present.

If the claim has multiple supporting *AND* contradicting evidences, classify the claim as '1'. If the claim has supporting evidence and the paragraph is in overall favor of the claim, then classify the claim as '2'. Q: Paragraph: The story makes no mention of costs. Instead by saying, “could be on the market and available for thousands of patients in about five years’ time” it leaves readers with the impression that cost is not an issue. This is exactly the kind of device that an insurance company might put on its “ineligible” list. A quick review of the business media suggests the cost of the device will exceed 75,000 if it becomes commercially available. according to this Medical Device Technology Alert. It is hard to imagine why this important fact was overlooked in the story. Beyond saying in the lead that three people were able to “see shapes and objects,” there is not much else in the story to help readers understand the levels of vision improvements that were seen and how those should be compared to the preexisting conditions or other treatments. Then, confusingly, the story narrows its focus to just one patient saying, “one blind patient who had the device implanted was able to identify and find objects placed on a table in front of him, and was able to walk around a room independently. He could even read a clock face and differentiate between seven shades of grey, the researchers said. Tests were conducted starting from seven to nine days after the device was implanted.” It’s tough when writing a story about a study this small to put hard numbers to the benefits, but even some acknowledgment of this limitation would have been better than some of the overly optimistic sentiments expressed. The study itself and the press released provided more ways for the story to quantify the benefits. The story provides absolutely no information on the implant requirements for the device nor the potential downsides associated with this surgical procedure. There are some caveats tossed into this story, but they can’t overcome the hype. The story says in the lead that the implant “allowed three blind patients to see shapes and objects within days of treatment”. The next sentence says, “Experts described the study results as phenomenal”. The story does deserve credit for saying in the lead that only “three blind patients” saw vision improvement, but the story does little else to describe the limitations of the study or to place it in any context. The story engages in disease mongering by throwing in some sketchy numbers about the frequency of the disease. It says the device “could eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.” Later it says, “Retinitis pigmentosa in a genetic eye condition that leads to blindness and affects about 1 in 4,000 people worldwide.” By our math, 200,000 out of 6.8 billion people worldwide means that 1 out of every 34,500 people is affected. And if we’re just talking about adults, that number drops to 1 out of every 22,105 people, a far cry from 1 out of every 4,000. If it were truly one out of every 4,000 people worldwide, that would mean that 1.1 million people have the disease. The story does quote one presumed independent source, Robert Maclaren, a professor of Ophthalmology at Britain’s Oxford University. In the above mentioned Medical Technology Alert, the manufacturer announced that Dr. Maclaren will be the lead investigator on a clinical study expected to enroll six subjects to advance this same retinal implant technology. As a result, Dr. Maclaren can hardly be described as an independent expert. Overall, we felt that the story was missing a strong, independent analysis. Had the reporter talked with more researchers in the field or more clinicians, perhaps the story would have had a more thoughtful tone. The story mentions that there are other implants, saying, “Other types of retinal implants, known as epiretinal implants, sit outside the retina and because they bypass the intact light-sensitive structures in the eyes they require the patient to wear an external camera and processor unit.” But that’s not a true comparison, nor does it provide readers with the true picture of how much R&D is happening right now in this field. As is often the case in medicine, surgical options and devices are not the only solution. Lowly old Vitamin A is often the first step for treating retinitis pigmentosa. The story does a credible job noting that the device is under study and not commercially available. Unfortunately it also suggests, based on the manufacturer’s statement, that the device in a very early stage of development will be available in 5 years. The hyperbole used is indefensible – “the device could become routine for some kinds of blindness in five years” and “could eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide.”  This comes after a test in 3 people. The novelty of the device is established. The story does not rely on a news release, and, in fact, this news release from the University of Tubingen contains more interesting information about the study than the story.

Even though it is protected by the skull and meninges, surrounded by cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier, the delicate nature of the brain makes it vulnerable to numerous diseases and several types of damage. In humans, the effects of strokes and other types of brain damage have been a key source of information about brain function. Because there is no ability to experimentally control the nature of the damage, however, this information is often difficult to interpret.

During the second half of the twentieth century, Czech dialect use began to weaken. By the early 1990s dialect use was stigmatized, associated with the shrinking lower class and used in literature or other media for comedic effect. Increased travel and media availability to dialect-speaking populations has encouraged them to shift to (or add to their own dialect) standard Czech.

Governments around the world are trying to boost the number of available mechanical breathing devices that can supply air and oxygen, crucial for the care of people who suffer lung failure, which can be a complication of COVID-19. The modified version of an existing design by medical devices company Penlon will join a product from Smiths, which is already being built by a consortium of aerospace, engineering, Formula One and automotive firms to fulfil a government order. “We are working closely with our supply chain partners to rapidly scale up production to achieve our target of at least 1,500 units a week,” said Dick Elsy, chief executive of the VentilatorChallengeUK consortium. The government said on Thursday it wanted 15,000 Penlon devices and thousands from Smiths. The initiative comes after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called on industry to help combat the pandemic, with several manufacturers switching from their normal day-to-day activities to contribute to the project. Ford’s Dagenham plant in east London, Britain’s biggest automotive engine factory, is now testing and assembling some components for ventilators. Planemaker Airbus is using its Welsh Broughton site, which makes wings for commercial aircraft, for the sub-assembly of absorbers and flow machines. McLaren’s southern English Woking site is making trolleys on which the medical devices are fixed for use in clinical settings. Over 10,000 mechanical ventilators are available to patients in Britain’s publicly funded health service with more to come from this production run and overseas purchases, the government has said. But whilst new models need approval, it is also taking time to ramp up the output of existing designs and prompting questions about suitability. On Sunday, a source told Reuters that the government had cancelled an order for thousands of units of a simple model, known as BlueSky, because more sophisticated devices are now needed.

The story gives an overview of the meta-analysis and explains why the results of this new study may differ from earlier studies on which an FDA warning of increased suicidal behavior in children taking anti-depressants were based. The story provides the number needed to harm as well as other quantitative information on the benefits and risks of anti-depressants as they relate to improved mood and risk of suicidal thoughts and feelings. The story simply reports the results of a review of many studies looking at suicidal behavior in children and adults who were prescribed anti-depressant medications. The story would be improved by giving information on frequency of the conditions discussed, but there is NO disease mongering The story interviews one of the lead authors of the study. However we are not told if he has financial ties with the pharmaceutical makers of anti-depressant medications. The JAMA article gives conflict of interest info and there are potential conflicts that are not reported in the news story. The version of the story we reviewed was in the Cleveland Plain Dealer. This version does not provide other treatment options for children and teenagers who have anxiety disorders and/or depression such as psychotherapy, especially cognitive behavioral therapy. But the original AP story did include an interview with a Duke expert, unconnected with the JAMA study, who commented on cognitive behavioral therapy. The story does not provide information about the availability of anti-depressant medications for young children and teenagers. However, since this story deals with possible risks from these drugs, this criterion seems less important in this story. Anti-depressant medication treatment is children is a relatively new phenomenon. The story does not mention this. However, the focus of the story was to provide a more up-to-date report of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior in children taking these medications. Data from this recent systemic review suggest the risk is still there, but not as great as previously thought. The original AP story had interviews with two experts, one of them not connected with the research. So it's safe to assume it did not rely solely or largely on a news release. But the Cleveland Plain Dealer, in which we picked up the story, cut out the quotes from this independent source. A:","output":"Sure, I'd be happy to help!

Garrison, are of the opinion that the origin of the science of geology can be traced to Persia after the Muslim conquests had come to an end. Abu al-Rayhan al-Biruni (973–1048 CE) was one of the earliest Persian geologists, whose works included the earliest writings on the geology of India, hypothesizing that the Indian subcontinent was once a sea. Drawing from Greek and Indian scientific literature that were not destroyed by the Muslim conquests, the Persian scholar Ibn Sina (Avicenna, 981–1037) proposed detailed explanations for the formation of mountains, the origin of earthquakes, and other topics central to modern geology, which provided an essential foundation for the later development of the science. In China, the polymath Shen Kuo (1031–1095) formulated a hypothesis for the process of land formation: based on his observation of fossil animal shells in a geological stratum in a mountain hundreds of miles from the ocean, he inferred that the land was formed by erosion of the mountains and by deposition of silt.

[EX Q]: The third assessment report (TAR) prominently featured a graph labeled 'Millennial Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction' based on a 1999 paper by Michael E. Mann, Raymond S. Bradley and Malcolm K. Hughes (MBH99), which has been referred to as the 'hockey stick graph'. This graph extended the similar graph in Figure 3.20 from the IPCC Second Assessment Report of 1995, and differed from a schematic in the first assessment report that lacked temperature units, but appeared to depict larger global temperature variations over the past 1000 years, and higher temperatures during the Medieval Warm Period than the mid 20th century. The schematic was not an actual plot of data, and was based on a diagram of temperatures in central England, with temperatures increased on the basis of documentary evidence of Medieval vineyards in England. Even with this increase, the maximum it showed for the Medieval Warm Period did not reach temperatures recorded in central England in 2007. The MBH99 finding was supported by cited reconstructions by Jones et al. 1998, Pollack, Huang & Shen 1998, Crowley & Lowery 2000 and Briffa 2000, using differing data and methods. The Jones et al. and Briffa reconstructions were overlaid with the MBH99 reconstruction in Figure 2.21 of the IPCC report.

Even if a chloroplast is eventually lost, the genes it donated to the former host's nucleus persist, providing evidence for the lost chloroplast's existence. For example, while diatoms (a heterokontophyte) now have a red algal derived chloroplast, the presence of many green algal genes in the diatom nucleus provide evidence that the diatom ancestor (probably the ancestor of all chromalveolates too) had a green algal derived chloroplast at some point, which was subsequently replaced by the red chloroplast.

[Q]: When Sky Digital was launched in 1998 the new service used the Astra 2A satellite which was located at the 28.5°E orbital position, unlike the analogue service which was broadcast from 19.2°E. This was subsequently followed by more Astra satellites as well as Eutelsat's Eurobird 1 (now Eutelsat 33C) at 28.5°E), enabled the company to launch a new all-digital service, Sky, with the potential to carry hundreds of television and radio channels. The old position was shared with broadcasters from several European countries, while the new position at 28.5°E came to be used almost exclusively for channels that broadcast to the United Kingdom.

The Internet2 community, in partnership with Qwest, built the first Internet2 Network, called Abilene, in 1998 and was a prime investor in the National LambdaRail (NLR) project. In 2006, Internet2 announced a partnership with Level 3 Communications to launch a brand new nationwide network, boosting its capacity from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s.

It evolved into one of the first peer-to-peer network architectures, thus transforming DEC into a networking powerhouse in the 1980s. Initially built with three layers, it later (1982) evolved into a seven-layer OSI-compliant networking protocol. The DECnet protocols were designed entirely by Digital Equipment Corporation. However, DECnet Phase II (and later) were open standards with published specifications, and several implementations were developed outside DEC, including one for Linux.

Lord Lytton wrote in 1853 that On the common some young men were playing at hockey . That old - fashioned game , now very uncommon in England , except at schools ... Hockey 's popularity increased with that of other team games . A version of the game played in south - east London was rougher than the modern version , played on a very large field ( 247m by 64m ) , and used a cube of black rubber and rough planed sticks . The modern game was developed on the other side of London by Middlesex cricket clubs , especially Teddington Hockey Club . The members of these clubs were looking for winter exercise , but did not particularly care for football . In 1870 , members of the Teddington cricket club , who had recently moved to play in Bushy Park , were looking for a winter activity . They experimented with a ' stick ' game , based loosely on the rules of association football . Teddington played the game on the smooth outfield of their cricket pitch and used a cricket ball , so allowing smooth and predictable motion . By 1874 they had begun to draw up rules for their game , including banning the raising of the stick above shoulder height and stipulating that a shot at goal must take place within the circle in front of it . An association was formed in 1875 , which dissolved after seven years , but in 1886 the Hockey Association was formed by seven London clubs and representatives from Trinity College , Cambridge . Blackheath were one of the founder members , but refused to accept the rules drawn up by the other clubs and left to found the National Hockey Union .

This model will have learned patterns in the data that allow it to predict the intent behind a given passage.  There are several machine learning models that you can use, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), and neural networks like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Each model works differently and some may be more suitable for your task than others. Once you have chosen a model, you would feed it the passage and the two intent probabilities as input and output the predicted probabilities. However, note that without knowing the specific model you've used, the exact code can vary greatly. Here is a simplified example of how you could do this using a Naive Bayes model in Python: \`\`\`python from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB # Assume X and Y are arrays with passages and their intent labels respectively X_train = X[:, :5] # 5 features for text Y_train = Y[:5] # 5 labels # Train a Naive Bayes classifier clf = MultinomialNB() clf.fit(X_train, Y_train) def predict_intent(passage, clf_obj):     X_test = [[passage]]  # <1 feature> for text     Y_test = [0]  # <1 label>     return clf.predict(X_test)[0] print(predict_intent(\\"The weather today is hot and humid.\\", clf_obj)) \`\`\` In this code, we first need to vectorize the passage using a \`CountVectorizer\`. Then, we train a Naive Bayes classifier on the vectorized data.

Like I pointed out earlier, this is a simplified example and does not include the precise probability calculations.

[EX Q]: Wee1-like kinase (Wee1) is a tyrosine kinase which negatively regulates entry into mitosis at the G2 to M-phase transition and has a role in inhibition of unscheduled DNA replication in S-phase. The present study investigated the clinical role of Wee1 in advanced-stage (FIGO III-IV) ovarian serous carcinoma.', 'Wee1 protein expression was analyzed in 287 effusions using immunohistochemistry. Expression was analyzed for association with clinicopathologic parameters, including survival. Forty-five effusions were additionally studied using Western blotting. Wee1 was further silenced in SKOV3 and OVCAR8 cells by siRNA knockdown and proliferation was assessed.', 'Nuclear expression of Wee1 in tumor cells was observed in 265/287 (92%) and 45/45 (100%) effusions by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting, respectively. Wee1 expression by immunohistochemistry was significantly higher in post-chemotherapy disease recurrence compared to pre-chemotherapy effusions obtained at diagnosis (p=0.002). Wee1 silencing in SKOV3 and OVCAR8 cells reduced proliferation. In univariate survival analysis of the entire cohort, a trend was observed between high (>25% of cells) Wee1 expression and poor overall survival (p=0.083). Survival analysis for 109 patients with post-chemotherapy effusions showed significant association between Wee1 expression and poor overall survival (p=0.004), a finding which retained its independent prognostic role in Cox multivariate analysis (p=0.003). [EX A]: 1 [EX Q]: Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) neurofilament light chain protein (NFL) is a sensitive marker of neuronal injury in a variety of neurodegenerative conditions, including the CNS dysfunction injury that is common in untreated HIV infection. However, an important limitation is the requirement for lumbar puncture. For this reason, a sensitive and reliable blood biomarker of CNS injury would represent a welcome advance in both clinical and research settings.', 'To explore whether plasma concentrations of NFL might be used to detect CNS injury in HIV infection, an ultrasensitive Single molecule array (Simoa) immunoassay was developed. Using a cross-sectional design, we measured NFL in paired CSF and plasma samples from 121 HIV-infected subjects divided into groups according to stage of their systemic disease, presence of overt HIV-associated dementia (HAD), and after antiretroviral treatment (ART)-induced viral suppression. HIV-negative controls were also examined.', 'Plasma and CSF NFL concentrations were very highly correlated (r = 0.89, P < 0.0001). While NFL was more than 50-fold lower plasma than CSF it was within the quantifiable range of the new plasma assay in all subjects, including the HIV negatives and the HIV positives with normal CSF NFL concentrations. The pattern of NFL changes were almost identical in plasma and CSF, both exhibiting similar age-related increases in concentrations along with highest values in HAD and substantial elevations in ART-naïve neuroasymptomatic subjects with low blood CD4(+) T cells.

One example: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease.

Q: Intradermal injection of capsaicin into the hind paw of rats induces spinal cord central sensititzation, a process in which the responsiveness of central nociceptive neurons is amplified. In central sensitization, many signal transduction pathways composed of several cascades of intracellular enzymes are involved. As the phosphorylation state of neuronal proteins is strictly controlled and balanced by the opposing activities of protein kinases and phosphatases, the involvement of phosphatases in these events needs to be investigated. This study is designed to determine the influence of serine/threonine protein phosphatase type 2A (PP2A) on the central nociceptive amplification process, which is induced by intradermal injection of capsaicin in rats.', 'In experiment 1, the expression of PP2A protein in rat spinal cord at different time points following capsaicin or vehicle injection was examined using the Western blot method. In experiment 2, an inhibitor of PP2A (okadaic acid, 20 nM or fostriecin, 30 nM) was injected into the subarachnoid space of the spinal cord, and the spontaneous exploratory activity of the rats before and after capsaicin injection was recorded with an automated photobeam activity system. The results showed that PP2A protein expression in the spinal cord was significantly upregulated following intradermal injection of capsaicin in rats. Capsaicin injection caused a significant decrease in exploratory activity of the rats. Thirty minutes after the injection, this decrease in activity had partly recovered. Infusion of a phosphatase inhibitor into the spinal cord intrathecal space enhanced the central sensitization induced by capsaicin by making the decrease in movement last longer.

Ex Input: Changes of volume status can be readily inferred from variations in diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC) measured by ultrasound. However the effect of IVC changes following acute blood loss are not fully established. In this study, three different approaches to measuring IVC variables were compared in healthy blood donors, as a model of acute volume depletion, in order to establish their relative ability to detect acute blood loss.', 'Inspiratory and expiratory IVC diameters were measured before and after blood donation in hepatic long axis, hepatic short axis and renal short axis views using a 2-5xa0MHz curvilinear probe. All measurements were recorded and examined in real-time and post-processing sessions.', 'All windows performed satisfactorily but the renal window approach was feasible in only 30 out of 47 subjects.

Recombinant human EPO (5,000 IU/kg)-immersed GHM was injected into the right hind limb muscles (n = 12); the control groups included a saline-injected group (n = 12), an EPO-injected group (n = 8), and an empty GHM-injected group (n = 8).', 'Eight weeks later, improvement of blood perfusion to the ischemic limb was significantly augmented in the EPO-GHM group compared with any of the control groups. There was no increase in the hemoglobin level, nor was there any increase in endothelial progenitor cells. However, capillary and arteriolar densities were significantly increased in this group. Although the treatment did not affect the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor or interleukin-1 beta, it up-regulated the EPO receptor and matrix metalloproteinase-2 and activated the downstream signaling of Akt and also endothelial nitric oxide synthase in ischemic limbs, which might have been associated with the evident angiogenic and arteriogenic effects in the present system.

PRMT5 was inhibited by AMI-1 (a small molecule inhibitor of PRMTs) or small interference RNA (siRNA). The proliferation of HCC cells was tested by Cell Counting Kit-8, cell migration was evaluated by Transwell assay and cell cycle and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry. The effect of AMI-1 on HCC in vivo was examined by mouse xenograft model.', 'PRMT5 expression was markedly upregulated in HCC tissues, and correlated inversely with overall patient survival. Knockdown of PRMT5 significantly reduced the proliferation of HCC cells, but did not affect the growth of normal liver cells. Furthermore, β-catenin was identified as a target of PRMT5. Silencing PRMT5 significantly down-regulated the expression of β-catenin and the downstream effector Cyclin D1 in HCC cells. AMI-1 strongly inhibited HCC growth in vivo, increased the ratio of Bax/Bcl-2, and led to apoptosis and loss of migratory activity in several HCC cells. Meanwhile, AMI-1 decreased the expression levels of symmetric dimethylation of H4 (H4R3me2s), a histone mark of PRMT5.

Context: Mutations in CHD7, a gene previously implicated in CHARGE (coloboma, heart defect, choanal atresia, retardation of growth and/or development, genital hypoplasia, ear anomalies) syndrome, have been reported in patients presenting with Kallmann syndrome (KS) or congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH). Most mutations causing CHARGE syndrome result in premature stop codons and occur de novo, but the proportion of truncating vs nontruncating mutations in KS and CHH patients is still unknown.', 'The objective of the study was to determine the nature, prevalence, mode of transmission, and clinical spectrum of CHD7 mutations in a large series of patients.', 'We studied 209 KS and 94 CHH patients. These patients had not been diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome according to the current criteria. We searched for mutations in 16 KS and CHH genes including CHD7.', 'We found presumably pathogenic mutations in CHD7 in 24 KS patients but not in CHH patients. Nontruncating mutations (16 missense and a two-codon duplication) were more prevalent than truncating mutations (three nonsense, three frame shift, and a splice site), which contrasts with patients presenting with typical CHARGE syndrome. Thus, the clinical spectrum associated with CHD7 mutations may be partly explained by genotype/phenotype correlations. Eight patients also had congenital deafness and one had a cleft lip/palate, whereas six had both. For 10 patients, the presence of diverse features of the CHARGE spectrum in at least one relative argues against a de novo appearance of the missense mutation, and this was confirmed by genetic analysis in five families. Answer: Considering the large prevalence and clinical spectrum of CHD7 mutations, it will be particularly relevant to genetic counseling to search for mutations in this gene in KS patients seeking fertility treatment, especially if KS is associated with deafness and cleft lip/palate.","output":"Question: What is the significance of CHD7 mutations in patients with Kallmann syndrome and congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and how does it relate to genetic counseling for fertility treatment?

Ex Input: Context: Low-level vagus nerve stimulation (LL-VNS) has been demonstrated to protect myocardium against acute ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. However, the underlying mechanism of this protective effect remains unknown.', 'This study aimed to test the hypothesis that LL-VNS exerts cardioprotective effect on acute I/R injury in canines via antioxidative stress and antiapoptosis reactions.', 'Thirty anesthetized mongrel dogs were randomly divided into three groups: I/R group (N = 12, the left anterior descending coronary artery was occluded for 1 hour following by 1 hour reperfusion), LL-VNS group (N = 9, I/R plus LL-VNS), and sham group (N = 9, sham surgery without LL-VNS). The voltage threshold was set at 80% of the voltage required to slow the sinus rate. Infarct size was assessed with Evans Blue and triphenyltetrazolium chloride. Activity assays, TUNEL staining, and western blotting were performed to determine markers of oxidative stress and apoptosis.', 'LL-VNS significantly decreased the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias, increased vagal tone, as confirmed by heart rate viability, and reduced infarct size compared with the I/R group. This improvement was associated with a reduction in myocardial neutrophil infiltration, the inhibition of oxidative stress, and the suppression in cardiomyocyte apoptosis. In contrast, the lack of LL-VNS in the I/R group induced the opposite effect compared with the sham group. Answer: LL-VNS exerts protective effects on myocardial I/R injury. Its potential mechanisms involve the suppression of oxidative stress and cellular apoptosis.

Ex Input: Context: To develop a method for quick identification of sun-dried and sulfur-fumigated Cimicifugae Rhizoma by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).', 'The alcoholic and aqueous extracts of sun-dried and sulfur-fumigated Cimicifugae Rhizoma were analyzed and compared by FTIR combined with second derivative infrared spectroscopy.', 'FTIR spectra showed that there were some differences in the positions of infrared absorption peaks and the relative intensities in the alcoholic and aqueous extracts of sun-dried and sulfur-fumigated Cimicifugae Rhizoma, and the second derivative IR spectra clearly enhanced the spectral resolution of their differences. FTIR spectra showed that the new absorption peaks of Cimicifugae Rhizoma appeared and a part of original absorption peaks disappeared after sulfur-fumigation in aqueous extracts, while a lot of new absorption peaks appeared and the intensities of almost all absorption peaks significantly decreased after sulfur-fumigation in alcoholic extracts. Second derivative IR spectra showed that both sun-dried and sulfur-fumigated Cimicifugae Rhizoma extracted by water differed significantly from each other ranging from about 3 950 to 3 940 cm(-1), 3 850 to 3 800 cm(-1), 1 800 to 1 750 cm(-1), as well as from 1 400 to 1 350 cm(-1); Differences also existed between sun-dried and sulfur-fumigated Cimicifugae Rhizoma extracted by ethanol ranging from about 3 980 to 3 960 cm(-1), 3 850 to 3 800 cm(-1), and 1 500 to 1 460 cm(-1).

Few studies have comprehensively evaluated patient experiences of abortion care. The objectives of this study were to describe women's experiences of abortion care in their own words, and to determine themes across patient experiences.\\", 'Data for this thematic analysis, a qualitative method that allows for the identification, analysis, and report of patterns or themes within data, come from a larger study of safety and quality of aspiration abortion care across 22 clinical sites. Participants completed an abortion experience survey including fixed choice questions and an open-ended question: \\"Is there anything you would like to tell us about your experience?\\" The data were then categorized by responses to another survey question: \\"Overall, was your experience about, better, or worse than you expected?\\"', 'A total of 5,214 responses were analyzed. Women reported positive abortion care experiences with the majority of women rating their experience as better than expected (n = 3,600). Two major themes that emerged from the data include clinic- and patient-level factors that impact how patients rate their experiences. Analysis of the responses categorized in the worse than expected group (n = 136) found that women primarily faulted clinic-level factors for their negative experiences, such as pain control and management, and wait time for appointments and in clinic. Answer: This analysis highlights specific areas of abortion care that influence patients' experience. The few women who were disappointed by care in the clinic tended to fault readily modifiable clinical factors, and provided suggested areas of improvement to enhance positive experiences related to their abortion care.

[EX Q]: Context: Cadherins are calcium-dependent cell-to-cell adhesion glycoproteins playing a critical role in the formation and maintenance of normal tissue architecture. In normal mammary gland, E-cadherin is expressed by luminal epithelial cells, while P-cadherin is restricted to myoepithelial cells. Changes in the expression of classical E- and P-cadherins have been observed in mammary lesions and related to mammary carcinogenesis. P-cadherin and E-cadherin expressions were studied in a series of feline normal mammary glands, hyperplastic/dysplastic lesions, benign and malignant tumours by immunohistochemistry and double-label immunofluorescence.', 'In normal tissue and in the majority of hyperplastic/dysplastic lesions and benign tumours, P-cadherin was restricted to myoepithelial cells, while 80% of the malignant tumours expressed P-cadherin in luminal epithelial cells. P-cadherin expression was significantly related to high histological grade of carcinomas (p <0.0001), tumour necrosis (p = 0.001), infiltrative growth (p = 0.0051), and presence of neoplastic emboli (p = 0.0401). Moreover, P-cadherin positive carcinomas had an eightfold likelihood of developing neoplastic emboli than negative tumours. Cadherins expression profile in high grade and in infiltrative tumours was similar, the majority expressing P-cadherin, regardless of E-cadherin expression status. The two cadherins were found to be co-expressed in carcinomas with aberrant P-cadherin expression and preserved E-cadherin. Answer: The results demonstrate a relationship between P-cadherin expression and aggressive biological behaviour of feline mammary carcinomas, suggesting that P-cadherin may be considered an indicator of poor prognosis in this animal species. Moreover, it indicates that, in queens, the aberrant expression of P-cadherin is a better marker of mammary carcinomas aggressive behaviour than the reduction of E-cadherin expression. Further investigation with follow-up studies in feline species should be conducted in order to evaluate the prognostic value of P-cadherin expression in E-cadherin positive carcinomas.

Let me give you an example: Context: Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a heterogeneous disease with an uncertain pathogenesis. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) represent a recently discovered cell population which has been implicated in driving Th2 inflammation in CRS; however, their relationship with clinical disease characteristics has yet to be investigated. The aim of this study was to identify ILC2s in sinus mucosa in patients with CRS and controls and compare ILC2s across characteristics of disease. A cross-sectional study of patients with CRS undergoing endoscopic sinus surgery was conducted. Sinus mucosal biopsies were obtained during surgery and control tissue from patients undergoing pituitary tumour resection through transphenoidal approach. ILC2s were identified as CD45(+) Lin(-) CD127(+) CD4(-) CD8(-) CRTH2(CD294)(+) CD161(+) cells in single cell suspensions through flow cytometry. ILC2 frequencies, measured as a percentage of CD45(+) cells, were compared across CRS phenotype, endotype, inflammatory CRS subtype and other disease characteristics including blood eosinophils, serum IgE, asthma status and nasal symptom score. 35 patients (40% female, age 48 ± 17 years) including 13 with eosinophilic CRS (eCRS), 13 with non-eCRS and 9 controls were recruited. ILC2 frequencies were associated with the presence of nasal polyps (P = 0.002) as well as high tissue eosinophilia (P = 0.004) and eosinophil-dominant CRS (P = 0.001) (Mann-Whitney U). They were also associated with increased blood eosinophilia (P = 0.005). There were no significant associations found between ILC2s and serum total IgE and allergic disease. In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (P = 0.03). ILC2s were also correlated with worsening nasal symptom score in CRS (P = 0.04). Answer: As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia and have a potential role in the activation and survival of eosinophils during the Th2 immune response. The association of innate lymphoid cells in CRS provides insights into its pathogenesis. The answer to this example can be: Are group 2 innate lymphoid cells ( ILC2s ) increased in chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps or eosinophilia? Here is why: The question is based on the following sentences from the two passages (i) Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) {ii) In the CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP) population, ILC2s were increased in patients with co-existing asthma (iii) As ILC2s are elevated in patients with CRSwNP, they may drive nasal polyp formation in CRS. and (iv) ILC2s are also linked with high tissue and blood eosinophilia. OK. solve this: Context: An imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission underlies the glutamate hypothesis of schizophrenia. Agonists of group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, mGluR2/3, have been proposed as novel therapeutic agents to correct this imbalance. However, the influence of mGluR2/3 activity on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors has not been explored.', 'We aimed to investigate the ability of a novel mGluR2/3 agonist, LY379268, to modulate the availability of the excitatory N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) and the inhibitory gamma-aminobutyrate-A receptor (GABAA-R), in a two-hit mouse model of schizophrenia.', 'Wild type (WT) and heterozygous neuregulin 1 transmembrane domain mutant mice (NRG1 HET) were treated daily with phencyclidine (10 mg/kg ip) or saline for 14 days. After a 14-day washout, an acute dose of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 (3 mg/kg), olanzapine (antipsychotic drug comparison, 1.5 mg/kg), or saline was administered. NMDA-R and GABAA-R binding densities were examined by receptor autoradiography in several schizophrenia-relevant brain regions.', 'In both WT and NRG1 HET mice, phencyclidine treatment significantly reduced NMDA-R and GABAA-R binding density in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and nucleus accumbens. Acute treatment with LY379268 restored NMDA-R and GABAA-R levels in the two-hit mouse model comparable to olanzapine. Answer: We demonstrate that the mGluR2/3 agonist LY379268 restores excitatory and inhibitory deficits with similar efficiency as olanzapine in our two-hit schizophrenia mouse model.

Q: Context: Intravascular volume loss from ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is a major clinical concern. We hypothesize that angiotensin II decreases IR-mediated microvascular fluid leak via the angiotensin II type 2 receptor in a cAMP dependent manner. We therefore sought to determine hydraulic permeability after IR of venules treated with 1) angiotensin II, 2) angiotensin II and cAMP synthesis inhibitor, and 3) angiotensin II and an angiotensin II type 2 receptor antagonist.', 'Rat mesenteric post-capillary venules were micro-cannulated to measure hydraulic permeability (L(p)). IR was achieved by placing animals in a 5% oxygen environment and preventing venular flow, after which blood flow was allowed to resume. L(p) was measured after IR and treatment with 1) angiotensin II (20 nm), 2) angiotensin II (20 nm) + cAMP synthesis inhibitor (DDA,10uM), and 3) angiotensin II (20 nm) + type 2 receptor antagonist (PD-123319, 300 mum) (n=6 in each group).', 'Compared with the seven-fold increase in L(p) because of IR alone: 1) angiotensin II attenuated the seven-fold increase by 50% (P<0.005), 2) cAMP inhibition did not change the effect of angiotensin II on leak, and the type 2 receptor antagonist completely blocked the effects of angiotensin II on IR mediated leak. Answer: Treatment with angiotensin II attenuated increases in hydraulic permeability because of IR by 50%. Inhibition of cAMP synthesis did not change the effect of angiotensin II on IR mediated leak, and angiotensin II type 2 receptor inhibition completely blocked the effects of angiotensin II. These results indicate that angiotensin II decreases IR induced leak via the angiotensin II type 2 receptor in a cAMP independent manner.

Q: Context: Previous studies have suggested that post-irradiation GH insufficiency results from a loss of GHRH secretion, since many patients were able to release GH following exogenous GHRH stimulation. However, supramaximal doses of GHRH were used and the response may decline with time after radiotherapy. We re-evaluated the GHRH dose-response curve in patients post cranial irradiation and in controls.', 'Randomized controlled study.', 'Five adult male long-term survivors of childhood brain tumours (median age 21.8 years (18.4-26.7); 13.7 years (11.4-15.7) post-radiotherapy, >30Gy) and five matched controls were studied. An intravenous bolus of GHRH(1-29)NH(2) was administered in doses at the lower (0.05 microg/kg) and upper (0.15 microg/kg) range of the dose-response curves for young males, as well as the standard supramaximal dose (1. 0 microg/kg). GH was measured before stimulation, every 2min for the first hour and every 5min for the second hour. All studies were conducted in a random fashion.', 'Significantly lower peak and area under the curve (AUC) GH concentrations occurred in the irradiated group using 0.15 microg/kg (median peak Irradiated, 4. 5mU/l vs median Controls, 37.4mU/l; P<0.01) and 1.0 microg/kg (median peak Irradiated, 4.8mU/l vs median Controls, 15.2mU/l; P<0. 05) GHRH(1-29)NH(2). In irradiated subjects there was an incremental rise in GH output with increasing doses of GHRH(1-29)NH(2 )(median AUC: 122mU/l.min vs 179mU/l.min vs 268mU/l.min; P=0.007) reflecting altered pituitary sensitivity and reduced responsiveness. Answer: The GH response to bolus GHRH(1-29)NH(2) is attenuated in adult long-term survivors of childhood brain tumours.

A: Is the GH response to low-dose bolus growth hormone-releasing hormone ( GHRH ( 1-29 ) NH2 ) attenuated in patients with longstanding post-irradiation GH insufficiency? **** Q: Context: Pain intensity attenuates muscular activity, proprioception, and tactile acuity, with consequent changes of joint kinematics. People suffering from low back pain (LBP) frequently show movement control impairments of the lumbar spine in sagittal plane. This cross-sectional, observational study investigated if the intensity of LBP attenuates lumbar movement control. The hypothesis was that lumbar movement control becomes more limited with increased pain intensity.', 'The effect of LBP intensity, measured with a numeric rating scale (NRS), on lumbar movement control was tested using three movement control tests. The lumbar range of motion (ROM), the ratio of lumbar and hip ROM as indicators of direction specific movement control, and the recurrence and determinism of repetitive lumbar movement patterns were assessed in ninety-four persons suffering from LBP of different intensity and measured with an inertial measurement unit system. Generalized linear models were fitted for each outcome.', 'Lumbar ROM (+ 0.03°, p = 0.24) and ratio of lumbar and hip ROM (0.01, p = 0.84) were unaffected by LBP intensity. Each one point increase on the NRS resulted in a decrease of recurrence and determinism of lumbar movement patterns (-3.11 to -0.06, p ⩽ 0.05). Answer: Our results indicate changes in movement control in people suffering from LBP. Whether decreased recurrence and determinism of lumbar movement patterns are intensifiers of LBP intensity or a consequence thereof should be addressed in a future prospective study. A: Does pain intensity attenuate movement control of the lumbar spine in low back pain? **** Q: Context: Prolonged re-exposure to a fear-eliciting cue in the absence of an aversive event extinguishes the fear response to the cue, and has been clinically used as an exposure therapy. Arc (also known as Arg3.1) is implicated in synaptic and experience-dependent plasticity. Arc is regulated by the transcription factor cAMP response element binding protein, which is upregulated with and necessary for fear extinction. Because Arc expression is also activated with fear extinction, we hypothesized that Arc expression is required for fear extinction.', 'Extinction training increased the proportion of Arc-labeled cells in the basolateral amygdala (BLA). Arc was transcribed during latter part of extinction training, which is possibly associated with fear extinction, as well as former part of extinction training. Intra-BLA infusions of Arc antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) before extinction training impaired long-term but not short-term extinction memory. Intra-BLA infusions of Arc antisense ODN 3xa0h after extinction training had no effect on fear extinction. Answer: Our findings demonstrate that Arc is required for long-term extinction of conditioned fear and contribute to the understanding of extinction as a therapeutic manner. A:","output":"Does the inhibition of Arc expression in the basolateral amygdala impair long-term extinction memory in fear conditioning?"},{"instruction":"Given a passage with a context and an answer, construct a question on the basis of the information present in the passage.

This perceptual restoration for human speech is affected by prior experience. Here we provide evidence for perceptual restoration in complex vocalizations of a songbird that are acquired by vocal learning in a similar way as humans learn their language.', \\"European starlings were trained in a same/different paradigm to report salient differences between successive sounds. The birds' response latency for discriminating between a stimulus pair is an indicator for the salience of the difference, and these latencies can be used to evaluate perceptual distances using multi-dimensional scaling. For familiar motifs the birds showed a large perceptual distance if discriminating between song motifs that were muted for brief time periods and complete motifs. If the muted periods were filled with noise, the perceptual distance was reduced. For unfamiliar motifs no such difference was observed. Answer: The results suggest that starlings are able to perceptually restore partly masked sounds and, similarly to humans, rely on prior experience. They may be a suitable model to study the mechanism underlying experience-dependent perceptual restoration. Answer: Does stimulus familiarity affect perceptual restoration in the European starling ( Sturnus vulgaris )?  Question: Context: Two years ago the authors began to use Swan-Ganz catheters to generate more complex hemodynamic data as a better guide to resuscitation of burns. This study uses the information to identify differences between survivors and nonsurvivors.', 'Fifty-three consecutive patients with major burns were treated using Swan-Ganz-generated data. Additional information was collected, including demographics, intake and output, medications, and arterial blood gas (including calculated oxygen consumption). Statistical analysis incorporated adjustments for autocorrelation.', 'The patients included 38 men and 15 women, averaged 43.7 years of age, and had a mean burn size of 40%. Thirteen patients suffered severe inhalation injury. Data collected hourly over 3 days were collapsed across 6-hour observation periods. Mean values, when plotted across time, discriminated the 37 survivors from the 16 nonsurvivors. Poor response to resuscitation as evidenced by increased use of colloid fluid and cardiotonic drugs plus failure to maximize oxygen consumption were associated with nonsurvival. Answer: Unsustained or inadequate response to hyperdynamic resuscitation of burns was associated with nonsurvival. Answer: Do survival in major burn injuries is predicted by early response to Swan-Ganz-guided resuscitation?  Question: Context: Knowledge concerning hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is rapidly changing.', 'We sought to understand the factors that influence how residents assimilate this knowledge.', 'We conducted an anonymous survey of residents in an internal medicine residency. Questions included personal demographic information and aspects of training (didactic and experiential) regarding and knowledge about HRT. Data were analyzed using univariable and multivariable linear regression.', \\"Sixty-nine of 92 residents (75%) completed the survey. The gender and race of respondents did not differ significantly from the overall group. Knowledge scores were higher among residents in nontraditional (Women's Health, Primary Care, and Internal Medicine-Pediatrics) training tracks (p = .04) and among residents with patient population of < or = 30% postmenopausal women (p = .049). Demographic characteristics and didactic training about HRT did not influence knowledge. Answer: Nontraditional residency track and higher proportion of postmenopausal women in a practice (experiential learning) improve knowledge about HRT. Didactic training has no effect.

However, it remains unclear whether volume overload imposes those detrimental effects through endothelial dysfunction.', 'In this cross-sectional study, 81 stable patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in a single center were recruited. Volume status was evaluated by extracellular water, assessed by bioimpedance analysis, and normalized to individual height (nECW). Endothelial function was estimated by endothelial-dependent flow-mediated dilatation (FMD) of the brachial artery and expressed as percentage change relative to baseline diameter.', 'There were 37 male and 44 female patients (mean age 61 +/- 12 years, dialysis vintage 20 +/- 23 months). FMD in female patients was significantly higher than that in male patients (9.17% +/- 6.23% vs 6.31% +/- 5.01%, p < 0.05). FMD was negatively correlated with weight (r = -0.308, p < 0.01), body mass index (r = -0.242, p < 0.05), systolic blood pressure (r = -0.228, p < 0.05), ECW (r = -0.404, p < 0.001), and nECW (r = -0.418, p < 0.001). No correlation was found between FMD and other variables. In multiple stepwise regression analysis, calcium x phosphate product (beta = 0.422, p < 0.001), nECW (beta = -0.343, p < 0.01), and dialysis vintage (beta = -0.237, p < 0.05) were independent determinants of FMD (adjusted R(2) = 0.327 for this model). Answer: There was independent correlation between index of volume status and FMD, and higher nECW was related to worse endothelial function. The results of this study may help us understand the underlying mechanism of volume overhydration leading to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. Answer: Is volume overhydration related to endothelial dysfunction in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients?  Question: Context: Pain intensity attenuates muscular activity, proprioception, and tactile acuity, with consequent changes of joint kinematics.

Answer: Does pain intensity attenuate movement control of the lumbar spine in low back pain?  Question: Context: To determine whether the CT angiography (CTA) spot sign marks bleeding complications during and after surgery for spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).', 'In a 2-center study of consecutive spontaneous ICH patients who underwent CTA followed by surgical hematoma evacuation, 2 experienced readers (blinded to clinical and surgical data) reviewed CTAs for spot sign presence. Blinded raters assessed active intraoperative and postoperative bleeding. The association between spot sign and active intraoperative bleeding, postoperative rebleeding, and residual ICH volumes was evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression.', 'A total of 95 patients met inclusion criteria: 44 lobar, 17 deep, 33 cerebellar, and 1 brainstem ICH; ≥1 spot sign was identified in 32 patients (34%). The spot sign was the only independent marker of active bleeding during surgery (odds ratio [OR] 3.4; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3-9.0). Spot sign (OR 4.1; 95% CI 1.1-17), female sex (OR 6.9; 95% CI 1.7-37), and antiplatelet use (OR 4.6; 95% CI 1.2-21) were predictive of postoperative rebleeding. Larger residual hematomas and postoperative rebleeding were associated with higher discharge case fatality (OR 3.4; 95% CI 1.1-11) and a trend toward increased case fatality at 3 months (OR 2.9; 95% CI 0.9-8.8). Answer: The CTA spot sign is associated with more intraoperative bleeding, more postoperative rebleeding, and larger residual ICH volumes in patients undergoing hematoma evacuation for spontaneous ICH. The spot sign may therefore be useful to select patients for future surgical trials.

I work in a very stressful job (emergency medicine) and see  a lot of mental health issues that get out of control.

She has lost friends because she comes off as completely desperate for approval, so I am really the only person she talks to outside of work. I told her as such and she got extremely upset as if I was insulting her. She is still refusing to seek help and is saying that it's \\"just who she is\\" that has driven friends away and that nothing will change it. I have gotten frustrated to the point that I get angry with her very easily.

He’s worked okay jobs for 8 years now, shares an apartment with our dad which means his rent is low but he uses all his money on unhealthy foods and goods and technology and games. He has no savings, has had a wreck of a credit score once or twice plus an addiction or two. For the past year though he’s been on a path for better life style and priorities.  I have worked more than 3 years a minimum wage job and have roughly 3000 in savings, I manage my expenses well and even have the money to have some fun yet these days I can manage to save up to 400euros a month.  Now the situation: to get a promotion he would need a drivers license. Getting one here would mount up to 1050-1500euros all together and as I said he has no savings. He asked if I could lend him the money and he’d pay back all of it plus 300euros interest, each a month in 150euro payments.  I’ve loaned him money before (last time was end of last month) and sometimes he comes through with the promised repayment schedule, sometimes he attempts to get around it claiming he’d already paid me all he owes me which leads to arguments and threats of me telling everyone what he did.  A thousand euros is a lot of money. Along with all that I might leave for university in autumn which means I would like to have savings as a fallback should I not find a part time job along with studies and just to feel safe.  A part of me wants to help him and if he doesn’t pay my mom is prepared to give him hell for it but I’m scared.  I told him I would think about it but I fear he will become emotionally abusive (he’s been like it before) if I don’t help him because “I’m doing so much better than him”. Fyi, he gets paid more than I do, he’s just stupid and doesn’t save money.  I love him but I have very big trust issues even with myself when it comes to money. I fear that his payments will slow down or stop and for my future’s sake I can’t afford it. But 3000euros is already a lot of money considering I have a steady income, and he could really use this in order to boost his income and status at work.

I take it back to the kitchen and explain that it has mould and I’m sorry but I can’t eat it. I will make myself something else. Parent a goes ballistic. I’m “ungrateful and don’t trust them and did I really think they’d feed me mould?” I pointed out the mould- clearly visible. “Well someone must’ve not sealed the bread package properly (ie me) and that’s how it got mouldy.” I asked if parent a had checked the date and that just seemed to escalate their reaction. They stormed out screaming and crying. I checked the bread date and it was 2 or 3 days past the best before. Aita in either situation? Parent a’s reaction made me think I was. But now I’ve had the same situation with parent b and they didn’t get angry or pissed off maybe I wasn’t the asshole? Obviously I think I need to just make my own food. Then I can’t cause trouble.

My boyfriend (30M) and I (25F) rent a house together in a nice town by the ocean. We have an great landlord that can sometimes be weird but otherwise he is a good guy. The other day I was home alone, smoking some weed and cleaning around the house. There was a knock and doorbell ring at the door, so obviously I go to answer it (and spray some febreze first lol). Random guy says “Hello I’m so and so from a local solar panel company and I was wondering if I could come in and take a look inside the house and the attic.” I glance behind him and I don’t see a car with any solar panel company logo. I say something along the lines of no, I wasn’t informed by my landlord that anyone would be stopping by so I’m sorry but have a good day. He insisted. He said something like please I’m supposed to do this, are you sure he isn’t here etc. etc. I again say no, told him to call my landlord then and proceeded to shut the door. That was that, stranger saunters off.   Later on that day, landlord stops by and is kind of annoyed with me. Landlord says“ that guy drove two hours to come here and you just sent him off like that. You should buy him a six pack or something to say sorry!” He kept going on about it. I told him next time someone is stopping by to inform me because I will never let a stranger in the house regardless if I am alone or not.   Also, I did not mention this is not the first time he has sent someone by without informing me and I have shut the door in their face. I don’t believe I am in the wrong here but I also am hyper aware of crimes/rapes/murders that have happened because of situations like this.

POST : Last year I went through a tremendous heartbreak after the love of my life - Beryl - broke up with me. I was taking Xanax, Valium and other downers on a routine basis to ease the pain and spiralled into addiction. I was living with Beryl's workmates and they decided to kick me out because they felt like it would be more convenient for her. I was at the peak of my addiction and my best mate Steve and his girlfriend Rosa decided to let me stay at their flat for a bit when I was going cold turkey. I was too depressed and in so much pain from the withdrawals that I went on sick pay and the next month was so much better. Days became months and I was staying there. I started dating again and met a lovely woman called Catherine but I couldn't shift my heartbreak about Beryl. This caused many arguments, including her crying and me punching the walls and myself. I got addicted to nitrous and Xanax I lost track of my finances and Catherine was loaning me a bit of money for living expenses. I also began obsessively watching videos by Jordan Peterson and Camille Paglia, as they really resonated with me. Despite my misery I would try and make myself happy by making art around the house, such as collaging pornographic magazines for a laugh. I would record songs for my band, singing my heart out until 2AM in the morning. I spent most days in front of the telly vaping and eating chips. I think as much as it became my home, it became my cocoon. I didn't have a job or a regular income so I couldn't pay three months rent.  The fights I was having with Catherine were becoming more frequent. She didn't like the media I was watching and I didn't like her criticising it and it became a push and shove between us. I quit nitrous and have been cleaning up. Me and Catherine broke up. Unfortunately Rosa dropped the bomb on me that she recently got engaged to Steve. Great, I though! Except she wanted me leave on a month's notice. How is that possible?? I have no income, no friends in the area and I fell out with all my family. I'm so unhappy I can't even wash. What do you do when you've got no family and no friends and nowhere to go? Nowhere to stay? I found a place shortly after a casual friend turned out to be living close by but after taking out three quarters of my stuff Rosa kept messaging me even though I practically moved out so I unfriended her and Steve. Now they are now complaining that I didn't pay rent and I'm a sponge and whatnot. I have nothing to pay. Can you really accuse someone who has nothing of being a sponge?! So I'm wondering Reddit if I am. tl;dr - best friend lets me stay with him when I'm withdrawing from addiction and very heartbroken, I relapse into addiction, lose track of money and can't pay rent. Best friend's fiancé kicks me out on a month's notice when I'm penniless and now is saying I'm a sponge for being unable to pay rent and cutting them out my life. AITA?

POST : A few months ago my partner started studying and part of that study is to work in a relevant workplace. She does this 3 times a week Monday-Wednesday and it's a 5 minute drive from my office. Even though she starts 45 minutes earlier than I do I told her I didn't mind getting to work a little earlier and driving us both to work.  However over the past few months I've come to dread our morning commute, she takes over the radio and puts on her Spotify playlists, which are always dreary love songs (Dido for example). She rarely speaks to me - and if she does it's in a very quiet and low tone of voice which I cannot hear over the radio. If I ask her to speak up (as I am a little deaf) and she will repeat what she has said in a more aggressive tone; She will occasionally shout at me that I have been ignoring everything she's been saying (when she knows I am hard of hearing and she needs to be louder), and every time I try to have a conversation with her, she shuts me down; either by grunting and ending the conversation or just groaning and saying she's too tired for the interaction. Today was our 2nd day back after the Christmas break and after a very long awkward silence I tried to make it clear that I'm aware she's tired on a morning, but we have the exact same sleeping pattern and I'm tired too. That on a morning before I get to work I like to engage a little bit so my brain is at least ready for human interaction, and that after spending a 45 minute drive in awkward silence, its more depressing and leaves me in a worse disposition than if I just commute on my own.  She was upset with me and said it's not her fault she isn't a morning person and kept repeating that she's just tired. We spent the rest of the drive in silence.  Am I The Asshole here?

I [F17] have a 13 year old brother, whose a lot bigger and stronger than me. Sometimes I annoy him out of sheer boredom, because that’s what siblings do. It’s never anything that could actually hurt him or anything, just stuff like a little push, putting something in his hood, touching the computer while he’s gaming or grabbing his phone.  He pretty much always responds very aggressively, usually by hitting me. (Not for long, just once or twice). As he is much bigger than me, it hurts a lot and I can never defend myself.  My dad never does much to stop it unless it becomes an actual fight. But he never told my brother off for what he did. This really pissed me off, because IMO my brother shouldn’t be allowed to hit me over such minor annoyances, or for any reason for that matter, and get away with it. My dad disagrees with me and says that it’s my own fault, because I provoked him, knowing that he would probably hit me.  I can see where my dad is coming from but I’m still conflicted. I know I’m not an angel either and I know that if he would get scolded, I should get scolded too. But AITA for wanting my brother to get told off for hitting me, when I provoked him?  A:","output":"Hello! I'm here to help you with your question. The claim that the post is HISTORICAL is true. The post describes a situation that has already happened, where the author's brother has hit them in response to minor annoyances. It's important to note that physical violence is never an appropriate response to annoyances or conflicts, and it can cause harm and be hurtful. It's understandable that the author is conflicted about the situation and wants their brother to be held accountable for their actions. It's also important to recognize that provoking someone can be a form of aggression, and it can escalate situations. However, it's not a justification for physical violence. It's important to communicate and resolve conflicts in a respectful and peaceful manner. If you are experiencing similar situations, it may be helpful to talk to a trusted adult, such as a parent or a counselor, about what you are going through. They may be able to provide guidance and support in resolving the situation. Please remember that it's important to treat others with respect and kindness, even if they are siblings or people we are close to. Physical violence is never the answer, and there are always other ways to resolve conflicts and communicate our feelings in a healthy and appropriate manner."},{"instruction":"Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation.

Problem: Is AUTHOR wrong in the post ? POST : 3 parties here. Myself, the boyfriend, and the girlfriend. We'll call the boyfriend Y, and the girlfriend K. The friend in question is K. I met Y and K in first year of university, when they were both single, and had what I think was a pretty good friendship with both of them individually for about a year before they started dating. They saw each other for about four years, seeing each other through graduation and eventually getting an apartment together. This is through our undergrad years (still quite a developmental time). They were easily two of my closest friends as individuals. Breakup context: K started a new program at school, with which came a new set of friends. Y's work had him out of town for weeks at a time, so K is often at their shared apartment on her own. Relationship appears to get a little rocky. The distance and time apart seems to be doing nobody any favours. One of the new friends K meets is a guy that she gets close with, call him M. I hear from K that M has a poor opinion of K's boyfriend Y (my friend), and their relationship. M's comments appear to be regular. I hear all this from K, and tell her at the time that those sound like red flags of someone who's trying to split a couple up so he can slot in. M has admitted to doing exactly that before. Y is obviously in arms about the whole thing. About 4 months into this arrangement (shared apartment, new job and new program) things come to a head and K calls it quits. It's messy because they're in the middle of the lease, and it's taxing on everyone. K and Y can both be stubborn and argumentative, and that's the side that comes out. I had a suspicion that M was the driving force behind K breaking up. This is just from how K has described M to be. Without any evidence I gave K the benefit of the doubt and tried to be as supportive as I could to both K and Y. I see Y often and we talk as often as we normally do. Communication with K drops off a cliff. Months later, I heard that K and M hooked up very soon after the breakup (approx 1 week). I think I enough for me to say K ignored the red flags we showed her months ago, and purposely played right into M's hands, hurting my friend Y in the process. So I decide I'm not interested in hanging out with K anymore (not a big deal, since she's cut me off anyway). A couple of years later, they're broken up and I hear through the grapevine she's apologetic and wants to reach out again. Our other mutual friends are all closer with Y than K, or vice versa and that dictates their opinion. I'm trying to stick to my guns.  I'm in her town this weekend with some mutual friends for an unrelated reason, and this is affecting our plans (some want to catch up with her, some don't care... And me).

The author is not being self-righteous for not wanting to get together with K, as they feel that K ignored their warnings and played right into M's hands.

He wants to “give his little girl away” and it’s a big deal for him, as I’m the only daughter he has. However, I am sure that I do not want him to walk me down the aisle for a number of reasons, and I’ve felt this way for about a decade now.  1. I find the whole process of “giving away the bride” old fashioned and sexist. I’m a grown woman making decisions for myself, financially independent and my dad (or anyone else in my life) has no say in whether or not I get married. 2. My dad is an okay father, but a shit husband.  He’s not winning any awards for father of the year, but not abusive or an alcoholic or particularly negligent. However, he’s a terrible husband who spent most of his marriage to my mother being a cheating, narcissist piece of shit and only in the past 5-6 years has turned it around. For 13 years, he had no respect for his wedding vows and has cheated on every woman he’s ever been with. When I found out about his cheating in high school and told him to fess up to my mother, he chickened out and I had to do it myself. It was devastating for me to be dragged into his bullshit like that, and fundamentally changed the way that I see him. I was really close to my dad growing up, so realizing that he was capable of being so awful cut me pretty deep.  Part of this is about punishing him for what he did to my mother, and to me. Who forces a 16 year old to tell her mother that her father is having an affair? But a bigger, more important part is that I don’t want a guy who is incapable of staying faithful having any part of me committing to being faithful for the rest of my life. He obviously doesn’t respect marriage, so who do I have to act like he did?  Anyway, am I the asshole?  Answer:","output":"No. The author in the post is not wrong.

This has been going on for a while now, but it's only recently become an issue to me. When he moved in this time last year, him and his gf had just broken up, and my bf moved in with us at the same time. He's been meeting girls on tinder and having them over since then, and it's never really been a problem. Bf and I just let him do his thing. However, the number is now up to 3-4 different women coming over every week. Some are repeats, but honestly he brings in new girls more often than going back for seconds. He claims these girls know the deal, but I cant imagine that they truly know the extent of women he's fucked...of course everyone has different opinions but I could never fuck a guy I knew was literally inside another girl the night before. Also I've mentioned STD testing to roomie who said hes \\"already been tested this year, I'm good\\". OK bud, not how that works.  And on the other hand, I'm simply no longer comfortable with the flow of different and unknown people in my house. It gets ridiculous, to come inside nearly every day and be introduced to a new girl. Yes I have tried purposely mixing up names, or making remarks like 'which one is this?' its like a joke to him.  I try and never use it as leverage, however the fact is that I own this house and will be here for much longer than he will. And I'm not comfortable with this many randos having our address. What happens when one of them wasnt expecting to go home at the end of the night and causes a scene? Or worse?  I also don't understand why he always has women over here. However I have heard him take credit for ownership and cleanliness of the house, when he barely pays rent on time and doesn't clean a fucking thing.   Not to mention, apparently nearly every girl he has over has made a comment about how attractive MY SO is. Being the sort of insecure person that I am, this just makes me feel even more uncomfortable in my own home. I'm not one to judge. I know he has rights to have people over.  However, me and BF specifically asked him to not have someone over last night and he did. He waited until we were asleep, which makes it slightly better, but we were going through a difficult time and wanted privacy, not just that night but the next morning as well. and he refused to respect our wishes even though it states in our lease agreement that all residents must be okay with a visitor.  TLDR; roommate has 3-4 different women over every week to fuck, he doesn't clean up after himself in general and is not a great rooommate, now after he disrespected our request for a night of privacy and mentioned that nearly every girl he fucks makes a comment about how attractive my SO is, I'm just fed up with my roommates promiscuity. At least, done with it happening at my house.   Would you be okay with this situation?  Am I even rational?? A:","output":"Yes, the AUTHOR is wrong in the situation.

(1)He began attending school.(2)He skipped a grade in school. 1 The lobbyist persuaded the legislature to support the bill. (1)The president vetoed the bill.(2)The legislature passed the bill.","output":"In the answer above, each letter corresponds to a word in the original question: English  Premise: My stomach hurt. Alternative 1 (1): I jogged on the treadmill. Alternative 2 (2): I ate birthday cake. Answer: 2 When we consider the premise \\"My stomach hurt,\\" it's more plausible that eating birthday cake (Alternative 2) would cause this discomfort rather than jogging on the treadmill (Alternative 1). As we all know, eating food, especially sweet or high-fat foods, can lead to discomfort in the stomach, which is commonly known as indigestion or heartburn. This is more common than discomfort from jogging on a treadmill, which doesn't typically make one's stomach hurt unless there's a specific medical condition or injury.  Therefore, based on our understanding of common human experiences, Alternative 2 (2) \\"I ate birthday cake\\" is more plausibly the cause of \\"My stomach hurt\\" than Alternative 1 (1) \\"I jogged on the treadmill.\\" Similarly, for the other questions: Premise: The child learned how to read. Alternative 1 (1): He began attending school. Alternative 2 (2): He skipped a grade in school. Answer: 1 In this case, it's more plausible that attending school (Alternative 1) would cause a child to learn how to read (Premise). School is generally the place where we gain formal education, including reading skills. Thus, Alternative 1 (1) \\"He began attending school\\" is more plausibly the cause of \\"The child learned how to read.\\" Finally, for: Premise: The lobbyist persuaded the legislature to support the bill. Alternative 1 (1): The president vetoed the bill. Alternative 2 (2): The legislature passed the bill. Answer: 2 In this case, the premise describes an action taken by the lobbyist (Alternative 2) which led to the legislature supporting the bill. Therefore, it's more plausible that the legislature passing the bill (Alternative 2) was the effect of the lobbyist's action (Premise) rather than the president vetoing it (Alternative 1). Vetoing the bill doesn't necessarily imply that it was passed by the legislature, but rather that the president disagreed with it, and hence, blocked its passage."},{"instruction":"Given a premise and two alternatives, choose the alternative that is a more plausible cause or effect of the situation described by the premise.

Context: Giant-cell tumor of bone is a rare, locally aggressive tumor that typically occurs in the bones of skeletally mature young adults in their second to fourth decades. Traditionally, surgery has been the mainstay of therapy for this disease, but the disease can recur even with optimal procedures. Furthermore, it may occur in locations where a surgical approach would be morbid. The maturation of the understanding of the role of the receptor activator of nuclear factor-B ligand (RANKL) in the pathophysiology of giant-cell tumor of bone has led to the use of denosumab, a monoclonal antibody against RANKL, in this disease. In 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration approved denosumab for use in patients with recurrent/unresectable/metastatic giant-cell tumor of bone or for patients in whom surgery would be morbid.

For example, think of all the time you waste taking cigarette breaks, rushing out to buy a pack, hunting a light, etc. Set a date for quitting --- perhaps a special day like your birthday, a holiday. If you smoke heavily at work, quit during your vacation. Make the date holy seriously, and don't let anything change it. Begin to condition yourself physically; start a modest exercise; drink more water; get plenty of rest. Immediately after quitting... The first few days after you quit, spend as much free time as possible in places where smoking is prohibited, e.g. libraries, museums, theatres, department stores, etc. Drink large quantities of water and fruit juice. Try to avoid wine, coffee, and other drinks which remind you of cigarette smoking. Strike up a conversation with someone instead of a match for a cigarette.

As the totals suggests, I [28m] and my wife [27f] have been trying for a child for about 6 months. There are a couple factors at play here as to why we may be having difficulties, so my thought is to rule out as much as possible. She has a bleeding disorder and a family history of ovarian cysts, and I am a bit concerned about whether or not we will even be able to have children.  Yesterday, we found out that for yet another month, we were unsuccessful. In my frustration, I put my hands on my head and she immediately followed with “why are you making this about you?” I tried to explain that I was struggling with each month getting our hopes up and that she probably felt the same way. She didn’t want to hear my side and it ended in an argument about how I “make it about me.” I can understand how I could have put my feelings aside, but in the moment after hearing a “no” again, I was a bit distraught. I followed up by suggesting that she go and get a check up. For the last 9 months she has been without insurance (quit her job to pursue a dream of hers, and has no benefits). I recently was able to get her on my benefits, and so this is a possibility. She is making the claim that it is her body, and that it is her decision. I can’t force her to go get checked up.  Her big Hangup is that doctors typically say that you need to try to conceive for 1 year before bothering them with any concerns of issues with pregnancy. We are at month 6. I suggested that my wife tell a white lie (how will they know when we started anyway?) in order to find out if there are any issues with her bleeding disorder, or cysts. She again reiterated that it isn’t my choice, and that she wanted to wait for a year.  Again, I am only hoping to rule out medical concerns for conceiving. I in no way an accusatory or think that it is “her fault.” Hell, the problem might even be me?

Example Input: My mental health hasn’t been great lately. SO’s family invited themselves over for Thanksgiving and at that time I was feeling ok about it, but today I felt way too stressed about a lot of things and had a breakdown. I couldn’t bear the thought of entertaining and pretending to be happy, not to mention cooking and cleaning. SO has uninvited them (he wasn’t too keen on their coming over anyway) but is unhappy about the timing of it all. I definitely feel bad but I am also relieved. AITA? Example Output: asking my so to uninvite family for thanksgiving Example Input: I’ve (21) been frustrated by my boyfriend’s (23) sister Lauren (name changed, will call her L). She makes reckless decisions without regard for consequences. L has never really done anything for herself, she is now 30 years old but has never pursued a particular career or paid her own rent, she has been supported by my bf’s family. Recently she fell pregnant to man she had only briefly dated and decided to have the baby. After this the relationship broke down and she moved back in with my bf’s family (he lives at home so I often spend time there). She was consistently rude and bratty to bf and his family. She would leave food scraps and rubbish everywhere and would send rude messages to anyone if they annoyed her slightly. L also adopted a dog a few years ago which she failed to walk or take proper care of and that responsibility now also falls on my bf’s parents.  I will occasionally make comments to my boyfriend as it makes me angry seeing L treat everyone this way. An example: in order to help L her parents recently bought an apartment for her to live in rent-free. L constantly comments on how ‘dark and depressing’ the place is (It’s honestly very nice). I told my boyfriend that I found this ungrateful and immature.  I’d never criticise L to her face as I don’t believe it’s my place. However, recently my bf and I had a fight about an unrelated issue and he got really upset. Afterwards, he told L that I’ve been critical of her. L took this really badly. She blocked me on social media and did nothing but vent anger to her family. A week or so later my bf and I patched things up and I wanted to try and make amends to L. He told me that L had been messaging him about the situation, and at this point I was confused about why she was so upset so I asked if I could see some of the messages she’d sent to try and understand where she was coming from. The messages were really aggressive and including things like ‘OP is a nasty bitch’, ‘OP needs regular therapy’ and ‘OP is emotionally abusive’.  After reading this I was really angry, I typed out an apology to Lauren but it was badly worded and this escalated the situation even further. She called my boyfriend’s parents screaming that she was a victim and that I was being hurtful. After giving the situation some time, I wrote another more careful apology which she finally responded to. At this point she is still unaware that I have seen her hurtful messages.  My bf wants to try and forget this situation but I’m feeling hurt and think I deserve an apology. However, this would involve telling her that I’d read the messages, which would no doubt stir up more drama. Part of the issue is that Lauren had a rough childhood with issues like bulimia, and is having a hard time being a single mother. AITA for insisting that she should apologise? I realise that she has had a hard time but I still believe L should be accountable for her actions.

Today I contacted one of the higher up managers to report the incidents, and requested to remain anonymous.

I'm a person that enjoys sleeping but he seems like not having to sleep (always staying up till very late even tho he's waking up early)  The thing is that he's always waking me up with the noise of his phonr, at night, at 3 am or even at 6am and I always wake up and tell him to please lower the volume since I'm sleeping right next to him (sometimes even wen we're cuddling and I'm deeply asleep he puts a video on his phone (he usually fels asleep watching videos or series at night and most of the time I turn off the screen when he fels asleep so I can sleep) full volume right next to my ear at witch I wake up scared and tell him to lower the volume)  But this morning it annoyed me the most because: 1-. Last night I feel asleep at 9:30pm as he was in the living room playing, came to the room aroun 11pm with a full volume video on his phone waking me up. 2-. This morning he went to the bathroom around 6am and keept watching a video with full volume for over 20 minutes at witch I went to the bathroom told him to lower the volume and closed the bathroom door 3-. When he came back to bed I told him again how annoyed I am with him waking me up every time he's watching a video like he can't even be considerated towards my sleep at witch he said \\"you could wake up with me as well\\" like??? No I'd rather sleep tru the night and rest properly for when I'm leaving the house to work 4-. After that he kept watching videos next to me and telling me things like \\"listen to this\\" until like 7:30 am that I asked him what time it was and he COMPLAINED THAT I WAKED HIM FROM A DREAM I gave him a petty answer like \\"oh what a shame right?\\" And left for work and left him sleeping  (we both work and have really flexible schedules)  So how can I tell him that his bad sleeping is annoying me without being an asshole or without him brushing it off and satisfying that I'm just lazy?? Sorry it's too long I'm pretty frustrated TD;LR How do I tell my boyfriend he is disturbing my sleep waking me up at random moments of the night/morning with really loud Facebook videos or anime when I'm sleeping next to him or watching videos in bed until he fels asleep without being an asshole or coming across as lazy or overreacting?","output":"\\"My Boyfriend's Loud Facebook Videos are Keeping Me Up at Night: How to Communicate Effectively\\""},{"instruction":"Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, generate a suitable title that describes the main event/root cause of the situation. Imagine that the given text is a social media post, and you have to write the title of the post, so the users can decide to read the main text or not. Let me give you an example: My boyfriend (well just call him M) and I are creators on Instagram (he is also on TikTok). I'm a digital and traditional artist and in one of my classes we create t shirts and things (socks, lanyards, water bottles, stickers, you name it). I'm a big fan of putting my art on t shirts so I can sell them. M wanted to make some posts for TikTok and wanted to use the shirt I made today. My one personal rule is that if the shirt isn't being given to someone else, then I wear it first (this is because I know I wont get it back. Ive made one other shirt that I've worn, and he wore it for a week and hasn't given it back.) So I told him no, because I haven't worn the shirt yet.  M proceeded to complain about not having content to post, and how his IG post today didn't get any engagement, saying \\"of course you dont know, because you never look.\\" Am I the asshole for wanting to wear the shirt I made just once? The answer to this example can be: wanting to wear a shirt Here is why: The paragraph describes an argument of the author with her boyfriend regarding not wanting to give the shirt she just made before wearing herself. This desire to wear the shirt raises the ethical situation. OK. solve this: (throwaway account) For a bit of backstory, my sister and I are roughly the same age and our whole lives we’ve been told that we look like twins. This really bothers me because I appreciate my individuality, and I want to be seen as more than somebodies look-a-like.  Lately, I’ve been trying new things like getting trying a new fashion style, getting piercings, etc. And every time I do one of these things, my sister goes and does it the next day. What really made me mad was that three days ago, I really wanted to change up my look so I decided to dye my hair red. My sister then decides she wants to do the same thing the next day. I got really mad and I sort of yelled at her for always copying me and making me feel like a mannequin for whatever she wants to try next. She tells me that I should be flattered because it means she thinks I look nice. I told her I’m going to start telling people we’re not related. Am I the asshole?

I work at a higher pace than him, while im also responsible for training and evaluating him. In general hes a good guy but hes clumsy as all hell. Tripping, bumping into desks and people, dropping things. I think its a combination of stress at learning something new and being just an older clumsy guy not used to faster office environments. I tell him multiple times to calm down and move deliberately as he walks around, but he hasnt improved much. Regardless i was going to give him a good review and pass him until this happened. Im sitting at my desk typing away at my work laptop when he walks up and leans on a near by cabinet. He places his coffee on said cabinet.

My boss thinks i shouldve been easier on him since our office was so close to his home and hes being transferred somewhere thats like an hour away vs a 5 minute drive to our office. AITA and was i too harsh? Example Output: AUTHOR Example Input: I live in an apartment that is on the top floor, on the side, with a 3BR unit below and a 2 BR unit next to me. I have no roommates. I start work at 7:30AM M-F which puts me having breakfast around 6:30AM. I like blending fruit and veggies into smoothies, which makes a considerable amount of noise for about 30 seconds. Am I the asshole for blending so early in the morning?  Example Output: OTHER Example Input: I used to be very close friends with this person and we had lots of good times together, but I cut them off last autumn because they were toxic and manipulative. The \\"break-up\\" was messy at the time but we're civil nowadays even though we don't talk. They have been smoking weed for the better part of a year now and it is illegal where I live. They tried to sell some to me as well while we were both underage last summer, and I am 99% sure they are currently selling to kids at our high school (I have heard these interactions). I am 100% sure they smoke regularly, and they have come to school high a few times as well as smoked outside during our breaks. This person barely comes to school (1-3h a day even though they would have an 8h day) and often just disturbs the class if they are there. Though we aren't acquainted anymore I still know a lot about the severe mental health issues this person has because of how close we were earlier; they are becoming worse and worse. Almost everyone knows that they smoke weed - it's part of their reputation. As I was discussing some stuff related to me with our school counselor, I decided to tell her about this person and their drug issues. This has now been forwarded to the principal, but that is all I know. I provided some screenshots where the person was trying to sell weed to me via text messages as proof of what I told the counselor per her request. Am I an asshole for busting them? This person has told me that smoking makes them less anxious and depressed - my morals do not align with what they are doing (selling, promoting) in our school community, which is why I decided to bring this up with a personnel from our school.

AITA and was i too harsh? Example Output: It's understandable that you're frustrated with your coworker's clumsiness, especially since it resulted in damage to your laptop and papers. However, it's important to consider the reasons behind his behavior. It's possible that he's struggling to adjust to the faster pace of the office environment, and his clumsiness may be a result of stress or nervousness. While it's understandable that you gave him a poor review, it's important to consider the impact that this may have on his career. Being transferred to a different location may not be a viable solution for him, especially if it's an hour away from his home. It may be more productive to work with him to address the issues you've identified and provide support to help him improve. Additionally, it's important to recognize that everyone makes mistakes, and it's possible that your coworker didn't intentionally mean to damage your laptop. It may be helpful to have a conversation with him to understand what happened and to see if there's a way to move forward in a positive way. Overall, it's important to approach this situation with empathy and understanding, while also addressing the issues that need to be addressed."},{"instruction":"Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, identify who is wrong here.

Q: I run a Dnd campaign my wife (Lisa) and best friend (Robert), among others. We have a policy with accepting new people. They play a temp character for 3 weeks. At the 4th week, if there are no objections we allow them to make their own original character and join anew. This is so we can vet new people because unfortunately, you tend to run into a lot of weirdos in the nerd community. About halfway through the encounter, Steve starts getting bored. He fidgets a lot, squirms in his seat, starts toying with stuff on my desk, etc.  He gets up, wanders behind me (a big no-no in DnD), takes my guitar down and starts playing it. I turn to him, a bit confused and ask, \\"Yo, what are you doing? Put that up and go sit down. What the hell man?\\" He puts the guitar away and sheepishly makes it make to his seat. The rest of the night was uneventful, so I texted him this morning.  \\"I should mention something before it becomes a problem. I don't mind folks standing up and stretching their legs when it's not their turn. I'd rather you stay focused and strategize, but I understand if you need to move around. But, please don't come into view of my screen, and especially don't start touching my stuff or playing my guitar. I'm not sure what gave you the idea that was ok, but it was definitely not. The guitar is a gift from my wife and it isn't for others to play. I'm not upset with you, I understand most people who own a guitar expect that people will try to play it. I wish you'd asked first, but it's not like you broke it or anything, so I'm just saying this as a caution. But during a combat encounter, playing the guitar is just... an odd choice for your time, I think.\\" STEVE \\"you should probably detune it if it isn't for playing. Takes pressure off the truss rod and keeps it from bending the fret board\\" At this point, I've gone from annoyed but willing to talk it out, to somewhat miffed. Like what the fuck dude? Someone tells you to not touch their stuff and you say \\"well don't make it inviting if you don't want someone touching it?\\" Me \\"It's fine the way it is. I play it. Not you.\\" STEVE \\"You're belaboring the point. I understood last night.\\"  ME \\"And yet. You haven't apologized\\" I showed this to Lisa and Robert, both of whom I trust completely with these sorts of things. Where Lisa at first was like \\"Maybe he's just lonely and has a hard time in social situations? Remember that Kurtzgezat video on loneliness? He mentioned he doesn't have any friends,\\" Robert said, \\"You should have just let it go, dude.\\" The rest of the conversation with Steve were along the lines of how me asking him to apologize is \\"demanding he prostrate himself\\" to me, or that telling him to stay out from behind the DM screen is me accusing him of cheating. So now I feel like an asshole. I don't think it's unfair of me to set clear boundaries for guests in my house, and certainly don't think simply talking about that is \\"belaboring the point.\\"  A:","output":"In this situation, the person who is wrong is Steve. He crossed boundaries by touching the DM's personal belongings without permission and playing the guitar, even after being asked not to. Steve's response to the DM's request for an apology and setting boundaries was dismissive and defensive. The DM, Lisa, and Robert are not wrong in this situation as they were trying to address the issue and maintain clear boundaries for guests in their house."},{"instruction":"Given a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation, judge whether or not a specific person is wrong here.

He wasn’t planning to marry me so I broke up with him, after a week he begged me to marry him but after he rejected my request I started to realize that marrying him was not the right decision - I still love him but we will face many difficulties-. He cried a lot - he never cried before -. He said that he was going to die frim pain. He asked me to say the truth if I want to marry him or not. And I said I want be we must consider the difficulties. Actually I’m not really sure. I do love him but I’ll lose some many people including my parents. I’m not sure if it’s worth or not. Please let me know about what should I do? - I never loved anyone else but him, but I’m not sure if I love him enough to lose my family and hurt my mother’s feelings? Am I a horrible person who changed my mind ?  [A]: not answerable  [Q]: I(26m) decided that I was going to go on one more spring break vacation with my boys and that was during the last spring break I went on, which was in 2018. The vacation was set to be a full week which I told her about since the beginning of our relationship. So it has been set in stone for awhile. Me and my SO have been together since November of 2018 which is not that long but long enough for us to be getting pretty serious. We don’t live together but she comes over often. I would say on average 4 times a week.  Before I left I would tell her to come over to my house every day, instead of the usual of other day or so, but  I  get off a  late from work a lot and most of the time we would get together by 9ish at night and I would be going to sleep pretty soon after that because I wake up at 6am, and the longer day wipes me out. Even then I would stay up with her until about 1030 to 11ish, because I wanted to spend more time with her before I left.  I left on Saturday and on Friday we were hanging out from the time I got out of work until about 1030 that night. This is when one of my best friends, pretty much my brother, wanted to come over because he wasn’t going to going to go on the  trip with me and my other best friend. All of us are basically family.  Now this is were it went bad because I hung out with them all night and we got drunk. I ended up drinking something bad or my stomach just wasn’t feeling right and I got sick and felt like throwing up in the middle of us having sex. She didn’t seem to be mad at me about this and was trying to be consulting about it but I felt like a POS after that happened. Then I woke up late the next morning because of the drinking. She wanted me to have sex with her again to make up for what I had done the night before  but I had to leave to get to where me and my fiend were going for spring break which was about an 8hr drive so I told her that all I could really do was have a quickie and she made it seem like by saying that she was just some side chick or something like that.  I never really thought that it was that big a deal when I said it but I do see her point. In my mind I just wanted to get to where me and my friend had to go and spend one more night with my brother before I left for the week because I rarely get to see him now, maybe once a month, because he is with a girl that is really controlling of him. I feel like I do see her point but also that I really didn’t do a thing wrong because I’ll be coming hack relatively soon.

Title: Kinetics of neurotensin gene expression in the developing gut Abstract: Background: Expression of the gene encoding neurotensin (NT/N) is regulated in a strict temporal- and spatial-specific pattern during gut development; the mechanisms (that is, transcriptional versus posttranscriptional) responsible for this expression pattern are not known. The purpose of this study was to determine whether developmental changes in NT/N expression reflect alternations in gene transcription. Methods: Sensitive ribonuclease protection assays were performed with a rat NT/N genomic probe containing the entire sequence of both exon 1 and intron 1 hybridized with RNA from fetal (day 19) and postnatal (days 14, 28, and 60) rat jejunum and ileum; signals were quantitated densitometrically. Results: Mature (exon 1) and precursor (exon 1 + intron 1) NT/N RNA, initially low in the fetus, increased dramatically by postnatal day 14 and attained maximal levels by day 28. NT/N RNA levels remained stable in the ileum of the 60-day-old rat but decreased in the jejunum, consistent with the typical expression pattern in the gut. Conclusions: Concomitant changes in expression of precursor and mature NT/N RNA suggest that NT/N gene regulation occurs at the level of transcription in the gut during development. Identifying the factors that regulate NT/N gene transcription is crucial to our understanding of how neurotensin functions in the gut.","output":"Based on the article titled \\"Kinetics of neurotensin gene expression in the developing gut\\" and its abstract, here are five distinct questions that can be addressed by this article: 1.

Here are some supporting facts to explain why the answer \\"ecosystem\\" is correct: 1. Definition of niche and habitat: A niche refers to the unique position or role that a species occupies within an ecosystem, while a habitat is the environment in which a species lives. Both concepts are closely related and work together to create the complex web of interactions within an ecosystem. 2. Interdependence of species: Each species in an ecosystem has a specific niche that it occupies, and it relies on other species in the ecosystem to fill other niches. For example, plants in a forest ecosystem rely on insects and animals to pollinate them, while insects and animals rely on plants for food and shelter. 3. Ecosystem services: Ecosystems provide essential services such as air and water filtration, soil formation, and climate regulation. These services are crucial for the survival and well-being of all species within an ecosystem, including humans. 4. Complexity of interactions: Ecosystems are complex systems with many interactions between species, including predator-prey relationships, competition for resources, and mutualism. These interactions are critical for maintaining the balance and stability of an ecosystem. 5. Resilience of ecosystems: Ecosystems have the ability to recover from disturbances, such as natural disasters or human activities. This resilience is due to the diversity of species within an ecosystem, which allows some species to compensate for the loss of others. 6. Importance of preserving ecosystems: Human activities such as deforestation, pollution, and overfishing can have severe consequences for ecosystems and the species that depend on them. Preserving ecosystems is essential for maintaining biodiversity, providing ecosystem services, and ensuring the long-term survival of species. In conclusion, the concepts of niche and habitat are closely related to the broader context of ecosystems. Understanding these concepts is essential for appreciating the complexity and interdependence of species within ecosystems, as well as the importance of preserving these delicate systems for the health of the planet and its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"Given a scientific question and its correct answer, generate supporting facts for the answer.

The group of 6 people will include the 19 people who weigh the same and the 1 person who weighs differently. 2. Compare the two groups of 7 people on the see-saw. If they balance, then the person who weighs differently is in the group of 6. If they don't balance, then the person who weighs differently is in the group of 7 that is heavier or lighter. 3. If the person who weighs differently is in the group of 7, divide this group into three groups: two groups of 2 people and one group of 3 people. Compare the two groups of 2 people. If they balance, then the person who weighs differently is in the group of 3. If they don't balance, then the person who weighs differently is in the group of 2 that is heavier or lighter. 4.

But Gillespie performed quite well with downstate traditional conservative Republican voters, failing to resonate in his own homeland of Northern Virginia. He only did a tiny bit better than Trump in the heart of the swamp — Fairfax County. That's Gillespie's home county! [EX A]: I will break down the sentiments mentioned in the text as follows: 1. Some say the \\"attempt at fusionism failed.\\" This implies a negative sentiment toward Gillespie's political strategy approach, following several positions of both parties, possibly based on a lack of consistency or a perceived attempt to appeal to too many voters. This leads to a \\"no\\" for a Positive sentiment towards Gillespie in this context. 2. Other users feel Gillespie did not have the benefit of running against Clinton, additionally stating that she lost nationwide despite having several resources to her cause. This implies that running against Clinton would have had a more favorable outcome for Gillespie, hence a \\"maybe\\" for a Positive sentiment, depending on which user has the correct perspective. 3. Others hold that Gillespie being an accomplished lobbyist for the \\"swamp,\\" which symbolizes a corrupt political environment in the United States, against the current anti-establishment sentiment, significantly reduced his chances and captured a meager performance. This takes us to a \\"no\\" for a Positive sentiment. Summing the overall sentiment analysis based on the breakdown of the text, we end up with: 1. Negative 2.

The expected number of random numbers, uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, that you need to sum to exceed 1 is approximately 2.71828. This number is actually the mathematical constant e, which is the base of the natural logarithm.  Here's a simple way to understand it: 1. The first number you draw will be between 0 and 1. So, you're guaranteed at least one number. 2. The probability that the second number will push the sum over 1 is the remaining distance to 1. Since the first number is uniformly distributed, on average, it will be 0.5, so there's a 0.5 chance that the second number will push the sum over 1. 3. If the sum after the first two numbers is still less than 1, on average, you'll be at 0.75, so there's a 0.25 chance that the third number will push the sum over 1. 4. And so on...

First, you need to connect to your MySQL database and extract the data. You can use the \`pymysql\` and \`pandas\` libraries in Python to do this: \`\`\`python import pymysql import pandas as pd # Create a connection object dbServerName    = \\"127.0.0.1\\" dbUser          = \\"root\\" dbPassword      = \\"root\\" dbName          = \\"DatabaseName\\" charSet         = \\"utf8mb4\\" cusrorType      = pymysql.cursors.DictCursor connectionObject   = pymysql.connect(host=dbServerName, user=dbUser, password=dbPassword,                                      db=dbName, charset=charSet,cursorclass=cusrorType) try:     # Create a cursor object     cursorObject = connectionObject.cursor()                                          # SQL query string     sqlQuery = \\"SELECT * FROM TableName\\"        # Execute the sqlQuery     cursorObject.execute(sqlQuery)     #Fetch all the rows     rows = cursorObject.fetchall()     # Create a DataFrame from the fetched data     df = pd.DataFrame(rows) except Exception as e:     print(\\"Exeception occured:{}\\".format(e)) finally:     connectionObject.close() \`\`\` 2. Next, you need to preprocess the data. This includes handling missing values, outliers, and encoding categorical variables: \`\`\`python from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer # Handle missing values imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean') # or median if the data is not normally distributed df = pd.DataFrame(imputer.fit_transform(df), columns = df.columns) # Handle outliers Q1 = df.quantile(0.25) Q3 = df.quantile(0.75) IQR = Q3 - Q1 df = df[~((df < (Q1 - 1.5 * IQR)) |(df > (Q3 + 1.5 * IQR))).any(axis=1)] # Encode categorical variables le = LabelEncoder() df['gender'] = le.fit_transform(df['gender']) df['socioeconomic_status'] = le.fit_transform(df['socioeconomic_status']) \`\`\` 3. Now, you can create your linear regression model. You can use the \`LinearRegression\` class from the \`sklearn.linear_model\` module. You also need to split your data into training and testing sets: \`\`\`python from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression X = df.drop('final_grade', axis=1) y = df['final_grade'] X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42) model = LinearRegression() model.fit(X_train, y_train) \`\`\` 4. To prevent overfitting, you can use regularization techniques such as Ridge or Lasso regression: \`\`\`python from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge ridge = Ridge(alpha=1.0) ridge.fit(X_train, y_train) \`\`\` 5. Finally, you can evaluate your model using cross-validation and compare it to other models: \`\`\`python from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeRegressor from sklearn.svm import SVR models = [model, ridge, DecisionTreeRegressor(), SVR()] model_names = ['Linear Regression', 'Ridge Regression', 'Decision Tree', 'Support Vector Machine'] for i, model in enumerate(models):     cv_scores = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=5)     print(f'{model_names[i]} Average Score: {np.mean(cv_scores)}') \`\`\` This is a basic guide and might need adjustments based on your specific dataset and requirements."},{"instruction":"Given a set of [FACTS] and a [QUESTION], you have to pick up which items in the [FACTS] set are required to answer the [QUESTION].

Reference to historical event or cultural phenomenon: From the ancient Greek civilization, where music played a vital role in religious and civic life, to the contemporary global music scene that brings together diverse cultures and genres, music has been an integral part of human history and has contributed significantly to the evolution of society. For instance, during the 1960s, music played a significant role in the American civil rights movement, with songs like \\"We Shall Overcome\\" and \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" becoming anthems of the struggle for racial equality. Similarly, the rise of hip-hop in the 1970s and 1980s gave voice to the experiences and struggles of marginalized communities in the United States, and today, music continues to be a powerful tool for social and political activism. In addition, music has the ability to transport us to different eras and cultures, evoking emotions and memories associated with those times and places. For example, the music of the Beatles, which blended rock and roll, skiffle, and folk, helped to define the spirit of the 1960s, while the rhythms and melodies of Afrobeats, a genre that originated in West Africa, have become a symbol of African cultural identity and a reflection of the continent's rich musical heritage. In conclusion, music has the unique ability to bring people together, bridge cultural divides, and inspire social change, making it a powerful force in shaping our individual and collective experiences."},{"instruction":"Given a set of five words, generate the word from the set that does not belong (i.e. is the least relevant) with the other words.

Note: Please refer to the table in the given prompt for the completion times of each task.","output":"Certainly! Here's an algorithm to optimize the process of completing tasks within the given time frame using the Fibonacci number strategy: 1. Create a list of Fibonacci numbers up to the maximum task number. You can start with [0, 1] and generate the rest of the Fibonacci numbers using the formula Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2. 2. Sort the list of completion times for each task in ascending order. 3. Initialize a variable \\"maxTasks\\" to 0 to keep track of the maximum number of tasks that can be completed. 4. Iterate through the list of Fibonacci numbers in descending order, starting from the largest Fibonacci number less than or equal to the time frame (30 minutes). 5. For each Fibonacci number, iterate through the sorted list of completion times. 6. Check if the sum of the completion times of the current task and the previous tasks (if any) is less than or equal to the time frame. 7. If the sum is less than or equal to the time frame, increment the \\"maxTasks\\" variable and subtract the completion time from the time frame. 8. Continue this process until the time frame is exhausted or there are no more tasks that can be completed. 9. Return the value of \\"maxTasks\\" as the maximum number of tasks that can be completed within the given time frame using the Fibonacci number strategy. Here's a Python implementation of the algorithm: \`\`\`python def fibonacci_tasks(completion_times):     fibonacci_nums = [0, 1]     max_tasks = 0     time_frame = 30     while fibonacci_nums[-1] <= time_frame:         fibonacci_nums.append(fibonacci_nums[-1] + fibonacci_nums[-2])     completion_times.sort()     for fib_num in fibonacci_nums[::-1]:         for time in completion_times:             if time <= time_frame:                 max_tasks += 1                 time_frame -= time             else:                 break     return max_tasks \`\`\` You can pass a list of completion times to the \`fibonacci_tasks\` function and it will return the maximum number of tasks that can be completed within the given time frame using the Fibonacci number strategy."},{"instruction":"Given a set of numbers consisting of both positive and negative values, identify the number which has the greatest absolute value.

The survey contains two questions: one inquiring about the level of satisfaction with the service and the other asking about the likelihood of recommending the service to a friend. The possible responses are categorized into five levels for each question.","output":"To calculate the mean score for each question using a Likert scale, follow these steps: 1. Assign numerical values to each level of response. For the level of satisfaction question, you can assign the following values: - Very Satisfied: 5 - Satisfied: 4 - Neither Satisfied nor Unsatisfied: 3 - Unsatisfied: 2 - Very Unsatisfied: 1 For the likelihood of recommending the service to a friend question, you can assign the following values: - Very Likely: 5 - Likely: 4 - Neither Likely nor Unlikely: 3 - Unlikely: 2 - Very Unlikely: 1 2. From the set of responses, count the number of each level of response for both questions. Let's say the responses for level of satisfaction are as follows: - Very Satisfied: 20 respondents - Satisfied: 35 respondents - Neither Satisfied nor Unsatisfied: 10 respondents - Unsatisfied: 5 respondents - Very Unsatisfied: 0 respondents Likewise, for the likelihood of recommending the service to a friend: - Very Likely: 25 respondents - Likely: 40 respondents - Neither Likely nor Unlikely: 5 respondents - Unlikely: 2 respondents - Very Unlikely: 3 respondents 3. Multiply the number of respondents for each level by the assigned value for each level. For level of satisfaction: - Very Satisfied: 20 * 5 = 100 - Satisfied: 35 * 4 = 140 - Neither Satisfied nor Unsatisfied: 10 * 3 = 30 - Unsatisfied: 5 * 2 = 10 - Very Unsatisfied: 0 * 1 = 0 For likelihood of recommending the service to a friend: - Very Likely: 25 * 5 = 125 - Likely: 40 * 4 = 160 - Neither Likely nor Unlikely: 5 * 3 = 15 - Unlikely: 2 * 2 = 4 - Very Unlikely: 3 * 1 = 3 4. Sum the results from step 3 for each question to get the total score. Total score for level of satisfaction: 100 + 140 + 30 + 10 + 0 = 280 Total score for likelihood of recommending the service to a friend: 125 + 160 + 15 + 4 + 3 = 307 5. Count the total number of respondents. In this example, the total number of respondents is the same for both questions: 20 + 35 + 10 + 5 + 0 = 70 respondents 6. Divide the total score for each question by the total number of respondents to calculate the mean score. Mean score for level of satisfaction: 280 / 70 ≈ 4.0 Mean score for likelihood of recommending the service to a friend: 307 / 70 ≈ 4.39 So the mean scores for level of satisfaction and likelihood of recommending the service to a friend are 4.0 and 4.39, respectively, on a scale of 1 (very unsatisfied or very unlikely) to 5 (very satisfied or very likely)."},{"instruction":"Given a set of rules and a text, check if the text fully meets the rules, and explain why.

Problem: What is the value of 738/82 + (-83)/9?","output":"To solve this problem, we first need to perform the addition and then the division. Remember that when dividing by a number, we invert it and multiply. 738/82 - 83/9 First, let's solve -83/9 + 738/82. To do this, we can find a common multiple for both the numerators and then compute the sum. The common multiple of 9 and 82 is 72. So, we need to multiply both the numerators and denominators by 9/82: (-83)(9/82) + (738)(1/82) Now we can calculate the sum: (-83)(9/82) + (738)(1/82) The sum is: (-83*1/82) + (738*1/82) The sum is: (-1/9) + (738/82) Now, we have the expression: 738/82 - 83/9 = (-1/9) + (738/82) To simplify further, we can add the two fractions directly: (-1/9) + (738/82) = (738/82 - 1/9) Now, we can calculate the difference of the denominators and use it to find the LCM of both denominators: Difference = 82 - 9 = 73 LCM of 82 and 9 is 729. Finally, we can convert the whole expression to an equivalent fraction with the LCM as the denominator: (738/729) - (1/9) The value of 738/82 - (-83)/9 is (738/729) - (1/9)."},{"instruction":"Given a skewed-right dataset with outliers on the high end, consisting of 1000 numbers stored in a SQL database, please provide a SQL query that calculates the mean, median, and mode of the dataset.

Please note that the dataset is provided for reference: you should assume that the actual dataset in the SQL database is different.","output":"To calculate the mean, median, and mode of a skewed-right dataset with outliers on the high end, we need to use appropriate statistical methods.  For the mean, we can use the trimmed mean method, which involves removing a certain percentage of the highest and lowest values from the dataset before calculating the mean. For example, we can use the 5th percentile trimmed mean, which involves removing the lowest 5% and highest 5% of values.  For the median, we can use the Winsorized median method, which involves replacing the extreme values with less extreme values. For example, we can replace the lowest 1% and highest 1% of values with the next closest value.  For the mode, we can use the adjusted mode method, which involves replacing the highest frequency value with a less extreme value. For example, if the highest frequency value is 1000, we can replace it with 999.  Here is a SQL query that calculates the 5th percentile trimmed mean, Winsorized median, and adjusted mode of the dataset: \`\`\`sql WITH cte AS (   SELECT      ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY value) AS rank,     value   FROM      table_name   WHERE      value > 0 -- exclude negative values ) SELECT    percentile_cont(0.05, cte.value) AS trimmed_mean,   percentile_cont(0.5, cte.value) AS winsorized_median,   MAX(cte.value) - 1 AS adjusted_mode FROM    cte WHERE    cte.rank <= 999 -- exclude extreme values GROUP BY    1; \`\`\` In this query, we first create a common table expression (CTE) that ranks the values in the dataset and excludes negative values.

Hint: The triangles are not to be feared!  [Mark down] The area of the original square is x^2. If we cut out four identical right-angled isosceles triangles from each corner of the square, the side length of the resulting square is (x-2s), where s is the length of each leg of the right-angled isosceles triangle. Thus, the area of the resulting square is (x-2s)^2.  We are given that the area of the resulting square is equal to the area of the original square. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:  x^2 = (x-2s)^2 Expanding the right-hand side of the equation, we get:  x^2 = x^2 - 4xs + 4s^2 Subtracting x^2 from both sides, we get:  0 = -4xs + 4s^2 Dividing both sides by 4s, we get:  0 = -x + s Therefore, we have s = x.  Substituting this into the equation x^2 = (x-2s)^2, we get:  x^2 = (x-2x)^2 Simplifying, we get:  x^2 = 4x^2 Dividing both sides by x^2, we get:  1 = 4 This is a contradiction, so there is no solution.","output":"I'm sorry, but there seems to be a mistake in your calculations.

However, substituting s = x into the equation x^2 = (x-2s)^2 would lead to 0 = 0, which doesn't provide us with any useful information. Instead, let's go back to the equation 0 = -4xs + 4s^2. This can be rewritten as: 4xs = 4s^2 Dividing both sides by 4s, we get: x = s This means that the side length of the smaller square (which is x - 2s) is equal to the length of the side of each triangle (which is s).

However, I can help you understand how to read a stock market chart.  A stock market chart provides information about a stock’s historical and current price movements. It can show the opening and closing prices for each trading period, as well as the high and low prices for that period.  1. Upward Trend: If the chart shows a series of higher highs and higher lows, it is in an upward trend, which might suggest that the stock price will continue to rise.  2. Downward Trend: If the chart shows a series of lower highs and lower lows, it is in a downward trend, which might suggest that the stock price will continue to fall.  3. Moving Averages: These are also used to identify trends. If the stock price is above its moving average, it's generally considered to be in an upward trend, and vice versa. 4. Volume: This shows the number of shares traded during a particular period. If a price increase is accompanied by high volume, it's a stronger signal that the price might continue to rise. 5. Patterns: Certain patterns on a chart may suggest future price movements. For example, 'head and shoulders' or 'double top' patterns might suggest a future price drop, while 'cup and handle' or 'double bottom' patterns might suggest a future price rise. Remember, these are just tools and they don't guarantee future performance. It's important to also consider other factors like the company's financial health, market conditions, and your own risk tolerance when making investment decisions."},{"instruction":"Given a story, answer the question about the story.

The pointer \`i\` represents the start of the current substring, and the pointer \`j\` represents the end of the current substring. For each character \`s.charAt(j)\` encountered, we update \`i\` to the maximum of its current value and \`charIndex[s.charAt(j)]\`. This ensures that \`i\` always points to the start of the current substring without repeating characters. We also update \`maxLength\` to the maximum of its current value and \`j - i + 1\`, which represents the length of the current substring without repeating characters. Finally, we update \`charIndex[s.charAt(j)]\` to \`j + 1\` to mark the last index of the character \`s.charAt(j)\`.

In the given input, the buyer seems interested in buying the items and negotiates the price with the seller. In the first conversation, the buyer expresses interest in the car and asks about the carfax report. The seller provides the necessary information about the car and the buyer asks about the mileage and fuel efficiency. The buyer then negotiates the price, and the seller agrees to lower it. The buyer accepts the deal and purchases the car. In the second conversation, the buyer expresses interest in a chair and negotiates the price with the seller. The buyer and seller have a bit of a crossed signal and the deal falls through.

Q: Paragraph:  Concept work for Valkyria Chronicles III began after development finished on Valkyria Chronicles II in early 2010 , with full development beginning shortly after this . The director of Valkyria Chronicles II , Takeshi Ozawa , returned to that role for Valkyria Chronicles III . Development work took approximately one year . After the release of Valkyria Chronicles II , the staff took a look at both the popular response for the game and what they wanted to do next for the series . Like its predecessor , Valkyria Chronicles III was developed for PlayStation Portable : this was due to the team wanting to refine the mechanics created for Valkyria Chronicles II , and they had not come up with the \\" revolutionary \\" idea that would warrant a new entry for the PlayStation 3 . Speaking in an interview , it was stated that the development team considered Valkyria Chronicles III to be the series ' first true sequel : while Valkyria Chronicles II had required a large amount of trial and error during development due to the platform move , the third game gave them a chance to improve upon the best parts of Valkyria Chronicles II due to being on the same platform . In addition to Sega staff from the previous games , development work was also handled by Media.Vision. The original scenario was written Kazuki Yamanobe , while the script was written by Hiroyuki Fujii , Koichi Majima , Kishiko Miyagi , Seiki Nagakawa and Takayuki Shouji . Its story was darker and more somber than that of its predecessor .   The majority of material created for previous games , such as the BLiTZ system and the design of maps , was carried over . Alongside this , improvements were made to the game 's graphics and some elements were expanded , such as map layouts , mission structure , and the number of playable units per mission . A part of this upgrade involved creating unique polygon models for each character 's body . In order to achieve this , the cooperative elements incorporated into the second game were removed , as they took up a large portion of memory space needed for the improvements . They also adjusted the difficulty settings and ease of play so they could appeal to new players while retaining the essential components of the series ' gameplay . The newer systems were decided upon early in development . The character designs were done by Raita Honjou , who had worked on the previous Valkyria Chronicles games . When creating the Nameless Squad , Honjou was faced with the same problem he had had during the first game : the military uniforms essentially destroyed character individuality , despite him needing to create unique characters the player could identify while maintaining a sense of reality within the Valkyria Chronicles world . The main color of the Nameless was black . As with the previous Valkyria games , Valkyria Chronicles III used the CANVAS graphics engine . The anime opening was produced by Production I.G.

A:  Valkyria Chronicles Rationale:  It is clear from the passage that the answer is Valkyaria Chronicles, as it appears most frequently in the passage.

However, I've been to two places that called themselves an izakaya where the bartender is not on the opposite side of the bar. In one of them, the bar faced a wall, while in the other, the bar formed an oblong shape. One of them seemed to be part of a chain of izakayas, which made me think it was an inauthentic rip-off of an izakaya, a place that was more izakaya-themed than a genuine izakaya. The other was in a touristy area of the touristy town of Takayama, which also made me suspicious that it was an inauthentic rip-off targeting people who wouldn't know what a real izakaya is like. Are such places regarded as real izakayas?

Now that everyone's grown up a bit, I'm trying to book some flights to Europe. Booking flights has changed a lot since I last did it: there are a lot more options available. And now I'm booking four seats instead of one, I really need to keep the prices down so I'm looking at budget flights. I was very surprised to find that the cheapest British Airways tickets seem to allow no hold luggage at all - just two small cabin bags. So surprised that I couldn't quite believe it was true. But that does indeed seem to be the case. So I went back to budget airlines and found a good price going out on EasyJet and back on BMI. I presumed these would have hold luggage in the price but, scanning the terms and conditions for these airlines, I'm now to so sure. The question then is: do budget tickets now commonly exclude any hold luggage at all?

But it has been non-functional since then.  Former use: put in an entire country for origin, box populates with all the airports in the country. Same for destination. Put in earliest date, latest date (any two). Click “search” and wait five minutes or more and see a table of five hundred flights with accurate fares. Pick one and book it. NOW, it says NOBODY flies from USA to Taiwan or Europe or Korea, and only Southwest flies within North America. Skyscanner, for comparison, makes you pick one origin and destination before estimating prices, and then a specific date to find the real price. Anyone familiar with Azuon and aware of something similar? Yes, Skyscanner is similar, but not close in value, primarily because it makes you select a single origin and destination before it shows prices, and those prices are always very inaccurate estimates. azair.com is closer, but it doesn't know some airports exist, its user-interface is clumsy, and it often complains that some problem prevented it returning results.

The process of separating audio is also known as source separation or blind source separation. One approach to separating audio is Independent Component Analysis (ICA), which is a computational technique used to separate a multivariate signal into independent, non-Gaussian components. Here is an example code using the FastICA algorithm from the scikit-learn library to separate audio of two speakers: \`\`\`python import numpy as np import soundfile as sf from sklearn.decomposition import FastICA # Load the audio file with two speakers audio, sample_rate = sf.read('audio_file.wav') # Apply FastICA to separate the audio into two components ica = FastICA(n_components=2) components = ica.fit_transform(audio) # Save the two separated audio signals to two separate files sf.write('speaker1.wav', components[:, 0], sample_rate) sf.write('speaker2.wav', components[:, 1], sample_rate) \`\`\` This code uses the \`soundfile\` library to read the audio file and the \`FastICA\` class from scikit-learn to perform the separation. The resulting audio signals are then saved to two separate files. Note that the quality of the separation will depend on the quality of the input audio, the complexity of the audio signal, and the parameters used for the separation algorithm. It may be necessary to experiment with different parameters or try different algorithms to achieve the desired separation quality."},{"instruction":"Given a user query about accommodations in London, suggest a relevant title that includes the top-rated luxury hotels with spa facilities and a Michelin-starred restaurant.

The disease was first identified in 2019 in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to over 210 countries and territories, infecting over 500 million people and killing over 6 million. The virus is spread through respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs. The virus can also be spread through contact with contaminated surfaces or objects. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Some people may also experience fatigue, muscle aches, headache, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea. Symptoms usually appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus, but most people develop them within 5 days. There is no specific treatment for COVID-19. Treatment is supportive and includes measures such as rest, fluids, and medications to relieve symptoms. In severe cases, patients may need to be hospitalized and receive oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation. There are several vaccines available to prevent COVID-19. These vaccines are safe and effective, and they have been shown to reduce the risk of severe illness, hospitalization, and death. The best way to prevent COVID-19 is to get vaccinated, wear a mask, practice social distancing, and wash your hands frequently. You should also avoid crowds and close contact with people who are sick.

We keep track of the distance from a to each vertex, and only consider vertices that are within a distance of K from a. If we find b within the allowed distance, we return true. If we visit all vertices within the allowed distance and still haven't found b, we return false. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(E+V), where E is the number of edges in the graph and V is the number of vertices. This is because we visit each edge once, and each vertex once, and we don't revisit any edge or vertex. The space complexity is O(V), because we need to keep track of the vertices that have been visited. Note that this algorithm assumes that the graph does not contain negative weight edges.

First, let's express the vector x in terms of the basis B: x = 1(1) + 0(1-x) + 0(x-x^3) + 0(x^2+2) = 1 Next, let's express the vector 1 in terms of the basis B: 1 = 0(1) + 1(1-x) + 0(x-x^3) + 0(x^2+2) = 1-x Similarly, we can express the other vectors in B' in terms of the basis B: x+x^2 = (x+x^2)(1) + (x+x^2)(1-x) + (x+x^2)(x-x^3) + (x+x^2)(x^2+2) = x + x^2 - x^3 + x^3 + 2x + 2x^2 = 3x + 3x^2 x^3 = (x^3)(1) + (x^3)(1-x) + (x^3)(x-x^3) + (x^3)(x^2+2) = x^3 - x^4 + x^4 + 2x^3 = 3x^3 - x^4 Now we can construct the change of basis matrix MBB'(id) by writing the coefficients of the vectors in B' as columns: MBB'(id) = [1 1 3 0; 0 -1 3 0; 0 0 -1 1; 0 0 0 0] So, the correct change of basis matrix MBB'(id) is: [1 1 3 0;  0 -1 3 0;  0 0 -1 1;  0 0 0 0] There is no need for a 2 in the matrix because the vector x^2+2 can be expressed as 3x + 3x^2 in terms of the basis B."},{"instruction":"Given below is a list of general types of movie viewer.

Because it turns out we are.\\" Respond to this text as a scholar","output":"Indeed, your observation aligns with many theories in psychology and cognitive science. The phenomenon you're referring to is often called \\"inner speech\\" or \\"self-talk\\". This is a fundamental part of human cognition and consciousness, and it's believed to play a crucial role in self-regulation, problem-solving, and reflection. The idea that we are \\"talking to someone in our head\\" can be linked to the Dialogical Self Theory, proposed by Hubert Hermans. This theory suggests that our mind is populated by a multitude of voices, each representing different aspects of our identity. These voices engage in a dialogue, helping us to process information and make decisions.

Can you provide step-by-step instructions for the process?","output":"To identify the smallest value in List 1 that has no divisors present in List 2 using shell command, you can follow these steps: 1. First, you need to create a function to check if a number has any divisors in List 2. You can do this by using a loop to check if the number is divisible by any element in List 2. If it is divisible by any element, then it has a divisor. If it is not divisible by any element, then it has no divisors. Here is the function: \`\`\` has_divisors() {   for ((i=2; i<=sqrt(1); i++)); do     if (((1 % i) == 0)); then       return true     fi   done   return false } \`\`\` 2. Next, you need to use a loop to iterate through each element in List 1 and check if it has no divisors present in List 2. If it has no divisors, then you print its value. Here is the loop: \`\`\` for num in (echo -n \\"5 12 3 7 15 \\" | tr ' ' 'n'); do   if ! has_divisors \\"num\\"; then     echo \\"num\\"   fi done \`\`\` 3. Finally, you need to run the loop. Here is the command to run the loop: \`\`\` bash script.sh \`\`\` Make sure to save the loop as a shell script file named \`script.sh\` and place it in the same directory as the shell command. When you run the command, it will output the smallest value in List 1 that has no divisors present in List 2, which is 3."},{"instruction":"Given me a point free program that has type \`b -> (b -> a) -> a\` using only \`axiom\` and \`axiom2\`","output":"Sure!

Here's a step-by-step guide: 1. **Spring Initializr**: This is a tool provided by Spring to quickly bootstrap a Spring Boot application. You can access it at https://start.spring.io/. Select the necessary options for your project, including the programming language (Java, Kotlin, or Groovy), the build system (Maven or Gradle), and the Spring Boot version. For dependencies, make sure to include 'Spring Web', 'Spring Data JPA', and 'Oracle Driver'. 2. **JHipster or Spring Roo**: These are code generation tools that can generate a lot of boilerplate code for you, including entities, repositories, services, and REST controllers based on your database schema.    - **JHipster**: You can use JHipster's JDL (JHipster Domain Language) to define your entities based on your database schema, and then use the \`jhipster import-jdl\` command to generate the code. JHipster also provides options to generate the frontend code for you.    - **Spring Roo**: Spring Roo is another code generation tool provided by Spring. It also allows you to generate entities, repositories, services, and REST controllers based on your database schema. However, it's less popular and less maintained compared to JHipster. 3. **Configure your DataSource**: In your \`application.properties\` or \`application.yml\` file, configure your DataSource to connect to your Oracle database. Here's an example:    \`\`\`    spring.datasource.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:xe    spring.datasource.username=your-username    spring.datasource.password=your-password    spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none    \`\`\`    The \`spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=none\` property is important because it tells Hibernate not to create or modify any tables in your database, since you already have an existing schema. 4. **Run your application**: You can now run your Spring Boot application. The generated REST APIs should be able to perform CRUD operations on your Oracle database. Remember, these tools generate a lot of code for you, but you might still need to modify some parts of the code to fit your specific needs."},{"instruction":"Given photosynthesis, what are the prospects of modifying a plant to power a jet engine using co2, water and sunlight?","output":"The idea of using photosynthesis to power a jet engine is an interesting concept, but it's quite complex and currently beyond our scientific capabilities.  Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the organism's activities. This process involves taking in carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), and converting them into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen (O2) in the presence of sunlight. The energy produced by photosynthesis is not directly comparable to the type of energy produced by jet fuel. Jet engines work by combusting fuel (usually a type of kerosene) and using the resulting force to propel the aircraft forward. The energy stored in glucose molecules produced by photosynthesis is not nearly as dense or as easily released as the energy in jet fuel. Moreover, the process of photosynthesis is not very efficient. A large amount of sunlight is required to produce a relatively small amount of glucose. To power a jet engine, an enormous amount of plant matter would be required, which is not practical or sustainable. However, there are ongoing research efforts to create biofuels from plants. These biofuels are created by processing plant matter in a way that extracts the energy-rich components and converts them into a form that can be used in an engine. While this is a promising field, it's still a long way from being able to power a jet engine solely with CO2, water, and sunlight. In conclusion, while the idea is fascinating, the prospects of modifying a plant to power a jet engine using CO2, water, and sunlight are currently not feasible with our existing knowledge and technology."},{"instruction":"Given queries, to extract the following metadata: - keywords: string Respond with a JSON containing the extracted metadata in key value pairs. queries:{母乳喂养}","output":"{ \\"keywords\\": [\\"母乳喂养\\"] }"},{"instruction":"Given reviews from Amazon, classify those review based on their content into two classes: Negative or Positive.

Both times before I broke the bank by purchasing the cord from apple. Big mistake. Although steep in price those things are C-H-E-A-P! This last time i decided to go with the Macally. What a great deal! Much more durable than then apple version. It is also more compact. The only thing missing is the indicator light to let you know if the battery is charging. Not a big deal for such a great price! Answer: Positive  Question: Purchased from We Sell Bulk here on Amazon and received the item much faster than predicted delivery date - I only say that because there's always a list and it's often difficult to pick which seller is the one to go with. Anyhow, the battery came in original and undamaged Canon packaging (looks just like the images available in product description). I was not about to buy the cheap knockoffs and was worried that the one I ordered would be any different than the one that came with the camera (damaged item or store return). Well, after a couple charges and hundreds of pictures, I can say that this battery is exactly the same as our original. It lasts just as long and charges in the same amount of time.

Here's an example Python program that demonstrates how to analyze and print the yogas: \`\`\`python from pyastrolib import * def analyze_kundli(ascendant, planets):     # Create a Kundli object     kundli = Kundli(ascendant)     # Add planets to the Kundli     for planet, sign in planets.items():         kundli.add_planet(planet, sign)     # Analyze the Kundli and get the yogas     yogas = kundli.get_yogas()     # Print the yogas and their implications     for yoga, implication in yogas.items():         print(f\\"{yoga}: {implication}\\") # Example usage ascendant = \\"Leo\\" planets = {     \\"Sun\\": \\"Leo\\",     \\"Moon\\": \\"Cancer\\",     \\"Mars\\": \\"Aries\\",     \\"Mercury\\": \\"Virgo\\",     \\"Jupiter\\": \\"Sagittarius\\",     \\"Venus\\": \\"Libra\\",     \\"Saturn\\": \\"Capricorn\\",     \\"Rahu\\": \\"Gemini\\",     \\"Ketu\\": \\"Sagittarius\\" } analyze_kundli(ascendant, planets) \`\`\` In this example, we create a Kundli object with the ascendant sign and add the planets with their respective signs. Then, we use the \`get_yogas()\` method to get the yogas present in the Kundli. Finally, we print out the yogas and their implications. Please note that you need to have the \\"PyAstroLib\\" library installed in order to run this program. You can install it using the following command: \`\`\` pip install pyastrolib \`\`\` I hope this helps!

Политическая стратегия Советского Союза в этот период характеризовалась попытками балансировать между сотрудничеством с западными странами и стремлением укрепить свои позиции в мире как государства, пропагандирующего коммунистическую идеологию. Рассмотрим ключевые моменты внешней политики СССР 1930-х годов: 1. **Борьба с \\"фашистской угрозой\\" и поиск союзников.** С ростом мощи нацистской Германии и усилением гитлеровской агрессии СССР начал искать способы противостоять возможной угрозе. Это привело к ряду дипломатических маневров и попыткам наладить взаимодействие с европейскими державами, в особенности с Великобританией и Францией, чтобы создать антигитлеровскую коалицию. 2. **Подписание пакта Молотова-Риббентропа.** Одним из самых спорных и значительных событий внешней политики СССР в преддверии Второй мировой войны стало подписание пакта о ненападении с Германией в августе 1939 года. Данный документ, также включающий секретное дополнение о разделе влияния в Восточной Европе, был шоком для международного сообщества и показал готовность Страна Советов идти на компромисс с нацистским режимом в погоне за собственной безопасностью. 3. **Коминтерн и распространение коммунизма.** В 1930-е годы СССР активно использовал Коминтерн (Третий интернационал) как инструмент влияния на коммунистические и рабочие движения по всему миру, стремясь распространить свою идеологию и поддержать союзники режимы. 4. **Испанская гражданская война (1936-1939).** СССР оказал значительную поддержку республиканским силам в Испании, противостоящим националистам под руководством Франко. Это вмешательство было частью более широкой стратегии поддержки антифашистских движений, хотя также вызвало напряженность с западными державами, обеспокоенными растущим влиянием СССР. 5. **Участие СССР в международных организациях.** Советский Союз стремился активнее участвовать в международных организациях, таких как Лига Наций (СССР присоединился в 1934 году), чтобы продвигать свои интересы на международной арене и противостоять изоляции. В целом, внешняя политика СССР в 1930-е годы была динамичной и полной противоречий. Стремление сохранить страну от угрозы фашизма, идейное противостояние капиталистическому миру и необходимость геополитического маневрирования определяли многие из действий Советского Союза на международной арене перед лицом надвигавшейся глобальной войны."},{"instruction":"Нужен только итог","output":"Итог внешней политики СССР в 1930-е годы ознаменовался рядом ключевых развитий, включая: - Попытки балансировать между сотрудничеством с Западом и поддержкой глобального коммунистического движения. - Подписание пакта Молотова-Риббентропа с нацистской Германией, что сильно повлияло на международные отношения и стратегию СССР непосредственно перед Второй мировой войной. - Активное вмешательство и поддержка антифашистских движений, особенно в Испании, и стремление противостоять фашистской угрозе в Европе. - Участие в международных организациях, таких как Лига Наций, для продвижения своих интересов и снижения международной изоляции. Эти действия обеспечили СССР определенные стратегические выгоды, но также и навлекли критику за сделку с Гитлером и за определенные геополитические маневры, которые имели долгосрочные последствия для международных отношений и внешней политики страны в годы Второй мировой войны и после неё."},{"instruction":"что такое демпинг, кратко очень","output":"Демпинг — это практика продажи товаров или услуг по ценам ниже их себестоимости или рыночной стоимости с целью вытеснения конкурентов с рынка или захвата рыночной доли."},{"instruction":"Можешь итоги ещё раз сократить?","output":"Внешняя политика СССР в 1930-е годы характеризовалась усилиями противостоять фашизму, подписанием пакта Молотова-Риббентропа, поддержкой антифашистских движений и активным участием в международных организациях, что привело к значительным геополитическим изменениям перед Второй мировой войной."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Этот меню предлагает общие рекомендации. Перед изменением диеты или добавлением новых продуктов в свой рацион обязательно проконсультируйтесь с врачом или диетологом."},{"instruction":"Сколько будет стоить такой рацион в России в рублях","output":"Оценка стоимости продуктов для рациона при подагре в России может варьироваться в зависимости от региона, сезонности, точки продажи (супермаркет, рынок, дискаунтер) и качества продуктов (например, органические продукты обычно дороже). Для упрощения, рассмотрим среднюю стоимость основных компонентов меню за неделю в среднеразмерном городе России. При этом, стоимость более дорогих продуктов, таких как индейка и нежирная рыба, будет учтена повышенно. Обратите внимание, что цены актуальны на момент написания данного ответа и могут изменяться со временем. # Примерный список продуктов на неделю для одного человека: - Куриная грудка – 500 гр - Индейка (филе) – 500 гр - Нежирная рыба (например, карп) – 500 гр - Говядина (для запекания) – 300 гр - Овощи (брокколи, морковь, помидоры, огурцы, кабачки, баклажаны, перец) – около 5 кг - Фрукты (яблоки, бананы, ягоды) – около 3 кг - Яйца – 10 шт. - Цельнозерновой хлеб – 1 буханка - Каши (овсяная, гречневая, из коричневого риса) – около 1 кг - Чечевица – 500 гр - Творог – 1 кг - Натуральный йогурт – 1 л - Сыр фета – 200 гр - Оливковое масло, специи, зелень – по потребности # Примерная оценка стоимости: - Мясо и рыба: 1500-2000 руб. - Овощи: 500-700 руб. - Фрукты: 300-400 руб. - Молочные продукты и яйца: 400-500 руб. - Каши и хлеб: 300-400 руб. - Прочее (масло, специи, зелень): 200-300 руб. **Общая оценка:** примерно 3200-5300 рублей на неделю. Эта оценка дает примерный диапазон стоимости рациона и может отличаться в зависимости от выбранной продукции и места покупки. Чтобы сэкономить, можно искать продукты по акции, покупать сезонные овощи и фрукты, а также заменять некоторые дорогие продукты их более дешевыми аналогами (например, заменять филе индейки на куриное филе)."},{"instruction":"Составь рацион для набора мышечной массы при условии трёх силовых тренировок в неделю","output":"Для набора мышечной массы важно обеспечить достаточное количество калорий и баланс белков, жиров и углеводов, при этом особое внимание уделяется употреблению белка, который необходим для восстановления и роста мышц. Рассмотрим примерный дневной рацион, подходящий для человека, занимающегося силовыми тренировками 3 раза в неделю. Такой рацион должен включать обильное количество калорий и белка, необходимых для поддержки интенсивных тренировок и восстановления после них. # Примерный дневной рацион: **Завтрак:** - Овсянка на воде или молоке с добавлением орехов, меда и свежих фруктов (банан, ягоды) – источник сложных углеводов и белка. - Протеиновый шейк или натуральный йогурт – дополнительный белок. **Второй завтрак (перекус):** - Творожная запеканка или сэндвич с куриным филе на цельнозерновом хлебе – источник белка и медленных углеводов. **Обед:** - Куринная или индейская грудка, запеченная с овощами (брокколи, стручковая фасоль, морковь) – источник белка и витаминов. - Коричневый рис или киноа – сложные углеводы для энергии. **Полдник (перекус):** - Смузи из авокадо, шпината, протеина и орехового молока – белки, здоровые жиры и витамины. - Горсть орехов – полезные жиры. **Ужин:** - Стейк из лосося или филе морского басса, приготовленное на пару – высококачественные белки и жиры омега-3. - Зеленый салат с оливковым маслом – клетчатка и здоровые жиры. **Второй ужин (если необходимо):** - Кейсиновый протеиновый шейк или стакан кефира – медленно усваиваемый белок на ночь. # Общие рекомендации: - Постарайтесь пить достаточное количество воды в течение дня, особенно перед и после тренировки, чтобы поддерживать гидратацию. - В дни тренировок, желательно употреблять дополнительный прием углеводов за 30-60 минут до занятий и белок с углеводами в течение 30 минут после тренировки для оптимального восстановления. - Стремитесь к разнообразию в выборе продуктов, чтобы обеспечить получение всех необходимых микронутриентов. Относительно количества калорий и макронутриентов (белков, жиров, углеводов) - это сильно зависит от вашего веса, возраста, пола и уровня активности. Обычно рекомендуется потреблять на 200-500 ккал больше, чем ваша суточная норма для поддержания веса, с белком на уровне 1,6-2,2 г на кг веса тела для набора массы, но лучше всего проконсультироваться со специалистом для составления индивидуального плана питания."},{"instruction":"Как снять боль в ногах при подагре","output":"Подагра — это форма артрита, вызванная накоплением уратов (солей мочевой кислоты) в суставах, что приводит к воспалению, отеку и болевым ощущениям, часто затрагивая большой палец ноги, но может поражать и другие части тела. При остром приступе подагры важно быстро снять воспаление и боль. Вот несколько способов, как это можно сделать: # 1. Принять лекарства от воспаления - **Не стероидные противовоспалительные препараты (НСПВС)**, такие как ибупрофен или напроксен, помогают снять воспаление и боль. Однако их следует применять с осторожностью, если есть проблемы с желудочно-кишечным трактом или почками. - **Колхицин** часто назначается при подагре для уменьшения воспаления. - **Кортикостероиды**, такие как преднизолон, могут быть назначены в ситуациях, когда другие препараты противопоказаны или неэффективны. # 2. Использование холода Приложение льда к пораженному суставу в течение 20-30 минут несколько раз в день может помочь снизить воспаление и облегчить боль. Важно не прикладывать лед непосредственно к коже — используйте полотенце или мягкую ткань. # 3. Отдых и избегание нагрузок Постарайтесь дать пораженной ноге отдохнуть, поддерживая ее в приподнятом положении на подушке, чтобы уменьшить отек. # 4. Гидратация Питье большого количества воды может помочь уменьшить концентрацию мочевой кислоты в крови. # 5. Изменения в диете Следует ограничить потребление продуктов, богатых пуринами, которые могут повышать уровень мочевой кислоты в крови, таких как красное мясо, некоторые виды рыбы, морепродукты и алкоголь, особенно пиво. # 6. Увеличение потребления продуктов, снижающих мочевую кислоту Включение в рацион ягод, вишни, овощей и продуктов, богатых витамином С, может помочь контролировать уровень мочевой кислоты. # 7. Контроль веса Снижение лишнего веса может помочь снизить нагрузку на суставы и уменьшить частоту приступов подагры. # Консультация со специалистом При острых приступах подагры важно обратиться к врачу, который может назначить подходящее лечение в зависимости от вашего состояния здоровья и истории болезни. Self-медикация может быть не только неэффективной, но и опасной."},{"instruction":"Основные нефтепроводы россии","output":"Россия обладает одной из крупнейших в мире сетей нефтепроводов, которая обеспечивает транспортировку нефти и нефтепродуктов к местам переработки и к портам для экспорта.

Here's a modified approach using UTF-8 encoding, where each character (code point) is handled correctly as a single entity, regardless of its byte length in the UTF-8 encoding. We'll use the \`utf8\` library introduced in Lua 5.3 to iterate over Unicode characters. If you're using an older version of Lua that doesn't have the \`utf8\` library, you'll need an external library to handle UTF-8 strings or write your own functions to parse UTF-8 characters from strings. \`\`\`lua -- Ensure utf8 compatibility for Lua versions before 5.3 if not utf8 then require('compat53') end function utf8.codepointsum(str) local sum = 0 for p, c in utf8.codes(str) do sum = sum + c end return sum end function vigenereEncrypt(plaintext, key) local result = {} local keySum = utf8.codepointsum(key) for i, p in utf8.codes(plaintext) do -- Use the sum of key code points to shift plaintext characters local c = (p + keySum) % 0x110000 -- wrapping around Unicode range table.insert(result, utf8.char(c)) end return table.concat(result) end function vigenereDecrypt(ciphertext, key) local result = {} local keySum = utf8.codepointsum(key) for i, c in utf8.codes(ciphertext) do -- Reverse the shift using the sum of key code points local p = (c - keySum + 0x110000) % 0x110000 -- ensure positive before mod table.insert(result, utf8.char(p)) end return table.concat(result) end -- Example usage local key = \\"КЛЮЧ\\" -- Cyrillic key for demonstration local originalText = \\"Привет Мир!\\" -- \\"Hello World\\" in Russian local encrypted = vigenereEncrypt(originalText, key) local decrypted = vigenereDecrypt(encrypted, key) print(\\"Original:\\", originalText) print(\\"Encrypted:\\", encrypted) print(\\"Decrypted:\\", decrypted) \`\`\` This code uses the \`utf8.codepointsum\` function (not a standard Lua function, defined here for convenience) to calculate the sum of the UTF-8 code points of the key. The encryption and decryption functions work by shifting the Unicode code points of the plaintext and the ciphertext characters by this sum, respectively. The modulo \`0x110000\` is used because it is the total number of Unicode code points. Keep in mind, this approach alters the basic nature of the Vigenère cipher by using the sum of the key's code points, rather than a per-character shift. It aims to demonstrate a simple method for adapting the process to support Unicode characters in Lua, focusing on maintaining the concept of shifting characters based on key values. This example also assumes you have Lua 5.3 or later for native UTF-8 support, or you are using a compatibility layer like \`compat53\` for earlier versions."},{"instruction":"Please slightly increase strength of this encryption algorithm on lua: function encrypt(key, text) local enc = \\"\\" local keyIndex = 1 local keyLength = string.len(key) for i = 1, #text do local c = string.byte(text:sub(i, i)) local k = string.byte(key:sub(keyIndex, keyIndex)) enc = enc .. string.char((c + k) % 256) keyIndex = keyIndex % keyLength + 1 end return enc end function decrypt(key, enc) local dec = \\"\\" local keyIndex = 1 local keyLength = string.len(key) for i = 1, #enc do local c = string.byte(enc:sub(i, i)) local k = string.byte(key:sub(keyIndex, keyIndex)) dec = dec .. string.char((c - k) % 256) keyIndex = keyIndex % keyLength + 1 end return dec end","output":"To slightly increase the strength of the provided encryption algorithm on Lua, we can introduce a more complex key transformation mechanism before applying it to the text. A simple way to do this without complicating the implementation too much is to use a variable shift method based on the position of the character in the text. Another approach could involve altering the key bytes in relation to their position to ensure the pattern is less predictable. Let's implement both ideas: 1. **Variable Position Shift**: Modulate the added (encryption) or subtracted (decryption) value based on the character's position. This means each character will not only be affected by the key but also by its position, distributing the encryption variance more evenly. 2. **Key Transformation**: Modify the key byte with a simple operation before using it for encryption or decryption, making static analysis harder if the key or parts of the encrypted text are known. Here's how you can implement these enhancements: \`\`\`lua function enhancedEncrypt(key, text) local enc = \\"\\" local keyIndex = 1 local keyLength = string.len(key) for i = 1, #text do local c = string.byte(text:sub(i, i)) local k = string.byte(key:sub(keyIndex, keyIndex)) -- Simple key transformation & variable shift based on character position local modifiedKey = ((k + i) % 256) enc = enc .. string.char((c + modifiedKey) % 256) keyIndex = keyIndex % keyLength + 1 end return enc end function enhancedDecrypt(key, enc) local dec = \\"\\" local keyIndex = 1 local keyLength = string.len(key) for i = 1, #enc do local c = string.byte(enc:sub(i, i)) local k = string.byte(key:sub(keyIndex, keyIndex)) -- Reversing the simple key transformation & variable shift local modifiedKey = ((k + i) % 256) dec = dec .. string.char((256 + c - modifiedKey) % 256) -- Ensure positive before modulo keyIndex = keyIndex % keyLength + 1 end return dec end -- Example usage: local key = \\"mysecretkey\\" local originalText = \\"This is a secret message.\\" local encrypted = enhancedEncrypt(key, originalText) local decrypted = enhancedDecrypt(key, encrypted) print(\\"Original:\\", originalText) print(\\"Encrypted:\\", encrypted) print(\\"Decrypted:\\", decrypted) \`\`\` This variation ensures that: - Each character in the plaintext is encrypted not only with a corresponding character from the key but also in a way that the position of the character affects the result. - By modifying the key character (\`k\`) with a simple operation based on \`i\`, the position in the text provides an additional layer of variance. Remember, while these enhancements may increase complexity slightly, the Vigenère cipher (and its variants) are considered insecure by modern cryptographic standards due to vulnerabilities such as frequency analysis.

This could involve not just summing the byte values, but also integrating other operations such as bitwise operations (e.g., XOR) and varying the way individual characters influence the final sum to disrupt simple patterns and make reverse-engineering or predicting checksums more difficult. Here's an enhanced version of the simple checksum algorithm incorporating these principles: \`\`\`lua function enhancedChecksum(inputString) local sum1 = 0 local sum2 = 0 for i = 1, #inputString do local byteValue = string.byte(inputString:sub(i, i)) -- Update the sums with a combination of addition and bitwise XOR -- This introduces non-linearity and dependency on character order sum1 = (sum1 + byteValue) % 65536 sum2 = ((sum2 + sum1) % 65535) -- Use a slightly different prime modulus for sum2 -- Introducing bitwise left shift and XOR to mix bits further sum1 = bit32.lrotate(sum1, byteValue % 32) -- Rotate sum1 left by a number of bits based on the current byteValue sum2 = bit32.bxor(sum2, sum1) -- XOR sum2 with the modified sum1 for further mixing end -- Combine the two sums for the final checksum computation, ensuring the result fits in 4 hex digits local finalSum = (sum1 + sum2) % 65536 local checksum = string.format(\\"%04x\\", finalSum):upper() return checksum end \`\`\` **Highlights of this version:** 1. **Two-Sum Approach:** We maintain two sums (\`sum1\` and \`sum2\`) that accumulate values differently. This introduces another layer of accumulation and makes the checksum more sensitive to input changes. 2. **Bitwise Operations:** Including bitwise XOR (\`bit32.bxor\`) and rotate (\`bit32.lrotate\`) introduces non-linearity, making it harder to predict output from input or mimic checksums without the exact original input. 3. **Modular Arithmetic Variance:** Using slightly different moduli for the two sums (65536 for \`sum1\` and a prime number, here 65535, for \`sum2\`) further differentiates the accumulation process. **Note:** \`bit32\` library functions (\`bit32.bxor\` and \`bit32.lrotate\`) are available in Lua 5.2 and later. If you're using Lua 5.1 or earlier, equivalent functionality might need to be achieved through an external library or manual implementation of bitwise operations. This enhanced checksum function offers improved security features compared to the simple summing method, but it is essential to understand that for cryptographic security, established hash functions (e.g., SHA-256) should be preferred. The presented method could serve educational purposes or scenarios where cryptographic security is not paramount but where a simple, somewhat more collision-resistant checksum is desirable."},{"instruction":"Create a photo-realistic image depicting a woman standing on a vivid red boat in the midst of the expansive ocean.

It began in the United States but quickly turned into a worldwide economic crisis. The decade was marked by widespread unemployment, acute deflation, and a drastic fall in both industrial and agricultural prices. The causes of the Great Depression include the over-speculation of the stock market, banking system failures, reduced consumer spending, and declining international trade. Moreover, the lack of financial regulation and inadequate monetary policies exacerbated the crisis. The impact of the Great Depression was devastating, with millions of people losing their jobs, homes, and life savings. At its height, unemployment in the U.S. rose to about 25%, and in some countries, the rate was even higher. Governments around the world responded with various policies. In the United States, President Franklin D. Roosevelt introduced the New Deal, a series of programs, public work projects, financial reforms, and regulations, to provide relief, recovery, and reform from the Great Depression. The Great Depression fundamentally changed the relationship between governments and their citizens, leading to increased government intervention in the economy and the creation of social safety nets. It influenced economic thought, leading to the rise of Keynesian economics. Moreover, the global nature of the crisis spurred the move towards greater international cooperation, ultimately leading to the establishment of institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank after World War II.

Принципы исследования суставов и костно-мышечной системы.","output":"1. **Общий осмотр пациента: оценка состояния, сознания, положения пациента.** При общем осмотре пациента важно оценить его общее состояние, включая уровень сознания и способность к контакту. Уровень сознания может варьироваться от полного сознания до сомнолентности, сопора или комы. Обращается внимание на положение пациента в постели (активное, пассивное), на лицевую мимику, наличие болевых признаков, двигательную активность и естественность позы. Это первичные показатели, которые дают информацию о тяжести состояния пациента и его способности реагировать на внешние раздражители. 2. **Общий осмотр пациента: оценка телосложения и антропометрия. Индекс массы тела (ИМТ) и классификация массы тела. Окружность талии, норма для мужчин и женщин.** Оценка антропометрических параметров включает измерение роста, веса, а также окружности талии. Индекс массы тела рассчитывается как вес в килограммах, деленный на рост в метрах, возведенный в квадрат ((ИМТ = frac{text{вес (кг)}}{text{рост (м)}^2})). По классификации Всемирной организации здравоохранения, ИМТ ниже 18.5 считается показателем недостаточной массы тела, между 18.5 и 24.9 - нормальной массой тела, между 25 и 29.9 - избыточной массой тела, и 30 и выше указывает на ожирение. Окружность талии более 88 см у женщин и более 102 см у мужчин свидетельствует о повышенном риске развития метаболических нарушений. 3. **Термометрия. Типы температурных кривых, виды лихорадок, клинические примеры.** Измерение температуры тела является важным элементом общего осмотра. Температурные кривые могут быть различными: постоянная лихорадка, при которой колебания температуры не превышают 1 °C в течение суток; периодическая лихорадка с резкими колебаниями; и волнообразная, при которой изменения температуры происходят с периодическими возвышениями и падениями. Клинические примеры включают инфекционные заболевания, аутоиммунные процессы, онкологические заболевания и другие состояния. 4. **Исследование кожных покровов, слизистых, подкожно-жировой клетчатки. Пальпация лимфатических узлов.** Осмотр кожи позволяет оценить ее цвет, увлажненность, наличие высыпаний, язв, пигментации или цианоза. Особое внимание уделяется тургору кожи, чем оценивается уровень гидратации. Также важен осмотр слизистых оболочек и состояние подкожно-жировой клетчатки. Пальпация лимфатических узлов необходима для выявления их увеличения, болезненности, консистенции, что может быть признаком инфекционного или онкологического процесса. 5. **Исследование отдельных частей тела: голова, лицо, шея (осмотр и пальпация щитовидной железы), верхние конечности, нижние конечности. Принципы исследования суставов и костно-мышечной системы.** Осмотр начинается с головы, включая оценку формы черепа, наличие шрамов, изменений на коже головы; следует осмотр и пальпация шеи, включая щитовидную железу на предмет увеличения и наличия узлов. В ходе осмотра верхних и нижних конечностей оцениваются суставы на предмет отеков, покраснений, деформаций и болезненности. Проводится функциональное тестирование костно-мышечной системы, включая оценку амплитуды движений в суставах, силы мышц и их тонуса."},{"instruction":"List down amazing fintech startups and their web Platforms dont include most famous ones","output":"Focusing on less commonly cited yet impactful fintech startups and their innovative platforms, the following list highlights some that are making significant contributions to the financial technology landscape.

Consistent, focused study sessions are more effective than last-minute cramming. Use ASVAB study guides and online resources to cover all areas of the test. 4. **Practice with ASVAB Practice Tests**: Taking practice tests can help you become familiar with the format of the ASVAB and the types of questions asked. It can also help improve your timing, as you’ll get a feel for how long to spend on each question. Analyze your practice test results to identify areas for improvement. 5. **Improve Your Test-Taking Strategies**: Learn strategies, such as eliminating obviously wrong answers, making educated guesses when necessary, and managing your time effectively during the test. 6. **Brush Up on Basic Math and English Skills**: Since the ASVAB includes sections on mathematics and English, it's essential to have a good grasp of basic math concepts (e.g., fractions, percentages, and algebra) and English skills (e.g., vocabulary, comprehension, and grammar). 7. **Get a Good Night's Sleep and Eat a Healthy Breakfast**: Being well-rested and well-nourished can significantly impact your ability to focus and perform well on the test. 8. **Stay Calm and Confident**: Test anxiety can negatively affect your performance. Practice relaxation techniques and keep a positive attitude. 9. **Use High-Quality Study Materials**: Choose reputable study guides and online resources.

Per tant, l’Escola assumeix els objectius, els valors i les metodologies que regulen l’educació al nostre país, malgrat podrà emprar les eines d’autonomia que consideri necessàries per millorar la qualitat de l’educació i adaptar-la a les necessitats de l’alumnat. Actualment el marc de referència ve donat pels objectius de la Unió Europea i les legislacions, prioritats i polítiques educatives de l’Estat espanyol, la Generalitat de Catalunya, el Consorci d’Educació de Barcelona i la regidoria d’Educació del districte de Sants-Montjuic. L’objectiu de l’Escola és l’educació d’infants i d’adults, tant en els ensenyaments obligatoris com els postobligatoris i la formació continuada. Per tant, ens organitzem per a què tothom hi pugui trobar el seu espai i així tenir un desenvolupament personal que li permeti aprofitar al màxim les seves capacitats. La situació d’especial debilitat dels infants fa que sempre calgui prendre les mesures i decisions que el protegeixin. L’educació dels infants és una missió que la nostra societat ha encomanat a les famílies i les escoles. Per tant, hi ha un solapament entre l’àmbit personal i el públic que pot dur a algun conflicte. Malgrat tot, hi ha un mínim comú denominador que tothom ha de complir per tal que la convivència a l’escola sigui possible: les famílies han d’assumir que l’escola educa molts més infants que els seus fills i filles i l’escola ha d’entendre que hi pot haver diferents models de família amb escales de valors pròpies. L’escola no ha de ser un reflex de la societat malgrat que ha de preparar l’alumnat per desenvolupar-se en ella. Els valors que defensi l’escola han de reflectir el model de societat que seria desitjable però també ha de formar l’alumnat, especialment en els ensenyaments obligatoris, per a què siguin prou competents en tots els àmbits de la vida. L’Escola treballa especialment els valors de justícia, respecte, honestedat i solidaritat. L’Escola empra eines per avaluar el seu funcionament i així poder aplicar millores en els diferents processos. Els resultats d’aquesta avaluació han de ser públics. També s’elaboraren plans a curt i mitjà termini per millorar allò que hagi obtingut una valoració deficient, optimitzar resultats i s’innovarà per avançar-se a noves necessitats. La direcció de l’Escola promourà gestions per a què l’administració assumeix la totalitat del cost de l’escolarització i així les famílies puguin gaudir de la gratuïtat de l’ensenyament: mentre aquesta gratuïtat no sigui possible, les famílies i l’alumnat ha d’entendre que les institucions públiques no cobreixen la totalitat del cost de l’educació i que la seva col•laboració econòmica és indispensable. Reconeixem que els processos d’ensenyament-aprenentatge es desenvolupen amb eficàcia quan hi ha una relació afectiva positiva entre alumnes i docents. Per tant, els docents han de tenir una bona relació amb l’alumnat i la comunitat educativa ha de crear les condicions per a què les relacions entre tots els membres que en formen part siguin en un marc de confiança i col•laboració. Els docents tenen autoritat en tant que aquesta ve donada per la seva posició però han de guanyar-se el seu reconeixement a partir de la seva actitud i els seus coneixements tant didàctics com de continguts i de valors. Per tant, hauran d’actuar d’acord amb els valors que guien la vida de l’Escola, també hauran de conèixer la seva matèria i procurar la formació continuada, tant metodològica com en els continguts de la seva especialitat. Els docents han de ser autoritats professionals i morals. L’Escola també ha de tenir les dinàmiques de funcionament adequades per a què l’autoritat del docent i de la institució no pugui ser qüestionada. Per tal de fomentar la igualtat entre tot l’alumnat independentment del seu origen, creences, capacitats, habilitats, aptituds, sexe… L’Escola desenvolupa els processos d’ensenyament-aprenentatge en règim de coeducació i fomenta actituds de respecte i tolerància envers els altres i les seves opinions, sempre que aquestes siguin respectuoses amb els Drets de les persones i dels pobles. Es posa especial atenció en l’atenció a les minories i persones amb dificultats. Tothom té dret a ser alumne o alumna de l’Escola Joan Pelegrí, sempre que respecti el nostre Projecte Educatiu del Centre i les diferents concrecions que se’n deriven (PCC, PAT, protocols…). En el cas dels menors, les famílies també hauran de respectar i compartir el PEC i les NOFC. Les persones amb desavantatges inicials o necessitats educatives especials rebran especial atenció de la comunitat educativa i les institucions han de posar a disposició de l’Escola els recursos materials i didàctics per facilitar la inclusió. A l’escola tenim un model de gestió democràtic on tots els càrrecs de direcció i coordinació pedagògica són elegits per tots els treballadors i treballadores. D’aquesta manera s’afavoreix una proximitat entre la direcció i l’activitat educativa que facilita l’adaptació a les necessitat de l’alumnat, els docents, les famílies i l’entorn. Aquest model pretén enfortir els lligams entre la comunitat educativa i l’escola, fent que tots els docents i personal d’administració la sentin com a seva. Me puedes resumir todo esto en 4 parrafos de 3 lineas cada uno?","output":"L'Escola Joan Pelegrí, depenent de la Fundació Cultural Hostafrancs, és compromesa amb l'educació integral d'infants i adults dins del marc educatiu de Catalunya i Europa, oferint des d'Educació Infantil fins a Formació Professional.

Els professors, com a autoritats professionals i morals, són fonamentals en la transmissió de coneixements i valors, i es promou la seva formació continuada. Es desenvolupa un enfocament inclusiu i coeducatiu, prioritizant el respecte i la tolerància, i s'ofereix atenció especial a les minories i persones amb necessitats especials. L'Escola defensa la igualtat i la diversitat dins del seu entorn educatiu, garantint un tractament equitatiu a tot l'alumnat. L'organització i gestió de l'Escola es basen en un model democràtic, on els càrrecs de direcció són elegits per tot el personal, afavorint la proximitat i adaptabilitat a la comunitat educativa. Aquest sistema busca enfortir els vincles entre tots els membres de l'escola, creant un ambient de pertinença i col·laboració comuna."},{"instruction":"1904 El 25 de març nasqué el Catecisme de Sant Francesc Xavier. El pare Gaietà Puig, jesuïta, Director de la Congregació Mariana de Barcelona, fundà un Centre en una barriada pobra, per anar-hi a ensenyar “doctrina cristiana i els bons costums”. Amb l’ajut uns joves que provenien de la Barcelona benestant, es desplaçaven al barri cada dia de festa. Hi aplegaven més de 100 infants. Era situat, inicialment al xamfrà dels carrers Torre Damians i Ermengarda, just davant on avui hi ha l’escola d’infantil i primària. S’anomenava El Tancat. 1910 El Centre es trasllada a l’actual espai de l’Escola al carrer Ermengarda. Se’n deia Centre Obrer i Instructiu d’Hostafrancs, encara que ben aviat serà conegut pel seu nom de sempre Centre Montserrat Xavier. Les dades d’instrucció del 1900 al barri són prou preocupants. Sobre una població del barri de 15.474 h el 66% era analfabeta. 1913 Inici de l’Escola. Comença l’escola nocturna gratuïta per a joves. 70 alumnes i un mestre. Sis anys, més tard, es crea l’escola diürna. Sorgeixen seccions noves com el Cor d’Obrers. 1919 Es funda l’Ateneu Montserrat, situat en l’actual emplaçament de l’escola de secundària al carrer Torre Damians. Si el Centre s’havia creat per a la formació dels infants, 15 anys enrera, ara calia continuar la tasca formativa amb aquells joves. “Com ningú no ignora, la barriada d’Hostafrancs, en la seva immensa majoria, està formada per elements obrers que per efecte de la necessitat apremiant, que obliga el jovent a guanyar-se la vida des dels seus primers anys al taller o a la fàbrica, viu en un estat molt rudimentari d’instrucció. L’objectiu de l’Acadèmia que ens ocupa no és d’ensenyar analfabets ni tampoc joves menors de 14 anys. L’ideal és un altre: subministrar a l’obrer tota aquella sèrie de coneixements que no es poden buscar a l’escola primària per ésser una altra la seva comesa i que per la qualitat d’aquests, no es pot anar rera d’ells als grans centres d’instrucció, per manca de recursos…” “Juventus”, revista, 1922, pàg. 145 1928 El Bàsquet Ateneu Montserrat (BAM) inicia les seves activitats. Club de bàsquet del barri que se n’enorgulleix de ser un dels històrics del bàsquet català i cinquè club més antic de l’Estat espanyol. 1929 Apareix el butlletí “Vida Nostra” publicació mensual de l’Ateneu. Publicació en català, que es mantingué força anys i que fou un referent pel seu contingut cultural i acurada edició. En aquesta segona dècada les seccions van creixent i en sorgeixen de noves que tindran molta presència a l’Ateneu: la Secció de Teatre i el Grup Excursionista. 1931 Durant la Segona República, el Centre Montserrat Xavier passà a denominar-se “Centre Cultural i Recreatiu Hostafrancs” i les activitats escolars “ESTRE” (estudi i treball). 1933 Es constitueix al Centre una secció d’escoltisme amb el nom de Follets de Sant Jordi. Es vol educar el jovent a partir del contacte amb la natura. Posteriorment s’anomenà Agrupament Escolta Montserrat Xavier. 1936-1939 Durant la Guerra Civil, el Centre fou incautat i a partir de l’any 1937 la Generalitat l’incorpora al C.E.N.U. (Escola Nova Unificada) com a grup escolar número 52, i es va bastir les dues plantes frontals de l’edifici actual. L’any 1938 assistiren a classe 250 alumnes, nens i nenes, d’edats compreses entre tres i catorze anys. L’Ateneu fou ocupat per les joventuts llibertàries. 1940 Acabada la Guerra les activitats del Centre i l’Ateneu es reprengueren immediatament amb les mateixes seccions que hi havia abans. Mantingueren vius els seus trets de catalanitat, malgrat les prohibicions i amenaces. El català era la llengua d’ús en les seves activitats. Es funda l’Escola Tècnica Professional d’Hostafrancs, d’ensenyament nocturn, en els locals del Centre, gràcies a un acord entre la “Hermandad de Ingenieros Industriales” i les “Congregacions Marianes”, i amb l’ajuda de les dues empreses veïnes “Hamsa” i “España Industrial”. Així, doncs, a partir d’aquest any hi va haver escola primària i escola d’aprenents. 1944 Inauguració del Saló-Capella del Centre el dia de Sant Jordi, amb cabuda per a 400 persones. 1954 Noces d’Or del Centre. Obres d’ampliació per a l’Escola Tècnica. Es construeix un pis a la nau lateral. 1963 Ampliació d’estudis. A més de l’escola de primària, s’inicia el batxillerat elemental com a filial número 5 de l’Institut Ausiàs March. L’ Escola Tècnica Professional, filial de l’Escola Industrial, s’obre a les especialitats de delineants, mecànica i química tèxtil. 1964 Classes de català. El Centre organitza classes de català per a infants i adults del barri, en horari de vespre i nit. El Centre i l’Ateneu passen a ser entitats independents de les Congregacions Marianes, que fins aleshores n’havien estat impulsores. 1969 En un document signat pels quatre últims presidents i consiliaris de l’Ateneu, es comunicava a tots els socis que com a resposta a les necessitats de la societat, l’Escola Professional i el Batxillerat es traslladarien a l’Ateneu. Al setembre començava l’enderroc del vell edifici al carrer Torre Damians. 1970 Neix el Grup d’Esplai. Durant uns anys fa les seves activitats al Centre per passar posteriorment als locals del ‘Ateneu Montserrat. Actualment s’anomena Esplai La Lluna i està integrat dins les activitats extraescolars del Centre. 1971 S’inaugura el nou edifici del carrer Torre Damians. S’hi impartien les especialitats d’electrònica, delineació, administració i química, a més a més de Batxillerat. En els nous espais, hi conviuran l’Escola, i les diverses seccions de l’Ateneu que oferia una bona quantitat d’activitats: biblioteca, conferències, cine fòrum, cinema, teatre, esbart dansaire Serra d’Or, coral Cum Jubilo, Grup de Joves, Grup de Matrimonis, C V X (Comunitat Vida Cristiana), piscina, bàsquet (BAM), gimnàs, CAM (Centre i Ateneu Montserrat), Grup Excursionista, escacs. 1973 Escola catalana. Les Escoles fan aquesta opció. El català serà la llengua d’aprenentatge i s’incorporaran els continguts catalans en els diferents nivells educatius. Per la seva reconeguda tasca pedagògica i de catalanitat, l’ Escola Montserrat Xavier i l’Escola Tècnica Professional rebran, al cap d’uns anys, el Premi Baldiri Reixac. Així mateix, l’Escola Joan Pelegrí ha rebut en diverses convocatòries els Premis CIRIT pel foment de l’esperit científic en els seus alumnes. Es crea al Centre i a l’Ateneu una nova secció: el Club de 6’30 a 8. Els escolars es reunien un dia a la setmana voluntàriament per parlar de temes del seu interès. Comptava amb la col·laboració d’alumnes de secundària com a monitors. 1974 Primer concurs de Focs de Sant Joan. Petites “falles” creades pels infants i joves i que es cremen la vesprada de Sant Joan al pati del Centre. A partir d’aquest estiu es faran colònies a Vespella (prop de Vic) per als alumnes del Centre i del barri. 1976 Es donen els primers passos per a la cessió del patrimoni i la titularitat del “Centre”, Ateneu, Escola Montserrat-Xavier i Escola Tècnica Professional d’Hostafrancs, fins aleshores de la Companyia de Jesús, amb la voluntat que la direcció i gestió es portessin mancomunalment entre el “Centre”, l’Ateneu i les Escoles. 1979 75 anys del Centre Montserrat Xavier. Esclat d’actes que es desenvolupen del març fins el juny. Les activitats extraescolars del Centre i Ateneu viuen un moment d’impuls i creixement. Edició del llibre “75 anys de tasca cultural”. Repàs de la història de l’Entitat en les seves noces de platí. 1983 L’Escola esdevé centre experimental de la Reforma de l’educació secundària obligatòria i post-obligatòria (LOGSE), en estreta col·laboració amb el Departament d’Ensenyament de la Generalitat de Catalunya. Així, de la relació es desprèn que moltes de les propostes educatives i materials de treball (Guies d’Alumne, Crèdits de Síntesi…) han estat model per escoles d’arreu. 1984 Es crea la Fundació Cultural Hostafrancs. Dirigida per un Patronat, titular de la institució que aglutina tant les Escoles com l’Ateneu i el Centre. Culminació del procés iniciat el 1976. L’Agrupament Escolta Montserrat Xavier commemora els seus 50 anys d’existència. 1985 Inici del Casal d’Estiu al Centre. L’APA, actual AMPA (Associació de Mares i Pares d’Alumnes) assumeix bona part de l’organització i suport a les activitats del Centre. En l’actualitat, prop de tres-cents infants de l’Escola i del barri participen al Casal durant el mes de juliol. 1989 Primera edició del Premi Drets Humans. Creat per promoure entre l’alumnat els treballs escolars de caire humanista i preocupació social. 1990 Celebració del 50è aniversari de la fundació de l’Escola Tècnica Professional d’Hostafrancs. S’amplia el nombre d’aules a l’edifici de Secundària. 1992 L’Escola s’integra dins el PEA (Pla Escoles Associades a la UNESCO). Assumeix en el seu Projecte Educatiu la defensa del Drets Humans, la Pau, la cooperació. Amb aquest fi es consolida la Campanya anual de cooperació destinada a sensibilitzar i recaptar fons per a un projecte solidari que és promogut pel Grup UNESCO. S’ofereix el servei de les Instal.lacions Esportives de la FCH integrat pel Club Natació Joan Pelegrí i diverses activitats de pràctica esportiva. 1994 Coincidint amb el 90è aniversari de l’Entitat, les escoles passen a anomenar-se Escola Joan Pelegrí . Durant el curs 1993-94, es completà el procés de transició al nou sistema educatiu amb la unificació dels noms de les dues escoles de la Fundació: l’Escola Montserrat-Xavier i l’Escola Tècnica Professional d’Hostafrancs. En Joan Pelegrí i Partegàs, (Barcelona, 1910-1998), a més del seu treball a la Institució com a metge i com a animador d’activitats, és autor de nombrosos treballs científics, històrics i morals. En reconeixement de la seva important tasca científica, pedagògica i humana va ser distingit l’any 1986 amb la Creu de Sant Jordi de la Generalitat de Catalunya. 1996 S’amplia l’edifici del carrer Ermengarda amb la construcció d’un pis superior que dóna cabuda a instal·lacions per a la nova oferta educativa. El curs 1996-97 l’Escola va finalitzar la implantació anticipada de les diferents etapes educatives establertes per la LOGSE. Es posen en marxa Cursos Ocupacionals. Des d’aquest any, l’Escola ha estat reconeguda per la Generalitat com a Centre Homologat per a Cursos Ocupacionals. Aquests cursos són adreçats a persones adultes en atur. 1998 El 27 de març mor en Joan Pelegrí i Partegàs als 88 anys, deixant un llegat cultural, humanístic, catalanista i pedagògic reconegut per les més altes institucions catalanes i després d’una vida completament dedicada al barri d’Hostafrancs, a l’Escola i al Centre Montserrat Xavier del qual fou president fins la seva mort. 1999 L’Escola inicia la seva presència a internet a través del seu domini www.joanpelegri.com. 2002 S’enderroca l’edifici del carrer Consell de Cent 14 i s’inicien les obres de l’escola de secundària al xamfrà de Consell de Cent i Torre Damians. A Infantil i Primària, es reformen els accessos a les aules del primer pis. 2003 S’incorpora a la Fundació Cultural Hostafrancs l’Escola Sagrada Família, una escola de llarga tradició al barri, situada al carrer Guadiana, 13-17. L’Escola és autoritzada a impartir Programes de Garantia Social. El BAM celebra el 75 aniversari. Bressol del bàsquet al barri. L’èxit de la seva pervivència cal trobar-la en el principi d’entendre el bàsquet com un complement de la formació dels joves. Compta amb 18 equips en totes les categories en competició, tant masculins com femenins. 2004 Celebrem el Centenari de la nostra comunitat educativa amb un bon nombre d’actes dels quals val la pena remarcar la setmana del 22 al 28 de març al Centre, tallers de circ, sessió d’aeròbic, educació viària o enlairament de globus; una foto multitudinària de l’alumnat i comunitat educativa al pati d’Infantil-Primària; una gran festa el 28 de març al pati del Centre amb un bon ventall d’actes com cercavila, cantada d’alumnes, actuació de l’Orfeó Atlàntida, botifarrada popular i actuació castellera, entre d’altres i finalment una excursió a Montserrat el dia 9 de maig en la qual es va fer una ofrena i una recepció amb l’abat Cassià Maria Just. S’inaugura el nou edifici de secundària a la cantonada Torre Damians, 6 – Consell de Cent, 14. 2007 Es remodela la Sala d’Actes de l’Escola de Secundària que passa a dir-se Sala Víctor Trías en honor a qui fou primer, Consiliari del Centre i director de l’Ateneu i posteriorment, director de les escoles durant la dècada dels seixanta i part dels setanta i veritable impulsor del nou edifici de l’Ateneu i i de l’ETPH (Escola Tècnica Professional d’Hostafrancs) 2010 Any del Centenari d’en Joan Pelegrí i Partegàs que celebrem durant el mes de maig amb diferents actes com una ofrena floral, una exposició titulada “El Pele i els infants, 100 anys del Pele”, una xocolatada, jocs, cercaviles, dinar de germanor, sardanes i actuacions musicals. 2012 L’Ajuntament de Barcelona otorga la Medalla d’Honor de la Ciutat a la Fundació Cultural Hostafrancs en reconeixement a les virtuts i valors cívics de l’Entitat. Per celebrar-ho vam organitzar uns jocs i una xocolatada per a tots els infants del barri el dia 1 de desembre a la plaça Joan Pelegrí. Resumeme la historia en 3 lineas","output":"Fundada el 1904 com a iniciativa per educar en valors i proporcionar instrucció a un barri de Barcelona majoritàriament obrer i analfabet, l'Escola Joan Pelegrí ha evolucionat des d'un centre modest fins a convertir-se en un referent d'educació integral, mantenint sempre el seu compromís amb la formació acadèmica, valors humanístics i catalanitat.

Her trademark goggles are a significant part of her iconography, but they seem to serve more as a part of her pilot-inspired ensemble rather than a functional component of her time-traveling capabilities. If Tracer blinked around without her goggles, technically, in terms of gameplay mechanics or lore, there wouldn't be any direct impact on her ability to use her powers. Her goggles do not appear to be linked to her ability to manipulate time or space, which is primarily enabled by the chronal accelerator she wears on her chest. This device is what actually allows her to control her position in time, correcting her desynchronization caused by an accident with experimental teleporting technology. However, considering the practical aspect and her design, if we dive a bit into speculative fiction and real-world physics, blinking around at such high speeds and potentially experiencing rapid changes in air pressure, wind resistance, and environmental particles without eye protection could realistically be quite harmful or at least uncomfortable for her eyes. Wearing goggles would protect her eyes from debris, insects, or any particulate matter in the air that could cause irritation or injury while moving at high velocities. Additionally, the goggles could offer protection against strong winds and rapid changes in humidity or temperature, maintaining her ability to see clearly and react quickly to her surroundings. So, while her goggles may not be a functional necessity for the operation of her time-blink abilities, they would certainly be beneficial for comfort and safety during high-speed movements in a more realistic setting. Without them, she might face practical challenges like eye irritation or reduced visibility, which could, in turn, affect her effectiveness in fast-paced situations."},{"instruction":"В чем он не прав? « Сигналы в процессоре передаются с помощью электрического тока, который двигается с 2/3 скорости света, это почти 200.000.000 м/с, в то же время сигналы в мозге передаются с помощью ионов со скоростью около 300 км/ч (~83 м/с). Таким образом компьютерный процессор (при прочих равных) \\"думает\\" в 2.5 миллиона раз быстрее, чем человеческий мозг. То, что процессор может \\"обдумать\\" за 1 секунду - тебе придется обдумывать 28 дней, непрерывно, не теряя концентрации ни на одно мгновение.\\"","output":"Аргумент предполагает некоторые недопонимания о том, как процессоры и мозг работают, и как их \\"скорости мышления\\" можно сравнивать. Во-первых, электрические сигналы в микропроцессорах действительно перемещаются с высокой скоростью, но эта скорость не является единственным фактором, который определяет скорость обработки информации процессором. Процессоры работают на определенной тактовой частоте, определяющей количество операций, которые они могут выполнить за единицу времени. Эта частота обычно измеряется в гигагерцах (миллиардах циклов в секунду). Но скорость процессора также зависит от множества других факторов, включая архитектуру процессора, эффективность выполнения инструкций, задержки памяти и другие технологические аспекты. Во-вторых, сигналы в мозге действительно передаются сравнительно медленно, если рассматривать только скорость движения ионов через нейронные мембраны. Однако мозг работает совершенно иначе, чем компьютер. Он параллельно обрабатывает информацию с помощью огромного количества нейронов (около 86 миллиардов) и синапсов (около 100 триллионов), что позволяет выполнять сложные операции, связанные с обучением, восприятием, памятью и принятием решений, которые могут быть очень сложными для компьютеров. Так что утверждение о том, что \\"процессор думает в 2.5 миллиона раз быстрее\\", преувеличивает и упрощает различия между электронным и биологическим вычислением. Реальность гораздо сложнее прямого сравнения скорости передачи сигналов: мозг и компьютеры эффективны в различных типах задач, используя совершенно разные механизмы обработки информации."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Skryf asb vir my 'n toespraak oor die pottebakker in die bybel, dit moet so 5 min lank wees en gerig op vroue.","output":"Goedemôre, liewe dames, Dis vir my 'n groot eer om vandag hier voor julle te staan en te deel rondom 'n baie spesiale onderwerp—die pottebakker uit die Bybel. As ons dink aan 'n pottebakker, dink ons aan iemand wat met sy of haar hande werk, iemand wat 'n vormlose klomp klei neem en dit in iets pragtig omskep. Dit is 'n kragtige beeld van hoe God met ons werk, spesifiek in die boek van Jeremia, hoofstuk 18. Hier sien ons 'n pragtige metafoor van God se verhouding met ons. Jeremia word na die huis van 'n pottebakker gestuur, nie om iets te doen nie, maar om iets te sien, te leer. Terwyl die pottebakker werk, misluk 'n vaas wat hy maak, maar in plaas daarvan om op te gee, begin hy oor met dieselfde klomp klei om iets nuut te maak. Sisters, hoe dikwels voel ons nie ook soos daardie mislukte vaas op die draaiskijf nie? Hoeveel keer dink ons ons is te ver gebreek, te diep gekneus dat selfs die Skepper nie kan begin om ons weer bymekaar te bring en ons opnuut te vorm nie? Maar hier, in die boek van Jeremia, herinner die Here ons dat Hy die pottebakker is en ons die klei. Ons hoef nie perfek te wees om in Sy hande geneem te word en iets wonderbaarlik gemaak te word nie. Hy vra ons net om oorgegee te wees aan Sy hande, om vertroue in Sy visie vir ons lewens te hê. Dit maak nie saak hoe gekneus of gebroke jy voel nie, God het 'n plan vir jou en daardie plan is mooier as enigiets wat ons vir onsself kon uitdink. As vroue speel ons soveel rolle in die lewe - ons is moeders, dogters, susters, vriende, mentors, en soveel meer. Elke rol dra sy eie uitdagings, sy eie verwagtings. En soms, te midde van hierdie alles, verloor ons 'n bietjie van onsself, ons word 'n bietjie misvorm onder die druk. Maar net soos klei in die hande van die pottebakker, het ons God wat ons vorm en ons ondersteun, wat ons af en toe weer op die draaiskijf plaas en ons hermodel na Sy perfekte ontwerp. Liewe dames, die boodskap vandag is eenvoudig: Moenie moed opgee nie. Moet nooit dink dat jou stukkies te stukkend is vir die Skepper nie. Om in die hande van die Meester-pottebakker te wees, is om toe te laat dat Hy met jou werk, jou versterk, jou beskerm en jou in die mooiste vaas omskep. Mag ons elkeen vandag hier weg stap met die wete dat ons in die hande van 'n liefdevolle, bedagsame Skepper is—Een wat nooit ophou werk met ons nie, nooit ophou om ons te vorm volgens Sy wonderskone plan nie. En mag ons die moed hê om sag en buigsaam in Sy hande te bly, om te vertrou in die proses, selfs wanneer ons nie die finale produk kan sien nie. Dankie dat julle luister. Mag julle elkeen versterk en verfris voel deur hierdie boodskap. God seën julle almal."},{"instruction":"ОТВЕТЬТЕ НА ВОПРОС В ТЕТРАДИ. ПОЧЕМУ ПЬЕСА НАЗВАНА «НА ДНЕ»?","output":"Пьеса Максима Горького \\"На дне\\", написанная в 1902 году, является одним из самых известных произведений русской литературы. Название пьесы метафорически отражает её основную тему – образ жизни людей на самом низу социальной лестницы, которые оказались в нищете, лишены прав и возможностей для изменения своего положения в обществе. Действие пьесы происходит в ночлежке для бедняков, которая символизирует самое \\"дно\\" общества. В пьесе Горький разворачивает живую картину жизни самых обездоленных слоев населения, их страданий, мечтаний и разочарований. Здесь собраны разные судьбы, каждый персонаж пришёл сюда своей дорогой, но всех их объединяет одно – они находятся на самом низу жизненного лестницы. В то же время, пьеса затрагивает вечные вопросы о смысле жизни, возможности духовного возрождения и поиске истины вне зависимости от материального положения. \\"На дне\\" также демонстрирует различные реакции человека на крайние условия жизни – от отчаяния до иллюзорной надежды, от самоуничижения до поисков смысла даже в самых тяжёлых обстоятельствах. Горький обнажает проблемы общества, показывая, как система и социальные условия разрушают человеческие души, приводя их к \\"дну\\". Таким образом, название \\"На дне\\" выбрано не случайно и глубоко символично, поскольку отражает не только материальное, но и моральное состояние персонажей, их борьбу за человеческое достоинство в условиях крайней нищеты и отчаяния."},{"instruction":"переведи на французский язык: ЯПОНИЯ Япония, расположенная на Востоке Азии, является уникальной и увлекательной островной страной с богатой историей и яркой культурой. Япония известна своей традиционной культурой, включая чаепития, сады и великолепные храмы. Японская кухня также известна во всем мире. Кроме того, Япония также славится передовыми технологиями, мангой и аниме, которые сильно влияют на мировую поп-культуру. Сегодня мы расскажем несколько интересных фактов о Японии. Культ природы и сакуры Японцы очень бережно относятся в своей природе. Даже в миллионных мегаполисах вам не составит труда найти многочисленные парки и зеленые уголки. Жизнь в Японии останавливается, когда весной начинает цвести японская вишня — сакура. Японцы на время забывают о своей работе, а все местные парки заполняются людьми. Лес для самоубийц Япония — страна с большим количеством самоубийц. Около Фудзиямы находится лес Аокигахара. В это место проститься с жизнью приезжают японцы. В год здесь находят более 100 тел. Причина самоубийств — это повальное внутреннее одиночество японцев и выгорание на работе. Японцы — шопоголики Японцы — любители покупок и большие модники. В стране представлены все мировые бренды. Правда, цены в таких магазинах очень дорогие. Но это не мешает японцам стоять в очереди несколько часов, чтобы купить какую-то безделушку. Такая же ситуация с возможностью вкусно поесть. Нужно готовиться к тому, что попасть в японский ресторан получится далеко не сразу. Ситуацию поправляют многочисленные автоматы. Они на каждом шагу: в них можно купить абсолютно все — от еды до одежды. Безопасность и якудза На японских улицах очень низкий уровень преступности. Стать объектом ограбления тут вряд ли удастся. Но раньше местная мафия — якудза была невероятно влиятельна. С ней приходилось договариваться даже правительству. Один раз в год во время праздновании Сандзя-Мацури в храме Асакусы японская мафия являет себя обществу. Неся священный палантин, якудза обнажаются, демонстрируя свои татуировки. Чистота на улицах Японцы уделяют большое значение гигиене улиц. Здесь нет гор мусора у подъездов. Все улицы тщательно убирают. Даже в районах, где выпадает снег, и есть опасность обледенения, на дорогах устанавливается специальный подогрев.","output":"Le Japon, situé en Asie de l'Est, est un pays insulaire unique et fascinant avec une histoire riche et une culture colorée. Le Japon est connu pour sa culture traditionnelle, notamment les cérémonies du thé, les jardins et les magnifiques temples. La cuisine japonaise est également renommée dans le monde entier. De plus, le Japon est également célèbre pour ses technologies de pointe, le manga et l'anime, qui ont une grande influence sur la pop culture mondiale. Aujourd'hui, nous allons vous parler de quelques faits intéressants sur le Japon. Culte de la nature et des cerisiers en fleurs Les Japonais ont un profond respect pour la nature. Même dans les villes tentaculaires, vous trouverez de nombreux parcs et espaces verts. La vie au Japon s'arrête lorsque les cerisiers japonais, appelés sakura, fleurissent au printemps. Les Japonais oublient leur travail et les parcs locaux se remplissent de gens. La forêt des suicidés Le Japon est un pays avec un nombre élevé de suicides. Près du Mont Fuji se trouve la forêt d'Aokigahara. C'est là que les Japonais viennent dire adieu à la vie. Chaque année, plus de 100 corps y sont retrouvés. La raison des suicides est le profond isolement intérieur des Japonais et le burn-out au travail. Les Japonais sont des accros du shopping Les Japonais adorent faire du shopping et sont de grands fans de mode. Toutes les grandes marques mondiales sont représentées dans le pays. Bien que les prix dans ces magasins soient très élevés, cela n'empêche pas les Japonais de faire la queue pendant plusieurs heures pour acheter quelque chose de futile. La même chose vaut pour la possibilité de bien manger. Il faut se préparer au fait qu'il faut du temps pour trouver un restaurant japonais. Heureusement, il y a de nombreux distributeurs automatiques partout : on peut y acheter absolument tout, de la nourriture aux vêtements. Sécurité et yakuzas Le taux de criminalité dans les rues japonaises est très faible. Il est peu probable de devenir la cible d'un vol ici. Cependant, autrefois, la mafia locale - les yakuzas étaient incroyablement influents. Même le gouvernement devait s'entendre avec eux. Une fois par an, lors de la célébration du Sanja Matsuri au temple d'Asakusa, la mafia japonaise se dévoile à la société. Portant un palanquin sacré, les yakuzas se dévoilent en montrant leurs tatouages. Propreté dans les rues Les Japonais accordent une grande importance à la propreté des rues. Il n'y a pas de montagnes de déchets devant les entrées. Toutes les rues sont soigneusement nettoyées. Même dans les zones où il neige et où il y a un risque de verglas, les routes sont équipées d'un système de chauffage spécial."},{"instruction":"напиши произношение на русском языке","output":"Произношение на французском языке \\"Япония\\": \\"ЖаПОНИЙ\\"."},{"instruction":"Identificar las principales LLM que sirven como herramientas de análisis estático de código","output":"Las herramientas de análisis estático de código, conocidas también por sus siglas en inglés SAST (Static Application Security Testing), son fundamentales para identificar vulnerabilidades en el código fuente de una aplicación antes de su despliegue. No obstante, cuando mencionas \\"LLM\\" en este contexto, puedo inferir que te refieres a modelos de lenguaje grande, como GPT-3, y su aplicación en el ámbito del análisis de código, aunque típicamente este no es el acrónimo usado para ellas. Los modelos de lenguaje desarrollados específicamente para entender o generar código pueden, en efecto, ser herramientas útiles en la identificación de patrones, sugerencias de mejora y, hasta cierto punto, en el análisis estático. Sin embargo, su propósito principal y diseño no están centrados exclusivamente en el análisis estático de seguridad. Si tu interés radica en cómo la inteligencia artificial y, específicamente, los grandes modelos de lenguaje pueden ayudar en el análisis estático de código, herramientas y modelos tales como Codex (creado por OpenAI, el cual es una evolución de GPT-3 enfocado en programación), GitHub Copilot (basado en Codex), y otros sistemas basados en IA están siendo explorados para mejorar la productividad de los desarrolladores y, en algunos contextos, para ayudar en la identificación de errores comunes o patrones de código potencialmente peligrosos. No obstante, para tareas específicas de análisis estático de seguridad en código, herramientas especializadas en SAST son más comúnmente recomendadas, incluyendo: 1. **SonarQube:** Popular herramienta que ofrece revisión continua de la calidad del código para detectar bugs, vulnerabilidades y malos olores en el código. 2. **Fortify:** Solución de Hewlett Packard Enterprise para proporcionar análisis estático de seguridad en diversas fases del desarrollo de software, identificando vulnerabilidades de seguridad. 3. **Checkmarx:** Plataforma que ofrece análisis estático, así como análisis de composición de software (SCA) y análisis interactivo de aplicaciones (IAST), entre otras. 4. **Coverity:** Ofrece análisis estático y análisis de integridad del software, permitiendo identificar y remediar vulnerabilidades y defectos en el código. 5. **CodeQL:** De GitHub, es una herramienta para query código como si fuera una base de datos, permitiendo identificar variadas vulnerabilidades en el código.

Аналитические отчеты играют ключевую роль в этом контексте, помогая руководству клиник и медицинскому персоналу принимать обоснованные решения. Ниже приведен список потенциальных аналитических отчетов, которые могли бы быть полезными в информационной системе для медицинских клиник: 1. **Отчет по посещаемости** - обобщает данные о количестве пациентов, посетивших клинику за определенный период, что позволяет оценить рабочую нагрузку и планировать график работы персонала. 2. **Отчет о доходах и расходах** - предоставляет детализацию финансовых потоков клиники, включая доходы от оказанных услуг и расходы на закупку медикаментов, оборудования и оплату труда. 3. **Отчет по заболеваемости** - анализирует данные о частоте встречаемости различных заболеваний среди обслуживаемой популяции, что помогает в планировании ресурсов и профилактических мер. 4. **Отчет о диагностической деятельности** - включает статистику по проведенным диагностическим процедурам и их результатам, способствующих оптимизации диагностических процессов. 5. **Отчет по лечению и его эффективности** - оценивает результаты терапии, применяемой в клинике, помогая выявить наиболее и наименее эффективные методики. 6. **Отчет по использованию медицинского оборудования** - фиксирует степень загрузки оборудования, его износ и необходимость в техническом обслуживании или обновлении. 7. **Анализ очередей и времени ожидания** - исследует продолжительность ожидания услуги пациентами и эффективность графиков приема, целью улучшения качества обслуживания. 8. **Отчет о профилактических мероприятиях** - собирает данные о проведенных кампаниях по профилактике заболеваний (вакцинация, скрининги, образовательные программы) и их результатах. 9. **Отчет по удовлетворенности пациентов** - анализирует отзывы и оценки пациентов относительно качества обслуживания, помещений, доступности услуг, что способствует улучшению работы клиники. 10. **Аналитика по персоналу** - включает анализ эффективности работы медицинского и административного персонала, обучение, квалификации, рабочую нагрузку и показатели текучести кадров. Эти отчеты могут быть адаптированы и расширены в зависимости от специфики и потребностей конкретной медицинской клиники, а также от возможностей используемой информационной системы. Внедрение системы бизнес-аналитики в медицинские информационные системы позволяет глубже анализировать операционную деятельность, что способствует повышению качества медицинского обслуживания и оптимизации ресурсов клиники."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.
