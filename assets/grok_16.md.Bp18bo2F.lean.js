World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, the Great War, or the War to End All Wars, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. Unresolved rivalries still extant at the end of the conflict contributed to the start of the Second World War only twenty-one years later.  The war drew in all the world's economic great powers, assembled in two opposing alliances: the Allies (based on the Triple Entente of the Russian Empire, the French Third Republic, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland) versus the Central Powers of Germany and Austria-Hungary. Although Italy was a member of the Triple Alliance alongside Germany and Austria-Hungary, it did not join the Central Powers, as Austria-Hungary had taken the offensive against the terms of the alliance. These alliances were reorganised and expanded as more nations entered the war: Italy, Japan and the United States joined the Allies, while the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria joined the Central Powers.

Given the question: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

The present-day location is known as Hisarlik. It was the setting of the Trojan War described in the Greek Epic Cycle, in particular in the \\"Iliad\\", one of the two epic poems attributed to Homer. Metrical evidence from the \\"Iliad\\" and the \\"Odyssey\\" suggests that the name (\\"Ilion\\") formerly began with a digamma: (\\"Wilion\\"); this is also supported by the Hittite name for what is thought to be the same city, Wilusa.  - In Greek mythology, Hector (\\"Hektr\\") was a Trojan prince and the greatest fighter for Troy in the Trojan War. As the first-born son of King Priam and Queen Hecuba, who was a descendant of Dardanus and Tros, the founder of Troy, he was a prince of the royal house and the heir apparent to his father's throne. He was married to Andromache, with whom he had an infant son, Scamandrius (whom the people of Troy called Astyanax). He acted as leader of the Trojans and their allies in the defense of Troy, \\"killing 31,000 Greek fighters\\", offers Hyginus. During the European Middle Ages, Hector figures as one of the Nine Worthies noted by Jacques de Longuyon, known not only for his courage but also for his noble and courtly nature. Indeed, Homer places Hector as peace-loving, thoughtful as well as bold, a good son, husband and father, and without darker motives. James Redfield writes of Hector as a \\"martyr to loyalties, a witness to the things of this world, a hero ready to die for the precious imperfections of ordinary life.\\"  - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\\"Hellespontos\\", literally \\"Sea of Helle\\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. One of the world's narrowest straits used for international navigation, the Dardanelles connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, while also allowing passage to the Black Sea by extension via the Bosphorus.  - In Greek mythology , Polyxena ( / plksn / ; Greek :  ) was the youngest daughter of King Priam of Troy and his queen , Hecuba .  - Cassandra (, also ), also known as Alexandra or Kassandra, was a daughter of King Priam and of Queen Hecuba of Troy. In modern usage her name is employed as a rhetorical device to indicate someone whose accurate prophecies are not believed by those around them.  - Hecuba (also \\"Hecabe\\", \\"Hécube\\"; \\"Hekáb\\") was a queen in Greek mythology, the wife of King Priam of Troy during the Trojan War, with whom she had 19 children. These children included several major characters of Homer's \\"Iliad\\" such as the warriors Hector and Paris and the prophetess Cassandra.

We performed an integrated analysis of genome-wide expression and copy-number data for primary endometrial carcinomas with extensive clinical and histopathological data to detect features predictive of recurrent disease. Unsupervised analysis of the expression data distinguished 2 major clusters with strikingly different phenotypes, including significant differences in disease-free survival. To identify possible mechanisms for these differences, we performed a global genomic survey of amplifications, deletions, and loss of heterozygosity, which identified 11 significantly amplified and 13 significantly deleted regions. Amplifications of 3q26.32 harboring the oncogene PIK3CA were associated with poor prognosis and segregated with the aggressive transcriptional cluster. Moreover, samples with PIK3CA amplification carried signatures associated with in vitro activation of PI3 kinase (PI3K), a signature that was shared by aggressive tumors without PIK3CA amplification. Tumors with loss of PTEN expression or PIK3CA overexpression that did not have PIK3CA amplification also shared the PI3K activation signature, high protein expression of the PI3K pathway member STMN1, and an aggressive phenotype in test and validation datasets. However, mutations of PTEN or PIK3CA were not associated with the same expression profile or aggressive phenotype. STMN1 expression had independent prognostic value.

Richard and Larry take their findings to the CEO, Bernie Lomax (Terry Kiser), who commends them for discovering insurance fraud and invites them to his Hamptons island beach house for the weekend. Unbeknownst to Larry and Richard, Bernie is behind the fraud. Nervously meeting with his mob partners, Bernie asks to have Larry and Richard killed and arrange it to look like a murder-suicide. However, after Bernie leaves the gangsters decide Bernie has been attracting too much attention with his grabbiness as well as his fooling around with a girlfriend of one of the mobsters, and order that he be killed instead.Bernie arrives at the island before Larry and Richard and speaks to the hitman Paulie (Don Calfa) on the phone, planning the murders and establishing an alibi, unaware the conversation is being recorded on Bernie's answering machine. Bernie then plants cash and a fake confession note implicating Larry and Richard in the insurance fraud. Paulie arrives, injects Bernie with a fatal overdose, then plants heroin on him. When Larry and Richard arrive at the beach house, they find their boss's body. Before they can call the police, however, guests arrive for a party that is a regular event at Bernie's house every weekend. To Larry's and Richard's amazement, the guests are all too engrossed in their partying to notice their host is deceased, with Bernie's dark sunglasses and dopey grin from the fatal injection concealing his lifeless state.Fearing implication in Bernie's death, Larry proposes he and Richard maintain the illusion that Bernie is still alive, a notion that Richard finds absurd. Only the arrival of Richard's office crush, Gwen Saunders (Catherine Mary Stewart), convinces him to go along with Larry's plan.

Q with options: Can we draw the following conclusion? Comdex launches trade shows for 20 years. Possible answers: 1). yes 2). no","output":"2). No Based on the information provided, we cannot draw the conclusion that Comdex has been launching trade shows for 20 years. Instead, we can infer that Comdex was a significant trade show event specifically in the computer and software industry, which occurred annually for 20 years in Las Vegas. Comdex operated as a vital platform for introducing new products and innovations within the technology sector. Through this trade show, various companies could showcase their latest technologies, network with other professionals, and gain insights into their competitors' projects and future advancements in the market. This annual event played a significant role in the growth and development of the computer and software industries. Although we can ascertain that Comdex was active for 20 years, it would be inaccurate to state that the event itself has been launching trade shows for those 20 years. Comdex was not the launching entity for other trade shows; instead, it focused on being a singular trade show within its industry niche. To recap, Comdex was a key technology trade show that took place in Las Vegas for 20 years, with a focus on computers and software products.

There are no comments about the state of music industry during the album release time, whether it was thriving, stagnant, or in decline.

The award was announced recently at a dinne r, held in Kilgore's honor and hosted by law school Dean Samuel M. Davis, who presented her with an engraved plaque. \\"Ginny Kilgore is a public servant in the truest sense,\\" said Davis. \\"Her selection continues the tradition of this award in recognizing those who have labored in the trenches, with little or no compensation but with great professional and personal satisfaction in helping to bring justice and equality to those who need it most.\\" \\"This award means a great deal to me,\\" Kilgore said, pointing to others so honored. \\"The work of those who received the award before me has been so important; I feel very honored.\\" After earning bachelor's and master's degrees in education and a few years teaching, Kilgore enrolled at the UM law school. Upon graduation in 1975, she entered private law practice in Oxford, joining NMRLS in 1978. Since then, she has earned promotions from managing attorney, senior attorney, then director of the Council on Aging project. Since 1990, she has worked in the Administrative Law Unit and Resource Development, and directed the Elder Law Project, serving the northern half of the state.

The variance in prevalence rates is reflected in people's inconsistent responses to the different components of sexual orientation within a study and the instability of their responses over time. Laumann et al., (1994) found that among U.S. adults 20% of those who would be considered homosexual on one component of orientation were homosexual on the other two dimensions and 70% responded in a way that was consistent with homosexuality on only one of the three dimensions. Furthermore, sexuality is fluid such that one's sexual orientation is not necessarily stable or consistent over time but is subject to change throughout life. Diamond (2003) found that over 7 years 2/3 of the women changed their sexual identity at least once, with many reporting that the label was not adequate in capturing the diversity of their sexual or romantic feelings. Furthermore, women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not relinquish same sex sexuality and acknowledged the possibility for future same sex attractions and/or behaviour. One woman stated \\"I'm mainly straight but I'm one of those people who, if the right circumstance came along, would change my viewpoint\\". Therefore, individuals classified as homosexual in one study might not be identified the same way in another depending on which components are assessed and when the assessment is made making it difficult to pin point who is homosexual and who is not and what the overall prevalence within a population may be. What did Diamond find about the women?","output":"Diamond (2003) found that, over a period of 7 years, two-thirds of the women in the study changed their sexual identity at least once, indicating that sexual orientation is fluid and can change over time.

Furthermore, Diamond found that women who relinquished bisexual and lesbian identification did not necessarily stop having same-sex attractions or behaviors, and they acknowledged the possibility for future same-sex attractions and/or behavior. One woman's quote serves as an example of this: \\"I'm mainly straight but I'm one of those people who, if the right circumstance came along, would change my viewpoint\\".

Hopefully I'm never in that position again.\\" Steve's wife Charly said she thought the condition had actually brought them closer together, with her often having to help with treatments. She said: \\"There's definitely no inhibitions in our relationship. \\"As a girlfriend I was happy to help out and as a wife I'm just as happy to help out. I'd rather I be useful than you have to go to hospital every day and get somebody else to do it.\\" Jenny Stradling, 26, from Leeds was born with eczema, but when she turned 16 her condition worsened and lead to her spending the night in A&E. In 2013 she set up the blog I Have Eczema to share her experiences. \\"It can be so bad that you actually stick to your bedding. You can have really raw areas and kind of look almost like a burns victim,\\" she said. But it is the urge to itch which Jenny, like many sufferers, struggles with particularly. \\"It's just this bone-deep itch that you can never scratch,\\" she said. \\"It never goes away.\\" Professor Andrew Wright, associate director of the Centre for Skin Sciences at the University of Bradford, said the \\"itch-scratch cycle\\" was a vicious circle. \\"If you scratch the skin enough to produce some discomfort and some pain, that that will almost certainly override the lower grade sensation of itching,\\" he said. \\"[But] the scratching isn't helping, it is damaging the skin and, undoubtedly, leading to the development of more eczema.\\" Equally common is the impact the condition can have on sufferer's personal life. Jenny said she had lost partners and friends as a result, and had been left housebound at times. It has also affected her self-confidence and left her feeling so embarrassed by her constant scratching she would hide herself away for \\"secret skin-picking sessions\\". \\"There's a kind of guilt that people put on you even though its not your fault. You can't help it. You just have to quench that itch,\\" she said. It is not just those with eczema who shoulder the burden of the condition. Sue's 17-year-old daughter Alice was born with eczema and she spent much of her childhood in hospital. But, at home, Sue has also had to learn to live with her daughter's condition, at times having to change her bed sheets on a daily basis, buying wipe-clean furniture and replacing washing machines damaged by the creams and lotions that seep into her daughter's clothes. Sue said: \\"It's very difficult as a mum. You have to be strong, you're a nag, you have to bully them in to doing their treatment. You have to cope with normal life, working and being a carer. \\"I struggle but I get on with it. I have to put that front up that everything is all right, I can't cry here so I go elsewhere and cry.\\" The effects are both emotional and physical. \\"When she's gone through what she's gone through all her life, I do want to protect her. I don't want to see my little girl in hospital. \\"I don't sleep cause I hear Alice scratching. When she was young, she used to sleep with me so that I could hold her hands and stop her scratching so that she could get some sleep.\\" Their struggle was compounded when Alice was targeted by bullies, but, together, they have been able to move forward. \\"My mum is my rock,\\" said Alice. \\"If anything goes wrong, I just go to my mum. She is just my world. I could not have done anything I've done up to now without her.\\" For 17-year-old Sam from Bradford, a combination of the desperate urge to scratch, the loss of control and comments about his skin left him feeling angry, upset and embarrassed. \\"The whole of my body was itching and I've only got two hands, it was impossible to deal with,\\" he said. \\"I like being in control and that was the one thing I was not in control of, it made me frustrated and angry. \\"I was probably quite ugly. I didn't like looking at my own skin because it was all dry and all red and all cracked. \\"Little comments by people about how my skin looked, that made me feel worse about it. \\"I was quite ashamed of my skin because it looked really horrible compared with everybody else's. I didn't want anybody to see it and think badly of me.\\" His mum, Lindsay Dobby, said that when Sam's condition worsened during his first year at secondary school, she was forced to give up work to look after him. She said: \\"Daily life became really hard. I could not have gone to work and looked after Sam because he simply could not go to school. \\"You end up shouting and snapping at each other because you're all tired.\\" She said her decision to give up work, however, was the only option. \\"It's your child and you would literally do anything for them,\\" she said. \\"To see your child in that state literally ripping themselves to shreds, it's horrendous.\\" Eczema: More than Skin Deep will be broadcast on 29 August at 09:00 BST on BBC Radio Sheffield and on BBC Radio Leeds at 18:00 BST. This article was about:","output":"This article details the experiences of various individuals suffering from eczema, a dry skin condition that affects one in 12 adults and 20% of children in the UK. Eczema, also known as dermatitis, can vary greatly in severity with mild cases being easily manageable, while severe cases can be completely life-altering and lead to infections. The daily struggles of those with severe eczema are highlighted in the article, such as the constant itch that never goes away, the impact on personal relationships, and the embarrassment caused by the condition. Professor Andrew Wright from the University of Bradford emphasizes the \\"itch-scratch cycle\\" that eczema sufferers experience, noting that the scratching only further damages the skin and leads to the worsening of the eczema. The emotional and psychological toll of managing eczema is also discussed, as many individuals experience feelings of shame, embarrassment, and a lack of control over their own bodies. In addition to the sufferers themselves, the article highlights the challenges faced by parents and caregivers who must help manage their children's eczema. For many, this involves constant care and communication, with the need to be strong and supportive while also handling the practical aspects, such as making sure treatments are applied properly and adapting their living environments to accommodate their children's needs. Despite the difficulties eczema can pose and the impact it can have on an individual's quality of life, those featured in the article find ways to persevere and continue living their lives, often with the support of their friends and family. Eczema: More than Skin Deep, a radio documentary, sheds further light on this destructive disease and the experiences of those who suffer from it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: An armed gunman causes a hostage situation at a Los Angeles grocery store. When negotiations between him and the law fail, Marion Cobretti (codenamed \\"Cobra\\") (Sylvester Stallone), a member of an elite division of the Los Angeles Police Department known as the \\"Zombie Squad\\", is summoned to the scene. Cobretti infiltrates the store, locates, and negotiates with him. During the negotiation, the criminal speaks of the unknown \\"New Order\\", a group of social darwinist radicals that despise modern society and believe in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule the world. Cobretti then kills the gunman by throwing a knife at his abdomen and firing shots at him. As the bodies are removed from the supermarket, Cobretti is admonished by Detective Monte (Andrew Robinson) for his seeming disregard for police procedures and protocols. Harassed by reporters, Cobretti admonishes them for failing to put the safety of potential victims first. Little does everyone realize at the time is that the supermarket hostage crisis is only one of a string of recent and seemingly unconnected acts of violence and murder that have broken loose in Los Angeles, perpetrated by the same supremacist group the supermarket gunman mentioned. After witnessing several individuals going on a spree killing, including the New Order leader, only identified as 'The Night Slasher' (Brian Thompson), model and businesswoman Ingrid Knudsen (Brigitte Nielsen) becomes the group's main target due to her being the only living witness to their crimes. After a failed attempt on her by the group, she is placed under the protective custody of Cobretti and his partner, Sergeant Tony Gonzales (Reni Santoni). Several more attempts are made on their lives by various people connected to the Order.

Expansion quickly peaked however, and the European powers who had carved up the New World set about testing each other in dynastic conflicts and colonial rivalry. The English were the main rivals of the Dutch on the high seas, and there were several wars between the two in the 17th and 18th centuries. In 1665–1667 the Dutch sailed up the River Medway and sank the British fleet moored there. The 18th century saw Amsterdam grow into the foremost financial center in the world, but the seeds of decline had already been planted. When the English colonies in New England rose up in revolt against the British, they found ready Ailies in the Dutch. From their colonies in the Caribbean they sent caches of arms and ammunition. The British were furious and went to war in 1780, destroying the Dutch navy and signaling a sudden decline in power and influence from which the Netherlands never recovered. Trade suffered to such an extent that in 1791 the VOC went into liquidation. In the latter part of the century there were anti-Orange demonstrations by pro-French factions in the country, and in 1795 Napoleon Bonaparte took the Netherlands in his epic march across Europe. Under the yoke of another foreign power, and with trade at an all time low, the Golden Age was truly dead. The Return of the House of Orange Napoleon installed his brother Louis as King of Holland and he chose to take the fine Town Hall on Dam Square as his palace — now the Koninklijk Palace. But only four years later he fled the city after civil disturbances broke out when he raised taxes. When Napoleon's bubble burst and French power began to wane, William of Orange emerged from exile and was proclaimed king in 1813. Amsterdam had to work its way out of economic decline, but throughout the 19th century the city grew steadily. Industrialization changed the city. With the building of the Central Station at the end of the century, Amsterdam turned its back on its seafaring past and looked towards the mechanical age for its future. The station was built over the old harbor wall and some of the oldest canals in the city center were filled in to allow better access to motorized vehicles. Dam Square was landlocked for the first time in its history.

Process:  - Dead organic material accumulates on the bottom of oceans, riverbeds or swamps, mixing with mud and sand - Over time, more sediment piles on top - The resulting heat and pressure transforms the organic layer into a dark and waxy substance known as kerogen - Left alone, the kerogen molecules eventually crack - The molecules break up into shorter and lighter molecules composed almost solely of carbon and hydrogen atoms - It will turn into either petroleum or natural gas -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more sediments pile on top happens, how will it affect LESS oil.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that if more sediments pile on top of the organic material, it will have an effect on oil formation in at least two possible ways: 1. Increased pressure: With more sediments on top, the pressure applied to the organic layer increases. This higher pressure could potentially speed up the transformation of the organic material into kerogen, as well as the cracking of kerogen molecules. As a result, the overall oil formation process might become more efficient, leading to the generation of more oil in a shorter period of time. 2. Altered temperature conditions: The addition of more sediments on top of the organic layer might also lead to further insulation and trapping of heat, causing the temperature to rise. Depending on the rate of sediment accumulation and the specific conditions, this increased temperature could affect the transformation of kerogen into oil and natural gas. Higher temperatures could potentially lead to more efficient conversions or a preference for the formation of natural gas over petroleum, thereby indirectly affecting the quantity of oil generated. However, it is important to consider other factors that may also influence the formation of oil, such as the chemical composition of the organic material, the specific geological environment, and the time scale for sediment accumulation. Therefore, while the perturbation hypothesis suggests a possible effect on oil generation, a comprehensive understanding of the specific conditions and interactions will be necessary to predict the outcome with greater accuracy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By the turn of the 20th and 21st centuries, almost one-quarter of all printed material in Japan consisted of comics. Moreover, the translated versions of these comics became extremely popular in foreign markets, in some cases even equaling or surpassing the sales of domestic comics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Fuel mixes with air - Mix gets inducted into cylinder - Piston compresses the mix - Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion - Combustion gases expand - Pushes piston during power stroke - Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tail pipe.  Question: suppose the injectors are replaced in the engine happens, how will it affect an increase in the fuel levels in the engine.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Replacing the injectors in the engine can lead to an increase in fuel levels if the new injectors have a higher flow rate. The flow rate of a fuel injector is the amount of fuel it can deliver in a given time (measured in cc/min or lb/hr). If the new injectors have a higher flow rate than the original ones, more fuel will be introduced into the combustion chamber during each cycle. Regarding the second effect mentioned - the mix (of air and fuel) getting inducted into the cylinder - the introduction of more fuel may result in a richer air-fuel mixture. The ideal air-fuel mixture (also known as stoichiometric) for gasoline engines is about 14.7 parts air to 1 part fuel. If the mixture becomes richer (meaning more fuel is present), the combustion process can be affected, as an excess of fuel may not burn completely and efficiently. This can lead to a decrease in engine performance, increased fuel consumption, and possibly higher emissions.  It is essential to tune the engine with the new injectors to maintain the proper air-fuel mixture for optimal combustion and engine performance. Proper tuning would involve adjusting the engine's control unit (ECU) and possibly upgrading other components (such as fuel pump and pressure regulator) to achieve the desired performance. In summary, replacing the injectors with higher flow rate units can have a \\"more\\" effect on the induction of fuel mix into the cylinder, but proper tuning is needed to avoid negative outcomes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The final attempt by Sigismund and Władysław to gain the throne was a new campaign launched on 6 April 1617. Władysław was the nominal commander, but it was hetman Chodkiewicz who had actual control over the army. In October, the towns of Dorogobuzh  and Vyazma  surrendered quickly, recognizing Władysław as the tsar. However, the Commonwealth forces suffered defeats between Vyazma and Mozhaisk, and Chodkiewicz's plans for a counterattack and an advance to Moscow failed. Władysław did not have enough forces to advance to Moscow again, especially because the Russian support  for the Poles was all but gone by that time. In response to Władysław's invasion, the burghers of Smolensk revolted against Polish rule, and the Polish troops had to fight their way back as they retreated from the city. However, in 1617 Polish forces, besieged in Smolensk  by Russian forces, were relieved by Lisowczycy, when Russian forces retreated to Bely soon after receiving news that Lisowczycy, then commanded by Stanisław Czapiński, had appeared in the area. In 1618 Petro Sahaidachny's campaign against Muscovy resulted in sacking numerous forts such as Putivl, Kursk, Yelets, and others. Together with Chodkiewicz he laid siege to Moscow in September 1618.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kidd was born in San Francisco, and raised in an upper middle class section of Oakland. His father, Steve, was African-American, and his mother, Anne, is Irish-American. As a youth, Kidd was highly scouted for AAU teams and tourneys, garnering various all-star and MVP awards. He attended the East Oakland Youth Development Center and frequented the city courts of Oakland, where he often found himself pitted against future NBA Hall of Famer Gary Payton. Kidd was traded to the Phoenix Suns with Tony Dumas and Loren Meyer for Michael Finley, A. C. Green, and Sam Cassell during the 1996-97 season. In his first full season with the Suns in 1997-98, the team's win total improved by 16 games. The Suns, who finished the season with a 56-26 record, had been recognized for their fast-paced style of play with Kidd frequently leading a small lineup of four guards (Kidd, Kevin Johnson, Rex Chapman and Steve Nash) being on the floor at the same time together with Antonio McDyess playing at center.  In the 1998-99 season, Kidd averaged 10.8 assists per game to dethrone Washington's Rod Strickland as the league's assists leader. He also led the NBA with seven triple-doubles (the rest of the league had just 11) and was second in the NBA with 41.2 minutes per game (behind Allen Iverson's 41.5 mpg). Kidd averaged career highs in points (16.9 ppg), field goal percentage (.444), rebounds (6.8 rpg, best among NBA guards) and steals (2.28 spg, fourth in the NBA) and was the only player to be ranked among the top 50 in the NBA in 10 different statistical categories. The Suns won all seven of the games in which he had triple-doubles.  The Suns acquired Penny Hardaway from the Orlando Magic before the start of the 1999-00 season in hope of creating the best backcourt duo in the league. Combination of Kidd and Hardaway in the starting lineup was often labeled as the BackCourt 2000. Despite a decent 53-29 record, the Suns' season was spoiled by injuries to both of their superstars. Kidd, who broke his ankle late in the regular season, returned during the playoffs to help his team to beat the defending champion San Antonio Spurs and advance to the second round for the first time in his career.  The 2000-01 season was affected by Kidd's personal problems as he was charged with domestic abuse of his wife. The Suns, who struggled in the middle part of the season, finished strongly with a 15-6 record to secure another 50-win season. Kidd took on more of the offensive load after his teammates encouraged him to be more selfish. He recorded 30-plus points six times on the year and five times in the last 19 games. In one particular hot stretch, he scored 36, 32 and 31 in three consecutive games in mid-March, prior to which he had never recorded consecutive 30-point games.  During his stay in Phoenix, Kidd made the All-Star Game in 1998, 2000, and 2001 (in 1999 it was not held because of a lockout) and led the NBA in assists for three consecutive years (1999-2001). It was also with the Suns that Kidd rose to the status of the league's best playmaker as he was voted to the All-NBA First Team three years in a row (1999-2001). On June 28, 2001, after five seasons in Phoenix in which the team made the playoffs each year, he was traded, along with Chris Dudley, to the New Jersey Nets for Stephon Marbury, Johnny Newman, and Soumaila Samake. What relationship did Jason Kidd have to the Phoenix Suns?","output":"\\"In his first full season with the Suns in 1997-98, the team's win total improved by 16 games.\\" This quote shows that Jason Kidd had a relationship with the Phoenix Suns as a player on their basketball team, which contributed to the team's improved performance during his time there."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Math Problem Solve 4*m - 8*m = -12 for m.","output":"To solve the equation 4*m - 8*m = -12 for m, it's important to remember the order of operations, as well as the properties of equality. The order of operations refers to the sequence in which you perform mathematical operations (like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). The properties of equality are guidelines that tell you how to manipulate equations to keep them balanced. So, let's start solving the given problem. The equation is 4*m - 8*m = -12. First, you will want to simplify the equation on the left-hand side.  To simplify, combine like terms on the left side of the equation. Terms are considered like if they have the same variable and exponent. Here in this case, 4*m and 8*m are like terms. One has a coefficient of 4 and the other has a coefficient of 8. If you add or subtract like terms, you just add or subtract the coefficients and leave the variable exactly as it is. So to solve this, you would subtract the coefficients: 4*m - 8*m = (4 - 8)*m              = -4*m  So the equation now looks like: -4*m = -12 The next step would be to isolate the variable m. To do this, you should divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of m, which is -4. So: (-4*m) / -4 = -12 / -4  So your m turns out to be: m = -12/-4 m = 3 To check the solution, you can substitute the value of m back into the original equation: 4*3 - 8*3 = -12 12 - 24 = -12 -12 = -12 Since this is true, our answer m = 3 is correct."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information:  - The Soviet Union, officially the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR \\" ) was a socialist state in Eurasia that existed from 1922 to 1991. A union of multiple subnational republics, its government and economy were highly centralized. The Soviet Union was a one-party federation, governed by the Communist Party with Moscow as its capital.  - The Republics of the Soviet Union or the Union Republics (\\"soyuznye respubliki\\") of the Soviet Union were ethnically based administrative units that were subordinated directly to the Government of the Soviet Union. For most of its history, the Soviet Union was a highly centralized state; the decentralization reforms during the era of \\"Perestroika\\" (\\"Restructuring\\") and \\"Glasnost\\" (\\"Openness\\") conducted by Mikhail Gorbachev led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.  - Vladimir Yefimovich Semichastny ( Russian :    , January 15 , 1924 -- January 12 , 2001 ) was the head of the KGB from November 1961 to April 1967 and prior to that in 1958 -- 1959 he headed Komsomol as the first secretary of the Central Committee . Before he became head of the KGB he had no experience in the field of intelligence and counter-intelligence . His mentor and predecessor was Alexander Shelepin . In October 1963 , Semichastny sanctioned the arrest of Professor Frederick Barghoorn of Yale University when he was visiting Moscow . Semichastny hoped that by charging Barghoorn as a spy he could induce the United States to release Igor Ivanov , arrested by the Federal Bureau of Investigation that month for espionage . Barghoorn was a personal friend of President John F. Kennedy , who forcefully stated that Barghoorn was not involved in any illegal activities at a press conference . The Soviets subsequently released Barghoorn . Ivanov was allowed to leave the United States in 1971 . Subsequently , Semichastny participated in the ouster of Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in October 1964 , an act that undoubtedly led to his being retained by the new Soviet leadership . There are some indications that Leonid Brezhnev , who led the coup against Khrushchev , wanted to assassinate him , but Semichastny refused to allow KGB participation . During his tenure Semichasnty attempted to create a new public image of the KGB , permitting an article to appear in the newspaper Izvestia that included an article with \`\` a senior KGB officer '' ( himself ) ; in the article he stated \`\` many young Communist Party and Communist Youth League workers have joined the KGB and none of the people who , during the time of Joseph Stalin 's cult of personality took part in the repressions against innocent Soviet people is now in the Service .

Formed in 1954, as a direct successor of such preceding agencies as the Cheka, NKGB, and MGB, the committee was attached to the Council of Ministers. It was the chief government agency of \\"union-republican jurisdiction\\", acting as internal security, intelligence, and secret police. Similar agencies were constituted in each of the republics of the Soviet Union aside from Russia and consisted of many ministries, state committees, and state commissions.  - Alexander Nikolayevich Shelepin (18 August 1918  24 October 1994) was a Soviet state security officer and party statesman.

Furthermore, the premise is phrased as a question, asking for a list or range of actions the person has taken regarding items to hang on the wall. The question suggests that there might be multiple things the person has hung up on the wall, but it does not specifically mention putting up new photograph frames. Since we do not have enough information to verify whether the person has actually put up all of their new photograph frames, we must conclude that it's not possible to tell on the basis of the given premise. The phrase \\"what else have I done things to hang on the wall\\" merely prompts for additional activities undertaken regarding wall decorations - it does not directly address the completion of the photograph frame hanging action. Consequently, while it could be possible that the person has indeed put up all of their new photograph frames, it is also conceivable that these actions haven't taken place yet or they have installed some, excluding others.

Recent survey by the writers' rights group PEN found 85percent of American writers are increasingly fearful of government surveillance. Comes hot on heels of eight of the world's largest tech giants urging President Obama to rein in internet surveillance. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Renowned Writers Unite Against Unchecked Surveillance, Warning of an Erosion of Democracy Introduction: Prominent writers from across the globe have come together to voice their concerns about the implications of widespread surveillance, including the far-reaching NSA scandal, on the democratic process and individual freedoms. Calling for reform, these authors argue that unchecked surveillance poses a threat to a fundamental pillar of democracy – the inviolable integrity of the individual. Body: 1. The NSA Scandal The National Security Agency (NSA) has been at the center of controversy due to its surveillance programs, which were brought to light by whistleblower Edward Snowden in 2013. The programs have been accused of violating the privacy of millions of individuals worldwide. The ensuing revelations about the scope and extent of government surveillance have sparked debates about privacy, freedom, and state power in the digital age. 2. Writers Speak Out In response to the growing concerns, a group of influential writers has joined forces to condemn the surveillance state. These authors warn that pervasive snooping undermines the democratic process by eroding the \\"inviolable integrity of the individual.\\" They argue that once this trust between citizens and their government is broken, people become fearful and less likely to engage in open discourse. 3. PEN Survey: The Chilling Effect on Free Speech A recent survey conducted by the writers' rights group PEN found that 85 percent of American writers have become increasingly fearful of government surveillance. The same survey showed that writers are now self-censoring their work to avoid potential repercussions from the state, a phenomenon known as the \\"chilling effect.\\" The collective silencing of critical voices can lead to an erosion of democratic values, with free speech being a cornerstone of any thriving society. 4. Tech Giants Join the Call for Reform In addition to the writers' coalition, eight of the world's largest tech companies – including Apple, Google, and Facebook – have also urged President Barack Obama to rein in internet surveillance. These corporate giants argue that widespread surveillance threatens their businesses and the sovereignty of the open internet, a key driver of economic growth and innovation. Conclusion: As this global group of prominent writers raises alarm bells about the unchecked intrusion of surveillance into the lives of individuals, it remains essential for citizens and policymakers alike to engage in a reasoned debate about the appropriate balance between security and privacy. With democracy at stake, reining in the surveillance infrastructure may require both public support and political will, but doing so is necessary to preserve our freedoms and uphold the democratic values which form the bedrock of our societies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which entity is this text about? Harry Partch (June 24, 1901 - September 3, 1974) was an American composer, music theorist, and creator of musical instruments. He composed using scales of unequal intervals in just intonation, and was one of the first 20th-century composers in the West to work systematically with microtonal scales. He built custom-made instruments in these tunings on which to play his compositions, and described his theory and practice in his book Genesis of a Music (1947). Partch composed with scales dividing the octave into 43 unequal tones derived from the natural harmonic series; these scales allowed for more tones of smaller intervals than in standard Western tuning, which uses twelve equal intervals to the octave. Supported by Guggenheim and university grants, Partch took up residence at the University of Wisconsin from 1944 until 1947. This was a productive period, in which he lectured, trained an ensemble, staged performances, released his first recordings, and completed his book, now called Genesis of a Music. Genesis was completed in 1947 and published in 1949 by the University of Wisconsin Press. He left the university, as it never accepted him as a member of the permanent staff, and there was little space for his growing stock of instruments.  In 1949, pianist Gunnar Johansen allowed Partch to convert a smithy on his ranch to a studio. Partch worked there with support from the Guggenheim Foundation, and did recordings, primarily of his Eleven Intrusions (1949-1950). He was assisted for six months by composer Ben Johnston, who performed on Partch's recordings. In spring 1951, Partch moved to Oakland for health reasons, and prepared for a production of King Oedipus at Mills College, with the support of designer Arch Lauterer. Performances of King Oedipus in March were extensively reviewed, but a planned recording was blocked by the Yeats estate, which refused to grant permission to use Yeats's translation.  In February 1953, Partch founded the studio Gate 5 in an abandoned shipyard in Sausalito, California, where he composed, built instruments and staged performances. Subscriptions to raise money for recordings were organized by the Harry Partch Trust Fund, an organization put together by friends and supporters. The recordings were sold via mail order, as were later releases on the Gate 5 Records label. The money raised from these recordings became his main source of income. Partch's three Plectra and Percussion Dances, Ring Around the Moon (1949-1950), Castor and Pollux, and Even Wild Horses, premiered on Berkeley's KPFA radio in November 1953.  After completing The Bewitched in January 1955, Partch tried to find the means to put on a production of it. Ben Johnston introduced Danlee Mitchell to Partch at the University of Illinois; Mitchell later became Partch's heir. In March 1957, with the help of Johnston and the Fromm Foundation, The Bewitched was performed at the University of Illinois, and later at Washington University in St. Louis, though Partch was displeased with choreographer Alwin Nikolais's interpretation. Later in 1957, Partch provided the music for Madeline Tourtelot's film Windsong, the first of six film collaborations between the two. From 1959 to 1962, Partch received further appointments from the University of Illinois, and staged productions of Revelation in the Courthouse Park in 1961 and Water! Water! in 1962. Though these two works were based, as King Oedipus had been, on Greek mythology, they modernized the settings and incorporated elements of popular music. Partch had support from several departments and organizations at the university, but continuing hostility from the music department convinced him to leave and return to California.

He played college baseball at the University of Southern California and later played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball, principally as a second baseman (717 games) and shortstop (164 games), from 1966 to 1978. Can we draw the following conclusion? Gary Sudsy retired in 1978 and declined to renew his contract after his 13 season.","output":"Based on the information provided, Gary Lynn \\"Sudsy\\" Sutherland had a successful baseball career, playing in Major League Baseball for 13 seasons from 1966 to 1978. Primarily a second baseman and also a shortstop, Sudsy demonstrated his talent in these positions with a total of 717 and 164 games played, respectively. He played college baseball at the University of Southern California, further highlighting his strong background in the sport. The conclusion drawn from this information suggests that Gary Sudsy retired in 1978 and did not renew his contract after his 13th season. While it is accurate to state that he played his last season in 1978, the specific reason for his decision not to renew his contract remains unclear. Retirement from professional sports can be influenced by several factors such as age, health, performance, personal matters, and team dynamics, among others. Without more information on the circumstances surrounding Gary Sudsy's departure from the league, it would be speculative to assert that his retirement was solely due to his choice to decline a contract renewal. In summary, we can confirm that Gary \\"Sudsy\\" Sutherland played 13 seasons in Major League Baseball before his career ended in 1978. However, without further details, we cannot definitively conclude that a declined contract renewal was the primary reason for his decision to retire."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"No, Rio de Janeiro is not the capital of Brazil. The capital of Brazil is Brasília, which was officially inaugurated on April 21, 1960. Before being moved to Brasília, the capital of Brazil was indeed Rio de Janeiro, from 1763 to 1960. The city is located in the southeastern part of the country and is well-known for its beautiful beaches, carnival celebrations, and iconic landmarks, such as the Christ the Redeemer statue and Sugarloaf Mountain. Regarding the safety of Rio de Janeiro, it is important to understand that safety can vary greatly, depending on the area of the city and the activities one chooses to engage in. While Rio de Janeiro is generally safe for tourists, it also has some neighborhoods with high crime rates. Tourists should exercise caution, follow common-sense safety advice, and stay informed about the security situation in the places they visit. In general, popular tourist areas like Copacabana, Ipanema, and Leblon are considered relatively safe. There is a large police presence in these areas, which helps deter criminal activity. However, pickpocketing and theft can still occur, especially in crowded places and on public transportation. To minimize the risk of falling victim to petty crime, it is recommended to avoid displaying valuable items, such as smartphones and expensive cameras, and to be vigilant about the surroundings. On the other hand, some neighborhoods, particularly the favelas (informal settlements), are known to be less safe due to drug-related violence and other criminal activities. Favelas can be extremely dangerous, even for locals, and tourists are advised against visiting these areas without a trusted guide or as part of a reputable guided tour. In conclusion, Rio de Janeiro is a city with safety concerns that visitors should be aware of, but it can be safely enjoyed if travelers take appropriate precautions and stay informed about the current security situation. Regarding the question of whether these two questions are the same, the answer is no, they are not the same. The first question asks about the capital of Brazil, which relates to political geography and historical facts about the country. The second question inquires about the safety of Rio de Janeiro, which is a topic related to travel, crime rates, and personal safety. While both questions do pertain to Rio de Janeiro, they address different aspects of the city and cannot be considered the same question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: The men are golfing. .Choose the correct answer: Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis? Pick your answer from: a. yes b. it is not possible to tell c. no","output":"a. yes Explanation: The given premise states that there are four men playing golf on the putting green of a hole on a sunny day. This information reveals that they are engaged in the activity of golfing. A putting green is a part of a golf course, and playing golf typically includes hitting the golf ball towards the hole, using different clubs, calculating distances, and strategically navigating the terrain.  In this scenario, directly stating that the four men are golfing is a reasonable hypothesis. The premise clearly indicates that they are participating in the sport, and the fact that they are on a putting green confirms that they are actively involved in a component of the game, hence this hypothesis is accepted. Moreover, the description in the premise does not contradict the hypothesis and provides relevant context to establish the fact that the men are indeed golfing. The weather being sunny further supports the notion that they are outdoors and participating in an open-air activity, which is one characteristic of golfing.

Kintaro Hayakawa (June 10, 1889 - November 23, 1973), known professionally as Sessue Hayakawa, was a Japanese actor. He was one of the biggest stars in Hollywood during the silent film era of the 1910s and 1920s. Hayakawa was the first actor of Asian descent to achieve stardom as a leading man in the United States and Europe. His \\"broodingly handsome\\" good looks and typecasting as a sexually dominant villain made him a heartthrob among American women during a time of racial discrimination, and he became one of the first male sex symbols of Hollywood. Hayakawa was born Kintaro Hayakawa (Zao Chuan  Jin Tai Lang , Hayakawa Kintaro) in the village of Nanaura, now part of a town called Chikura, in the city of Minamiboso in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, on June 10, 1889.  From an early age, Hayakawa's family intended him to become an officer in the Imperial Japanese Navy. However, while a student at the naval academy in Etajima, he swam to the bottom of a lagoon (he grew up in a shellfish diving community) on a dare and ruptured his eardrum. The injury caused him to fail the navy physical. His father felt shame and embarrassment by his son's failure and this drove a wedge between them. The strained relationship drove the 18-year-old Hayakawa to attempt seppuku (ritual suicide). One evening, Hayakawa entered a shed on his parents' property and prepared the venue. He put his dog outside and attempted to uphold his family's samurai tradition by stabbing himself more than 30 times in the abdomen. The barking dog brought Hayakawa's parents to the scene and his father used an axe to break down the door, saving his life.  After he recovered from the suicide attempt, Hayakawa began to study political economics at the University of Chicago to fulfill his family's new wish that he become a banker. While a student, he played quarterback for the football team and was once penalized for using jujitsu to bring down an opponent.  Hayakawa graduated from the University of Chicago in 1912, and subsequently made plans to return to Japan. He traveled to Los Angeles and awaited a transpacific steamship. During his stay, he discovered the Japanese Theatre in Little Tokyo and became fascinated with acting and performing plays. It was around this time that Hayakawa first assumed the stage name Sessue (Xue Zhou , Sesshu), meaning \\"snowy field\\" (Xue  means \\"snow\\" and Zhou  means \\"north field\\"). One of the productions in which Hayakawa performed was called The Typhoon. Tsuru Aoki, a member of the acting troupe, was so impressed with Hayakawa's abilities and enthusiasm that she enticed film producer Thomas H. Ince to see the play. Ince saw the production and offered to turn it into a silent film with the original cast. Anxious to return to Japan, Hayakawa tried to dissuade Ince by requesting the then-astronomic fee of 500 a week, but Ince agreed to his request.  The Typhoon (1914) became an instant hit and was followed by two additional pictures produced by Ince, The Wrath of the Gods (1914) co-starring Hayakawa's new wife, Aoki, and The Sacrifice (1914). With Hayakawa's rising stardom, Jesse L. Lasky soon offered Hayakawa a contract, which he accepted, making him part of Famous Players-Lasky (now Paramount Pictures). When did he start his acting career?","output":"Sessue Hayakawa started his acting career around 1914 when he performed in a play called The Typhoon. After impressing film producer Thomas H.

A school sent a teenage girl into isolation because she dyed her hair red. Natalya Page, 14, was and told she could not attend lessons at Kenton Academy, in Kenton, Newcastle, until she had her hair dyed back to a natural colour. Teachers told her she would need to sit on her own with her form teacher, away from the rest of the class. They contacted the pupil's father asking for his permission to recolour his daughter's hair in the school salon. But Fred Page, 44, refused and accused the school of overreacting. Mr Page, a taxi driver, said: 'It’s ridiculous - she’s dyed her hair, not her brain. 'I do understand they have got to look after the image of the school, but how can it affect her education? 'How can they teach them to be different if they are going to put them down for the simplest of things? I just feel as though she is being persecuted.' Miss Page claims that she dyed her hair weeks ago, and that teachers have only just noticed the change. Principal David Pearmain said:. 'Natalya came to school last week with her hair dyed a colour which she. was well aware was against school uniform regulations. 'She was offered the opportunity to dye it back to a more natural colour but refused to do so,' he said. 'She. was also offered the option from our fully qualified and experienced. hair and beauty staff in our own well equipped salon. She and her family. refused this also. 'Therefore. she is being educated in isolation from other students until the issue. is resolved. She is present in school today and has not been excluded at. any time.

Kenton Academy announced plans earlier this week to charge parents if. their children missed lessons. Now,. if a pupil falling into a 'causing concern' category has at least 2.5. days unauthorised absences, the school will issue a fixed penalty notice. - similar to a parking fine for motorists - to the child’s parents.

Please answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump is not expected to meet the leaders of Cuba and Venezuela when he attends the Summit of the Americas next week, according to White House officials. However, there will still be opportunities for interactions between Trump and his Latin and North American counterparts at the two-day summit that begins April 13 in Lima, Peru. The gathering takes place as Trump finalizes plans to send the military to the U.S. border with Mexico and threatens to withdraw from the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. In addition, Trump's recently imposed steel and aluminum tariffs have sparked criticism from many of the attendees at the summit, though some countries have received temporary exemptions. Despite all the turbulence, White House officials outlined a fairly traditional agenda for the summit. \\"A win for this president at this summit will be a strong speech focused on regional governance, leadership on Venezuela and promoting reciprocal trade,\\" a senior administration official said. The official would not say whether Trump will continue to \\"speak his mind\\" during the summit on sensitive issues such as immigration. Trump has repeatedly portrayed immigration from South and Central America as both a national security and economic threat. During his presidential campaign, Trump accused Mexico of sending rapists, drug dealers and criminals across the border. Trump has also clashed with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto over the funding of a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico. The president has long insisted that Mexico will pay for the wall. The disagreement become so heated earlier this year that Pena Nieto canceled plans to visit the White House. It is not clear whether Trump will hold a one-on-one meeting with Pena Nieto during the summit, U.S. officials said.  But Trump will not meet with Cuban leader Raul Castro or anyone from the Venezuelan delegation, White House officials said. \\"Obviously the Cubans will be participating in the summit, so there will be a mixing of regional...

If \\"There is a girl wearing an American flag hat standing in a field.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A girl is standing in a field.\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that \\"A girl is standing in a field\\" when given the statement \\"There is a girl wearing an American flag hat standing in a field.\\" Let's break down the process of deducing this conclusion. The initial statement provides us with three key pieces of information: 1. The presence of a girl 2. The girl is wearing an American flag hat 3. The girl is standing in a field From this information, we can deduce certain logical conclusions based on each individual piece of information and their combinations. First and foremost, the presence of a girl is explicitly mentioned in the given statement. This confirms that there is indeed a girl involved in the scenario. Next, we are told that the girl is wearing an American flag hat. While this is a more specific detail about the girl's attire, it still reaffirms the presence of the girl in the given situation. Lastly, and most importantly, the statement mentions that the girl is standing in a field. This directly establishes the location of the girl and serves as the basis for our logical inference. Putting all these pieces of information together, we can confidently deduce that \\"A girl is standing in a field.\\" This is because the initial statement establishes the presence of a girl and also specifies that this girl is standing in a field. In this example, the fact that the girl is wearing an American flag hat does not impact the logical conclusion that a girl is standing in a field. It serves as a specific detail about the girl's attire, but it does not alter the fundamental information that a girl is present and she is standing in a field. In summary, given the statement \\"There is a girl wearing an American flag hat standing in a field,\\" it does logically follow that \\"A girl is standing in a field.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

William Calley Jr. Lt. Calley was implicated in a pivotal incident which marked a significant moment in United States military history: the My Lai Massacre. The My Lai Massacre took place during the Vietnam War on March 16, 1968. A group of American soldiers, under the command of Lt. Calley, murdered as many as 500 unarmed Vietnamese civilians in the village of My Lai. The victims of this horrific incident were predominantly women, children, and elderly people. The incident sparked significant outrage, both domestically and internationally, following its exposure. Lt. William Calley Jr. was the only officer held criminally accountable for the roles played in the massacre. His court martial became one of the most infamous military trials of the 20th century, not just because of the shocking nature of the crime itself, but also due to the widespread attention it received. As Calley's defense lawyer, George Webster Latimer faced one of the most challenging cases of his career. He had to defend Calley against charges which were not just severe legal complexities, but which carried with them enormous socio-political implications. By the end of the trial, Lt. Calley was found guilty of killing 22 Vietnamese civilians and was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, his sentence was later reduced to 20 years on appeal, and he was eventually paroled after serving just three and a half years under house arrest. This trial is still frequently referenced in both legal and military education as a key case study of war crimes and their judicial processing. Latimer's representation of Lt. Calley thus holds a seminal place in the history of United States military law, marking a cornerstone of his professional accolades as a lawyer from Utah.

Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  She doe not torture Bond.  for the following movie plot:  In Bilbao, Spain, MI6 agent, James Bond, meets with a Swiss banker to recover a large sum of money. The banker, however, plans to have James killed. James uses a flash grenade disguised as his sidearm to create a diversion and ends up holding the banker at gun-point. The banker had taken the money from another \\"00\\" and is about to tell Bond who the agent's assassin is when he himself is killed by a thrown knife from his secretary, the Cigar-Smoking Woman. Bond grabs the case of money and is about to escape when another man tries to shoot him; that man is hit by an unseen sniper. Bond escapes out the window.At MI6 headquarters in London, Bond returns the money to a wealthy man named Robert King. King and Bond's boss, M, are both present in M's office when Bond arrives. Bond learns from them both that King is building an oil pipeline through the Caucasus region and that the project has been threatened with destruction from several factions. King leaves and M gives Bond a glass of bourbon with ice. When the ice begins to bubble, Bond deduces that the money, which he'd handled, may itself be dangerous. In a nearby lab, the metallic security strip in one of the bills bursts into flame and the money explodes, killing King and blowing a large hole in the outer wall of MI6 HQ. Bond looks out through the hole and sees a woman on a boat who tries to shoot him with an automatic rifle. Bond takes a small, experimental, jet-powered boat belonging to Q and races after the woman, chasing her down the Thames. She tries several times to evade him but Bond catches up with her, finally destroying her boat near the Millennium Dome with a torpedo. The woman steals a hot-air balloon and floats upward, with Bond hanging on to one of the anchor ropes. The woman, the Cigar Smoking Woman who killed the Swiss banker, points her own pistol at the gas tanks on the balloon. Bond pleads with her not to kill them both, saying MI6 will protect her. She says no one can protect her from \\"him\\". She shoots the tanks and the balloon explodes,...

At the age of seventeen Lancaster passed his final school examinations and gained entrance to Lincoln College, Oxford, to study history. He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of life classes at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the \\"hearties\\" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the \\"aesthetes\\" had a largely homosexual membership. Lancaster followed his elder contemporary Kenneth Clark in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set. He cultivated the image of an Edwardian dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly. He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don Maurice Bowra; Lancaster's friend James Lees-Milne commented, \\"Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip.\\" Lancaster's undergraduate set included Stephen Spender, Randolph Churchill, and most importantly John Betjeman, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.Lancaster tried rowing with the Oxford University Boat Club, but quickly discovered that he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school. He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), acted in supporting roles, designed programme covers, wrote, and choreographed. He contributed prose and drawings to Isis and Cherwell magazines, engaged in student pranks, staged an exhibition of his pictures, attended life classes, and became established as a major figure in the Oxonian social scene.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What is the growing root tip protected by?    Choices:  - root flap  - tip cap  - root hinge  - root cap  A: Answer:","output":"The growing root tip is protected by the root cap.  The root cap is a unique, specialized structure found at the tip of the growing roots in plants. It has a crucial role in assisting the roots as they grow and navigate through the soil. The primary function of the root cap is to safeguard the delicate tissues referred to as the apical meristem, which is responsible for the root's growth and development. The root cap is composed of parenchyma cells, which are relatively unspecialized plant cells that make up the majority of the cap's mass. These cells are frequently replaced due to the constant cell division in the root's apical meristem, as well as the inevitable wear and tear the root cap experiences while being pushed through the soil. Additionally, the root cap plays an essential role in detecting and responding to gravity. This ability, known as gravitropism or geotropism, helps the plant to grow its roots downwards into the soil, providing the necessary anchorage, water, and nutrient uptake for the plant's survival. In the root cap, specialized cells called statocytes contain dense, starch-filled plastids called statoliths. When the plant's orientation changes, the statoliths' movement within the statocytes influences plant hormone distribution, guiding the root's growth direction by regulating cell elongation. Apart from gravitropism, the root cap also helps in the secretion of mucilage, a slimy substance that lubricates the root's surface, thereby facilitating smoother penetration through the soil. Mucilage offers additional advantages in improving water absorption, reducing desiccation, and facilitating the formation of beneficial microbe associations, such as with nitrogen-fixing bacteria or mycorrhizal fungi. In summary, the growing root tip in plants is protected by the root cap, which offers several vital benefits including shielding the apical meristem, guiding root growth through gravitropism, and lubricating the root surface for enhanced resource acquisition."},{"instruction":"Greg was studying behavior of different organisms.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The dynamics of a sister-in-law (S-I-L) are complex at the best of times but no more so if she has spent much of her life causing her immediate family to run to her beck and call. The drama queen thrives off drama and having everyone pay attention to her as a result.  Sit back at your next family occasion and simply watch. Notice how she interacts with her family members, and how they in turn react back. If you witness a lot of step-toeing around her and acquiescing to her, she is clearly used to getting her own way. Consider what happens when she raises a drama-filled topic. Do other family members rush to agree with her about how \\"outrageous\\" the price of child care/electricity/shampoo/dog grooming/car maintenance/etc. is? Do they confirm her quibbles as quickly as possible, thereby engendering even more complaints? This shows that they enable her complaint-filled view of the world and sadly, have long been used to pandering to it. You can't change them but you can set a new role model by not complaining yourself. Notice what happens when you disagree with her. Does she pout, throw an adult-style tantrum or try and put you down? While it's important to stand your ground on things that matter to you, if she does react childishly, you'll need to learn how to manage this carefully.

Question: Who does Hitman Joe hire as his go-between in Bangkok? Movie title: Bangkok Dangerous Movie plot: Joe (Cage) is a professional freelance contract killer. He works strictly by the rules; He never socializes outside his work, he stays secluded in quiet spots, never meets his handlers and always leaves on time, leaving without a trace. He usually hires young pickpockets or small-time criminals as his local help, whom he usually murders after the end of the job to prevent any identification. He uses multiple aliases and also has middlemen between him and his handlers. He also carries a watch to perform a hit in specific time and correctly visualizes his every target. After completing a hit in Prague and killing his current help, Joe travels to Bangkok for an assignment to assassinate four people for notorious Bangkok crime boss Surat, whom he never meets. Joe occasionally provides insight via voiceover narration throughout the film. He hires a local pickpocket with simple English knowledge, Kong, as his go-between in Bangkok, a condition of the contract being that the gang will never meet Joe. Contracts from the Bangkok gangsters are passed to Kong one by one via a nightclub dancer, Aom. Joe's first execution in Bangkok is done on motorcycle; when the target car stops at a red light, Joe kills all the passengers with a machine pistol. Kong retrieves information about the second target, again via Aom, and the pair become friendlier with every contact. Before Joe executes his mission, Kong informs him of the target, Pramod Juntasa, another notorious gang lord and Surat's rival crime boss who acts as sex trafficker, buying young girls from impoverished parents and selling them after sex deals. Joe sneaks into the target's penthouse and drowns him in his pool. Unsatisfied with Kong's assistance, Joe contemplates killing him, but after a brief confrontation when Kong is ambushed by local gangsters regarding a briefcase containing information files of Surat's/Joe's targets, he instead decides to act as Kong's mentor and trains him for self-defense. Midway through the movie, Joe meets Fon, a deaf-mute pharmacist,... The answer to this question is:","output":"Joe hires a local pickpocket with simple English knowledge, Kong, as his go-between in Bangkok."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A partygoer bit a stranger on the face as she danced in a cage in a night club after drinking to celebrate her birthday, a court has heard. Katie Bateman turned on the man in the club because she is suffering from a stress disorder as a result of traumatic events in her childhood, it was said. She admitted attacking a fellow customer at Caesar's Palace club in Bideford, Devon, and grabbing a second by his T-shirt in a confrontation at the bar. Confrontation: Katie Bateman turned on the man at Caesar's Palace club in Bideford, Devon. Bateman, 27, had been celebrating her birthday in August last year when she carried out the attack while suffering from anxiety which made her 'hyper vigilant' about approaches from men. A psychologist's report showed she suffers from post traumatic stress disorder which makes her prone to panic attacks and depression. She was forced to leave a hearing at Exeter Crown Court when she became distressed as the Judge was told of the evidence against her. Bateman, of Bideford, Devon, admitted causing actual bodily harm to Aaron McMahon and assault by beating of Richard Ball. Her sentence was adjourned for reports by Judge Erik Salomonsen. The Judge told her she would not face an immediate jail sentence. He said: 'I have seen the letter from her doctor and the psychological report and it seems to me a case where she needs to be treated in the community to ensure there is no further offending.' The judge made his ruling after being told that CCTV from the club showed the incident in which the first victim suffered a small graze and bruising to his face after she leaned over and bit him on the cheek. The second was grabbed by the shirt in a second incident shortly afterwards. Kate Bateman was forced to leave a hearing at Exeter Crown Court when she became distressed as the Judge was told of the evidence against her. She had been drinking, taking drugs and dancing in a cage shortly before the attacks and later said she had little memory of what happened. Miss Beth Heaton, defending, said Bateman was out celebrating her birthday with family and friends.She said: 'She suffers from PTSD among other conditions and that may be relevant to these offences in that she may have believed she was going to be assaulted. 'She reacted in a hyper vigilant way to what she perceived as threats from males. When she was shown the CCTV she became very anxious and had a panic attack. 'She reacted very differently from someone who was not suffering from her condition. She has been suffering for some time, having been diagnosed in 2007.' Miss Heaton said the attacks in August last year coincided with the start of a new treatment regime which is proving successful.","output":"A court hearing at Exeter Crown Court has unveiled a case in which Katie Bateman, a 27-year-old woman suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression, attacked a fellow customer at Caesar's Palace club in Bideford, Devon.

A psychologist's report confirmed her condition, which makes her prone to panic attacks and depression stemming from traumatic events in her childhood.

Beth Heaton, defending Bateman, noted that her client suffers from PTSD, among other conditions, and argued that Bateman's mental health issues may have played a significant role in her violent outburst. Heaton explained that Bateman reacted in a hypervigilant way to what she perceived as threats, which elicited a panic attack when she saw the nightclub's CCTV footage of the incident. Bateman admitted to causing actual bodily harm to Aaron McMahon and assault by beating Richard Ball but was told she would not face an immediate jail sentence.

He has seven overbearing sisters who ridicule and emotionally abuse him regularly and leads a very lonely life punctuated by fits of rage and anguish. In the span of one morning, he witnesses a bizarre car accident, picks up an abandoned harmonium from the street, and encounters Lena Leonard (Emily Watson), a co-worker of his sister, Lena having orchestrated this meeting after seeing him in a family picture belonging to his sister Elizabeth (Mary Lynn Rajskub).Coping with his loneliness, Barry calls a phone sex hotline, but the female operator attempts to extort money and sends her four henchmen, who are brothers, to collect. This complicates his budding relationship with Lena, as well as his plan to exploit a loophole in a Healthy Choice promotion and amass a million frequent flyer miles by buying large quantities of pudding (based on the true story of David Phillips). After Lena leaves for Hawaii on a business trip, Barry decides to follow her. He arrives and calls one of his manipulative sisters to learn where Lena is staying. When his sister tries manipulating him again, Barry snaps and demands she give him the information, which she does. Lena is unexpectedly overjoyed to see Barry, and they have a pillow talk scene.

As Philip marched south, his opponents blocked him near Chaeronea, Boeotia. During the ensuing Battle of Chaeronea, Philip commanded the right wing and Alexander the left, accompanied by a group of Philip's trusted generals. According to the ancient sources, the two sides fought bitterly for some time. Philip deliberately commanded his troops to retreat, counting on the untested Athenian hoplites to follow, thus breaking their line. Alexander was the first to break the Theban lines, followed by Philip's generals. Having damaged the enemy's cohesion, Philip ordered his troops to press forward and quickly routed them. With the Athenians lost, the Thebans were surrounded. Left to fight alone, they were defeated. After the victory at Chaeronea, Philip and Alexander marched unopposed into the Peloponnese, welcomed by all cities; however, when they reached Sparta, they were refused, but did not resort to war. At Corinth, Philip established a \\"Hellenic Alliance\\" (modeled on the old anti-Persian alliance of the Greco-Persian Wars), which included most Greek city-states except Sparta. Philip was then named Hegemon (often translated as \\"Supreme Commander\\") of this league (known by modern scholars as the League of Corinth), and announced his plans to attack the Persian Empire.

Step 3: Wrap the Wires Now, it's time to connect the transformer and diodes with wires. Wrap a wire around the left side of the diamond (the diodes) and another one around the right side. Make sure they're secure and in place. Step 4: Check with a Multimeter Finally, let's see if our circuit works!

Summarize the following: If your mother-in-law has always been critical, demanding, or argumentative, you may need to simply work out a strategy to minimize the behavior and cope with it. If this is a new behavior and it is directed only at you, there is likely an underlying problem that must be addressed. Talk to your spouse to get a better understanding of your mother-in-law. If you’re nervous about broaching the subject, say something like, “I’d like to talk about the way your mother has been acting, but I don’t want to fight. I just want to discuss the issue to see if we can find a solution.” Presenting a united front with your spouse will send the message to your mother-in-law that her behavior is unacceptable. If your spouse confronts the problem first, it will signal that you both acknowledge the issue. Ask your partner to talk to her privately to see if they can uncover the root of the problem. If your spouse is uncomfortable getting in the middle of things, ask them to at least stand up for you when she crosses a line.  Ask your spouse to report back to you after they have a private conversation with their mother. They may have some important information about what the root of the problem is. Tell your spouse, “I really think that you’ll have an easier time talking to her than I will. If you talk to her first and figure out why she’s not acting fairly, it will make it easier for me to sit down with her.” Don’t get ahead of yourself and start talking or arguing with your mother-in-law without consulting your spouse first. If you cross a line or engage in an argument without agreeing on a coping strategy, you may end up offending your spouse. Decide on whether you want to confront, deflect, or avoid the problem together to give yourself the highest chance of succeeding. Even if you want to deal with the problem by talking to your mother-in-law privately, you should still consult your partner first.

For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences.

Question: A lake (from Latin lacus) is a terrain feature (or physical feature), a body of liquid on the surface of a world that is localized to the bottom of basin (another type of landform or terrain feature; that is, it is not global) and moves slowly if it moves at all. On Earth, a body of water is considered a lake when it is inland, not part of the ocean, is larger and deeper than a pond, and is fed by a river. The only world other than Earth known to harbor lakes is Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has lakes of ethane, most likely mixed with methane. It is not known if Titan's lakes are fed by rivers, though Titan's surface is carved by numerous river beds. Natural lakes on Earth are generally found in mountainous areas, rift zones, and areas with ongoing or recent glaciation. Other lakes are found in endorheic basins or along the courses of mature rivers. In some parts of the world, there are many lakes because of chaotic drainage patterns left over from the last Ice Age. All lakes are temporary over geologic time scales, as they will slowly fill in with sediments or spill out of the basin containing them.  John wanted to know what makes a lake different from a pond. To that end, he first visited a lake. He labeled that part of the study as case A. Then he visited a pond. He labeled that part of the study as case B. John realized that though both of them were water-bodies, they were very different.  Would case B water-body be smaller or larger than case A?

Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiou (Greek: Euaggelos Odusseas Papathanasiou, IPA: [ev'anjelos odi'seas papathana'siu] (born 29 March 1943), best known professionally as Vangelis (), is a Greek composer of electronic, progressive, ambient, jazz, and orchestral music. He is best known for his Academy Award-winning score for the film Chariots of Fire, composing scores for the films Blade Runner, Missing, Antarctica, 1492: Conquest of Paradise, and Alexander, and the use of his music in the PBS documentary Cosmos: For an artist of his stature, very little is known about Vangelis' personal life and he rarely gives official interviews to journalists. However, in a 2005 interview with The Daily Telegraph, Vangelis talked openly about various parts of his life. He stated in the interview that he was \\"never interested\\" in the \\"decadent lifestyle\\" of his band days, choosing not to use alcohol or other drugs. At the time of the Telegraph interview, Vangelis was involved in his third long-term relationship. When asked why he had not had children, Vangelis replied:  ...Because of the amount of travelling I do and the nonsense of the music business, I couldn't take care of a child in the way I think it should be taken care of.  It is not publicly known where Vangelis generally resides; he has stated that he \\"travels around\\", rather than settling down in one specific place or country for long periods of time. As a hobby, Vangelis enjoys painting; his first art exhibition of 70 paintings was held at Almudin in Valencia, Spain in 2003 and then toured South America until the end of 2004.  Excerpts from other interviews mention that Vangelis has been married twice before. In a 1976 interview with Dutch music magazine Oor, the author wrote that Vangelis had a wife named Veronique Skawinska, a photographer who had done some album art work for Vangelis. An interview in 1982 with Backstage music magazine suggests that Vangelis had previously been married to a singer named Vana Verouti, who had performed vocals on some of his records, performing for the first time with him on La Fete sauvage and later on Heaven and Hell.

Q:SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

Are the following two questions the same? When is the right time to drink lime water, after the workout or before the workout? Is it right to take bath just after your workout? Available choices: (1). no; (2). yes; The answer is:","output":"(1). no; The two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of workout routines and their potential effects on the body. The first question asks whether it is better to drink lime water before or after a workout. Lime water refers to water with added lemon or lime juice, which provides benefits such as vitamin C, improved digestion, and increased hydration. To answer the question, it is generally better to consume lime water both before and after a workout. Drinking it before a workout can help to hydrate the body, increase energy levels, and provide essential nutrients that may be used during physical activities. On the other hand, consuming lime water after exercising can help replace fluids and electrolytes lost through sweating and support muscle recovery. The second question inquires whether it is appropriate to take a bath immediately after working out. This question is more about post-workout hygiene and recovery practices. Bathing right after a workout can help to cleanse the skin from sweat, dirt, and bacteria that may have accumulated during physical activity. It also helps to relax the muscles and alleviate any soreness or stiffness. However, it is essential to allow the body to cool down for a few minutes before hopping into the shower, as the heart rate and body temperature should stabilize before immersing in water. During this cooldown period, it is recommended to do some light stretching and focus on controlled breathing. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same because they address different aspects of workout routines. The first question is about proper hydration and nutrient intake, while the second question deals with post-workout hygiene and recovery practices. Each question acknowledges essential elements for maintaining optimal health during and after exercise, ensuring that the individual is both fueled and clean for daily activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Swab your ears with a cotton swab and alcohol and apply antibiotic ointment. Article:","output":"Title: The Importance of Proper Earring Care: Keeping Your Ears Healthy and Fashionable Introduction Earrings are a beautiful and versatile accessory that can elevate any outfit. They come in various shapes, sizes, and precious materials, allowing people to express their personalities and style. However, not everyone knows how to maintain proper earring hygiene, which can lead to infections and various ear health problems. In this article, we will outline the importance of removing your earrings every night, cleaning them with rubbing alcohol, and swabbing your ears with a cotton swab before applying an antibiotic ointment. Why Take Your Earrings Out Every Night? Removing your earrings before going to bed is not only a great way to maintain your jewelry but also essential in promoting ear health. Wearing earrings continuously can cause significant strain on the earlobes, leading to swelling and discomfort. Moreover, sleeping with earrings can lead to tearing, particularly if they get caught on fabric or accidentally pulled during the night. Taking your earrings out at night also allows your earlobes time to breathe, reducing the chances of infection. Moreover, it prevents dirt and bacteria buildup, which may occur when earrings are worn for prolonged periods. How to Clean Your Earrings With Rubbing Alcohol Cleaning your earrings with rubbing alcohol is an excellent practice to prevent the transfer of bacteria from your jewelry to your skin. To clean your earrings properly, follow these simple steps: 1. Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol into a clean, shallow dish or bowl. 2. Remove your earrings and carefully immerse them in the alcohol solution. Ensure that all parts of the earrings, including the posts, are submerged. 3. Let the earrings sit in the rubbing alcohol for at least 30 seconds. You can leave them in for a minute or two if they are significantly dirty. 4. Carefully remove the earrings from the solution and use a clean, soft cloth to dry them thoroughly. 5. Store your earrings safely in a jewelry box or container, preferably lined with soft fabric, to protect them from getting scratched or damaged. Swabbing Your Ears with a Cotton Swab and Alcohol Cleaning your ears with a cotton swab and alcohol can significantly decrease the chance of infection. It removes any accumulated dirt and bacteria around the piercing area, ensuring a clean surface for your earrings. To swab your ears properly, follow these steps: 1. Soak a clean cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and gently remove any excess liquid by pressing the swab against a bowl's edge. 2. Carefully clean the area around the earring hole by rubbing the cotton swab in a circular motion. Avoid pushing the swab too deep into your ear as it may damage the ear canal. 3. Once you have cleaned both ears, discard the cotton swab. 4. Allow your ears to air dry for a couple of minutes before replacing your earrings. The Benefits of Applying Antibiotic Ointment Applying an antibiotic ointment after cleaning your ears is an effective way to reduce the risk of infection. The ointment creates a barrier that protects the earlobe from bacteria while also providing a nurturing environment for the healing process. To apply the antibiotic ointment: 1. Squeeze out a small amount of the ointment onto a clean fingertip or cotton swab. 2. Gently apply the ointment directly onto the earring hole, spreading it evenly around the area. 3. Replace the earrings once the ointment has been absorbed into the skin. Conclusion Proper earring care is essential, particularly for freshly pierced ears or individuals with sensitive skin. By removing your earrings before bed, cleaning them and your ears with rubbing alcohol, and applying an antibiotic ointment, you can maintain both your jewelry's aesthetic appeal and your ear health. Following these simple steps will ensure you can keep rocking those gorgeous accessories without worrying about infection or discomfort."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generally, in order to file a lawsuit, a person must be over 18 years of age and in good mental health.  If you are under 18, you will need a guardian to participate in the lawsuit. If you are judged to be mentally incompetent because of age, disability or illness, you will need a guardian, trustee or executor to participate in a lawsuit. The requirements for standing are established by each state. Generally, to sue in state court a person must have been injured, or will be directly injured or harmed. There must also be a way to redress or compensate for the injury. For example, if a person or entity caused you physical harm, didn't hold up their end of a contract, or didn't pay you what you were owed then you may have legal standing to sue. The court in which you file must have subject matter jurisdiction, or the legal jurisdiction to hear the type of case you are filing. Most cases will be filed in the state where you live. Federal courts hear specific types of cases, including the following:  Cases that arise under federal law, such as those concerning federal civil rights statutes, patent laws, antitrust laws, federal tax claims, or constitutional issues.  Cases in which the plaintiff is suing a defendant who is a citizen of a different state or country for an amount over 75,000.  If you are unsure whether to file in state or federal court, or which state to file the suit in, talk to an attorney. Venue refers to the county or judicial district within a state where the lawsuit must be filed. Sometimes, multiple courts meet the venue requirements for a case. These requirements are:  The court is located in the county in which the defendant resides or does business. The court is located in the county in which the harmful actions occurred. The court is located in the county in which a violated contract was signed or was to be carried out. In cases in which multiple venues are appropriate, choose the one that is most convenient to both you and the defendant, or talk with your attorney about which one they think would be best. Every state has a time period by which a person must file a lawsuit. This is referred to as the statute of limitations. Different types of case have different statute of limitations. For example, in Alabama you have two years from the date of injury to file a lawsuit for personal injury but six years to file a case regarding property damage. For a list of state specific statutes of limitation visit: http://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/statute-of-limitations-state-laws-chart-29941.html.

A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a 500 bond is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety. Along the way, they encountered a dying Chinese woman, and Ruth agreed to care for her child as well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 'Selma' Cast Wear 'I Can't Breathe' Shirts to New York Premiere The cast and crew of Selma — a film about Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights marches in Selma, Alabama — wore “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts before the New York City premiere of their film on Sunday night to protest the death of Eric Garner. Golden Globe-nominated director Ava DuVernay stood on the steps of the New York Public Library in the “Hands up, don’t shoot” pose with cast members including star David Oyelowo. The red carpet statement came one day after an estimated 25,000 people gathered in New York at the Millions March to protest the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, unarmed black men who were both killed by white police officers this year. In video footage of Garner’s death, he repeats “I can’t breathe” while in a chokehold. At the premiere, Oyelowo drew comparisons between the Selma march and the current protests. “Thankfully, we’re seeing a lot of the same good sides of protests happening with these protests — i.e., that they are nonviolent, and that we are now seeing black and white and everything in between coming together against injustice,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “I think that the next step for us to be able to really articulate our demands. What is it we want out of this? In Selma, it was voting rights, and now it’s police reform.” “The lesson of the movie is strategy,” added Oprah Winfrey, who both starred in and produced the film. “Strategic planning, rigorous discipline, peaceful protest, and knowing what you want.” MORE: Selma and the Dream Worker Selma actor Wendell Pierce, best known for his role on The Wire, took his protest a step further. He spent four hours at the Millions March on Saturday before walking the red carpet for the film in his “I Can’t Breathe” shirt. His Wire co-star Michael Kenneth Williams, who is currently promoting The Gambler, also donned the shirt on the red carpet. Though the Selma actors are the first celebrities to wear the “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts on the red carpet, several sports stars including LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Derrick Rose have worn the shirts during warmups before NBA games.

Although much of his early life is shrouded in mystery, it is known that he would eventually become one of Costa Rica's most notorious criminals. Carvajal's life took a dark turn as he delved into a string of criminal activities that culminated in first-degree murder charges. Between 1938 and 1984, he was responsible for the deaths of four victims, propelling him into infamy. His violent actions led to his arrest on August 23, 1938, marking the beginning of a long and arduous journey through the criminal justice system in Costa Rica. As a consequence of his heinous crimes, Beltrán Cortés Carvajal faced a 32-year prison sentence. Throughout his incarceration, he became a symbol of the dangers that lurked in the shadows of Costa Rican society. Despite his notorious status, many who encountered him described him as a complex individual who possessed a range of emotions and character traits. While Carvajal's criminal lifestyle remained the focal point of his later years, he was also characterized by his physical appearance. His image, captured in the photograph \\"Beltrán Cortés Carvajal.jpg,\\" showcases the hardened visage of a man whose life was marked by violence and turmoil. Ironically, it was not his criminal past that would ultimately lead to Carvajal's demise, but rather prostate cancer. He fought bravely against the disease but succumbed to its ravages on June 11, 1984, in his birth town of Santa Bárbara, Costa Rica. His death, while bringing an end to a tumultuous life, also served as a lesson to many about the profound impact that one's choices can have on their life story. In the grand narrative of Beltrán Cortés Carvajal's life, a myriad of factors converged to create the man who would be remembered by history. From the small-town beginnings in Santa Bárbara to his struggles with prostate cancer, Carvajal's story is rife with hardship, violence, and ultimately, redemption.

Answer:","output":"Yes, the Catalan Sheepdog (Gos d'Atura Català) and the Can de Palleiro are both dog breeds that originated in Spain. However, they were bred in different regions of the country and have distinct characteristics, purposes, and histories. Here is a detailed comparison and overview of both breeds: Catalan Sheepdog (Gos d'Atura Català): The Catalan Sheepdog is a breed that originated in Catalonia, an autonomous community in northeastern Spain. This region covers a significant portion of the eastern Pyrenees Mountains and is known for its unique culture, language, and traditions that are deeply rooted in the area. The Catalan Sheepdog has been an essential part of this region for centuries, primarily used for herding sheep and other livestock. The breed is medium-sized, with a wavy or curly coat that comes in various shades of grey, sable, fawn, or black. They have an athletic build, a sturdy appearance, and are known for their agility and intelligence. The Catalan Sheepdog is prized for its strong herding instincts and excellent guarding capabilities. They are considered to be versatile working dogs that are also known for their exceptional loyalty and affection towards their families. In addition, they are friendly with children and other animals. Catalan Sheepdogs have gained recognition outside of Catalonia over time. They have been used for search and rescue, police work, and as therapy dogs due to their intelligence and trainability. However, this breed remains relatively rare outside of their native region. Can de Palleiro: The Can de Palleiro, sometimes referred to as the Galician Shepherd or Galician Barn Dog, is a dog breed originating from Galicia, a region in northwestern Spain, known for its Celtic heritage and lush landscapes. This working breed has been used primarily in agricultural settings for centuries, where they were responsible for guarding livestock and their human families, as well as performing various farm tasks. The Can de Palleiro is a medium to large-sized dog, with a distinctive rectangular body shape and a strong, muscular build. They have a medium-length, thick coat which can come in a range of colors, including red, yellow, black, and brindle. Their ears are often semi-erect, and their facial expressions showcase intelligence and alertness. Can de Palleiros are known for their loyalty, courage, and adaptability. They are highly protective of their family and territory, making them excellent guard dogs. However, they can also be affectionate and gentle with their loved ones. With proper socialization and training, they make great companions in both rural and urban environments. In conclusion, the Catalan Sheepdog and the Can de Palleiro are both dog breeds that originated in Spain, specifically in the regions of Catalonia and Galicia. Despite their differing regional origins, they share common traits such as loyalty, intelligence, and their roles as working and herding dogs. They are both valued for their protective instincts and strong bonds with their families. While they may both be bred in Spain, their distinct characteristics, purposes, and regional origins set them apart from each other."},{"instruction":"Instructions: Languages typically provide more than one grammatical construction to express certain types of messages.

Article: The retailer digitally modified, or \\"retouched\\", the body shape of a model in an issue of Healthy , its customer magazine, to conceal her true thinness.      The revelation will fuel concerns about the \\"size-zero\\" culture within the magazine industry, where increasingly-slender models are being used in photo shoots.      Details of the incident emerged during a round-table debate on the issue of retouching earlier this month, hosted by the model agency Leni's Model Management and attended by photographers, magazine editors and models including Jodie Kidd.      During the debate, Jane Druker, the editor of Healthy magazine – which promotes \\"health and wellbeing\\" and has featured Elizabeth Hurley on its cover – admitted that Kamilla Wladyka, the model who features in the April issue, was so thin in real life that her image was radically retouched before appearing on the cover.      Miss Druker told participants in the debate: \\"She was so thin, we had to put on about half a stone.\\" Gerard Chevalier, a psychotherapist and former fashion photographer who also took part in the debate, said that Miss Druker went on to tell him the image had been enhanced to make the model appear two to three stone heavier than her actual weight. He said: \\"She told me the girl was so thin, they had to put 15 to 20 kilograms on her.\\"      The Sunday Telegraph has previously revealed that fashion magazines are increasingly manipulating images of skinny models to make them look fuller-figured, in order to deflect criticism of promoting unhealthily-thin images.      But the use of such retouching in a health magazine will raise concerns that the magazine industry is simply ignoring the \\"size-zero\\" issue. The details provided by Miss Wladyka's modelling agency clearly state that she is a very slender size 6, with a 24-inch waist.      Susan Ringwood, the chief executive of the eating disorder charity, Beat, who has campaigned for magazines to use models of diverse sizes, described the use of the images as \\"hugely disappointing\\".      She said: \\"There's a fundamental difference between using camera work to make someone look polished, and changing the shape and size of someone's body in order to portray them looking differently, to conform to whatever ideal.      \\"It's just not helpful and puts huge pressure on people to keep up a hyper-perfectionism that isn't real. If you can't trust the health industry to be healthy, how can you expect the fashion magazines to put their house in order?\\"      Eleni Renton, the director of Leni's Model Management, said that retouching photographs to make models appear larger was \\"crazy\\". She said: \\"Rather than take a chance on a different size model who actually fits the criteria for a shoot, it's much easier for magazine editors and casting directors to book a girl who is a known quantity in the industry, even if she might be slightly too slim or large for a job, and then retouch her later.      \\"But when magazines start changing body shape, it becomes unhealthy. They are not acting responsibly. That girl probably should have been sent home from the shoot – she's supposed to be representing a 'healthy' magazine as their cover girl and they retouched her to make her look healthier. It's false.\\"      She also called for magazines to introduce a kite-mark system informing readers when images are modified: \\"Retouching is getting increasingly out of hand. Most people can't tell how much is being used, so they are aspiring to unattainable fantasy images.      \\"Magazines should have signs indicating when an image has been retouched, so people can see at a glance how much work has been done.\\"      Miss Kidd said that retouching images to correct minor imperfections was acceptable, but condemned the practice of distorting models' body shapes. She said: \\"Re-touching for little blemishes is fine, but putting weight on, taking weight off, that goes too far.\\"      Miss Druker claimed that Miss Wladyka had appeared healthy during a casting for the photo shoot a week before it took place, but looked too thin to feature on the magazine's cover on the day of the shoot.      She said: \\"Sometimes when you cast a model, they look OK, but then when they turn up on the shoot day, they might not have eaten for two or three days. You're not in charge of their health.      \\"When she did arrive, there were plenty of clothes that we couldn't put on her because her bones stuck out too much. She looked beautiful in the face, but really thin and unwell.      \\"That's not a reflection of what we do in our magazine, which is about good health and women looking healthful and well.      \\"She was a stunningly beautiful girl and we knew what we were able to do with retouching. We made her legs a little bit bigger, to make her look like she was a size 10 as opposed to a size 4.      \\"It's not what we normally do and I would never want to mislead people.\\"      Holland & Barrett declined to comment. ||||| Skinny model airbrushed to look curvier      By MSN NZ      Polish model Kamilla Wladyka was digitally altered for the health magazine cover (right).      A magazine has digitally altered a model to appear curvier, rather than thinner.      The model's body was retouched with added weight for the cover of UK health and wellbeing magazine Healthy.      Editor Jane Druker admitted that the model used  Kamilla Wladyka  was so thin in real life that she needed to be \\"radically retouched\\" before appearing on the cover.      According to the UK's Daily Telegraph, the magazine added between 15kg to 20kg to the model's frame.      The magazine claimed that the model had appeared healthy during a casting for the photo shoot a week before it took place, but on the day of the shoot she appeared too thin.      \\"Sometimes when you cast a model, they look okay, but then when they turn up on the shoot day they might not have eaten for two or three days,\\" Miss Drucker said.      \\"You're not in charge of their health.      \\"When she did arrive, there were plenty of clothes that we couldn't put on her because her bones stuck out too much. She looked beautiful in the face, but really thin and unwell.\\"      She said the magazine was promoting health and wellbeing and therefore the model's look was at odds with its philosophy.      \\"We made her legs a little bit bigger, to make her look like she was a size 10 as opposed to a size 4,\\" Miss Drucker said.      \\"It's not what we normally do and I would never want to mislead people.\\" ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A magazine called Healthy changed a picture of a very skinny model to make her look bigger and healthier. They did this because they didn't want to show an unhealthy-looking person on their magazine cover. Some people think doing this is not good because it can make people think they need to look perfect all the time. It is also not fair to change someone's body shape in a picture to make them look different than they really are."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Process:  - Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs - The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs - Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose blood oxygen levels decrease happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis of decreased blood oxygen levels can have a direct effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the blood stream. When there is a drop in blood oxygen levels, the body responds through various mechanisms to increase the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. 1. Increased breathing rate: One of the initial responses to low blood oxygen levels is to increase the rate of breathing. This results in a higher volume of air entering the lungs, allowing for a greater amount of oxygen to be absorbed by the alveoli and transferred to the blood stream. 2. Increased heart rate: The heart may also increase its pumping rate to ensure that the oxygen-rich blood reaches tissues and organs more quickly, compensating for the lower concentration of oxygen in the blood. 3. Redistribution of blood flow: The body may selectively redirect blood flow to the most critical organs and tissues (e.g. brain, heart), ensuring that they receive adequate oxygenation despite the reduced blood oxygen levels. 4. Release of erythropoietin: As a long-term response to low blood oxygen levels, the kidneys may release erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. An increase in red blood cell count results in an increased blood oxygen-carrying capacity, ensuring that more oxygen reaches the tissues and organs. 5. Enhanced oxygen binding affinity: The body may also alter the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin, the molecule responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells, allowing it to more effectively capture and release oxygen as needed. In summary, the proposed perturbation of decreased blood oxygen levels does have a direct and indirect effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the blood stream. The body will respond through various means to counteract the reduced oxygen levels and ensure that a sufficient amount of oxygen is delivered to the vital tissues and organs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Q: Context: Malcolm Earl \\"Mal\\" Waldron (August 16, 1925  December 2, 2002) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger. He started playing professionally in New York in 1950, after graduating from university. In the following dozen years or so Waldron led his own bands and played for those led by Charles Mingus, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, and Eric Dolphy, among others. During Waldron's period as house pianist for Prestige Records in the late 1950s, he appeared on dozens of albums and composed for many of them, including writing his most famous song, \\"Soul Eyes\\", for Coltrane. Waldron was often an accompanist for vocalists, and was Billie Holiday's regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959., Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl., Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\"., Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music (cross-rhythm), or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm., The Dealers is a 1964 album by jazz musician Mal Waldron released on Status Records , catalogue 8316 ., Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns., The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties., West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo., Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan., The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums., Prestige Records was a jazz record company and label founded in 1949 by Bob Weinstock in New York City. The company recorded hundreds of albums by many of the leading jazz musicians of the day, sometimes issuing them under subsidiaries. In 1971, the company was sold to Fantasy, which was later absorbed by Concord., A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. , MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices., Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915  July 17, 1959), professionally known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed \\"Lady Day\\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. There were other jazz singers with equal talent, but Holiday had a voice that captured the attention of her audience., Subject: the dealers, Relation: record_label, Options: (A) 1982 (B) album (C) conflict (D) digital (E) digital audio (F) france (G) island (H) leaf (I) melody (J) philips (K) pop (L) prestige records (M) record (N) sony A:","output":"L) prestige records"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was designed by the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM), which also designed iconic buildings like the One World Trade Center in New York City and the Willis Tower in Chicago. The building's design was inspired by regional desert flowers, and its structure incorporates elements from Islamic architecture. Constructed over a span of six years (2004 to 2010), the Burj Khalifa boasts a total of 163 floors, of which more than 150 are occupied and in use. The building houses a combination of residential, commercial, and hospitality facilities, as well as featuring some of the most amazing feats of engineering and design. Among them are the world's highest outdoor observation deck on the 148th floor and the world's highest swimming pool, positioned on the 76th floor. The tower also houses the Armani Hotel, which was designed by Italian fashion designer Giorgio Armani. Besides the hotel, there are luxury residences within the building, known as the Armani Residences. The lower floors of the skyscraper are occupied by various retail outlets and restaurants, making the Burj Khalifa a desirable location for both residents and tourists. A special feature of the Burj Khalifa is its exterior lighting, which often features spectacular displays to mark important events, festivals, and holidays. One of the most memorable light shows occurs on New Year's Eve, when the facade of the building turns into a mesmerizing spectacle of lights and fireworks, drawing thousands of onlookers every year. In conclusion, the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, is a monumental symbol of Dubai's innovation and ambition. Its stunning height, architectural design, and variety of features make it a must-see attraction for architects, visitors, and residents alike."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Photos View photos zoom      Through his entire life, Jeff Walton Jr. had no idea his father was keeping a secret.      The 35-year-old learned from police earlier this month that his father, who he knew as Jeff Walton the first — a 69-year-old New Orleans Saints fan living in small-town Oklahoma — is not who his son thought him to be.      The senior Walton was born Ronald Stan, a Canadian living in the former Township of East Williams, Middlesex County until September 29, 1977, when he was reported missing after a mysterious early-morning barn fire.      “I’m still trying to put all the puzzle pieces together myself,” said the younger Walton reached on the phone. He and the rest of Stan’s American family, which includes Walton’s stepmom and at least three grandchildren, only found out about his Canadian past this month.      Provincial police in Ontario pieced together the story of Stan in July, when they reopened the file on his disappearance as part of a routine audit of the case file. Const. Laurie Houghton with the Middlesex County OPP attributed the resolution of the case to modern investigative techniques not available in 1977.      “I can’t speak to his motives,” said Houghton. “We were able to connect the dots.”      Stan, who was 32 years old when he disappeared, is considered legally dead in Canada. He was declared deceased by a court in 1986, nearly a decade after his disappearance amid circumstances that still remain murky. Police responded to a fire at a barn near a piece of farmland property owned by Ronald Stan. A witness saw Stan in the area of the barn before the fire and he couldn’t be found afterwards.      At least one neighbour recalls the serious blaze in 1977. Bert Toonen said his brother Peter was out with Stan the night of the fire. A young man at the time, Toonen was one of many neighbours who helped investigators search the debris.      “They were my father’s pigs in that barn. We were out the next day combing through the wreckage with the police looking for human remains,” Toonen said. No human remains were found.      Decades later, Toonen now owns Stan’s former property, land which changed hands several times over the years. He lives down the street from Stan’s uncle Edward Stan, who moved in down the road with his family shortly after the fire.      Both Toonen and Edward say Stan left behind a wife. Edward says the couple had two children, but that he had little contact with his nephew’s family after Ronald Stan’s disappearance. The Star attempted to reach people believed to be the wife and children of Stan but was unable to verify whether they were his relatives.      It’s not clear how Stan came to be declared deceased. In Ontario at that time, a family member would have had to make the request through court, but Stan’s legal status was unclear to at least one family member — his uncle Edward did not know he was legally declared dead. In fact he said he knew Stan was alive, because he saw his nephew in 1997:      “We knew because he came up when his dad died. We saw him then.”      Edward said he refused to talk to Stan at his father Henry’s funeral, evading the happy-go-lucky nephew he once knew. He knows nothing about Stan’s new life in the United States, except for information gathered from provincial police after they contacted him early this month with Stan’s whereabouts.      In 2002 the province enacted stricter measures to make it harder to declare someone dead. Prior to the Declarations of Death Act, the court could declare a missing person dead incidentally to another sort of application, said Joshua Eisen, an associate at Toronto law firm Hull and Hull LLP, who deals with wills and estate litigation.      “(A person) would have to start litigation to get their life insurance . . . or something like that,” Eisen said. “The court could say that this person is dead for the purposes of a life insurance application or maybe to distribute the money in the will. There had to be some reason for it.”      Today, a spouse, next of kin or any person affected by an order declaring that an individual is dead can apply to the courts to have somebody declared dead under only two circumstances: the person has been missing for seven years or they disappeared in circumstance of peril.      The consequences of declaring a person dead are very severe, Eisen said; a person declared dead loses all right to their own property. An applicant has to show nobody has heard from the missing, they’ve made reasonable inquiries into the person’s location, they have no reason to believe the missing person is alive and there has to be enough evidence to find that the person’s dead.      Courts, he said, were always reluctant to grant this sort of release.      “You really have to go off the map to be declared dead,” said Eisen.      Jeff Walton Jr. doesn’t blame his father for what happened but is still dealing with the shock of the new information. He declined to discuss the specifics of his father’s flight or any potential motivation.      Stan, now 69 years old, suffers from vascular dementia and heart disease, his son says. He was in a nursing home when the police made the connection. Stan’s American wife, Debra Proctor, filed for divorce upon hearing the news, said Walton.      “It’s been tough on me, but he’s still my father. It doesn’t change the man I knew for 35 years,” said Walton. “Hopefully one day he can sit down and write a book and remember all the stuff he’s been through in his life. It’d be a damn good book I’ll tell you that, just from what I’ve heard.”      The Ontario Provincial Police said there are no charges being laid and the case is now closed. ||||| CTV A 32-year-old man who went missing in 1977 following an Ontario barn fire on the property seen here has been found alive and living in Oklahoma, according to Ontario Provincial Police.      A Canadian man who was declared dead after vanishing 37 years ago has been found alive and living in Oklahoma.      Ontario Provincial Police say Ronald Stan, who was 32 when he went missing, was recently discovered living under the name of Jeff Walton after vanishing on Sept. 29, 1977, CTVNews reported.      Stan was suspected of dying in a barn fire, southwest of Toronto, which left firefighters painstakingly digging through the smoldering remains without any sign of his body.      \\"I remember that one quite well because we dug through dead pigs and so-on with our boots on, and had done our very best to find human remains,\\" retired firefighter Jim Walsh told CTVNews. \\"And there was none in that barn.\\"      CTV Retired firefighter Jim Walsh, pictured right, recently recalled sifting through the remains of the burned barn for Ronald Stan's body in September 1977 without any luck.      Nearly a decade later, after finding no trace of the missing man, an Ontario court declared him dead in 1986.      Fast forward to last July, authorities say a routine audit of his mysterious disappearance linked Stan to a 69-year-old man living more than 1,000 miles south. That man was positively identified as Stan. Police did not identify where in Oklahoma he was found.      \\"I can't speak to his motives,\\" Const. Laurie Houghton with the Middlesex County Ontario Provincial Police told The Star of Stan's possible reason for disappearing.      CTV Ontario Provincial Police Middlesex County OPP Const. Laurie Houghton, pictured, said that charges are not expected to be filed against Stan, who has been living under the name of Jeff Walton.      Houghton said his family has been informed of his discovery and that he is not facing criminal charges in Canada.      As for how they found him this time around, she credited new technology for cracking the case.      \\"There's a lot that's available to us now for investigative tools that wasn't available to us back in 1977. As a result, we were able to connect the dots, essentially, and lead us to the state of Oklahoma,\\" she told The Star. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A man named Ronald Stan went missing in 1977 when there was a big fire in a barn in Canada.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  Jim and Greg are brothers who both run their own farms, but they rarely see each other due to them living in different states. Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to.  Whose lake will have more algae? A:","output":"Jim's lake in Illinois Step 1: Consider the rainfall in the two areas. Jim's farm in Illinois has more regular rainfall, while Greg's farm in Texas has less rainfall and requires more manual watering. Step 2: Consider the impact of rain on fertilizer. Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil and can create runoff that carries the fertilizer into bodies of water like ponds and lakes. Step 3: Assess the potential for algae growth. As nitrogen from the fertilizer enters bodies of water, it promotes the growth of algae. Step 4: Compare the likelihood of algae growth in the two lakes. Since Jim's farm in Illinois experiences more regular rainfall, it is more likely that the fertilizer will be carried into the lake near his farm, leading to higher levels of nitrogen in the water and increased algae growth. Based on these steps, it is more likely that Jim's lake in Illinois will have more algae compared to Greg's lake in Texas."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is full the name of the person whose records from the 1980s have been described as being influenced by Prince?

Often non - smokers avoided places which allowed smoking for both work and recreation . However in 1998 California became one of the first to pass a bill which outlawed smoking in casinos , bars , clubs and restaurants . In the last ten years , other states such as Arizona , Florida , New York and recently Oregon have followed California 's example . Why is smoking not allowed in 5 US states in eateries , drinking establishments , clubs and gambling halls starting with the western most mainland state ?","output":"To answer the question of why smoking is not allowed in certain establishments in 5 US states starting with California, I will provide key factors underlying such decisions: 1. Health concerns: Smoking is a significant health hazard. Secondhand smoke can be harmful for both smokers and non-smokers who are exposed to it. Banning smoking in these establishments helps protect the health of the general public, including patrons and employees. 2. California as a pioneer: Being the first state to pass such a bill in 1998, California set a precedent for other states to follow. Its progressive attitude towards environmental and public health issues encouraged other states to implement similar regulations. 3. Public demand: Various surveys and studies have shown that people often prefer smoke-free environments. In response to this demand, states have enacted legislation to create more welcoming atmospheres in public establishments, benefiting both customers and businesses. 4. Workplace safety: The Occupational Safety and Health Act establishes the importance of providing a safe and healthy workplace for employees. Banning smoking in eateries, drinking establishments, clubs, and gambling halls serves to achieve this goal, as it reduces the risk for employees who would otherwise be exposed to a hazardous environment. 5. Indoor air quality: Smoking indoors produces a decline in air quality, which can lead to respiratory issues and other health concerns for occupants. Banning smoking improves the indoor air quality in such establishments, thus benefiting both employees and patrons. In conclusion, the primary reason behind the banning of smoking in 5 US states' eateries, drinking establishments, clubs, and gambling halls is to protect public health and improve the overall experience for customers and employees. California paved the way, inspiring other states like Arizona, Florida, New York, and Oregon to adopt similar measures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Glasses are very important to many people. Do you know how they were invented and developed? Glasses took a long time to develop into what you can find in the glasses store today. The Chinese first used colored glasses as fashion. They thought that those glasses had magic, but they didn't think that glasses could help eyes to see clearly. In 1262, the inventor, Roger Bacon, discovered the amazing function of lenses , and he thought that glasses could be used to help people to see. Twenty years later, in Florence, Italy, the inventor, Alessandro di Spina, made the first pair of glasses that could help people to see. Although these glasses worked, scientists didn't understand how glasses helped eyes to see. They thought that eyes sent out light onto whatever a person was looking at, and then the light came back to the eyes. Johannes Kepler finally found out how glasses worked. Inventors continued to improve glasses. In 1784, Ben Franklin created glasses that had bifocal lenses. Many years later, in 1827, George Airy made circle-shaped glasses to correct _ , an eye problem that stops the eyes from seeing things clearly. 1.

Choice 1 - Cold-blooded: Cold-blooded organisms are those whose body temperature varies with the environment. They include reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Most cold-blooded organisms have blood, so this choice seems incorrect. Choice 2 - Vertebrate: Vertebrates are animals with a backbone. This group includes mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fish. Most vertebrates have blood, so this choice also appears incorrect. Choice 3 - Marine: Marine refers to organisms living in the ocean. Marine organisms can include a wide range of animals, from tiny plankton to large whales. Many marine organisms do have blood, so this choice seems incorrect. Choice 4 - Single-celled: Single-celled organisms are microscopic organisms made up of a single cell, like bacteria and protozoa. As they are made up of just one cell, they typically do not have blood, so this choice appears correct. Step 2: Select the correct choice based on the analysis.

Ideally, you will have two moisturizers, one for day that is lighter and includes an SPF, and one for night that is a bit heavier. Before applying makeup, you will want to use the lighter moisturizer. Make sure that your day time moisturizer contains at least SPF 15 to protect your skin from the sun.  If you struggle with breakouts and/or oily skin look for oil-free moisturizers that are non-comodogenic. If you have dry skin you can look for creams that are a bit thicker to wear during the day. A thicker cream will also give you a more dewy look. If you are prone to dry skin, adding a serum to your routine can help add a little extra moisture to your face. With most facial products, it’s important to remember that a little bit goes a long way, and this is especially true in the case of serums.  Look for serums that contain antioxidants, such as Vitamin C; anti-inflammatories, such as Zinc; and hydrators such as amino acids. Apply this after cleansing and toning, but before applying moisturizer. If you want to incorporate a serum into your routine, but have oilier skin, try applying the serum at night.

If you harvest the pods every couple days as they mature, the plants will continue producing pods for several days or even weeks.  Pods are ready for harvest when they are long, crisp, and firm. However, harvest the pods before the beans inside become plump and developed. Harvest beans from dry plants to prevent the spread of bacteria. If necessary, wait until the late morning or early afternoon so morning dew has dried. To eat your beans fresh, eat them the day you pick them, or store them in the fridge for a few days.

Smooth them out so that they are flat and even. Then, trace around the edges of the jeans leaving about ½” (1.3 cm) on all sides for seam allowance. If you want baggier overalls, then trace further away from the edges of the jeans. For example, you could trace 2” (5cm) from the edges of your jeans for baggy overalls. You might also use a baggy pair of jeans to make it easier to get a loose fit. After you finish tracing around the edges of your jeans, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the edges of the lines you created. Make sure to cut straight even lines in your fabric. The 2 pieces you cut out will be the legs and waistband of your overalls. Next, you will need to create the bib pieces for your overalls. To do this, measure from your waist to your chest and cross the front of your chest. Then, add 1” (2.5 cm) to each measurement for a seam allowance. Trace a rectangle with these dimensions onto your folded fabric and then cut it out from both layers. These pieces will be the front and back bib pieces for your overalls. To make the straps, measure from your chest to your shoulder blade and add 1” (2.5 cm) for a seam allowance. This will be the strap length that you need to create. You can make your straps as wide or as narrow as you like, but 2” (5 cm) to 3” (7.5 cm) is a good size. However, make sure to add 1” (2.5 cm) to your strap width as well for the seam allowance. When you have determined your strap measurements, trace these onto the folded fabric and cut along the lines to make two identical straps. If you would like to include a pocket on the front of your overalls, then you can also make a pocket piece. To make a pocket piece, draw a rectangle onto your fabric and cut it out. Make sure that the rectangle is smaller than your front bib piece, but large enough to use as a pocket.  A good pocket width might be 4” (10 cm) by 6” (15 cm). Make sure to add 1” (2.5 cm) to both sides of the rectangle for the seam allowance as well. You will only need 1 piece to create the pocket, so you only need to cut out 1 rectangle.","output":"To make a pair of overalls, follow these steps: 1. Prepare your fabric by laying it out in two layers. Place your unfolded jeans on top of the fabric, ensuring they are flat and even. 2. Trace around the jeans with a ½” (1.3 cm) seam allowance. For baggier overalls, increase this distance or use a baggy pair of jeans as your template. 3. Cut the fabric along the traced lines using sharp scissors, ensuring straight, even cuts.

Add 1” (2.5 cm) for seam allowance to each measurement, then trace a rectangle with these dimensions onto your folded fabric. Cut the rectangles from both layers to create the front and back bib pieces. 5. To make the straps, measure from your chest to your shoulder blade and add 1” (2.5 cm) for seam allowance.

In summary, this process involves preparing your fabric and cutting out the necessary pieces to create overalls: legs, waistband, bib sections, straps, and optional pocket. These cut-outs will be assembled in subsequent steps to form a complete pair of overalls.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Sanctions against Russia boost Iran's standing before nuclear talks restart A visitor to Tehran's energy expo, which drew 1,800 firms, including 600 foreign companies, despite sanctions. Photograph: Ahmad Halabisaz/Xinhua/Corbis The Ukraine crisis has strengthened Iran's hand in its nuclear talks and other dealings with the west by reminding European countries and the Obama administration of its potential as a major alternative energy supplier if Russia cannot be relied upon, officials and analysts in Tehran say. But even as it attempts to play the Russia card, the government of President Hassan Rouhani is simultaneously stressing closer bilateral ties with Vladimir Putin's Kremlin as a means of mitigating the impact of US, EU and UN economic sanctions, imposed in the still-unresolved row over Iran's nuclear programme. \\"The western countries are imposing sanctions on Russia [after its annexation of Crimea]. Now Russia is the bad guy,\\" said Amir Mohebbian, a government adviser. \\"This has made the situation better for Iran's nuclear negotiators. Time is on our side. If we sit here long enough, it will all come to Iran.\\" It was not for Iran to say who was right or wrong in Ukraine, said Mohammad Marandi, an international relations expert at Tehran University. \\"But of course if Iran is no longer under sanctions, the Europeans would have many more choices regarding energy. At the same time, if the sanctions continue, Rouhani may move closer to Russia and China.\\" Majid Takht Ravanchi, deputy foreign minister and a member of Iran's nuclear negotiating team, said Iran would focus solely on details of a deal to lift sanctions when nuclear talks resumed in Vienna this week. But he did not deny Ukraine had placed matters in a new light. \\"Naturally Iran and Europe could have much better cooperation on the economy, trade, energy. We believe there is much room for improvement,\\" Ravanchi said. The extent to which Iran could become Europe's alternative energy supplier is borne out by statistics, and by growing western commercial interest in its energy sector. Iran is the third largest Opec oil producer after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. It controls an estimated about 13% of the world's recoverable crude oil reserves and the world's second largest natural gas reserves. Despite sanctions that severely limit cash sales of Iranian energy, an international oil, gas, refining and petrochemicals exhibition in Tehran last week attracted 1,800 companies, among them 600 foreign companies from 32 countries including the US and Britain. China is one of Iran's biggest customers, owing an estimated 22bn (£13bn) for oil and gas supplies, which cannot be paid due to banking sanctions. Details emerged last week of plans for China to invest an equivalent sum in electricity and water projects as a way of circumventing the restrictions. Similar barter deals are now in the pipeline with Russia. Last month the Mehr news agency reported a planned 8bn-10bn energy deal in which Russia would supply electricity, generating plants and a transmission network. The US says an earlier proposal for Iran to supply 500,000 barrels of oil a day in return for Russian products would violate sanctions. Speaking last month as the Ukraine crisis intensified, Rouhani went out of his way to praise Russia. \\"Strong political ties in bilateral, regional and international domains, along with vast economic relations between the two countries, set the stage for the promotion of peace and stability,\\" he said. Rouhani's message to the west was plain: if there is no deal to end sanctions, Iran has strategic alternatives that the US, Britain and others may find unpalatable. Western analysts worry the Iran-Russia relationship may expand into the security sphere. Concern centres on the sale of Russian advanced S-300 advanced anti-missile defence systems, which would provide Iran with state-of-the-art protection in the event of a hypothetical Israeli or American attack. The sale, agreed in 2007, was blocked after Putin came under international pressure. But if Moscow's relations with the west deteriorate further, it is possible Russia's president could give it the green light. Iran insists, meanwhile, that its missile capabilities, both offensive and defensive, cannot be part of talks with the west. Despite the election victory of the more centrist Rouhani administration, Iran remains deeply at odds with the US on a range of other fronts extending beyond Russia and the nuclear talks. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other hardline clerics persist in casting the US in the role of \\"Great Satan\\" or \\"global arrogance\\". They continue to castigate Israel at every opportunity, although former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's notorious threat to wipe it off the map is no longer repeated. Iran is also embroiled in a regional power struggle with the key US ally, Saudi Arabia, and other Sunni Muslim Gulf states. This so-called proxy war has found its sharpest expression in Syria, where the Sunni-Shia divide is most evident, but it also extends to Bahrain, Yemen and even Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. A Tehran official said Iran was intent on curtailing the spread of extremist Wahhabi ideology and jihadism that flowed from Saudi Arabia's \\"wealthy mosques, teachers and banks\\". But there was also unanimous agreement on another, overriding objective: fulfilling Iran's destiny as the leading power of the Middle East, the official said. The US should not try to thwart this ambition, said Mohebbian. \\"We need a new dynamic. The US and Iran should agree not to be friends and not to be enemies. The US [and Europe] should accept Iran as it is. It will be better for them not to have Iran as an enemy. It would be expensive for them in the long run, more than they can imagine.\\"","output":"The crisis in Ukraine has boosted Iran's position in its nuclear negotiations, reminding European countries and the US of its potential as a major alternative energy supplier if Russia becomes unreliable. As sanctions continue against Russia, Iran is looking to strengthen its ties with the Kremlin as a means to mitigate the impact of US, EU, and UN economic sanctions imposed due to Iran's nuclear program. Iran remains the third-largest OPEC oil producer and has the world's second largest natural gas reserves, making it an attractive alternative to Europe's energy needs. Iranian officials believe that as the situation with Russia unfolds, time is on Iran's side, which could lead to a more favorable outcome in nuclear negotiations and an eventual lifting of sanctions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Write some highlights for the following article: Israel's former security chief is slamming the country's prime minister and defense minister for their handling of Iran, saying neither one inspires confidence. \\"I don't trust a leadership that relies on messianic leadership,\\" said Yuval Diskin, the former head of the Shin Bet, the country's internal security service, at a public conference Friday night in Israel. \\"Our two messiahs from Caesaria and from the Akiorv Towers are not fit to stand at the helm of the government,\\" Diskin said, referring to the respective residences of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak. His comments were widely reported in the Israeli media Saturday. Barak said while he welcomed Diskin's entry into politics, the comments are irresponsible. \\"It is both embarrassing and saddening to see the weakening of judgment and responsibility and the low language a man who served the public for years was dragged into,\\" said a statement from Barak's office. \\"Diskin is acting in a petty, irresponsible manner motivated by personal frustration. He is harming the heritage of generations of Shin Bet heads and the operational norms of the organization.\\" A senior Israeli government official said that the comments lacked credibility because the domestic security focus of the Shin Bet made the organization a \\"peripheral player\\" when it comes to Iran. The same official, who declined to be named publicly due to the sensitivity of the issue, said Diskin's comments were \\"both surprising and strange\\" because he had worked under both Netanyahu and Barak, and sought to become Mossad director under their leadership. \\"Are you saying these things because you didn't get the position?\\" the official asked rhetorically, adding that Diskin's attack seemed more \\"personal than policy.\\" Diskin, a widely respected former security official, also took the two Israeli leaders to task for mis-characterizing the possible effectiveness of a military strike against Iran and its nuclear program. He said the Israeli government presented \\"a false view to the public on the Iranian bomb, as though acting against Iran would prevent a nuclear bomb. But attacking Iran will encourage them to develop a bomb all the faster.\\" It is not the first time a high-profile figure has criticized the Israeli government's handling of Iran. Meir Dagan, the former chief of Israel's spy agency, the Mossad, has been a frequent and vocal critic of talk about an Israel strike on Iran, famously calling it a \\"stupid idea.\\" Israeli vice-premier and Likud party member Silvan Shalom told the Jerusalem Post that Diskin should not have spoken in public. \\"I think that Diskin was wrong to say what he did, and that when he considers what he said he will realize that he was wrong,\\" Shalom said. Diskin's blunt commentary follows controversial remarks by Israel's top general, who said Iran is led by \\"very rational people\\" and doesn't appear poised to build a nuclear bomb that would threaten his nation. Iran \\"is going step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether to manufacture a nuclear bomb,\\" Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz told Israel's Haaretz newspaper in Wednesday editions. \\"It hasn't yet decided whether to go the extra mile.\\" Those comments were in stark contrast to those of Netanyahu, who suggested to CNN that time is running out for Western sanctions on Iran to have a meaningful effect on Tehran's nuclear program.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:You are given a new situation: Ben and Andy were two old friends. They both have high levels of cholesterol. Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless.  and a hint : Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  Please answer this question : Which friend started taking statins for his disease? A:","output":"Ben started taking statins for his high cholesterol levels. As mentioned in the situation, Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, which is likely to be a statin, after visiting the doctor. Statins are a type of drug that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, ultimately lowering blood cholesterol levels by inducing the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This helps in the stimulation of catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is essential in tackling atherosclerosis. On the other hand, Andy did not go to the doctor due to his carelessness and is not mentioned to be taking any medication, including statins, for his high cholesterol levels. The effectiveness of statins may vary among individuals, partly due to their genetic background and the presence of different single nucleotide polymorphisms. Pharmacogenomics, which focuses on the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, can help in understanding these variations and in finding the most appropriate statin treatment for each individual."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write some highlights for the following article: Facebook has started to roll out a new version of its Messenger app for Android that only requires a name and a phone number, not an actual Facebook account, to sign up. Although the new Facebook Messenger app is only available in a handful of countries for now--Australia, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Venezuela--it will eventually roll out to the United States and elsewhere, allowing users to chat with their phone contacts even if they're not using Facebook. This news has set the tech world atwitter with proclamations that the new Messenger is an assault on the lowly text message (including one such proclamation from Facebook itself). It's a nice thought, at least. Given that a single text to your neighbor can cost more than a data transmission from Mars, who wouldn't relish the idea of wireless carriers getting their comeuppance? In reality, though, standard SMS has a lot going for it, and will likely weather all kinds of assaults, especially one from Facebook. For one thing, Facebook Messenger faces the same adoption hurdle as other Internet-based messaging apps like WhatsApp and Viber: It requires a conscious decision not to use traditional SMS. With Facebook Messenger, you must first consider whether the recipient has Facebook installed, and is set up to receive notifications for new messages. Then, you must commit to using the Messenger app instead of your phone's built-in SMS functionality. Once you do that, the conversation is locked into Facebook unless you have one of the select Android phones that can integrate regular text messages. That's a lot to consider compared to the standard SMS, which is guaranteed to reach and alert the recipient as long as you have the right phone number. To truly threaten the text message, Facebook Messenger needs the kind of tight smartphone integration found in Apple's iMessage, which automatically replaces standard text messages between any two iPhone users. That's not really possible unless Facebook starts making its own smartphones. In lieu of tighter smartphone integration, Facebook simply has to compete with similar services that are already well-established. As Boy Genius Report points out, competitor WhatsApp is already a Top 5 messaging app in 141 countries and handles 10 billion messages per day. (Compare that to 7.8 trillion regular text messages sent in 2011, according to Portio Research, for an average of 21 billion messages per day.) Competition is good, but in this case it means users will be fragmented across multiple services that can't talk to one another. Ideally, these competing services would somehow find a way to work with each other, so a Facebook user could send a message to someone who uses Whatsapp or Viber. It sounds crazy, but considering that wireless carriers found a way to make it work with SMS, tech companies should be able to figure out a solution. I acknowledge that the need for SMS alternatives is more desperate outside the United States, where the price per message can be cost-prohibitive. But in the land of all-you-can-eat messaging, if you really need to reach someone, SMS remains the most reliable option, and Facebook Messenger only poses a minor threat. &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

Facebook has started rolling out a Messenger app for Android that only requires a name and phone number, without needing a Facebook account. 2. The new Messenger is currently available in Australia, India, Indonesia, South Africa, and Venezuela, with plans to expand to the United States and other countries. 3. Some speculate that Facebook's new Messenger could threaten traditional text messaging; however, it faces multiple obstacles, such as adoption hurdles and competition from well-established messaging apps like WhatsApp and Viber. 4. To truly pose a threat to text messaging, Facebook Messenger would need tighter smartphone integration similar to Apple's iMessage, which is currently not possible unless Facebook produces its own smartphones. 5.

Overnight the clouds had rolled in and the summer was dead. I sat at my office window and drank coffee, looking out on a dirty brown Saturday that smelled like rain.

There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn't one of them! It's a shame The Child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). This is all well and good, except for the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. There's really not much I can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it.

The financial literacy series concluded with a discussion on college savings plans, and the show also examined the science behind tornadoes as storm season began in the U.S. - In the wake of the tragic South Korean ferry sinking, the prime minister of South Korea resigned, citing remorse for the government's handling of the crisis. - History was made in the Roman Catholic Church with the canonization of two popes, as Pope Francis declared both John XXIII and John Paul II as saints, describing them as \\"men of courage.\\" - Ukraine seemed to brace for war, with the prime minister blaming Russia's recent actions for the escalating tensions. Meanwhile, the U.S. president expressed concern about the situation and called for international support. Russian leaders accused the West of orchestrating the crisis. - \\"Tornado Alley,\\" an area located in the central U.S., is particularly prone to tornado activity due to a combination of factors such as warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from the Rocky Mountains. Tornado activity in March 2014 was lower than average, possibly due to a long-lasting cold-air system. - A 529 Savings Plan is designed to help families save for college, offering tax advantages over traditional savings accounts.

However, adulteration and use of spurious materials as substitutes have become a major concern for users and industry for reasons of safety and efficacy. Therefore, authentication of medicinal plants is of utmost importance. Morphological, anatomical, chemical and DNA markers solve the problem by differentiating the genuine material from the adulterants, substitutes and spurious drugs. DNA markers use nucleotide sequences to identify species; it takes preference over the other two markers being not age dependent, tissue specific and having a higher discriminating power. Therefore, characterization of plants with such markers is an ideal approach for identification of medicinal plant species and populations/varieties of the same species. Availability of certified taxonomic specimens in herbaria is certainly required for unambiguous confirmation through final visual comparison and analysis.

Solve this math problem Solve -55*n + 3912 = 33*n + 4352 for n.","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step like we're talking to a five-year-old. We start with -55*n + 3912 = 33*n + 4352.   1. First, we want to put all the n's together on one side and the regular numbers on the other side. So, let's move 33*n to the other side to join -55*n. We do this by subtracting 33*n on both sides. -55*n - 33*n + 3912 = 4352 2. Now we have -55*n - 33*n, let's combine them! -55 - 33 is -88, so our expression becomes: -88*n + 3912 = 4352 3. Next, we want to isolate n, so let's move the 3912 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides. -88*n = 4352 - 3912 4. Now, let's find the difference! 4352 - 3912 is equal to 440. So, now we have: -88*n = 440 5. To find the value of n, we need to get rid of the -88. So, we'll divide both sides by -88 because that's the opposite of multiplying. n = 440 / -88 6. And finally, when we divide 440 by -88, we get -5. So: n = -5 And there you have it! We've solved the math problem, and the answer is n = -5."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Specifically, voltage is the potential difference between two points in an electrical circuit, and it represents the amount of energy required to move a unit charge from one point to another.

The US Library of Congress is the registration authority for ISO 639 - 2 ( referred to as ISO 639 - 2/RA ) . As registration authority , the LOC receives and reviews proposed changes ; they also have representation on the ISO 639 - RA Joint Advisory Committee responsible for maintaining the ISO 639 code tables .  - ISO 639-1:2002, \\"Codes for the representation of names of languages  Part 1: Alpha-2 code\\", is the first part of the ISO 639 series of international standards for language codes. Part 1 covers the registration of two-letter codes. There are 184 two-letter codes registered as of October 2015. The registered codes cover the world's major languages.  - The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international standard-setting body composed of representatives from various national standards organizations.  - ISO 639 is a set of international standards that lists short codes for language names. The following is a complete list of three-letter codes defined in part two (ISO 639-2) of the standard, including the corresponding two-letter (ISO 639-1) codes where they exist.  - Language is the ability to acquire and use complex systems of communication, particularly the human ability to do so, and a language is any specific example of such a system. The scientific study of language is called linguistics. Questions concerning the philosophy of language, such as whether words can represent experience, have been debated since Gorgias and Plato in Ancient Greece. Thinkers such as Rousseau have argued that language originated from emotions while others like Kant have held that it originated from rational and logical thought. 20th-century philosophers such as Wittgenstein argued that philosophy is really the study of language. Major figures in linguistics include Ferdinand de Saussure and Noam Chomsky.    'iso 639-2' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

Please answer the following question: Answer the question below:   If Milo is holding two objects close together and he decides to move them closer together, what happens to the gravitational force between the objects increases or decreases?    Assuming that:  The gravitational force between two objects decreases as the objects move further apart. A:","output":"Step 1: Understand the user's question. The user wants to know whether the gravitational force between two objects held by Milo increases or decreases when they are moved closer together. Step 2: Recall the principle governing the gravitational force. According to the law of universal gravitation, the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Step 3: Apply the principle to the scenario. In this scenario, Milo moves the two objects closer together, which means the distance between their centers is decreasing. Step 4: Determine the effect of decreasing the distance on the gravitational force. Since the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects, when the distance decreases, the gravitational force between the objects will increase. Step 5: Provide the answer to the user's question. The gravitational force between the objects Milo is holding increases as he moves them closer together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: the burning candle on which to melt wax","output":"In the sentence \\"the burning candle on which to melt wax,\\" the most important words are \\"burning,\\" \\"candle,\\" \\"melt,\\" and \\"wax.\\" These words are crucial in understanding the meaning and focus of the sentence, as they describe the central subject (\\"candle\\") and its condition (\\"burning\\"), as well as the purpose for which it is being used (\\"melt wax\\"). In addition, these words carry the primary information that someone looking to understand the purpose of the burning candle needs to grasp. 1. \\"Burning\\": This word is important because it indicates the state of the candle - that it is currently lit and producing heat and light. This word helps distinguish the candle from a non-burning or unlit candle, which would not serve the same purpose or have the same effects. 2. \\"Candle\\": The central subject of the sentence, \\"candle\\" identifies the object being described. As a familiar, commonplace object, the reader should immediately understand the candle's basic properties, such as its shape, composition (usually a wax core with a wick), and its function to produce light and heat when lit. Without the mention of \\"candle,\\" the sentence would be vague, and it would be unclear what is meant by \\"burning\\" and \\"melt wax.\\" 3. \\"Melt\\": This word describes the action that the burning candle is intended to perform. It indicates that the candle's purpose in this context is to change the state of some wax, typically by generating heat to liquefy it. \\"Melt\\" helps to clarify the function of the burning candle in this specific situation, providing context for its use. 4. \\"Wax\\": \\"Wax\\" represents the material that the burning candle is expected to affect. Most candles are made of wax, but in this sentence, it's essential to understand that there is additional wax meant to be melted by the burning candle. The combination of \\"melt\\" and \\"wax\\" emphasizes the purpose of the described scenario - to use the candle's heat to transform the wax from a solid to a liquid state. Each of these words serves a critical function in conveying the core message of the sentence. Together, the words \\"burning,\\" \\"candle,\\" \\"melt,\\" and \\"wax\\" fully express the idea of a candle actively being used to heat and melt a separate portion of wax."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Andrew Ross, 48, died after suffering severe brain damage during an operation to remove excess skin. An obese man died after suffering severe brain damage when he was put to sleep for surgery to remove excess skin, the result of a gastric band operation. Andrew Ross' weight dropped from 41 to 26 stone after the surgery in 2008, an inquest heard. The 48-year-old former fork-lift truck driver from Wythenshawe, who weighed 26 stone, was admitted to the private Spire Manchester Hospital for treatment to remove excess skin from his abdomen. It followed a gastric bypass operation carried out in 2008. At that point, he weighed around 41 stone and had a body mass index of 67, three times what it should have been. But the inquest heard ‘complications’ quickly arose after he was anaesthetised for the apronectomy procedure and he went into cardiac arrest for around 10 minutes. Mr Ross, who had four children and three step-children, was revived but suffered brain damage, his ex-wife Christine Blay told the hearing. He was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit at Wythenshawe Hospital then transferred to the specialist Dermot Murphy care home in Withington, where he had 24-hour care. He died in hospital on August 10 after developing bronchial pneumonia. The inquest heard Mr Ross had a very large heart due to his obesity and high blood pressure. Mrs Blay, 49, his wife for 11 years, said his weight rose after he stopped working following a fall. He also suffered asthma and diabetes. Coroner Nigel Meadows was told that the surgery was approved and he went for a pre-operative anaesthesia assessment a week before, where he was classed as high risk. Mrs Blay said that after he was admitted she was told that the operation hadn’t gone ahead and he was in a critical condition after a ‘cardiac event’. The inquest heard Mr Ross’s heart stopped during an attempt to intubate him, or insert a tube down his throat. The operation in March 2011 followed gastric band surgery in 2008, after which Mr Ross' weight fell from 41 to 26 stone, an inquest at Manchester Coroners' Court heard. Pictured is the private Spire Hospital in Manchester. Anaesthetist Dr Deborah Nolan said there was a high risk of complication because he was morbidly obese. It was a ‘difficult intubation’ after relaxant and anaesthetic drugs were given before his oxygen levels dropped, the inquest heard. He was immediately given oxygen but his heart rate dropped, Dr Nolan said. She said she had given him sufficient amounts of anaesthetics and had reacted in a ‘appropriate and timely’ way. The inquest continues.","output":"A man named Andrew Ross, who used to weigh a lot, had surgery to help him lose weight. After the surgery, he needed another operation to remove some extra skin. During this operation, he was given medicine to help him sleep, but then his heart had trouble and stopped for a short time. The doctors helped him, but he suffered brain damage from not having enough oxygen. Later, he got very sick and sadly passed away.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A small ,white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree and it has been there for the past ten years or so. It all began because my husband Justin hated Christmas--oh, not the true meaning of Christmas.Overspending was one thing, but compared to the difficult experience of choosing gifts--running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and a pair of gloves for Grandma...,spending money is nothing. I felt too tired to think of any special gifts. Knowing Justin felt the same way, I decided one year not to buy the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so on. I reached for something special just for Justin. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling  at the junior level at the school he attended; and shortly before Christmas, there was a match against a team sponsored   by an inner-city church.These youngsters, dressed in such worn-out shoes that shoe strings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, while our boys were in their blue and gold uniforms and new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was shocked to see that the other team were wrestling without wearing helmets   to protect their ears. Well, our boys ended up defeating them. We took every weight class. Justin, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, \\"I wish just one of them could have won,\\" he said. \\"They have a lot potential   , but losing like this could take the heart out of them.\\" Justin loved kids--all kids, and he knew them, having coached little league football and baseball. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought different kinds of wrestling helmets and shoes. I sent them to inner-city church without leaving my name. On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Justin what I had done and that was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year and since then the envelope has become the highlight of our Christmas.

They both decided to join the Girl Scouts, which is a group where girls learn new skills, make new friends, and do fun activities. One of the things Girl Scouts do is selling cookies to raise money for their group. Now, Rebecca joined the Girl Scouts before Laura, which means she became a part of the group earlier than her friend. So, we can choose the option where the story goes like this: [1] Rebecca has more experience selling yummy but overpriced cookies. Since Rebecca joined the Girl Scouts first, she had a chance to sell cookies for a longer time. Laura, on the other hand, is still new to the group and figuring out how to sell the cookies in the best possible way. Even though their cookies are a little expensive, people love buying them because they taste really good and they help the Girl Scouts do more fun activities and learn new things. Plus, it feels good to help out by buying a box of cookies! Rebecca, being a good friend, decided to share her cookie-selling secrets with Laura, like the best spots in town to set up a cookie stand and how to talk to people about the delicious cookies they have to offer.

After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain.  When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\"  He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production.  There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again.  Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point.  I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\"  However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was.  According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that.  This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound.

The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen.  I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\"  The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Choose a long, heavy overcoat for cold weather and bundle up. The primary purpose of an overcoat is to act as a warm outer layer. For this end, materials like wool, cashmere, and fleece will work best. Look for thick fabrics, strong seams and additional features like belts, buttons and high collars you can use to envelope yourself when it gets brisk.  Overcoats pair well with hats, gloves, scarves and other formal cold weather gear.  Nicer types like Chesterfields and Polos are ideal for wearing over a suit, which can be difficult to layer effectively in the winter. Another function of overcoats is to create a barrier between you and the outside world. They provide enough coverage to cut down on wind chill, are sturdy enough to protect you from moisture and everyday contact, and act as a membrane to keep your formal items from getting dirty. An overcoat can lend you peace of mind knowing that you and your clothing will remain protected and pristine beneath it.  If you think your lifestyle might be rough on an overcoat, try out materials like cotton twill, waxed canvas or even leather. These tough fabrics are resistant to wear and tear and are generally easy to clean. Safeguard leather overcoats with a protective coating of oil to make them water-resistant. Go for an overcoat over a fleece jacket or windbreaker the next time you need to make a good impression. Overcoats are one kind of formal garment that never goes out of style. You’ll look much more suave wearing a well-fitted, sensible overcoat than you would in plain outerwear, or caught unprepared for chilly weather in only a suit.  Black, charcoal gray and navy blue should be your go-to color choices for formal dress.  An overcoat can and should be worn in place of inappropriately casual jackets whenever possible. While overcoats have become a less prevalent fashion choice in contemporary times, they are still regarded as the peak of men’s business and formal style. You’ll stand out from the crowd and be taken seriously as a man of refinement once you add a nice overcoat to your coat rack. It’s a good way to inject some classic style into your wardrobe, and you’re sure to turn heads when you walk past a crowd of people all wearing the same thing. Go for modern styles and materials and an accentuated fit. Overcoats are marked by a somewhat vintage aesthetic and can look like a novelty if they’re not chosen carefully. Summary:","output":"Choose a heavy, stylish overcoat made from materials like wool, cashmere, or fleece for cold weather protection and to make a strong impression in formal settings, featuring strong seams, extra features like belts and high collars for added warmth, pairing well with other cold weather gear, and prioritizing modern styles and materials for a refined, timeless look."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the reviewer, the employees at this particular establishment are \\"a bunch of idiots and rude people.\\" Such a description implies that the staff may be lacking the level of professionalism and courtesy expected from a restaurant.

Hoping to rebound from their divisional home loss to the Eagles, the Redskins traveled to Texas Stadium for a Week 11 NFC East showdown with the Dallas Cowboys. In the first quarter, the Redskins struck first when quarterback Jason Campbell completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end Chris Cooley for the only score in the quarter. In the second quarter, the Cowboys tied the game with quarterback Tony Romo completing a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Terrell Owens.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: While each person will experience different effects from a stroke, hemiparesis (or weakness) of the whole side or just the arm or leg is a common result of a stroke. In addition, problems with balance and coordination are common, too. Thus, adjustments may need to be made to ensure that your loved one (who may now have mobility difficulties) can easily access her house. When attempting to make your house stroke-survivor-friendly, consider the following suggestions:  Move the person’s bed to the ground floor so that she can avoid having to use the stairs, where falls are more likely to occur. Clear a path to all essential rooms (including  bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen). Less clutter will mean that your loved one is less likely to fall. This includes removing area rugs. Install a seat in the shower to allow her to sit while bathing. Additionally, install handrails to assist with getting in and out of the tub and/or shower as well as by toilet to help her get up and down if needed. Make a bedpan readily available at her bedside. Encourage use of this commode, especially if the person feels off-balance or disoriented as this can avoid falls which could further injure the patient. If stairs cannot be avoided, install handrails around the stairs to assist your loved one move up and down. The person's physical therapist should be working with the person to re-learn how to navigate her environment, including going up and down stairs. A new deficiency in mobility is one of the most common issues faced by stroke survivors. A person who was once very mobile and independent may be reduced to slow, unsteady walking or even be largely bed-bound after a stroke. Expect your loved one to require some assistance moving around for at least a period of time after a stroke.  Assistive devices can be used to better facilitate mobility. Family members can consult a physical therapist in order to find out which assistive devices would best suit the stroke survivor. These devices could include a wheelchair, walker, or cane depending on the severity of mobility issues.  Support and encourage your loved one in his attempts to be mobile. Celebrate any reduction in dependence on assistive devices. Falls and accidents after a stroke are, unfortunately, very common. Make your loved one’s safety a priority to avoid any unnecessary side effects or complications that are related to, but not a direct result of, her stroke.  Put up rails around the stroke survivor’s bed and lower the level of the bed as necessary. The rails should be up at night to prevent any falls due to imbalance or disorientation, and the bed can be lowered to avoid the need to “climb” into bed. If something that is frequently used (for example, pots and pans) are located somewhere that is hard to access (like in a high cabinet), move them. Make commonly used items in locations that are easy for your loved one to access. Be present to assist with tree trimming, snow shoveling, house painting, or any other activities that put your loved one at an increased risk for an accident after her stroke. Dysphagia is the medical term that means a person is experiencing difficulty swallowing. After a stroke, eating or drinking can become difficult because the muscles of chewing and swallowing can be weakened (this is particularly true immediately after a stroke). Thus, it is important to help your loved one adapt to new habits of eating and drinking to ensure he is getting adequate nutrition.  After a stroke, it is common to have a nasogastric feeding tube in the early stages; however, in especially severe cases, a feeding tube will be a permanent requirement in order for the stroke survivor to receive the necessary nutrients. If the stroke survivor is feeding through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube — a tube used for feeding that is inserted directly in the stomach- make sure that the tube is intact, functioning properly, and protected from infection and from pulling by the patient. Your loved one will need to undergo a test called a swallowing study, which will allow his doctor to assess his ability to swallow food. Speech therapy and x-rays are used to help the doctor determine when it is safe for the patient to move from liquids to thick, soft foods. When your loved one is able to eat without assistance of a medical device, feed him thick, soft food. Stroke survivors who are starting to feed orally must start with this type of food to prevent aspiration pneumonia. There are liquid thickeners in the market that can help make soup and juice thicker. You can also use items in your kitchen like gelatin, cornmeal, and oats. Keep your loved one upright while eating in order to prevent aspiration pneumonia, which occurs when food is inhaled into the lungs. Because his muscles involved with swallowing are weak, his position for eating is even more important. This will ensure mealtimes are safe and remain a fun part of the day. A stroke may change the control your loved one has over her bladder and bowels. This can create safety problems (for example, infections or sores) and can also be a sore subject or one that causes great embarrassment. As a caretaker, it is important to recognize if these issues are occurring and address them with your loved one in order to help her on the road to recovery.  For stroke survivors that are unable to use a commode or go to the bathroom, adult diapers may be used. These can be found in almost any drug store or grocery store. Encourage your loved one to wear one if necessary until she regains control of her bodily functions. You will need to assist your loved one by making sure the diaper is changed immediately after each time she voids or has a bowel movement. Otherwise she may experience skin breakdown and sores and potential infection in the area. Most stroke survivors have certain levels of communication impairment, at least temporarily. The severity of the stroke may determine how severe the communication impairment is. Some stroke patients might not be able to express themselves correctly, while others might not be able to understand what is being said. Due to paralysis, some stroke survivors might not be able to say words properly, though the cognitive aspect of their communication is functioning. It is important to help your loved one deal with communication issues.  Before considering speech impairment, make sure that the stroke survivor does not have any hearing difficulty. This can also be a cause of communication difficulty and often can be corrected with the use of a hearing aid. Learn about the different types of communication issues. For example, recognize if your loved one is suffering from aphasia (where the individual can think clearly, but has trouble getting her messages in and out) or apraxia (where the individual has difficulty putting speech sounds together in the correct way). Use short words and nonverbal communication such as hand gestures, nodding or shaking, pointing, or even showing objects. The patient should not be asked too many questions at once and should be given ample time to respond to any communication. Accept any form of communication as valid.  Visual aids can be used for communication — this includes charts, alphabet boards, electronic media, objects and pictures. This can help your loved one overcome the frustration associated with not being able to communicate effectively. Establishing a daily routine can make impairments such as communication less frustrating. If the stroke survivor knows the routine for the day, he anticipates the activities and the family anticipates his needs. This can relieve stress for both the patient and those caring for him. Strokes can have emotional as well as physical effects. First, strokes can result in personality changes that can negatively affect relationships. Second, strokes can result in post-stroke mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA). As a caregiver, it is important to be vigilant and take notice of any emotional changes in your loved one.  Depression strikes between one- and two-thirds of stroke survivors, while PBA affects approximately one-quarter to one-half of survivors.  Get treatment for your loved one if necessary. Medication and counseling have benefitted many stroke survivors and is often covered by insurance.","output":"This article gives suggestions on how to make a home safer and more comfortable for a person who had a stroke, as they may have difficulty moving, talking, eating, or controlling their emotions, and might need help with daily activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The official currency of the People's Republic of China is called the Chinese Yuan (CNY). The term \\"Yuan\\" (元) translates to \\"round object\\" or \\"round coin\\" in English, which signifies the tradition of using coinage in China. Apart from Yuan, you may hear people using the term \\"Renminbi\\" (RMB), which means \\"people's currency.\\" Please note that while both these terms refer to the same currency, Renminbi is the official name of the currency, and Yuan stands for the unit in which Renminbi is denominated. The Chinese financial system operates under a decimal currency structure, with each Yuan being further divided into smaller units called Jiao (角) and Fen (分). 1 Yuan equals 10 Jiao, and one Jiao contains 10 Fen. Hence, one Yuan is equal to 100 Fen. It is similar to how the US dollar is divided into 100 cents. The Bank of China, which is the country's central bank, is responsible for handling all matters related to monetary policy, including the regulation, circulation, and maintenance of the value of the Chinese Yuan. The currency is available in both banknotes and coins in various denominations. Banknotes come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 Yuan, as well as in 1, 2, and 5 Jiao. The banknotes often feature the portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China, on the obverse side. The reverse sides often depict various Chinese landscapes and cultural symbols. Coins, on the other hand, are available in denominations of 1 Yuan, 1, 2, and 5 Jiao, and 1, 2, and 5 Fen. The coins are typically designed with a flower pattern on one side, while the denomination and the national emblem are on the opposite side. It's important to be aware that the Chinese Yuan operates under a managed floating exchange rate system. This means that the exchange rate is determined by market forces with some influence from the government through the central bank. Due to this mechanism, the value of the Yuan may fluctuate against other currencies, such as the US Dollar, the Euro, or the Japanese Yen. As a traveler or someone interested in doing business with China, understanding the value and conversion rates of the Chinese Yuan may prove to be helpful during financial transactions. To find the current conversion rates, you can consult reliable sources like financial newspapers, websites, or mobile applications that provide up-to-date exchange rates."},{"instruction":"How long ago was it…?

Article: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese   telecom group claims. Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region. \\"Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage   of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,\\" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu. The installation   will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year. Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain. \\"This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,\\" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell. The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe. Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. TeliaSonera said it planned to invest  100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population. The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile.

In this context, the correct answer to the question is Li Guang (砺光), a famous Chinese general and prominent military commander of the Western Han dynasty. Li Guang, also known as the \\"Flying General,\\" was known for his expertise in archery and his exceptional battlefield tactics. He was born in 236 BC and died in 106 BC. Over his long military career, Li Guang participated in several campaigns against the Xiongnu, a tribal confederation of nomadic people who inhabited the eastern Eurasian Steppe and posed a constant threat to the Chinese empire. Throughout his campaigns, Li Guang faced many difficulties and suffered numerous losses. Unfortunately, after a failed campaign in 106 BC, Li Guang's troops suffered from hunger and, in a desperate bid, he ordered his troops to eat their horses to survive. The campaign's failure led Li Guang to lose his command, and he was eventually court-martialed. Unable to cope with the dishonor and his subsequent demotion, Li Guang took his own life in 106 BC. In conclusion, the given statement does not include any information related to Li Guang or his death, and therefore, it does not answer the question about which Han commander died in 106 BC.

Tax authorities say Ai's design firm, Beijing Fake Cultural Development, owes £1.5m in back taxes and fines. Ai disputes this and says he does not own the company involved.

Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel, The Great Gatsby, grew up in Louisville, Kentucky in a wealthy and privileged family. Daisy's upbringing, like that of many wealthy young women of the early 20th century America, took place in a society that was characterized by its traditional values, social hierarchy, and emphasis on wealth and status. It is within this cultural context that Daisy's character was shaped. Daisy's Louisville was an affluent city in the southern United States during the early 1900s. It was known for its opulent mansions, lavish parties, and distinguished families. Consequently, Daisy's upbringing was likely imbued with a strong sense of tradition, high society, and social graces. This environment cultivated her desire for wealth and social standing, which eventually played a significant role in her life choices.  As a member of the privileged class, Daisy lived a relatively sheltered life that revolved around attending boarding schools, social events, and engaging in leisure activities typical for girls from her milieu. Such pursuits might have included horseback riding, playing tennis or golf, and participating in charity events. These activities reinforced her role in high society, where women were expected to be beautiful, ornamental, and dependent on the men in their lives. Daisy's character is often described as charming, vivacious, and somewhat careless. These traits, combined with her upbringing, contributed to her ultimately marrying Tom Buchanan, an immensely wealthy man from an equally illustrious background. This union ties Daisy's fate to the privileged life she has always known. However, Daisy's feelings of emptiness and disillusionment with her insubstantial existence become evident as the story unfolds, especially concerning her love affair with Jay Gatsby. Daisy's turbulent emotions, which drive the novel's central conflict, can be traced back to her Louisville upbringing. Here, she first fell in love with Gatsby when he was a young military officer stationed at Camp Taylor near Louisville. At that time, Gatsby was a poor young man, relying on his ambition and dreams to provide a brighter future for himself and the woman he loved. Despite being deeply in love, Daisy was unable to marry Gatsby due to her family's expectations and her own preoccupation with wealth and social status. This history between Daisy and Gatsby ultimately resurfaces years later, leading to the climactic events and the tragic outcome of the novel. In summary, Daisy Buchanan's upbringing in Louisville, Kentucky, shaped her character and values within the context of the privileged society of early 20th century America. Her experiences and choices, influenced by the wealth, status, and traditions of her social class, made her who she is in the novel, ultimately leading to the tragic consequences of The Great Gatsby."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against  Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles.  Question: \\"What was done in order to minimize collateral damage in Kandahar in December of 1998?\\" Response: \\"Not use AC-130 gunships\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The passage states that cruise missiles were not used in Kandahar in December 1998 due to fear of collateral damage. However, it does mention that plans were developed for using AC-130 gunships instead of cruise missile strikes because they had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. The correct response should be: \\"Cruise missiles were not used, and plans were developed for using AC-130 gunships instead, as they had a lower risk of causing collateral damage.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: A man is playing the piano. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","output":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis given the premise. The hypothesis is a statement or a suggestion that might eventually be proven true, usually formed from an analysis or observation and often to provide a basis for further understanding or investigation. In this case, the premise states that a man is sitting in a chair playing a guitar. The key elements here are a man, a chair, and most importantly, a guitar.  Given these elements, any hypothesis derived should logically relate to these elements. However, the proposed hypothesis states the man is playing the piano, which is not related to the major elements of the premise. There are a few reasons why we can't conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise: 1) The premise involves a man playing a guitar, not a piano: Guitar and piano are different musical instruments with different mechanisms of producing sound. The act of playing the guitar involves techniques distinct from those used in playing a piano. 2) The setting and position could be different: Generally, playing a guitar can happen in various sitting or standing positions, and it isn't dependent on a fixed structure. In contrast, playing the piano frequently involves a specific seated position in front of the instrument, which is typically immovable or less portable than a guitar. 3) The skills required are different: Playing the guitar mainly involves the use of both hands to fret and strum or pick at the strings. On the other hand, playing the piano involves using both hands to press keys, often simultaneously reading bass and treble clef, which is fundamentally different from guitar tablatures or chord diagrams. So, from the facts given in the premise, there's no logical reason to assume or conclude that the man could be playing the piano instead of the guitar. If the hypothesis were to be valid, the premise would need some mention or suggestion of a piano, which it does not. Therefore, from the premise that a man is sitting in a chair playing guitar, we cannot conclude that a man is playing the piano."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Planet A emitted a lot of air pollution, destroying its ozone layer, while Planet B respected the environment and used ecological products.  Which planet had higher levels of UV reaching it?  Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information indicating that air pollution destroys the ozone layer and results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching the planet's surface, Planet A, which emitted a lot of air pollution and destroyed its ozone layer, would have higher levels of UV radiation reaching it compared to Planet B which respected the environment and used ecological products. The destruction of the ozone layer on Planet A led to an increased vulnerability to UV radiation's harmful effects on life forms and ecosystems, while Planet B was better protected due to the maintenance of a healthier ozone layer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The woman lying on her back might be a trainee or client who is receiving instruction or guidance from the professional. Step 3: Analyze possible actions Given the context and setting, the next likely action could be the woman lying down beginning an exercise or workout routine under the guidance of the kneeling woman. This could involve stretching, core exercises, strength training, or any other type of workout.

Add a second nut to the hook and bring the pendulum back to where you marked on the paper the first time. When you release the pendulum, start a stopwatch and count the number of oscillations for 1 minute. Repeat the process 5 times, then calculate your average.  Notice the difference in the number of oscillations and the average between 1 nut on the hook and 2 nuts on the hook. Add another nut and repeat the experiment to see if even more mass will affect the pendulum’s oscillations. Go back to just 1 nut on the hook, bring the string back about 10 inches (25 cm), and make a mark on the paper taped behind it so you can repeat the experiment from the same distance. Release the pendulum and count the number of oscillations for 1 minute. Repeat the process 5 times and calculate an average.  You may be surprised to learn that the distance (also called amplitude) does not affect the swing rate, or number of oscillations. Try the experiment again from 5 inches (13 cm) and find the average number of oscillations to see how much of a difference the distance makes. Slide the look off of the pencil and cut off 10 inches (25 cm) of string, tie another loop, and put it back on the pencil. Then bring the pendulum back about 10 inches (25 cm) and mark on the paper where you release it from. Repeat the experiment 5 times and find the average number of oscillations to see how the length of the string affects the pendulum.  Cut off another 10 inches (25 cm) of string to see the difference it makes on the average number of oscillations. The length from which a pendulum is suspended helps determine the speed and regularity of the swings, which is why pendulums have been used to keep time.

Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression.

Migration Period art denotes the artwork of the Germanic peoples during the Migration period (ca. 300-900). It includes the Migration art of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the Insular art or Hiberno-Saxon art of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic fusion in the British Isles. It covers many different styles of art including the polychrome style and the animal style. In the 3rd century the Roman Empire almost collapsed and its army was becoming increasingly Germanic in make-up, so that in the 4th century when Huns pushed German tribes westward, they spilled across the Empire's borders and began to settle there. The Visigoths settled in Italy and then Spain, in the north the Franks settled into Gaul and western Germany, and in the 5th century Scandinavians such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes invaded Britain. By the close of the 6th century the Western Roman Empire was almost completely replaced with smaller less politically organized, but vigorous, Germanic kingdoms.  Although these kingdoms were never homogeneous, they shared certain common cultural features. They settled in their new lands and become farmers and fishermen. Archaeological evidence shows no tradition of monumental artwork, such as architecture or large sculpture in permanent materials, but a preference instead for \\"mobile\\" art for personal display, usually also with a practical function, such as weapons, horse harness, tools, and jewelry which fastened clothes. The surviving art of the Germanic peoples is almost entirely personal adornment, portable, and before conversion to Christianity was buried with its owner. Much art in organic materials has no doubt not survived.  Three styles dominate Germanic art. The polychrome style originated with the Goths who had settled in the Black Sea area. The animal style was found in Scandinavia, north Germany and England. Finally there was Insular art or the Hiberno-Saxon style, a brief but prosperous period after Christianization that saw the fusion of animal style, Celtic, Mediterranean and other motifs and techniques. Can you clarify how the art is portable?","output":"Certainly! \\"Portable\\" in this context refers to the fact that Migration Period art was typically not large or fixed installations like monumental sculptures or architectural elements, but rather, smaller and easily transportable objects. These objects could be carried or worn by their owners and would often accompany them wherever they went. The Germanic tribes and peoples who were on the move during the Migration Period valued personal adornment and practical objects that could be easily transported with them as they journeyed to new lands. Examples of such portable art include: 1. Jewelry: Necklaces, bracelets, brooches, rings, and other ornaments that could be worn on the body. 2. Decorated weapons: Swords, shields, and axes embellished with intricate designs, often having practical functions. 3. Horse harness and equipment: Horse bridles, buckles, and fittings decorated with ornate patterns and symbols. 4. Everyday tools: Knives, combs, belt buckles, and other functional items adorned with artistic elements. 5. Manuscripts and codices: In the case of Insular art, illuminated manuscripts containing detailed illustrations and calligraphy were also considered portable and could be transported easily. These portable art pieces were often created using materials like metal, wood, bone, and ivory, which allowed for durable and intricate designs. Due to their size, these objects would be more likely to remain intact and be preserved for future generations to discover, especially if they were buried with their owners upon their death.

It carries genetic information and instructions required to build, maintain and reproduce various structures and functions within a cell. The DNA molecule is composed of a long, double-stranded chain made from four types of nucleotide bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). These bases pair together, A with T and C with G, forming units known as base pairs. The sequence of base pairs in a DNA molecule forms the genetic code. Gene segments are specific sections of this DNA sequence that carry the information required to build proteins. Proteins play a crucial role in the cell by acting as enzymes, structural components, signaling messengers, and performing a wide variety of other functions. Essentially, genes serve as blueprints for the production of these proteins, ensuring proper cellular function and sustaining life. The process of converting genetic instructions into proteins involves two main steps - transcription and translation. Transcription is the process by which the genetic information contained in a gene segment is copied into a precursor molecule known as messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA then undergoes further modifications to form a mature mRNA molecule, which carries the information out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm of the cell. Translation is the second step, wherein the genetic code in the mRNA molecule is translated into a sequence of amino acids. This process takes place in the cell's ribosomes, which are responsible for reading the mRNA sequence and assembling the corresponding amino acids to form a protein. Once the protein is synthesized, it can then perform its specific function within the cell. In conclusion, the best answer to the question is gene segments, as they contain the encoded instructions within DNA molecules that direct cellular processes by determining the production of proteins necessary for proper functioning and maintenance of cells and organisms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What will Lee want to do next?  Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: sit down and rest  B: want to go through the garbage  C: want to take care of the garbage Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it can be inferred that Lee has already completed the task of picking up and disposing his garbage. As such, the possible options for what Lee might want to do next could involve either A: sitting down and resting, B: wanting to go through the garbage, or C: wanting to take care of the garbage. Considering option B, the context specifies that Lee has already gone through the garbage, which means he has completed the process of sorting it and disposing of it accordingly. Given this information, it is unlikely that Lee would want to go through the garbage once more, as he has already completed this task. Option C suggests that Lee would want to take care of the garbage. However, the context provided clearly states that Lee has already thrown away all of his garbage after picking it up. Therefore, this option is also unlikely, as the task of taking care of the garbage has been addressed. This leaves us with option A: sitting down and resting. Since Lee has completed the task of picking up and disposing all of his garbage, it is reasonable to assume that he might want to sit down and rest after having finished this chore.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Early one morning, more than a hundred years ago, an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep. He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed  and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day. However, the unconscious part expresses itself through its own logic and its own language.. It uses strange images which the conscious part may not understand at first. This is why dreams are sometimes called \\"secret messages to ourselves\\".

Let's analyze the sentence in detail to support this conclusion. The sentence reads, \\"exactly what it wants to be: an atrociously, mind-numbingly, indescribably bad movie.\\" Here, the core sentiment is focused on the characterization of the movie being discussed. The movie is described with several negatively connotated adjectives: 1. Atrociously: This word generally implies something terrible, awful, or of extremely poor quality. It typically portrays a sense of horror or unsatisfactory nature. 2. Mind-numbingly: This term suggests that the movie is so monotonous or uninteresting that it numbs the viewer's mind. It refers to a lack of entertainment or stimulation. 3. Indescribably: While this term itself is not inherently negative, it is used here in conjunction with negative words to emphasize the extent to which the movie is bad. 4. Bad: This is a straightforward negative term, which suggests that the movie is not good or of high quality. The sentence begins with the phrase \\"exactly what it wants to be,\\" which might initially seem like a positive or neutral statement. However, the string of negative adjectives that follows indicate that the acknowledgment of the movie's intentions is not meant as praise or appreciation. Instead, it portrays that the movie has achieved the undesirable qualities it apparently sought to embody.

It would be hard to find a person who is neutral  ,or simply doesn't care one way or the other. What I wonder is why something even without legs causes such great fear. Snakes are quite useful, but that doesn't seem to matter. Snakes help control the population of mice. Without snakes, perhaps we would find mice everywhere. Most of us, however, would rather see a mouse than a snake. The poison argument   is a strong one. Some snakes are poisonous, and this causes people's death. However, the poisonous snakes are only a small number. We can't say all the snakes are bad just because of a few dangerous ones. And what do we do with the people who really like snakes? They like snakes even more strongly than we dislike them. These people learn about them, find them out, and watch them carefully. Why? The only reason I can think of is that these people are open-minded. They are able to put aside differences and welcome the snake as a friend. Whatever the reason for our like or dislike, snakes do something good in the circle of life. They would prefer to be left alone, and that is what we should do. If you're lucky, you might not run across more than a few of them in a lifetime. That would be fine with most of us. Although some snakes are poisonous,   _  . A) they cause many people's death B) they control the population of mice C) they are not dangerous to people D) they are only a small number Answer:","output":"D) they are only a small number Snakes, despite their intimidating appearance and the fear they elicit in many people, serve an important role in the ecosystem they inhabit. The fear these creatures spark in humans can be attributed to various factors such as their appearance, movement, and the potential danger posed by venomous species. However, it is essential to acknowledge the minority of venomous snakes and emphasize the significance of snakes as a whole. One of the primary reasons snakes are particularly feared is their unique appearance and method of movement. They lack legs, which sets them apart from most other animals, and they slither across the ground in a manner that can be unsettling to some. Humans tend to fear the unknown or things that deviate from the norm, so their distinctive appearance and movement contribute to the overall fear associated with snakes. Another contributing factor to the fear of snakes is the risk posed by venomous snakes. Although only a small percentage of snakes are venomous, their bites can be dangerous and, in some cases, lethal to humans. This danger is heightened by the fact that it can be difficult for the average person to distinguish between venomous and non-venomous snake species, leading to an inherent fear of all snakes. However, it is important to recognize that the majority of snakes are not venomous and do not pose such risks. The benefits of snakes within ecosystems should not be understated. They help control the population of rodents and other pests, thus maintaining a balance within the food chain. Without snakes, rodent populations could increase substantially, leading to a range of problems, such as crop damage and the spread of diseases. For those who appreciate and even admire snakes, it is often a case of open-mindedness and curiosity. They may view snakes as fascinating creatures and appreciate their unique characteristics and the role they play in their ecosystems. By learning about and understanding snakes, these individuals can move past the initial fear or apprehension that many people experience. In conclusion, while the fear of snakes may be prevalent, it is crucial to recognize the importance of these creatures in the ecosystems they inhabit. As only a small number of snakes are venomous, it is unjustified to fear all snakes based on the potential danger of a minority of species. By understanding and respecting the role of snakes in nature, humans can learn to coexist with them and appreciate their contributions to environmental balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants.  I am facing a new situation today: Demetrious is conducting chemical reactions for his community college chemistry laboratory course. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide.

Definition: Given a scientific question, generate a correct answer to it. Input: Wearing what will reduce the amplitude of sound waves entering the ears? Output:","output":"Earplugs or headphones designed for noise cancellation will reduce the amplitude of sound waves entering the ears. Step-by-step Explanation: 1. Analyze the task: The task requires me to answer a scientific question asking which kind of wear reduces the amplitude (strength) of sound waves entering the ears. 2. Understand the scientific concept: Sound waves are form of energy that travels through a medium (like air, water, or any other liquid or solid matter). When those waves reach our ears, they cause the eardrums to vibrate, which our brains interpret as sound. Reducing the amplitude of these waves will therefore reduce the intensity of the perceived sound. 3. Identify the correct solution: Earplugs and noise-cancelling headphones are devices designed to reduce the amplitude of sound waves. They work by either physically blocking the sound waves from entering the ear (earplugs), or by creating 'anti-noise' waves that interfere with and cancel out the incoming waves (noise-cancelling headphones). 4. Formulate the response: Based on the discussion above, the correct answer to the question is 'Earplugs or headphones designed for noise cancellation'.  This solution is justified as both earplugs and noise cancelling headphones are scientifically proven to reduce the intensity of incoming sound waves, thus benefiting people who need to work in noisy environments, or who simply wish to reduce the amount of noise they're exposed to."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At first, he was no one special in my life. Then he became my friend. In time, I felt he was also my father. Leo married my mother when I was eleven. Two years later we moved into a house in a new suburban development, where we put down roots. At first our lawn was just a mud with wild grass, but Leo saw bright possibilities. \\"We'll plant trees there to give us shade as well as some flowers,\\" he said. And just these little touches made our house different from all the others. More important, a real family was forming. Leo was becoming a full-time parent, and I was learning what it meant to have a father. Weekday mornings when the weather was bad, Leo often drove me to school. Having a father drop you off may have been something my classmates took for granted, but I always thought it was wonderful. Saturday mornings, we went to the hardware shop, then stepped into the five-and-ten, buying a sports magazine or something else.

BuzzFeed reports one photo shared on Twitter is actually an 18-year-old woman who was assaulted by her boyfriend for hours on end; he later pled guilty. Another shows the ex-wife of former White House aide Rob Porter who has accused him of domestic violence. \\"Fake posts are being created to make black people look bad and the sad part of it is some people will believe them,\\" the New York Daily News quotes one disappointed Twitter user as saying. Other images used by trolls include a young Swedish woman who was assaulted at a bar in January, a years-old stock photo, and a still from a 2013 video that used special-effects makeup to raise awareness about domestic violence. Vox advises readers to use Google's reverse image search function before believing everything they see online. \\"It’s possible the trolling is an attempt to scare people away from the theaters and cut into the movie’s bankroll—or it could be yet another example of trolling being used to create a disruptive and ever-more-extreme political environment,\\" the website states.

Article:","output":"Title: Beware of Online Trolls Spreading False Claims about Racial Attacks at Black Panther Screenings The internet is a powerful source of information, but it can also be a breeding ground for fake news and outrageous claims. One recent example surrounds the much-anticipated Black Panther movie, where online trolls have been spreading false claims using real photos of domestic violence victims. These trolls allege that white people are being targeted in racially-motivated attacks at movie screenings. This harmful misinformation is not only misleading, but it also disrespects the victims whose images are being used for malicious intent. BuzzFeed recently uncovered the disinformation campaign, revealing that one of the photos circulating on social media was of an 18-year-old woman who had been assaulted by her boyfriend. The boyfriend eventually pled guilty to the crime. Another photo showed the ex-wife of former White House aide Rob Porter, who has accused him of domestic violence. It's highly likely that these trolls are aiming to create a misleading narrative about Black Panther moviegoers to incite fear and potential backlash. While most internet users can discern what is real and fake, some users still fall prey to these false claims. As one Twitter user lamented, \\"Fake posts are being created to make black people look bad and the sad part of it is some people will believe them.\\" This realization highlights the importance of verifying the information we come across online. Vox recommends using tools like Google's reverse image search function to check whether images and claims are legitimate. The motives for creating these false accusations are not always clear. Some trolls may be attempting to dissuade people from attending Black Panther screenings, in an effort to cut into the movie's profits. Alternatively, it could be another instance of online trolling fueling an increasingly extreme and disruptive political environment. In related news, a number of Twitter users, including Questlove of the Roots, have expressed genuine concern that white supremacists could target Black Panther screenings this weekend. It's essential to remain vigilant, and to remember that a majority of information on the internet should be taken with a grain of skepticism. At the same time, it's important not to let these falsehoods dampen the excitement surrounding the movie.

In 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out. Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.","output":"Scientist Hank Pym arranged for his own home to be broken into.

It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse. He is very tense at rehearsals, which makes us concentrate, but relaxed during the performance, which is a great asset to the... contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that said Solti is tense at rehearsals?, what is it ?

He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  and a hint : Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth.

Step 1: Consider the hint provided, \\"Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms.\\" - Freezing works as preservation because it slows down food decay and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. Step 2: Understand the relationship between temperature and reaction rates. - Lower temperatures mean slower reaction rates, which means slower decay and less bacterial growth. Step 3: Compare the given temperatures, 0°F and 10°F. - 0°F is colder than 10°F. Step 4: Determine which temperature will result in slower decay of the cupcakes. - Given that lower temperatures slow down reaction rates and reduce bacterial growth better than higher temperatures, the colder temperature of 0°F will result in slower decay of the cupcakes compared to 10°F."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: In the United States, almost half of the First-Class mailstream is workshared and an even larger portion of Standard A4 is either workshared or has preparation requirements that involve work the mailer must do. Here is a hypothesis: Each year in the United States, almost half of all mail is delayed because of steep requirements on preparation. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"No, it's not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true.  Here's the reasoning process: Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that almost half of the First-Class mail is workshared, which means it has been pre-sorted or pre-processed by the sender to expedite its handling by the postal service. It also claims that an even larger portion of Standard A4 mail either involves similar worksharing processes or the mailer has to do some preparatory work. But it doesn't give any assessment or judgment about whether this worksharing or preparatory work leads to delay or expedite in the mail delivery. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis claims that almost half of all mail in the United States is delayed each year due to steep preparation requirements. This statement implicitly implies a negative impact of the preparatory work - causing delays in mail delivery, which is not mentioned or proven in the premise. Step 3: Compare premise and hypothesis While the premise and the hypothesis both refer to work that needs to be done by the mailer, they depart significantly in their implications. The premise does not draw any negative correlation between work-sharing and mail delivery speed, whereas the hypothesis directly points out a negative impact causing delay. Just because some work is done by the mailer (preparation requirements/worksharing), we cannot deduce that it will cause a delay. It could, in fact, speed up the process as the purpose of worksharing is typically to expedite handling by the postal service.  Therefore, if the premise is true, it does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. We would need more information that directly links the preparatory work to delays in mail delivery."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C. By 9:25, FAA's Herndon Command Center and FAA headquarters knew two aircraft had crashed into the World Trade Center. They knew American 77 was lost. At least some FAA officials in Boston Center and the New England Region knew that a hijacker on board American 11 had said \\"we have some planes.\\" Concerns over the safety of other aircraft began to mount. A manager at the Herndon Command Center asked FAA headquarters if they wanted to order a \\"nationwide ground stop.\\" While this was being discussed by executives at FAA headquarters, the Command Center ordered one at 9:25. The Command Center kept looking for American 77. At 9:21, it advised the Dulles terminal control facility, and Dulles urged its controllers to look for primary targets. At 9:32, they found one. Several of the Dulles controllers \\"observed a primary radar target tracking eastbound at a high rate of speed\\" and notified Reagan National Airport. FAA personnel at both Reagan National and Dulles airports notified the Secret Service.

Short answers containing words that are present in the passage are preferred. Georgina Salt (Heather Graham) is a young English contractor living in London who longs to have a baby, which she sees as the one thing missing from her life. In the opening scene, Zach, Georgina's long-time boyfriend, is talking on the phone with his sister, who has just had a baby girl. Georgina is obviously more interested in the baby than Zach. After Zach gets off the phone, the couple goes back into their bedroom where Georgina seduces Zach. Zach, however, uses a condom, much to the dismay of Georgina.The next day, Georgina goes shopping for a present for Zach's sister's baby with her mother. Georgina is taken away by the baby items around her and is saddened by it. When a doctor's ad for his clinic for women who want to get pregnant, but may not be able to conceive for much longer, Georgina's mother mentions her aunt. Presuming that her aunt was a lesbian, Georgina was never surprised that her aunt had no children, however her mother informs her that she was simply unable to have children; she was too late.A frantic Georgina spends Â£150 on a blanket, to the surprise of her mother, before leaving the store. At Zach's sister's house, Georgina is taken by the baby and is allowed to hold her as Zach goofs off with his sister's belly sculpture. After breaking the sculpture, Zach blames it on her three-year-old son and the couple soon leave.In the car, Georgina gets upset with Zach over the statue and she is about to ask him a question before he cuts her off saying, \\"I do not hate babies.\\" Georgina jumps to the conclusion that he does hate babies and demands that he pull over and lets her out. Zach goes to a friend's house to 'crash' while Georgina heads home.Prior to this event, Georgia had gone to the clinic to see how many eggs she had left; her best friend Clem goes with her and receives the call that the two of them are to return. The doctor informs Georgina that she only has one egg left and that she'd be ovulating for four days. The two women go out on a 'date' with a young man named Justin, who is completely taken aback when Georgina announces that she has one egg left.Clem and Justin help Georgina form a plan to sleep with a random stranger. On day one, Georgina has an \\"open house\\" to rent out her apartment in order to lure men inside. The first few are turned away due to their looks or their gender preference. Finally, a man of great quality comes along, however just before he and Georgina kiss, Zach calls.Georgina kicks the man out and talks to Zach, but then hears a woman's voice saying, \\"Zach, darling, will you zip me up?\\" An angry Georgina hangs up the phone and Zach isn't too pleased with the woman - Alexandra. Alexandra is the daughter of a rich man who is funding Zach's latest documentary; she is also the reason why Georgina was unable to speak to Zach before he left for a trip.On day two, Georgina goes to a funeral to pick up a man overcome with \\"emotions\\" and isn't thinking too well. She takes him back to her apartment, leaves to get wine and as she is in the kitchen he discovers her \\"PLAN\\" sheet that has all the details about her seducing him on it. He is disgusted and leaves, as Georgina tries to explain herself.Day three, Georgina finds herself with Clem at a night club. They see a very good looking young man, dancing very seductively and attracting all the girls' attention, and Georgina goes to seduce him. Before successfully seducing the man, she rips her dress in several places to make herself more sultry.At the hotel, Georgina is about to go all the way with him, before she excuses herself to go to the bathroom. While she is taking out her breast pads and washing her mouth out, he steals some of her money and a card before leaving. Georgina comes out to find the lights off and him gone. After cursing her stupidity â and noticing her money and card gone â she goes home.During this time, Zach is seen trying to hurry back to London and has to take the ferry because Alexandra had taken the last ticket going to London. Georgina and Clem purchase sperm from the Internet and go out to buy a turkey baster. At this time, Georgia reveals to Clem that she only wants Zach, before she says that she can't believe that the future father of her child is a turkey baster.Georgina, seeming desperate at this point, turns to one of her employees who reveals that he is infertile just before the two of them can have sex. She then plans to go through with the artificial insemination, reading the directions as the sperm arrives. Her mother arrives with a birthday cake and Georgina accidentally squirts the sperm on the cake. Clem intends Justin, her so-called pet, to impregnate Georgina. A nervous Justin doesn't seem to want to go through with it. They go to a hotel room and Justin can't seem to get off, nor is he comfortable with this idea. Justin can't do it and backs out.She begins to spank him, before she is thrown out of the hotel by the staff. She runs into a friend of Zach's and is comforted by him. While hugging him, Zach walks in and assumes that they are having an affair and slaps his friend before leaving. Georgina runs after him, but loses him. She misses her chance to get pregnant and mopes around because she lost both her chance to have a baby and Zach.Ben, Zach's friend, comes over to check on Georgina and the two begin to talk about how awkward the situation was just as the doorbell rings. Clem gets it and turns out that it's Zach, who is outraged to find Ben and Georgina holding hands. He slaps Ben again, who, in turn, punches Zach. The two have a scuffle, during which Ben tells Zach that while Georgia is OK, she isn't Clem. Clem, hearing this, asks him to repeat that and after establishing that he likes Clem and not Georgina, he gets off Zach and goes to Clem.Georgina asks about Alexandra, who Zach admits is beautiful, but says that isn't all he looks for in a person. She isn't impressed by his reasoning, however Zach continues on trying to explain that he loves her and had never stopped. Zach reveals that he wants children too, however an upset Georgina leaves and Ben has to explain to Zach what had been going on. At work, Georgina's worker reveals that he understands why she left and leaves before Zach comes in with a dozen roses.Four months later, while Georgina is running her breasts and belly feel sore and goes to a clinic for a pregnancy test. She receives a call informing her that she is, in fact, pregnant. At a birthday party for Zach, it is revealed that they are engaged and Georgina tells him that sheâs pregnant.

Station in Kansas City to put song on heavy rotation on first night of series. Giants and Royals face off in Game 1 of World Series Tuesday night. Article:","output":"Title: San Francisco Radio Stations Outlaw Hit Song \\"Royals\\" ahead of World Series  In one of the most unconventional episodes in the world of sports media, San Francisco radio stations have enacted a necessary ban on the chart-topping hit \\"Royals.\\" The popular song by Grammy-award-winning artist Lorde has become notably absent from the airwaves of Bay Area radio stations. This decision was born out of a fierce sense of city pride, brewing up in the tension surrounding the highly anticipated clash between the San Francisco Giants and the Kansas City Royals in Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night. The solidarity sparked by the emblematic song has intensified the rivalry between the two cities, giving rise to a tantalizing narrative that extends beyond sports. The banning of \\"Royals,\\" a tune that one could argue is rather innocuous, has stirred various emotions among the public, creating complicated feelings towards what promises to be an electrifying Game 1 of the World Series. On the track, Lorde sings about never seeing ‘a diamond in the flesh,’ and consequently not being ‘royal.’ The lyrics, coincidentally matching the name of the Kansas City baseball team, became the de facto anthem for Kansas City Royals fans when the song was released in 2013. Now, before the showdown between the Giants and the Royals, it seems the song has found an unfortunate fate on the other side of the battle line. Simultaneously, Kansas City radio stations have responded by rallying around the song, pointing to it as a source of civic identity. Kansas City's decision to put \\"Royals\\" on heavy rotation on the first night of the series acts as a counter-protest and a hearty show of support for their home team. This move only adds fuel to the anticipation surrounding the opening game, marking the beginning of what can only be described as \\"battle of the airwaves.\\" The face-off between the Giants and the Royals on Tuesday night represents more than a sporting event; it embodies a culture clash enhanced by the interplay of a popular song, a major sport, and civic pride. This war of the airwaves, with \\"Royals\\" being caught in the crossfire, contributes to the captivating narrative of nationwide broadcast sporting events. The ban itself represents a statement that the battle for the title extends beyond the baseball diamond. It reflects San Francisco's determination and spirited solidarity, an effort to support their team and draw the line in the face of the competition. However, despite the ban on \\"Royals,\\" the song continues to ring loud in Kansas City, enhancing the sense of rivalry and camaraderie between the two cities. As the Giants and Royals gear up to face-off in the World Series, the public eagerly awaits the score, stoked by the emotional subtext of this war of the airwaves. The spirit of American baseball is alive and pulsating in a new, unprecedented manner, creating an unforgettable saga nourishing itself on the fervor of fans from both coasts. In the tumult and thrill of sports, this music ban is a powerful symbol, reminding us all of the deep roots sport can have in our communal consciousness and everyday life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film explores themes of purity, adolescence, and sexual instinct, as well as incorporating elements of horror and comedy. While it can be assumed that a portion of the characters in the film may be white, due to the film being an American production and Jess Weixler being a white actress, it is not accurate to conclude that it is solely about white people. The film's themes and subject matter transcend race and ethnicity, focusing more on the protagonist's unique condition and how she comes to terms with it, navigates her relationships, and experiences the consequences of her actions. To determine the racial and ethnic representation in the film, it would be beneficial to analyze the full cast and the way various characters are portrayed.

According to a study, half of British people own smartphones and they spend an average   of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from shortsightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at things closer to your face, the blinking slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphones in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light enters your eyes. This can do harm to the eyes and cause a disease called glaucoma . While you're probably not going to stop using to your _ , there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \\"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \\"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \\"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \\"behind the scenes force\\" in ending apartheid. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did high public interest in the  private lives of the royal family cause in the press?","output":"High public interest in the private lives of the royal family during the 1980s caused the press to publish lots of stories about them. Some of these stories were not true, but the newspapers didn't always care if they were true or not. They just wanted to make their stories exciting for people to read. This made it hard for people to tell the difference between real news and made-up news about the royal family."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Certainly he looks like no one else of the time, that skull-like face, flattened nose, and elongated body-- even now he remains an unsettling presence. And what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy New Orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague Blackie is loosing on the city. I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes. The movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgue's black humor, the Widmark- Douglas interplay, the un-touristy locations, the battles among officialsall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time. Even Widmark's domestic scenes that put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive. Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio (Fox) product, no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect. Widmark does a solid low-key job as the public health officer. But my money is on the one- and-only Zero Mostel. Was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy (e.g. The Enforcer, 1950). That scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Mostel's shrewish wife (Liswood), is a gem of frantic subservience as Mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball. Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist. (I wonder if it was the voluble Kazan who named him.) But it's not only the professionals that add color. The locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the cops. That whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot. Then too, that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration. And what about those flea-bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest Denny's.

This documentary explores a story covered in Pilger's latest book \\"Freedom Next Time\\", which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. The islanders are technically British citizens, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, much like Mauritius, the nearby island to where the natives were exiled, used to be. But the British government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the United States army, who have used it as a basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking, especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews all round are excellent, and his cornering of a Parliament representative where he uses the Government's own information to pin him down, ranks as one of his best. Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives. The weaving of this footage with the interviews, and the islanders music, really heightens the film's impact. It is not easy viewing, but \\"Stealing a Nation\\" is John Pilger at his best.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Renegade KGB agents hijack a plutonium shipment inside the United States and use it to plant a nuclear device in the Saudi Arabian Ghawar oilfield. They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminating 50% of the world's oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions. On the run from his own government, he seeks refuge in the Israeli embassy. He and his team cooperate with the Israeli Mossad, represented by their director of covert operations Susan Goodman (Alberta Watson). Meanwhile, the president authorizes military action against Israel. Given the unpleasant options of the KGB destroying a large part of the world's oil supply or the United States having to invoke a military response to force Israel to remove its settlements from the West Bank, the title character decides to take a third option. His team infiltrates and captures a US nuclear missile silo in Smith Center, Kansas, and obtains independent launch capability. As the American military launches their air strikes toward Israel, The Soldier and Susan break into East Berlin by launching their car over the Berlin Wall, confronting the KGB agents and informing them that if their nuke in Saudi Arabia is detonated, his team in Smith Center will nuke Moscow.

Translate to English English:","output":"What if it suffers because of the European Union's bad politics? If a country or region suffers due to the European Union's bad politics, there would be several potential implications and consequences. The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union established in 1993, aiming to foster greater cooperation and integration amongst its member states. However, the EU has faced multiple challenges, including managing different political ideologies, economic policies, and addressing varying social and environmental concerns. In the case where bad politics become a significant issue, the following impacts might occur: 1. Economic stagnation: Bad politics within the EU can lead to ineffective economic policies, regulations, and decisions that stifle or slow down economic growth, leading to stagnation. This can result in higher unemployment rates, reduced productivity, and increased reliance on social welfare programs by affected citizens. 2. Social unrest and division: Poor political decision-making can have a direct impact on society, leading to social unrest and division within the affected countries or regions. This might manifest in the form of protests, increased crime rates, or the rise of extremist political movements. It could also lead to growing disillusionment with the European Union and its institutions amongst the citizens. 3. Inequality: Bad politics can exacerbate wealth disparities between EU member states and within individual countries. This can lead to escalating tensions among member states, causing resentment and potentially leading to political frictions. It might also result in an internal debate among member states, with some advocating for more equitable wealth distribution and others seeking to retain the status quo. 4. Weakening of democratic institutions: If the EU's bad politics cause mistrust among its member states and their citizens, democratic institutions might be weakened. This could make it more difficult to arrive at consensus-based decisions and lead to gridlock, further exacerbating the problems and challenges facing the union. 5. Potential for a rise in nationalist movements: As countries or regions suffer from the consequences of bad politics within the EU, nationalist movements might gain traction. This could eventually lead to calls for secession or even the disintegration of the European Union as more countries seek greater autonomy and control over their political, economic, and social destinies. 6. Impact on global relations: Bad politics within the European Union might affect its relations with non-member countries. It could potentially jeopardize international trade deals, partnerships, and alliances, consequently diminishing the EU's influence and standing on the global stage. In conclusion, if a country or region suffers due to the European Union's bad politics, it would face numerous challenges, including economic stagnation, social unrest, inequality, weakened democratic institutions, the rise of nationalist movements, and a potential impact on global relations. Addressing these problems would require a concerted effort from the EU, member states, and potentially involved international partners."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This problem is kind of like a game of stack the blocks.  On the left side of the equal sign, we have 859 blocks with a letter 'v' on each of them (859*v).  On the right side of the equal sign, we have two stacks of blocks: 1748 blocks with the letter 'v' on them (1748*v) and negative 865 blocks (that means we want to remove 865 blocks, like taking them away in a game of Jenga) with the letter 'v' on them (-865*v), and lastly, we have a simple pile of -624 blocks with no 'v' on them (-624). The equal sign in the middle is like a balance scale. Whatever we do on one side, we have to do on the other to keep it balanced. Now, let's play the game on the right side first. We need to add up (or subtract, based on situation) all the 'v' blocks on the right side. So if we have 1748 'v' blocks and we take away 865 of them, we will have 1748 - 865 = 883 'v' blocks left (in other words, 883*v). And remember - we still have those -624 blocks too. Now, both sides of our equation look like this: 859*v = 883*v - 624. If we want to balance out the 'v' blocks on both sides, we can remove 859 'v' blocks from each side (because that's how many we started with on the left side). So on the left, we'd have zero 'v' blocks, while on the right side, we'd end up with 883*v - 859*v = 24*v blocks and don't forget about those -624 blocks.  So it looks like this now: 0 = 24*v - 624. Remember, we want to solve for 'v', kind of like a final winner of our game.  To do that, let's move those -624 blocks to the other side by adding 624 to each side, to keep our scale balanced.  The equation should now look like this: 624 = 24*v. To find what 'v' equals (or who the 'v' winner is), we simply need to divide 624 (total blocks) by 24 ('v' blocks).  It looks like this: v = 624/24 = 26. And so, the winner of our game, or the value of 'v', is 26."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 2: The air goes down the trachea (not the esophagus) - The trachea, not the esophagus, is the correct anatomical structure responsible for carrying air to the lungs. The esophagus is responsible for carrying food from the mouth to the stomach.   Step 3: The air moves into the lungs - The air rich in oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes and bronchioles, finally reaching the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. Step 4: The carbon dioxide is removed, and the oxygen enters the body - Within the alveoli, oxygen diffuses from the air into the surrounding blood vessels, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. Step 5: The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth - The air is exhaled through the trachea and out of the mouth, removing carbon dioxide from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: If there are tumors in the esophagus Since the esophagus is not directly involved in the respiratory process, the presence of tumors in the esophagus may not have a direct impact on the oxygen intake. However, they can cause indirect effects: 1. If the tumors are large enough or their location causes an obstruction in the trachea, it may inhibit the proper flow of air to the lungs, leading to less oxygen reaching the body. 2. If the tumors cause pain or discomfort, it may affect the person's ability to breathe deeply, reducing oxygen intake to some extent. 3. In some cases, if the tumors are cancerous and metastasize to the lungs, they can directly affect the lung's capacity to take in oxygen.

At Starbucks? And on your lap?\\" She could barely hide the jealousy in her voice. George laughed it off, saying, \\"Yeah babe, it was funny. The little furball wouldn't leave. It was as if she felt at home.\\" Clara, struggling to mask her jealousy, tried to change the topic, but George continued to gush about the cat. \\"I wish I could have kept her, you know. She was so comfortable and happy there,\\" he added. \\"I can't believe you're thinking of keeping a cat you just met at a coffee shop, George!\\" Clara exclaimed, her green-eyed monster making an appearance. She found it hard to wrap her head around George's sudden affinity for the stray cat. George, oblivious to Clara's jealousy, laughed and said, \\"I'm serious! She was just so adorable, curling up in my lap, purring away. You'd have loved her!\\" \\"But I want to be the only one curling up in your lap and purring away,\\" Clara blurted out in a moment of passionate jealousy, immediately regretting it. There was a pause on the line. Then, George couldn't help but laugh. \\"Clara, are you... Are you jealous of a stray cat?\\" Pure embarrassment flooded through Clara, and she stammered, \\"No, of course, I'm not.\\" But despite her denial, Clara couldn't help but feel a peculiar mix of jealousy, amusement, and curiosity. After all, who would've thought a cat could cause such a stir in a relationship? This small incident sparked a light-hearted conversation between Clara and George, opening up another facet to their relationship filled with humor and affection."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Where is Liz stopping for a drink? Movie plot title: Whore Movie plot: Liz (Russell) is a Los Angeles prostitute the audience first sees attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passer-by (Jack Nance) helps her to the hospital, and even pays her bill there. She sends him a thank you note. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake (Benjamin Mouton). Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man who catches up with her at a convenience store. He demands money, and Liz has no choice but to agree though she gives him the finger as he leaves. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta (Antonio Fargas) decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's soliloquy.

Guinea-Bissau The word gumbe is sometimes used generically, to refer to any music of the country, although it most specifically refers to a unique style that fuses about ten of the country's folk music traditions. Tina and tinga are other popular genres, while extent folk traditions include ceremonial music used in funerals, initiations and other rituals, as well as Balanta brosca and kussundé, Mandinga djambadon, and the kundere sound of the Bissagos Islands. Q: What type of tradition includes ceremonial music used in funerals?","output":"In Guinea-Bissau, the tradition that includes ceremonial music used in funerals, as well as in initiations and other rituals, can be attributed to the rich and diverse cultural heritage of the country. This West African nation is home to various ethnic groups, each with its own distinct language, customs, and musical styles. These groups include the Balanta, Mandinga, Fula, Manjack, Papel, and Bijagós, among others. The ceremonial music played during funerals serves various purposes, such as honoring the deceased, providing comfort to the grieving family, and fostering a sense of community and continuity within the ethnic group. It is often characterized by a combination of traditional instruments, vocal performances, and rhythmic patterns that reflect the unique cultural identity of the group. Different ethnic groups in Guinea-Bissau may have their specific variations of funeral music. For example, the Balanta people often play brosca, a type of ceremonial music, in their funeral rites. This music is characterized by the use of drums, rattles and other percussion instruments, as well as call-and-response singing patterns. Similarly, the Mandinga people use their traditional djambadon music, played on an indigenous string instrument called kora, during funerals and other important cultural events. Additionally, in the Bissagos Islands, located off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, the kundere sound is a unique musical style utilized during ceremonies, including funerals. The kundere uses a specific type of wooden xylophone, accompanied by singing and dancing. In summary, the tradition of incorporating ceremonial music in funerals in Guinea-Bissau is deeply rooted in the various ethnic groups that comprise the country's diverse population. Each group has its own cultural identity and practices, which are reflected in the unique musical styles and instruments used during funeral ceremonies and other significant rituals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Hellenistic period During the Hellenistic period, Judea became a frontier region between the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt and therefore was often the frontline of the Syrian wars, changing hands several times during these conflicts. Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the High Priest of Israel as a Hellenistic vassal. This period also saw the rise of a Hellenistic Judaism, which first developed in the Jewish diaspora of Alexandria and Antioch, and then spread to Judea. The major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic to Koiné Greek.

Article: Like most parents, I worry that my child isn't getting enough sleep. Now it turns out that doctors have been warning kids don't get enough sleep for over a century--long before iPads, and texting robbed children of peaceful sleep. What's more, there's no solid scientific basis for pediatricians'   recommendations on the amount of time children need to sleep. That's the word from researchers in Australia. It turns out that children are sleeping less than those in days of old. The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined   by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. \\"This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,\\" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore \\"wearied brain tissue\\". Children and \\"clever\\" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. \\"There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,\\" the authors write. Their work was published in the journal Pediatrics.

To achieve this, we can subtract 22 from both sides of the equation. 11*l = -22 (since 22 - 22 = 0) Step 4: Solve for l by dividing both sides of the equation by 11. l = -2 (since -22 ÷ 11 = -2) Hence, l = -2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: If you are afraid of the dark,it's not a big deal.It's perfectly normal to feel afraid After all,animals do too. \\"Fear matters,\\"says Karen Warkentin,an ecologist.\\"It's a good thing,\\" she adds, \\"because fear makes you do things that keep you alive.\\" Like kids,many animals experience fear and they respond to the feeling in variety of ways.A frightened turtle pulls its head and legs inside its shell.A  small fish will swim away when a big,hungry fish approaches. Some animals respond to fear in ways you might not expect.The first example is that the fear of being eaten can scare some frogs right out of their eggs. Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica. In this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs. Tree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape. If hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water. Question: Why do the tadpoles hatch up to 2 days ahead of the schedule?Because - They like falling into the water early - They want to grow into adult frog - They sense a hungry snake is about to attack - Frog embryos can grow strong Answer:","output":"They sense a hungry snake is about to attack"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: advertisement      The mother of a Newtown shooting victim will deliver the weekly presidential radio and Internet address, according to the White House.      President Barack Obama typically gives the talk and focuses on a topic that's in the news or a policy the White House is pushing and this is the first time in Obama’s administration that someone other than the president or vice president will give the address.      This week, Obama has asked Francine Wheeler, mother of 6-year-old Ben, to deliver the address instead.      Wheeler and her husband, David, lost their young son in the December schoolhouse shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown.      A month after the shooting, the Wheelers spoke publicly with members of Sandy Hook Promise, asking for action to prevent more violence.      “We are not done being the best possible parents we can be for Ben, not by a very long measure,” David Wheeler said at the time. “If there is something in our society that needs to be fixed, clearly healed or resolved, that resolution needs a point of origin. It needs parents.”      Then, he posed the question to parents everywhere of what it is worth to them to keep their children safe.      White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama believes the voices of Newtown families have been critical to progress on gun control.      When asked if this was the first time in history someone other than the President has delivered the weekly address, Carney said the only person other than President Obama to deliver the address in this administration was Vice President Joe Biden.      The families who lost loved ones during the shooting have been in Washington lobbying members of Congress.      The Senate cleared its first hurdle for gun control legislation on Thursday and will consider expanded background checks next week.      The weekly address is posted on the White House Web site. ||||| President Obama (Photo: Alex Wong Getty Images) Story Highlights The president spoke about Francine Wheeler's anguish in a speech earlier this week      WASHINGTON—With the White House trying to keep pressure on Congress to pass gun control legislation, President Obama has asked the mother of a 6-year-old victim of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy to deliver his weekly radio address.      Francine Wheeler, whose son Ben was among the 26 victims of the Connecticut school shooting, will deliver the radio address, said White House spokesman Jay Carney.      \\"Nobody has a more important and powerful perspective on the issue than the families who have lost loved ones,\\" Carney said.      Obama spoke of Wheeler's anguish in a speech he made in Hartford, Conn., earlier this week as part of the White House push for the legislation.      \\"Over the weekend, I heard Francine Wheeler, who lost her son Ben that day, say that the four months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some, but for her, it feels like it's been years since she saw Ben,\\" Obama said in the Connecticut speech. \\" And she's determined not to let what happened that day just fade away. 'We're not going anywhere,\\" she said. 'We are here. And we are going to be here.' And I know that she speaks for everybody in Newtown, everybody who was impacted.\\"      The radio address airs on Saturday. |||||","output":"The White House has announced that Francine Wheeler, a mother who lost her 6-year-old son in the Newtown shooting, will deliver the weekly presidential radio and internet address.

Input: Polymerization of actin filaments directed by the actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 complex supports many types of cellular movements. However, questions remain regarding the relative contributions of Arp2/3 complex versus other mechanisms of actin filament nucleation to processes such as path finding by neuronal growth cones; this is because of the lack of simple methods to inhibit Arp2/3 complex reversibly in living cells. Here we describe two classes of small molecules that bind to different sites on the Arp2/3 complex and inhibit its ability to nucleate actin filaments. CK-0944636 binds between Arp2 and Arp3, where it appears to block movement of Arp2 and Arp3 into their active conformation. CK-0993548 inserts into the hydrophobic core of Arp3 and alters its conformation. Both classes of compounds inhibit formation of actin filament comet tails by Listeria and podosomes by monocytes. Two inhibitors with different mechanisms of action provide a powerful approach for studying the Arp2/3 complex in living cells.

Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  On an island near Antarctica, a male penguin named Peter sees a female named Polly, and attempts to woo her. First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help.  The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay. The shark struggles until he's too tired to move. Passing fish begin to poke fun at him. Meanwhile, Polly and Peter reconcile and fall in love, thus Peter's wooing succeeded. They cuddle, and their bodies form a heart-shaped silhouette on the horizon.","output":"In the given context, Peter, the male penguin, saves Polly, the female penguin, from a shark. Peter notices the shark's fin moving menacingly towards Polly's iceberg while she is swimming and attempts to warn her of the impending danger. However, Polly disregards Peter's warning and assumes that he is only seeking her forgiveness. When the shark attacks, Polly panics and swims away, prompting Peter to grab a stick and rush to her aid. The shark chases Polly around the bay until Peter finally intervenes and hits the shark on the nose with his stick. The enraged shark now turns its attention to Peter and chases him instead.  Peter manages to climb onto a cliff, inadvertently dislodging a boulder that falls on the shark, weighing it down. The boulder causes the shark to sink to the bottom of the bay, where it eventually exhausts itself to the point of immobility, becoming a laughingstock among the other fish in the area.

Based on the sentence \\"A woman, with a drink in hand, is leaning against a silver car parked along the street, while looking at the camera.\\", is the sentence \\"The man chipped his toot on the soda bottle.\\" a true sentence?","output":"The sentences \\"A woman, with a drink in hand, is leaning against a silver car parked along the street while looking at the camera.\\" and \\"The man chipped his tooth on the soda bottle.\\" seem unrelated, and it's impossible to determine the truth of one based on the other. Let's analyze each sentence individually to see why it's not possible to answer the question. Sentence 1: \\"A woman, with a drink in hand, is leaning against a silver car parked along the street while looking at the camera.\\" The first sentence describes a visual scene in which a woman is interacting with a parked car and a drink. The elements mentioned are: - A woman - A drink in the woman's hand - A silver car parked along the street - The woman leaning against the car - The woman is looking at the camera. Sentence 2: \\"The man chipped his tooth on the soda bottle.\\" The second sentence describes an unfortunate situation wherein a man suffers damage to his tooth due to a mishap with a soda bottle. The elements mentioned in this sentence are: - A man - A soda bottle - The man's tooth - The man's tooth getting chipped Now, let's look at the connections, if any, between sentences 1 and 2: There is no connection between the woman and the man, as they are different people or subjects. Additionally, the car, which is an essential part of sentence 1, does not appear in sentence 2. Likewise, the man's tooth and the soda bottle, which are the primary components of sentence 2, are not present in sentence 1. Although there is a drink mentioned in the first sentence, it's important to note that it is held by the woman. Furthermore, the specifics of the drink — whether or not it's from a soda bottle — are not disclosed. Therefore, the drink could be unrelated to the man's unfortunate incident. In conclusion, the truth of the second sentence, \\"The man chipped his tooth on the soda bottle,\\" cannot be determined based on the first sentence. Both sentences present distinct scenarios and subjects, with no evidence supporting the veracity or falsehood of either statement based on the other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When Nita's boyfriend, importer Phillip Corey, scoffs at her predictions, she informs him that he himself will die within 48 hours. Corey is later found dead in his San Francisco shop, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Jim C. Gregg is certain it is a homicide and has Sergeant Kelly bring Mei Lei in for questioning. She convinces him she is innocent and, after demonstrating her astrological powers by telling both skeptical policemen about themselves based solely on their birth dates, proceeds to help them solve the case and two subsequent, related killings. Police forensic scientist Dr. Merton, however, remains firmly scornful of Mei Lei's unscientific methods. When Corey's Chinese business partner Frederick Gow shows up at the police station, he recognizes Juggler Barrows (an uncredited Sidney Bracey), who has been brought in for questioning about an unrelated crime. He pretends to cough and uses a handkerchief to conceal his face from Barrows as he enters Gregg's office. There, he announces that he wants to recover certain business letters from Corey's safe.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Toby Harnden. UPDATED:. 16:49 EST, 7 March 2012. A confident Mitt Romney has said he feels 'pretty darn good' about his six wins on Super Tuesday, dismissing the narrowness of his Ohio victory over Rick Santorum by insisting he would be the Republican nominee. Appearing on CNBC the morning after he increased his delegate lead and won states from Alaska to Massachusetts with Idaho, Ohio, Virginia and Vermont in between he said he was 'getting the kind of support across the party that I need to become the nominee'. Santorum won North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee while Newt Gingrich claimed his home state of Georgia but the Romney campaign said that it was a virtual impossibility either could win. On the way: Mitt Romney, who claimed at least 212 delegates on Super Tuesday, believes that he is well on his way to becoming the Republican nominee for president. 'All we have to do is keep doing what. we're doing and we can get to the nomination,' a senior Romney adviser. said. 'Those guys, it's going to take some sort of act of God to get. where they need to be to win the nomination.' As if to confirm that President Barack. Obama believes Romney will be his opponent in November, the Obama. campaign held a press conference call slamming the former Massachusetts. governor. David Axelrod, Obama's top strategist. said that Romney 'grinds out tactical victories in a kind of death. march' and added: 'We tried to appeal to the best of people, and they. appear to be trying to appeal to the worst in people' Though critics argue that he is having. trouble 'sealing the deal' with voters, Romney advisers argue that the. rules for apportionment of delegates make it certain that he will be the. nominee. Romney said: “We will come together. because Barack Obama has organised a conservative community…the. community organiser has organised us in a big way. 'When we have a nominee we will come together because Barack Obama has organized the conservative community. 'We're going to come together because we really believe that he needs to be replaced.' As well as winning more states and. securing more votes, Romney also amassed a clear majority of the more. than 400 delegates at stake. But proportional Republican rules meant he. was several hundred away from the 1,144 needed for the GOP nomination. In the bag? Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann greet supporters as they arrive at their Super Tuesday primary rally in Boston tonight. He now leads the field with 415 delegates with Santorum on 176, Gingrich on 105 and Ron Paul on 47. Romney's His wafer-thin margin of. victory in Ohio underlined doubts about his candidacy and his ability to. connect with low-income voters. Santorum's wins in North Dakota,. Oklahoma and Tennessee gave his shoestring campaign a boost but his poor. campaign organisation was revealed in his failure to secure more. delegates. Kansas is set to vote on Saturday. followed by two Southern states Alabama and Mississippi, where. evangelicals are suspicious of Romney because of his Mormon faith. Santorum is expected to do well in all three contests. Gingrich's win in Georgia was a lone. bright spot in a dismal night for him. He vowed to continue but will. face pressure to drop out so that Santorum can consolidate the. conservative anti-Romney vote, especially if victory eludes him in. Alabama and Mississippi. He told supporters in Georgia: 'There. are lots of bunny rabbits to run through, I am the tortoise. I just take. one step at a time.' Ron Paul, the libertarian Texas. congressman whose uncompromising anti-war stances have meant he never. had a realistic chance of the nomination, failed to win a single state. He is likely to stay in the race for the long haul but is not viewed as a. threat by Romney. The results underlined Romney's. continued inability to win over large swathes of the Republican base,. who view his past as a moderate Massachusetts governor with suspicion. Fighting spirit: Rick Santorum rallied his supporters on Super Tuesday at the Steubenville High School in Ohio - before he lost the state to Mitt Romney. Early success: Newt Gingrich makes his victory speech in Atlanta with wife Callista after he won the state of Georgia. Confident: Rick Santorum kisses his wife after he won in Tennessee and Oklahoma on Super Tuesday. Speaking to supporters in Boston, Romney acknowledged that he had not landed a knockout blow. He said: 'Tonight, we are counting up. the delegates for the convention – and counting down the days until. November. We're going to take your vote and our victory all the way to. the White House.' Romney and his allies spent almost. four times the money on campaigning in Ohio compared to Santorum, with. much of that on negative advertising. Santorum waited until Oklahoma and Tennessee fell into his column before speaking to cheering supporters in Ohio. Santorum told supporters in. Steubenville, Ohio: 'We're going to get at least a couple of gold medals. and a whole passel full of silver medals. 'We've won in the West, the Midwest, in the South and we're going to win across this country.' Romney is worth more than 200 million and has at times struggled to connect with ordinary people. But he honed his message in Ohio,. saying that the 2012 election centred around 'whether the stresses on. families are going to be alleviated, where you've got a mom working the. day shift and a dad working a night shift and the kids not sure who's. home when'. He unveiled a new slogan of 'more jobs, less debt, smaller government' that was as much aimed at Obama as his Republican rivals. Party elders fear that a prolonged race would leave Romney damaged against Obama in the general election. In Ohio, Santorum charged: 'The. underlying problem that I hear when I talk to people all over, they say. they just don't trust Mitt Romney to not do what's the fashionable thing. at the moment.'

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Whether you and your husband live together but rarely see each other, or you have a long distance marriage, it's important to talk about how you plan to make this arrangement work for you. Good communication is key to keeping your romance alive, even when you are physically apart.  The conversation should be ongoing. Check in regularly with your husband to make sure the arrangement is still working for both of you. Don't be afraid to share your feelings if you feel that something needs to change. Consider making a list of the benefits of the separation. When things get hard or you start arguing about how little you see each other, you can consult the list to help remind you about why you chose the arrangement in the first place. Your husband will miss you tons if he's always finding little reminders of you while you are apart. Before your next separation, consider hiding little treasures for him to discover. They can be anything from notes to photos of the two of you or other tokens of your affection.  If your husband is going away, you can leave him love notes in his suitcase or in the pockets of his clothing. Try to put them in places where he will discover them at different times. If you are leaving home, hide things around the house for him to find. They can be notes or small mementos of your affection, like his favorite chocolate. Phone conversations tend to be centered around recounting daily activities. While this is fine, it's not the kind of conversation that will make your husband miss you. Instead, try to think of the kinds of conversations you have in person, and recreate these over the phone.  Share something personal about yourself during each phone call. For example, you might tell your husband about something interesting you noticed today or about an activity you would like to try. You can also remind your husband of all of the things you love about him. For example, you might tell him that he's an excellent cuddler or that you love his laugh. While you may need to talk about household things, like bills or maintenance, be sure that they do no dominate the conversation. Balance them out by also talking about enjoyable topics. For example, you could tell your husband about a great movie that you saw, or you could discuss plans for a trip you plan to take together. Instead of just talking on the phone and telling each other about your days, find ways to participate in activities together. This will help remind your husband of how enjoyable it is to be with you, even if you won't get the opportunity to see each other in person for a long time.  For example, you could play an online game together, watch the same movie while talking to each other, or even bring each other to important events via video conference. If you get the chance to see your husband periodically, make that time count. You may choose to do activities together or just relax together, but no matter what you do, make sure that you both enjoy the time you have together. It's easy to get into a rut when it comes to long-distance communication. For example, if you write your husband a letter every week or speak to him on the phone every evening, it can easily become routine. Keep your husband on his toes and looking forward to your next communication by doing something a little different every once in a while. For example, you might send your husband videos or silly cards at times. Alternatively, you might recite a poem that you wrote for him the next time you speak on the phone. Try to be a little unpredictable! When you talk to your husband, try not to say anything that will make him feel bad about being apart. You want to make him miss you, and complaining about the burden he has left you with by leaving will do just the opposite.  Instead of complaining, try offering him some sweet compliments. For example, you might let him know that something he fixed before he left is working very well. This will make him realize how much you appreciate him, which will intensify his feelings for you.  If you are the one who is away from home, you could let him know that a joke he told you made you smile all day. If you want your husband to miss you while you are apart, it is vital that the time you spend together is as enjoyable as possible. Let him know that you value your time together, and he will too.  Avoid bombarding him with a to-do list if he is coming home from a long trip. Instead, take a few days to spend quality time together doing things you both enjoy. If your husband is coming home from a military deployment, consider throwing him a welcome home party or meeting him at the airport with a welcome home banner.","output":"This article talks about keeping romance alive in a long-distance marriage by having good communication, hiding little surprises for each other, sharing personal stories over the phone, participating in activities together, making the most of the time spent together, and offering sweet compliments instead of complaining about the distance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that helps the park ranger find the naturalist in an animal skin? from the following article ?  The film opens with military veteran helicopter pilot and guide Don Stober flying individuals above the trees of a vast national park. He states that the woods are untouched and remain much as they did during the time when Native Americans lived there. Two female hikers are breaking camp when they are suddenly attacked and killed by an unseen animal. The national park's chief ranger, Michael Kelly, and photographer Allison Corwin, daughter of the park's restaurant owner, decide to follow a ranger to the primitive campsite to check on the female hikers. There, they discover the mangled corpses of the two girls, one of which has been partially buried. At the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that the girls were killed by a bear. The park supervisor, Charley Kittridge, blames Kelly for the attacks, saying that the bears were supposed to have been moved from the park by Kelly and naturalist Arthur Scott before the tourist season began. Kelly and Kittridge argue over closing the park, before deciding to move all hikers off the park's mountain while allowing campers to remain in the lowlands. Kelly calls Scott, who tells him that all of the bears are accounted for and this specific bear must be unknown to the forest. During a search of the mountain, a female ranger stops for a break at a waterfall. Deciding to soak her feet, she is unaware that the bear is lurking under the falls, and she is attacked and killed. Kelly recruits the helicopter pilot, Stober, to assist in the search. Flying above the forest, they see what they believe to be an animal, only to discover the naturalist Scott adorned in an animal skin while tracking the bear. He informs them that the animal they are looking for is a prehistoric grizzly bear (a fictional Pleistocene-era Arctodus ursos horribilis) standing at least 15 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds.

The former — and possibly future — presidential candidate will launch a website called the Huckabee Post, according to multiple reports. Mediaite found a Craigslist post listing openings for reporters at the new venture, touting it as \\"a new and exciting online news publication covering news on politics, U.S., international, media, sports and other general news.\\" Huckabee served as governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007 and briefly led the race for the Republican nomination during the 2008 presidential election before John McCain secured the nomination. His campaign featured one of the more tongue-in-cheek advertisements: an endorsement from Chuck Norris. Huckabee has also recently indicated that he is considering another run for the presidency in 2016. Conservative personalities have found success leveraging their personal popularity into media brands, most notably with subscription service. Glenn Beck started TheBlaze in 2011 and Andrew Sullivan launched The Dish earlier this year.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Lysias Anicetus, also known as the \\"Invincible,\\" was an Indo-Greek king who reigned between 130 and 120 BCE. His rule marks an important period in the history of the Indo-Greek kingdom, as he continued to expand the territories under his control and fostered a flourishing cultural exchange that still echoes through the ages. Lysias Anicetus' name, derived from the Greek words for \\"liberator\\" and \\"invincible,\\" suggests his reign was marked by a strong sense of martial prowess and an unwavering belief in his divine right to rule. He inherited the throne at a time when the Indo-Greek kingdom was already well-established, with the Greek influence having permeated deep into the cultural fabric of the region. One of the most notable aspects of Lysias Anicetus' rule was his impressive coinage. A well-preserved example of one of his coins - dated to approximately 120 to 110 BCE - showcases the king's image and offers valuable insights into the artistic achievements of his time. It displays the king's portrait, draped in royal attire and wearing a distinct diadem, a symbol of his power and authority. The coin also features the legend \\"BASILEOS ANIKETOU LYSIOU,\\" which translates to \\"Of the Invincible King Lysias\\" - a clear testament to his self-image as a fearless ruler. During his reign, Lysias Anicetus focused on expanding the kingdom's borders and securing the territories already under his control. He led a series of successful military campaigns against neighboring kingdoms and tribal chieftains, which reinforced his image as a powerful, victorious ruler. Consequently, the Indo-Greek kingdom enjoyed a period of relative stability and prosperity. Lysias Anicetus' reign was also marked by a vibrant cultural exchange between the Greek and Indian civilizations. The artistic styles of the time fused Hellenistic and Indian elements, creating a unique aesthetic that celebrated the best of both worlds. This cultural fusion is best evidenced in the realm of art and architecture, with the creation of numerous Buddhist and Hindu temples and monuments exhibiting intricate Greek-inspired designs. In the religious sphere, Lysias Anicetus is said to have supported both Buddhism and Hinduism, demonstrating his tolerance and openness to diverse beliefs and practices. The Indo-Greek kingdom became a melting pot of ideas and philosophies, with the blending of these ancient traditions potentially shaping the development of later forms of Buddhism, such as Mahayana Buddhism. In conclusion, Lysias Anicetus, the \\"Invincible\\" Indo-Greek king, was a dynamic figure who played a significant role in the expansion and cultural blossoming of the Indo-Greek kingdom. His reign, marked by military successes and thriving artistic endeavors, left an indelible mark on the legacy of the Indo-Greek kingdom and its enduring links with Hellenistic and Indian civilizations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor PUBLISHED: 12:54 EST, 29 November 2012 | UPDATED: 15:17 EST, 29 November 2012 Lord Leveson wants Ofcom to 'verify' a new independent regulator and act as a 'backstop' for those newspapers which did not sign up One of New Labour’s most powerful quangos would have ultimate responsibility for press regulation under dramatic plans set out in Lord Leveson’s report. The judge insisted his proposals would not amount to state regulation of newspapers, but legislation was needed to enforce it. But both David Cameron and Nick Clegg today criticised the plan to change the law to put state media watchdog Ofcom in overall charge of ‘verifying’ a new independent regulatory body. Six years later, OPTIONS: - David Cameron warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will - Leveson warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will - Lord Leveson warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will - Mailonline warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will - Matt Chorley warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will - New Labour warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will - Nick Clegg warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will - Ofcom warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will - Tony Blair warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will","output":"Correct Answer: Lord Leveson warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will Explanation: In this case, the story is talking about Lord Leveson, and it would make sense for the last line of the story to be something that he warned about, which is why \\"Lord Leveson warned 'Ofcom, as we know it, will\\" is correct. Other choices would not make sense because the story does not indicate that those people made a warning about Ofcom. It would be like if we were talking about what foods elephants eat all day long, but then end the story by saying, \\"And the bunny warned, 'Carrots, as we know it, will'\\". It just wouldn't make sense because the story is about elephants, not bunnies, and the story implies that Lord Leveson is the one giving a warning, not the other people."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During this time, Japan started its modernization and rose to world power status. This era name means \\"Enlightened Rule\\". In Japan, the Meiji Restoration started in the 1860s, marking the rapid modernization by the Japanese themselves along European lines. Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously. Japan expanded its military production base by opening arsenals in various locations. The hyobusho (war office) was replaced with a War Department and a Naval Department. The samurai class suffered great disappointment the following years.\\"?

I heard that Taylor spilled coffee all over Ash's shirt and offered to pay for it immediately.  And I was wondering What will Ash want to do next? Answer:","output":"Given that Taylor has spilled coffee on Ash's shirt and offered to pay for it, it's necessary to consider various factors and potential courses of action in order to determine what Ash might want to do next. Here's a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Assess the situation Ash would likely assess the situation by evaluating the extent of the coffee spill and any potential damage to their shirt. They would also consider Taylor's gesture of offering to pay for any damages caused due to the incident. Step 2: Respond to Taylor's offer Depending on how much they value the shirt and their relationship with Taylor, Ash might accept, decline, or suggest an alternative to Taylor's offer. If the shirt holds sentimental value or is expensive, they might be inclined to accept the offer. On the other hand, if they're close friends with Taylor or believe the shirt isn't worth much, they might decline the offer. Step 3: Clean up Ash would likely want to clean up the coffee spill as soon as possible to minimize the stain on their shirt. They could use napkins or water to gently dab at the stain, or visit a restroom to clean it more thoroughly if the situation allows. Step 4: Decide on a course of action Following the immediate response and clean-up, Ash might want to consider their next steps based on the specific context of the incident. Some possible options include: - If the shirt is ruined and Ash has accepted Taylor's offer, they could arrange a time to shop for a replacement together or discuss reimbursement for a new shirt. - If Ash declined Taylor's offer, they may want to clean the shirt thoroughly when they get home and possibly purchase a new one on their own. - If the shirt isn't badly damaged and Ash is not overly concerned, they might choose to let it go and move on from the incident. Overall, Ash's immediate next step would likely be responding to Taylor's offer and cleaning up the coffee spill as best as possible. From there, their subsequent actions would depend on the specifics of their relationship with Taylor and the value they place on the damaged shirt."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Abortion is legal in Mexico in cases of rape. But Regina Tames, director of the Group for Information on Reproductive Choice, said officials in Sonora state are relying on a judge’s decision to classify the assault on the girl as a crime in which consent was obtained through deception or seduction, reasoning it falls short of rape.      “She has the right as the victim of sexual aggression to end the pregnancy,” Tames said. “The classification of the crime doesn’t matter.”      The attack occurred in May, but the group did not become aware of it last week, Tames said. The family reported the assault to state investigators the same day it occurred.      The girl was not offered emergency contraception upon reporting the rape, Tames said.      A representative in the communications department for the Sonora state health agency said officials were meeting about the case and would comment later.      Tames said the family was considering bringing the girl to Mexico City for an abortion where it is legal up to 12 weeks.      Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The teenager immediately reported her abuser to the police after an attack she described as rape and a medical report showed physical evidence which corroborated her allegations.      But the case judge in the state of Sonora instead accused the alleged rapist of “illegal sex with a minor” as he ruled that the man had gained the girl's consent by deception.      The state health service has refused to allow the girl, named by local media as Citlali, to terminate the foetus - despite rape-related pregnancies being exempt from a ban on abortions      Women’s rights organisations are demanding that hospital authorities reverse their decision, arguing that the judge’s interpretation of the crime does not change the fact that Citlali was sexually assaulted and became pregnant as a result.      “This is important in terms of the criminal investigation, but should not affect access to legal termination,” said Regina Tamés, president of GIRE, an organisation which defends the right of women to access legal abortion and contraceptive methods. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A 13-year-old girl in northern Mexico, who became pregnant after being raped by a family acquaintance, has been denied her legal right to an abortion.

Soon after his arrival, one of the missing women is found dead, bound to a tree, and a short time later, Kate McTiernan is kidnapped from her home.

I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out.

It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament.

Given the question: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns.

Article: Warning: reading too much Cinderella  to your daughter may damage her emotional health in later life. A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy  in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused  by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel  and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way.     The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \\"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\\" she said.\\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \\"The question,\\" said Ms Darker Smith, \\"is why she did not break the door down herself.\\" Question: Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast are similar in that   _  . Answer: Options: I. They all married some princes II. They all changed their partners with love III. They were all abused by their partners IV.

First, we need to find out the answer to -1225 - 7850. It's like having 1225 sad faces and then adding 7850 more sad faces. When you add all the sad faces together, you'll get 9075 sad faces. So, the equation becomes: -9075 = -363 * z Now, we want to find out how many times -363 can fit into -9075 so that we can know the value of z. To do that, we will divide -9075 by -363: z = -9075 / -363 When you have a negative sign in the front of both numbers and you divide them, it becomes a positive number. So dividing -9075 by -363 is the same as dividing 9075 by 363. Now when you divide 9075 by 363, you get: z = 25 That means -363 fits into -9075 exactly 25 times.

Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira's origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato's lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \\"Island of Timber. \\" The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo.  Question: \\"Why might a Castillian source have known about the existence of Madeira around the time Zarco was exploring?\\" Response: \\"Castillians were the first to explore Maderia\\" Select from the following. (A). no (B). yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"(A). no The response doesn't correctly answer the question. The text doesn't say that the Castilians were the first to explore Madeira. It suggests that Zarco might have learned about Madeira from a Castilian source, but it does not tell us why the Castilians might have known about Madeira. So basically, like if your friend tells you about a new playground, it doesn't mean he found it first, he might have just heard about it from someone else."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Animals eat a lot during good (warm, clear) weather - Animals gain weight - The season changes to one with bad (cold, snowy) weather - Animals find a place to hibernate - Animals enter a type of &#x27;sleep&#x27; (hibernation) - Body processes slow down - The animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate slow - The animal loses weight more slowly than usual - The animal is able to survive not eating or drinking without hurting itself -   suppose less stormy weather occurs happens, how will it affect more food available.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The perturbation in this scenario, where less stormy weather occurs and more food becomes available, can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's a detailed explanation: This scenario introduces a change in the weather conditions, specifically, less stormy weather. Storms can substantially impact the availability of food resources for animals, affecting either quantitative or qualitative aspects of their diet. With lesser storms, more food becomes available, allowing the animals to have easier access to resources and potentially affecting their feeding habits. In the given process, the step that would be influenced by this change would be the first step: \\"Animals eat a lot during good (warm, clear) weather.\\" With less stormy weather, the availability of food increases, potentially allowing animals to consume a higher quantity of food than they would under normal circumstances, in turn affecting their weight gain. This perturbation does not directly impact other steps within the process; however, the increased food availability could have secondary effects on the animal's behavior, well-being, and overall physiology. For example, if an animal manages to store more energy due to increased food intake, it might be able to cope better with the changes caused by the unfavorable weather conditions and may not need to hibernate as early or as long. Moreover, with increased food availability, animals might gain weight more rapidly than usual, leading to a shift in the usual timeline of events. In turn, this might affect the subsequent steps of the process, like hibernation and the rate of weight loss while in hibernation. Therefore, we can conclude that the supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process, as the changes in weather conditions and food availability introduced in the question are not targeting a specific step in the process but rather, are modifying the environment in which the process takes place. The alteration in such environmental factors can set off a ripple effect, consequently influencing the different steps in the process in an indirect manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Understand the task: You need to determine if the given statement about date and time is true or false. 2. Identify the template: In the example, the template is \\"t1 occurs between t2 and t3\\". 3. Extract the values: In this case, t1 is 07:52:22, t2 is 10:52:34 AM, and t3 is 03:42:23 PM. 4. Compare the values:    - Convert all times to a common format (e.g. 24-hour format)      - t1: 07:52:22 (already in 24-hour format)      - t2: 10:52:34 (AM, so no conversion needed)      - t3: 15:42:23 (PM, so 3 + 12 = 15 hours)    - Check if t1 occurs between t2 and t3:      - 07:52:22 is before 10:52:34, so it does not occur between t2 and t3. 5. Provide the output: As 07:52:22 does not occur between 10:52:34 and 15:42:23, the statement is False."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the first names of the three people who moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee?, using the article: Blonde on Blonde is the seventh studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, released June 20, 1966 on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—\\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded. Blonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \\"a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial\\". It was one of the first double albums in rock music. The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. Blonde on Blonde spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\" and \\"I Want You\\". Two additional songs—\\"Just Like a Woman\\" and \\"Visions of Johanna\\"—have been named as among Dylan's greatest compositions and were featured in Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list., what would be the answer ?","output":"Based on the article provided, the first names of the three people who moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee are Bob, Al, and Robbie.

Connie Talbot entered the public eye appearing, aged six, on the first series of the reality programme Britain's Got Talent, reaching the final. After briefly recording with Sony BMG, Talbot was signed to Rainbow Recording Company, an offshoot of the label Rhythm Riders made specifically for her. To produce Over the Rainbow, Talbot worked with John Arnison, then-manager to Gabrielle and Billy Ocean, and Marc Marot, a former managing director of Island Records. It was produced and mixed by Simon Hill and Rob May. A recording schedule was worked out so that Talbot could continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as \\"a better solution\\" than the one offered by Sony BMG, \\"which has not robbed her of her childhood\\". Talbot said that \\"it was just amazing that we could do it in my auntie's house\\". Arnison and Marot asked the Talbot family to \\"write down a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party\\" to help choose the track listing, and then \\"thought long and hard\\" about including more adult songs on the album. Talbot herself insisted that they should.The final version of Over the Rainbow was recorded at Olympic Studios, on 12 October 2007. Arnison described the recording process by saying that Talbot \\"hadn't sung nursery rhymes; she'd always sung classic tracks. So it was actually quite an easy task to make the record\\". The album was released on 26 November 2007, with an initial pressing of 50,000 copies. However, an additional 120,000 had to be created after the album sold out in a matter of days.Over the Rainbow was re-released on 18 June 2008, with the new version being made available for pre-order in May.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"(ii). yes. While both questions discuss the topic of the human buttocks, the nature of the questions differ significantly in focus and context. Question 1: \\"How was the famous 'Ass To Ass' scene filmed?\\" The famous \\"Ass to Ass\\" scene is a controversial part of the movie \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" directed by Darren Aronofsky. The filmography and techniques used in this scene aimed to depict the dark realities of drug addiction and the character's downward spiral. To film this scene, Aronofsky and his team would have employed various methods to effectively capture the essence and emotion of the scene. First, the director might have used specific camera angles to create an emotionally engaging point of view. This could have been achieved through the use of close-ups and longer shots to establish a voyeuristic perspective, making the audience feel uneasy and uncomfortable. Next, the lighting would have been designed to create a dark and gritty atmosphere, reflecting the intense emotional turmoil experienced by the characters. Low key lighting and chiaroscuro techniques may have been employed to evoke a sense of despair and gloom. The actors involved in the scene would have undergone rehearsal and preparation to accurately convey the character's emotional journey. This could involve practicing the choreography and studying the script to thoroughly understand the motivations behind each character's actions. Lastly, editing and post-production work would have been essential in refining the scene to achieve the desired impact. The editor would have had the task of intuitively syncing the visual and audio elements to maintain the continuity of the story while amplifying emotions. Sound design and score would have played a significant role in enhancing the scene, adding intensity and heightening the overall emotional impact. Question 2: How do I make my ass bigger? Making the buttocks or \\"ass\\" bigger generally involves a combination of exercise, nutrition adjustments, and lifestyle changes. Here are some methods to achieve a more prominent derriere: 1. Exercise: Incorporate strength training exercises, targeting the glutes, into your workout routine. Some popular glute exercises include squats, lunges, hip thrusts, donkey kicks, and glute bridges. Aim to do these exercises 2-3 times per week, using progressive overload by gradually increasing weights or resistance bands. 2. Nutrition: A healthy diet plays a role in shaping the buttocks. Consume a balanced diet that includes complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and lean proteins. Eating frequently in smaller portions may help increase your metabolism, ensuring consistent fuel for muscle-building workouts. A dietitian, personal trainer, or nutritionist can help customize a diet plan for your specific needs. 3. Protein: Increase protein in your diet to support muscle growth. Lean sources of protein include chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, beans, and low-fat dairy products. Consider incorporating protein shakes or supplements if you find it challenging to meet your protein requirements through food alone. 4. Weight Gain: For those who are underweight or have a lean frame, gaining weight in a controlled manner can contribute to a bigger buttocks. A nutritionist can provide guidance on a healthy weight gain plan that focuses on obtaining the right amount of calories, macronutrients, and micronutrients. 5. Lifestyle Changes: Maintain a consistent exercise regimen and healthy diet, but also ensure adequate sleep and recovery for optimal muscle growth. Prioritize rest days from your workouts and aim to minimize stress levels, as stress can impair muscle growth. Remember that individual results may vary depending on genetics, body types, and commitment to the diet and exercise routine. Consulting with a fitness professional or medical expert may help establish a plan tailored to your individual goals, needs, and abilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Backwoods Gallery\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? Answer:","output":"To determine the category to which \\"Backwoods Gallery\\" belongs, I will follow a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Analyze the title for context clues. \\"Backwoods\\" refers to a remote or rural area, and \\"Gallery\\" is usually associated with a place displaying artworks, such as paintings or sculptures. Step 2: Eliminate unlikely categories based on context clues. Given that \\"Backwoods Gallery\\" suggests a display of artworks in a rural area, I can eliminate several categories that do not fit the context: - Educational institution - Athlete - Office holder - Mean of transportation - Building (could be a possibility, but requires further examination) - Natural place - Village - Animal - Plant - Album - Film - Written work Step 3: Examine the remaining categories and compare them to the context. The remaining categories are: - Company - Artist - Building Step 4: Select the most fitting category based on the context. Out of the remaining categories, \\"Backwoods Gallery\\" seems to fit best as an Artist or Company, since it may refer to a business or a group of artists showcasing their work.

Here are possible answers to this question: - mall - kitchen - fairgrounds - neighbor's house - military base  I believe the correct choice is \\"fairgrounds\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"fairgrounds.\\" This is because fairgrounds typically host various events, such as fairs, carnivals, and festivals, where numerous tickets, rides, and games are offered as entertainment. While these attractions generate income, the real money is often made from the sale of food and beverages.  Food vendors at fairgrounds usually offer a wide range of irresistible and delicious options, from classic fair treats like cotton candy, funnel cakes, corn dogs, and deep-fried delights to gourmet festival food, artisanal items, and international cuisine. Visitors to these events are often more than willing to spend money on such indulgent treats.  Due to the temporary and festive nature of these events, guests usually allocate more of their spending budget toward food and beverages as they enjoy the unique atmosphere and communal experience. Additionally, the captive audience at fairgrounds is more likely to splurge on food items as there are limited options for them to eat during their visit.  In summary, the correct answer is \\"fairgrounds\\" because it is a location where tickets, rides, and games are commonly associated with events; however, the main revenue source is from the sale of a diverse range of food and beverages that cater to the large audiences attending these events."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: On April 24th, another natural disaster-the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, happened. Millions of dollars have been used to help stop the spill and to clean up the animals, beaches, and land spoiled by the oil. Unfortunately, when many of these chemicals are used, more damage is caused to the environment, especially to lives in the sea. But governments seem to accept the _ of transporting mil-lions of tons of oil by ship every day so that we can fill up our cars and drive around and cause even more environmental damage. Interestingly, the biggest companies in the world produce cars, and the next biggest supply the gasoline to make them run. Of all of today's environmental disasters, an oil spill may actually be one of the least serious. Although oil is poisonous, it is a natural material. In the end, it breaks down naturally. In 1967 the tanker Torrey Canyon sank off the Scilly Isles near the coast of England and spilled 120,000 tons of oil into the ocean. If you go there today, you will find it hard to see any sign that it ever happened. However, we should be thinking more about reducing our dependency on oil. Governments should be encouraging research into new technologies, such as cars run by solar power, electricity, hydro-gen, and so on. Much of this research, in the past, was stopped by the oil, gas, and coal. If the world's millions of cars were 10% more efficient  ,we would need many fewer tankers crossing the oceans each year. If this happened, the risks of oil spills would be reduced, and the air we breathe would be cleaner and fresher, too. Options: A Oil spills pollution. B What oil pollution is. C Oil tanker accidents.

Q:Title: Problem Product review: Can't have too many of these for my older Nikon dslr, but it is \\"locked\\" and there is no slide as on ALL my others to unlock so it can be formatted and written to. Is it me, or did I get a bad one? Not enough money to return so I will buy another. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","output":"The review depicted in the question highlights a negative experience and thus, portrays the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer discusses a specific issue with the product, which is related to the memory card being \\"locked\\" without any option to unlock it. The fact that this particular card lacks a slide to unlock it for formatting and writing, unlike other memory cards that the reviewer has owned, suggests a potential design flaw or manufacturing defect. This issue ultimately affects the usability of the product, causing dissatisfaction for the customer. Furthermore, the notion of the product being \\"locked\\" could indicate that the customer cannot fully utilize it for their intended purpose – in this case, storing photographs taken with an older Nikon DSLR camera. This also contributes to an overall unfavorable view of the product and can deter potential buyers. The reviewer briefly mentions that they do not believe the issue warrants a return due to the low cost of the item. Although this statement does not necessarily denigrate the product, it does little to counterbalance the negative impression established earlier in the review. The fact that the reviewer decides to purchase another card instead of returning the current one suggests that they have lost faith in this particular product and would rather invest in another option. In conclusion, the review described above negatively portrays the product because it details a crucial functional issue that prevents the customer from using it as intended. The lack of resolution and the decision to buy a different card instead of seeking a refund further underscores an overall unflattering depiction of the product. Potential buyers who come across this review may be discouraged from purchasing the item and might opt for alternative options with more positive reviews and fewer reported issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.  - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico.  - South Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southernmost part of the state. It is one of Florida's three most common \\"directional\\" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida.

South Florida is the only part of the continental United States with a tropical climate.  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet.

Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines.

Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world.  - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.  - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors.

The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go.  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person Ray pleaded with to return for the sessions for their upcoming album?

(AP) — Prosecutors in a murder case against Aaron Hernandez won’t be allowed to tell a jury about two other killings with which the ex-New England Patriot is charged or the final text messages the victim sent to his sister, a judge ruled Friday. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee. He has also pleaded not guilty to the fatal shootings of two men in 2012 after an encounter at a Boston nightclub. Prosecutors have said Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where the double shooting allegedly took place, and suggested that was a possible motive for killing Lloyd. But Judge Susan Garsh, after hearing arguments, said that theory is “clearly in the realm of speculation” and “does not comport with common sense.” She said there was no demonstrated link between the two crimes and disallowed the introduction of the 2012 homicides. Garsh also said Friday she would not admit the final text messages sent by Lloyd to his sister, including one sent just minutes before he was shot to death at an industrial park near Hernandez’s North Attleborough home. Prosecutors say Lloyd sent the messages while in a car with Hernandez and suggested they showed he had become fearful. One said “U saw who I’m with” and another indicated the person was “NFL,” referring to Hernandez. Defense lawyers called it “rank speculation” that the texts indicated fear and said they were inadmissible. Garsh said the texts did not suggest any hostility and that prosecutors didn’t meet the burden to prove Lloyd felt he was at an “imminent death.” Jury selection is scheduled to start Jan. 9. Patriots coach Bill Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft have been listed by prosecutors as possible witnesses. Garsh also ruled that prosecutors may not introduce the shooting of Alexander Bradley, a former associate of Hernandez. Bradley has filed a civil suit against Hernandez that says the ex-player shot him in the face in 2013 after an argument in Florida. Massachusetts prosecutors sought to admit a range of evidence related to the ex-player’s other alleged crimes or “bad acts,” including the Boston homicides, firearms found at Hernandez’s home or elsewhere and even a photograph obtained from the celebrity gossip website TMZ that depicts Hernandez holding a gun. His attorneys warned against compromising his right to a fair trial. “It is critical that this trial be about the murder of Odin Lloyd,” defense attorney James Sultan said Friday. The judge allowed in some evidence relating to firearms, but disallowed the photograph.","output":"A judge ruled on Friday that prosecutors in the murder case against Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriot, cannot tell the jury about two other killings he has been charged with or the final text messages the victim sent to his sister.

So, we will first get all the 'n' parts on one side and the number on the other side. Currently, it looks like this:  -27*n = -18*n + 45. Let's add 27*n to both sides. This is just like playing on a seesaw, we have to make sure it stays balanced. Adding 27*n to both sides will make it: 0 = 9*n + 45.  Getting better, right? Now, our new goal is to leave 'n' alone on one side of the = sign. So let's subtract 45 from both sides, to help our 'n' be on one side: 0 - 45 = 9*n. This becomes -45 = 9*n. We're nearly there! Now we divide 9 from both sides to get the value of 'n'. Just like you split your gummy bears equally with your friend, we'll do the same here.  So -45 divided by 9 will give us the value of 'n'.  When we do that division, we get n = -5. And that's our answer! Great job, you did really well! Our mystery 'n' turned out to be -5! So if this was a treasure hunt, we found the treasure.

Hull's third-choice keeper Eldin Jakupovic could again start for Hull against Southampton on Saturday. Southampton. Sadio Mane could return to the Southampton squad as Saints look to maintain their impressive run of form at Hull. Mane was rested as a precaution against Stoke in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night. The midfielder was expected to train on Friday in the hope that he will be included in the squad that travels to East Yorkshire. Saints manager Ronald Koeman, whose team have won six of their last seven Barclays Premier League matches, otherwise has a full squad to select from. Provisional squad: Forster, K Davis, Cropper, Clyne, Fonte, Gardos, Alderweireld, Bertrand, Targett, Schneiderlin, S Davis, Wanyama, Reed, Cork, Tadic, Yoshida, Mane, Long, Mayuka, Pelle, Gallagher. Sadio Mane is set to return to the Southampton squad after missing their midweek Capital One Cup tie. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Hull City have drawn five of their nine Premier League games this season – they only drew seven in the whole of 2013-14. Southampton have won their last four league games against Hull and lost just one of the last 16 in all comps (W10 D5 L1), incl. a meeting in the Full Members Cup in 1986/87. Southampton have won six of their opening nine games to a top-flight season for the first time in their history. Ronald Koeman’s side have conceded just five league goals this season; fewer than any other team in England’s top four divisions. Four of those five goals have been conceded on the road, with the Saints managing just one clean sheet in four games away from St Mary’s in the PL this term. Hull players look on as Jose Fonte pounces to score in Southampton's 1-0 win at the KC Stadium in February - the Saint's fourth consecutive victory over the Tigers in all competitions. Southampton have won every game that they have scored first in this season in the Premier League (5/5). No-one has dropped more points from leading positions this season than Hull City (8 – level with Swansea City). Hull (11 points, 10th position) are exactly where they were after nine games of the season in 2013/14, although they have lost only two games this season (W2 D5) compared to four at this season last season (W3 D2). The Tigers have scored exactly two goals in each of their last three home league games (W1 D1 L1). No side have caught their opponents offside on fewer occasions this season than Hull City (6; level with Stoke).

Orthanc uses either SQLite or PostgreSQL as its database backend, depending on your configuration. It's important to know that Orthanc abstracts away the file system and database interactions; thus, you generally don't access file paths or the database directly during normal operation. When you configure Orthanc to store files on the file system, it will create a directory structure based on UUIDs that correspond to the stored DICOM instances. Orthanc generates these UUIDs for internal consistency and indexing and typically does not expose the actual file paths via its database schema. Instead, it provides APIs to access the DICOM files and related metadata. To locate DICOM files on the system, Orthanc provides a REST API that can be used. For example, to retrieve an image with a known Orthanc identifier, you would use a URL like this in your web browser or HTTP client: \`\`\` http://[orthanc-server-address]:[port]/instances/[orthanc-instance-id]/file \`\`\` Replace \`[orthanc-server-address]\`, \`[port]\`, and \`[orthanc-instance-id]\` with the appropriate values for your Orthanc server and the specific DICOM instance you're interested in. Accessing this URL will result in the DICOM file being streamed to the client. If you still need to access the database directly for some reason, such as a custom migration or integration task, please note the following: 1. **For SQLite:** The default database used by Orthanc is SQLite. The file paths in SQLite are typically stored within the file \`OrthancStorage.db\`. 2. **For PostgreSQL:** If you use PostgreSQL, similar information would be stored within tables in the PostgreSQL database you configured for Orthanc. In either case, extensive knowledge about the database schema and careful consideration of the risks is necessary before manually interacting with the database. It's usually preferable to interact with Orthanc through its REST API or official plugins to avoid corrupting the data or interfering with its internal processes. To obtain detailed information about the file system layout or database schema used by your Orthanc installation, you should consult the Orthanc documentation for your particular version and setup: - [Orthanc Book](https://book.orthanc-server.com/) - [Orthanc Users Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/orthanc-users) Directly accessing the database is not common practice and should be done with care and understanding of the risks involved. Always backup your data before making direct database queries or changes."},{"instruction":"How actual paths to files are usually stored in database? Are they hashed?","output":"How the actual paths to files are stored in a database can vary significantly based on the system architecture, security requirements, and other considerations specific to the application or system in question. Here are a few common ways in which file paths are stored: # Absolute or Relative Paths: Most commonly, file paths are stored as plain text either as absolute paths or relative paths. Absolute paths specify the file's location from the root of the file system, while relative paths specify the file's location relative to a certain directory (often the application's working directory or a designated data directory). # UUID / ID Mapping: Instead of storing file paths directly, a system might store a unique identifier (like a UUID or an auto-incrementing ID) for each file in the database. The actual file is then saved on the filesystem with its name based on this identifier. The mapping between the ID and the file content is then managed by the application logic. # Hashed Filenames: Hashing is often used to generate a unique filename based on the file content (or other relevant data) to prevent conflicts and to obfuscate the original filename for security purposes. However, the hash is usually part of the filename itself, not the path. The actual path (minus the filename) is typically stored as plain text and combined with the hashed filename when accessing the file. # Encrypted Paths: For additional security, some systems may encrypt file paths before storing them in the database. This measure prevents anyone with access to the database (but not the encryption key) from knowing the actual file paths. # Binary Large Object (BLOB) Storage: Instead of storing file paths, databases can store the file data directly in the database as a BLOB. This approach means that files are not stored in the filesystem separately, but rather their contents are directly in the database, retrievable through standard database queries. # Content Addressable Storage: Some systems, including distributed file systems and object stores, use content addressing, where the file content's hash dictates where and how the file is stored. These systems usually manage mappings internally without exposing the actual file paths to the users. # Considerations: - **Performance**: Large numbers of files and path lookups can impact database performance, making some of the above solutions more suitable than others. - **Security**: Storing paths as plain text can lead to security risks if malicious users gain access to the database. - **Portability**: Using absolute paths can cause issues if the system moves to a different environment whereas relative paths or UUID/ID mappings are more portable. - **Backup/Recovery**: Consider how file paths and actual files will be backed up and restored, as this may affect the selected strategy. Each method has its use cases and trade-offs, and the choice depends on the specific requirements of the application, such as the need for security, performance, and the ease of backup and recovery. In most conventional applications, using relative paths with a predictable structure or UUID/ID mapping to manage files within the file system is quite common and balances simplicity with flexibility."},{"instruction":"Describe blissful dishonesty, denial of obscene truths","output":"Blissful dishonesty is the act of deliberately ignoring or denying unpleasant or obscene truths in order to maintain a sense of peace or happiness.

However, if we were to explore an alternate storyline where Arya gradually abandons her quest for revenge to instead focus on helping Gendry stay alive, this would mean a significant shift in her character development and plot trajectory. This change could have various implications and outcomes depending on when and how this shift occurs. Assuming Arya decides to prioritize Gendry's safety post their reunion in the later seasons, here are some possibilities: 1. **Character Growth**: Abandoning her revenge quest would signify a major development in Arya's character. This would show her maturity and her ability to let go of past grievances for the sake of personal connections, which is something she struggles with throughout the series. 2. **Deepening Relationship**: Arya's decision to prioritize Gendry could lead to a closer bond between them, both in terms of friendship or a more romantic relationship, as hinted in the series. 3. **Altered Dynamics**: Arya's attention towards Gendry might affect her relationships with other key characters. For example, her interactions with the Hound might change, as she might no longer see him solely through the lens of vengeance. 4. **Change in Destiny**: Arya's fate and her role in the overarching plot of the series would likely change. She might not be at certain pivotal places at key times if she's focused on Gendry's safety. This could especially impact her storyline in the final season and the battle against the White Walkers. 5. **Survival Skills**: Arya's skills as a fighter and a survivor would be an asset to Gendry. Her protective nature could lead to different encounters and possibly avoid dangerous situations that would have otherwise occurred. 6. **Gendry’s Role**: Gendry's character might undergo a change with Arya's support. With Arya by his side, Gendry could rise in prominence and confidence, potentially affecting his claim to the Baratheon lineage and possibly politics in Westeros. 7. **Plot Consequences**: With Arya no longer seeking vengeance, certain deaths might be averted, altering the series' storyline. For instance, she may spend less time in King’s Landing, and key characters that she kills might survive or meet different fates. In conclusion, Arya choosing to safeguard Gendry over her own personal vengeance would represent a compelling narrative shift that could significantly alter both their character arcs and potentially the outcome of certain events in Westeros. It's intriguing to consider how her reprioritized objectives would ripple through the \\"Game of Thrones\\" saga, influencing not just their lives but potentially the political and social landscape of the Seven Kingdoms."},{"instruction":"What could be a deep reason why Arya has s Change of priority?","output":"There could be several deep and nuanced reasons for Arya Stark to change her priorities from revenge to protecting Gendry. Here are some speculative explanations that align with her character's journey: 1. **Human Connection**: Throughout Arya's journey, she struggles with maintaining her humanity in the face of the trauma she has experienced. Finding solace or even a sense of family with Gendry could remind her of the importance of human connection over vengeance. 2. **Realization of the Cycle of Violence**: Arya could come to understand that her quest for revenge is perpetuating the cycle of violence that destroyed her family in the first place. Protecting Gendry could represent a newfound desire to break this cycle and choose a path that leads to healing rather than more bloodshed. 3. **The Influence of Family**: Arya's changing priorities could reflect the lessons she learned from her family about the importance of protecting one another. This mirrors the Stark family ethos of unity and support: \\"The lone wolf dies, but the pack survives.\\" 4. **Moral/Philosophical Growth**: As Arya matures, she may undergo a philosophical shift, questioning the moral implications of her actions and whether revenge truly brings satisfaction or just emptiness. Helping Gendry could symbolize her choosing life and creation over death and destruction. 5. **Love**: Arya might realize she has developed romantic feelings for Gendry, which could change her motivations and life goals. This would not be out of character given the moments of vulnerability between the two in the series. 6. **Identity Crisis**: Throughout the series, Arya struggles with her identity, especially during her time with the Faceless Men. She may choose to protect Gendry as part of reaffirming who she is: a Stark of Winterfell who values family and friends over blind vengeance. 7. **Long-Term Vision**: Arya might start to prioritize the larger battle against the White Walkers and the survival of humanity. In this context, she may see ensuring Gendry's survival as part of a broader strategy to preserve human life and fight the greater threat. 8. **Sense of Purpose**: Arya could develop a sense of purpose that goes beyond personal revenge. By helping Gendry, she might feel that she is contributing to something larger and more meaningful than her list of names. 9. **Fatigue from Violence**: Facing so much death and having been so deeply involved in violence might wear Arya down emotionally, making her long for a simpler, more peaceful existence—a life that centers around caring for those she loves, like Gendry. 10. **Foresight**: Knowing that Gendry has a potential claim to the Iron Throne as a Baratheon, Arya might realize that keeping him alive is important for the power balance in Westeros and could lead to a more just ruler than those currently in contention. These reasons, alone or combined, would represent a profound shift in Arya's character, allowing her to move from a path of darkness and solitude to one of light and companionship, coinciding with themes of redemption and the search for meaning that permeate the series."},{"instruction":"How could this shift be done in a well written, subtle, realistic way?","output":"To craft a subtle and realistic shift in Arya Stark's priorities in a well-written narrative, writers would handle the transition organically, laying the groundwork over time rather than through sudden changes. Here are some steps that could be taken to effectively portray this change in Arya's character: 1. **Gradual Change**: Start with small moments where Arya shows concern for Gendry beyond the scope of her usual interactions. Instead of a sudden abandonment of her quest, she begins to question it internally, and these doubts are reflected in her actions and dialogue. 2. **Show Internal Conflict**: Convey her internal struggle through her expressions, hesitations, and the decisions she faces. Arya could be shown to wrestle with a decision where she must choose between pursuing a name on her list or ensuring Gendry's safety. Her ultimate decision would reveal where her priorities lie. 3. **Reflective Moments**: Include scenes where Arya reflects on her past, perhaps triggered by witnessing innocent people suffering due to revenge-driven actions. These moments of introspection would illustrate her evolving mindset. 4. **A Catalyst Event**: A life-threatening situation involving Gendry could serve as a catalyst for Arya to reassess her values and the importance of her bond with him. Saving him would become a turning point, emphasizing her emotional investment in his well-being. 5. **Character Interactions**: Use conversations with other characters (like The Hound, Jon Snow, or Sansa) in which they discuss the nature of revenge, the value of family and friends, or the cost of holding onto anger. This could challenge and influence Arya's perspective. 6. **Foreshadowing Through Dialogue and Symbolism**: Plant seeds early on, with lines of dialogue or symbolic gestures that foreshadow a change in Arya's priorities. For instance, she may pass up opportunities to talk about her list and instead show more interest in Gendry's blacksmithing or his views on life after the war. 7. **Consequences of Revenge**: Illustrate the negative consequences of revenge through other characters' arcs and use them as a mirror for Arya's journey, making her reassess the outcomes she desires from her own path. 8. **Positive Reinforcement**: When Arya prioritizes Gendry, show positive outcomes that reinforce her decision. This could be as simple as a heartwarming scene that acknowledges her choices, strengthening her resolve to choose this new path. 9. **Internal Monologue**: If adapting this shift for a book, employ Arya's internal monologue to reveal her gradual change in thinking. In a visual medium like television, this could be translated through voiceovers or dream sequences. 10. **Gendry's Influence**: Illustrate how Gendry's views on the world, his own experiences with loss, and his grounded nature influence Arya and contribute to her transformation. By weaving these elements into the storytelling, Arya's shift in priorities can be portrayed in a nuanced and believable manner. Her change would emerge as a logical progression of her character's journey, influenced by her experiences and the relationships she has formed, especially with Gendry. This approach would allow viewers or readers to empathize with Arya's growth and accept her evolution from a revenge-driven assassin to a character who values human connections and prioritizes the well-being of those she cares about."},{"instruction":"Building on this, What if Gendry, post reunion, had trouble keeping his emotions together, being driven by guilt and shame and self loathing after hearing about what happened to Arya over the past years, and serving her out of guilt and obligation. How could Arya help him, and how can his serving out of guilt and obligation slowly become pure love-driven?","output":"Given this exploration into Gendry's emotional state post-reunion with Arya, where he struggles with guilt, shame, and self-loathing upon learning about her suffering, we can envision a reciprocal process of healing that aids both their developments. Here's how Arya could help Gendry navigate his troubled emotions, and how this initial sense of guilt and obligation could transform into an authentic, love-driven connection: **Arya Helping Gendry:** 1. **Listening and Understanding**: Arya would need to be a patient listener, allowing Gendry to express his feelings without judgment. Her strength and resilience could provide a stable space for him to unpack his guilt and shame. 2. **Acceptance**: Arya could assure Gendry that she doesn't blame him for what happened to her and that she values his presence in her life, not his guilt-driven service. This could be a powerful affirmation for Gendry's self-worth. 3. **Shared Vulnerability**: Arya can share her own vulnerabilities and traumas, not to compare sufferings, but to create a bridge of mutual understanding and empathy. Sharing her own journey could help Gendry see that everyone's path is fraught with pain, and self-forgiveness is a necessary step toward healing. 4. **Encouraging Agency**: Arya could encourage Gendry to make choices for himself, not just out of a sense of obligation to her or her family. By promoting his autonomy, she supports his growth beyond his guilt. 5. **Emphasizing His Goodness**: Arya can remind Gendry of his actions and character strengths, highlighting moments when he's been kind, brave, or honorable. She can help him recognize that he has always been more than his mistakes or his past. **Gendry's Transition from Guilt to Love:** 1. **Self-Reflection**: Over time, through introspection and conversations with Arya, Gendry begins to understand that serving out of guilt is not sustainable and that he wants to be valuable in Arya's life in a positive and genuine way. 2. **Acts of Kindness**: Instead of serving Arya out of guilt, Gendry can start doing things for her because he genuinely cares. His actions and motivations become less about making amends and more about forming meaningful connections. 3. **Emotional Support Reciprocated**: As Gendry starts to support Arya in various ways, Arya also provides him with emotional support. This reciprocity deepens their bond and helps Gendry to see that their relationship is based on mutual care and respect, not just his unilateral atonement. 4. **Witnessing Arya's Growth**: Seeing Arya overcome her own demons and becoming more compassionate and embracing life could inspire Gendry. As he witnesses her choose life and connections over revenge, he too might choose love over guilt. 5. **Positive Reinforcement**: When Gendry acts out of love and genuine care, and Arya responds positively, he receives the affirmation that fills the void guilt once occupied. Through these interactions, he learns that love, not guilt, is what strengthens their bond. 6. **Finding Joy Together**: Sharing moments of joy and respite from the chaos of their world can be a critical step in their emotional journey. As they find happiness in each other's company, Gendry's motivation can evolve from a place of obligation to one of desire to be together because it feels right and good. By following this path, the writers can demonstrate how two people, scarred by their pasts, can help each other to grow and heal. Rather than being bound by guilt and obligation, Gendry learns to serve out of love - a transformation that enriches his character's depth and provides a satisfying arc to his relationship with Arya. This nuance not only contributes to Gendry's development but also helps to underscore Arya's growth from avenger to healer and friend."},{"instruction":"Building on this, what if there was a parallel character arc in which both Jon and Daenerys seem to get along fine at first, before, as the story progresses, it’s decline begins rapidly speeding up before crashing completely near the end of the series. How could Experiences with Winter, and slightly too much positivity and idealism, expressed by both Jon and Daenerys, be the relationship’s downfall?","output":"A parallel character arc featuring Jon Snow and Daenerys Targaryen could explore the complexities and eventual downfall of their relationship, despite its positive beginnings. The harsh realities of winter, coupled with a sense of over-optimism and idealism from both characters, could potentially play a significant role in the unraveling of their alliance and affection. Here’s how such a narrative might unfold: **Initial Unity and Momentum:** At first, Jon and Daenerys connect over shared visions of a better future for the Seven Kingdoms. They are united against common enemies and share a powerful sense of purpose. This propels their relationship forward, as they believe they can overcome any obstacle together with the right intentions and the willingness to fight for the good of the people. **Cracks Begin to Form:** As winter sets in, the sense of unyielding optimism that originally brought them together begins to falter in the face of mounting challenges. Resources become scarce, conditions worsen, and the reality of governing amidst such hardship proves to be far more complicated than either anticipated. The burdens of leadership weigh heavily on them, and their idealistic solutions start to seem naive. 1. **Testing Ideologies:** Both Jon and Daenerys have strong principles shaped by their past experiences and upbringing. However, as they confront the practicalities of ruling in a relentless winter, they face situations where their ideals conflict with reality. The compromises required to survive and keep their people safe might directly clash with their deeply held beliefs. 2. **Daenerys and Control:** Daenerys's desire to \\"break the wheel\\" could turn into somewhat of an obsession, with her idealism blinding her to the negative impact of some of her actions. As winter exacerbates the sufferings of the realm, her methods of maintaining control could become more draconian, causing friction in her relationship with Jon. 3. **Jon and Trust:** Jon's inherent trust in people and his insistence on honor could lead to strategic missteps. His reluctance to engage in political maneuvering and his optimistic belief that straightforwardness will win the day could result in significant losses or betrayals. 4. **Differing Leadership Styles:** Daenerys is accustomed to absolute rule, while Jon values consensus and collaboration. The dissonance between their leadership styles becomes clear as winter's demands grow more severe, and each situation requires quick, decisive action—often without the luxury of a perfect solution. 5. **Conflicting Priorities:** Jon remains firmly focused on the threat of the White Walkers, while Daenerys is driven by her claim to the Iron Throne and the re-establishment of Targaryen rule. While initially, this dual focus seems beneficial, ultimately, their inability to fully align their priorities creates tension. **The Downfall:** As the story progresses, the realities of winter reveal the limitations of Jon and Daenerys's idealistic approaches. The stark differences in their worldviews become insurmountable, and the consequences of their decisions begin to erode the foundation of their relationship. 1. **Mistrust and Miscommunication:** The pressures of leadership in harsh conditions foster an environment ripe for misunderstandings. Their optimistic natures make them ill-prepared for deceit and manipulation from others, leading to mistrust between them. 2. **Losses and Sacrifices:** The sacrifices necessary to survive the winter and political conflicts take a personal toll on both characters, hardening them and driving a divide between their previously aligned goals. 3. **The Public and Loyalty:** The people they lead might start questioning their overly optimistic and idealistic rulers, who seem disconnected from the suffering around them. The fading loyalty of their followers could add another layer of conflict between Jon and Daenerys. The decline of their relationship underlines a major theme: the danger of idealism when it lacks pragmatism, especially in the face of unforgiving circumstances like the permanent winter in \\"Game of Thrones.\\" Both characters learn that positive intentions are not always enough, and leadership often requires a balance between ideals and the harsh truths of reality. The rapid deterioration and eventual collapse of their union serve as a poignant reminder of the complex nature of power, love, and governance in a world where survival is never guaranteed."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but Daenerys is the more idealistic and positive one, and Jon is more realistic. How could Daenerys stay grounded and idealistic at first, before experiences with winter slowly erode that. Also, despite being realistic, how could Jon’s sense of honor and his personal craving to belong help destroy the relationship. Also, how could winter, and Jon, unintentionally, cause Daenerys to snap in the very end?","output":"In this alternative narrative, Daenerys Targaryen begins her relationship with Jon Snow as the beacon of hope and idealism, dreaming of a brighter, just future for the Seven Kingdoms. Jon, with his realistic outlook shaped by the grim realities of the North, provides a sharp contrast to Daenerys's optimism. However, his personal issues contribute to the fracture of their bond alongside the hardships of winter. Here's an exploration of how this scenario could play out: **Daenerys's Initial Idealism:** Daenerys's positive vision fuels her campaigns and drives her to end the long-standing injustices in Westeros. Having seen slavery and corruption, she wants to rebuild a world based on fairness, freedom, and prosperity. Jon supports her but also works to ground her ideals in the practicalities he's known all his life. **Jon's Realism and Personal Struggles:** Jon Snow, shaped by the austerity of the Night's Watch and the starkness of the North's landscape, knows the cold, hard truths of survival. While he wants to believe in Daenerys's brighter future, he can't fully embrace her idealistic goals without considering the costs. His sense of honor and deep need for belonging—stemming from his bastard status—complicate matters, as they sometimes compel him to make choices that prioritize noble ideals over pragmatic solutions or align him with family over Daenerys, thereby inadvertently undermining her. **Experiences with Winter:** As the relentless winter grips the land, the pair face challenges that test Daenerys's utopian aspirations. Food shortages, the threat of the White Walkers, and the immediate needs of the people strain her resolve. Daenerys struggles to maintain her vision as she's forced to make choices that clash with her ideals—constraints that Jon had anticipated, but Daenerys had hoped to transcend. **Changes in Daenerys:** Through the bitter winter, Daenerys's optimism begins to crumble under the weight of each compromise and defeat. The war against the undead, the reality of starvation and disease among her people, and the dark underbelly of Westerosi politics slowly chip away at her idealism. She must constantly grapple with the notion that her dream of a new and just world might be unattainable in a land that seems unable to escape its cycles of violence and betrayal. **The Breaking Point:** Jon’s own moral code and his divided loyalties, particularly as truths about his lineage emerge, exacerbate the situation. His commitment to doing what's right—even when it conflicts with Daenerys's goals or strategies—creates a rift that widens over time. Moreover, his North-centric focus jars Daenerys, who had hoped he could help unite all of Westeros under her vision. **Daenerys's Snap:** In the end, what causes Daenerys to snap could be a convergence of all these factors compounded by a critical and harrowing failure or betrayal. Perhaps a catastrophic defeat where she loses a significant portion of her army, or a close confidant's treachery, triggers her fall. Her existential crisis is aggravated by Jon's inability to substitute her lost idealism with anything she considers meaningful. This complex system of pressures, along with Jon's struggle to reassure her that the smaller victories and compromises can still lead to long-term good, might lead to Daenerys making an impulsive, drastic decision. This could manifest as a violent outburst or a misguided ruling that irrevocably damages the people and the land she came to save. In her final moments, Daenerys could represent the tragic figure of a leader whose once-benevolent goals were destroyed by the very issues she sought to conquer, leaving her legacy in question. Jon's role in her undoing is complex—his realism was a necessary counterbalance to her ambition, but his own sense of honor and quest for belonging unwittingly contributed to her spiral, highlighting the intricacies of their ill-fated alliance."},{"instruction":"How could Jon’s reputation in the North be damaged by all this in the process?","output":"Jon Snow's reputation in the North could be damaged through the progression of events and various misunderstandings or disagreements with Northern expectations and traditions. Here are some ways this might happen within the context of his relationship with Daenerys and the ongoing hardships of winter: **Perceived Betrayal of the North:** Jon's alliance with Daenerys, whom many Northerners see as an outsider and a Southern ruler, can be viewed as a betrayal of Northern independence. His decision to bend the knee without consulting the Northern lords could be seen as him valuing his personal ambitions or affections over the collective will of his people. **Prioritizing Targaryen Goals:** If Jon is perceived to prioritize Daenerys’s claim to the Iron Throne and her wider Westerosi objectives over the immediate needs of the North, such as improving their defenses against the cold and the White Walkers, he could lose the trust and support of his own people. **Cultural Misalignment:** The North is steeped in tradition and values resilience and simplicity. Daenerys’s vision for the future of Westeros and her means might contrast starkly with Northern values. If Jon is seen as too strongly endorsing or adopting foreign customs and policies at the expense of Northern traditions, this could lead to a perceived loss of his Northern identity. **Collateral Damage:** If Jon’s association with Daenerys leads to disastrous outcomes, such as significant Northern losses in battles that are believed to be more about Daenerys’s claim than the North's survival, his reputation would suffer. Any tactics used by Daenerys that result in harm to Northerners could reflect poorly on Jon as well. **Failure to Protect Against Winter:** Underestimating the winter could result in inadequate preparations leading to famine, freezing, and death. If Jon is unable to safeguard his people against the harsh conditions or if his attention seems divided, it would be seen as a failure to fulfill his duties as the “King in the North.\\" **Family Feuds:** Conflicts with other Stark family members over his allegiance to Daenerys or other matters could bring further questioning of his judgment from the Northern populace, who hold the Stark family name in high regard. **Rumors and Politics:** In the politics-heavy environment of Westeros, rumors can spread quickly and be just as damaging as the truth. If Jon’s opponents manipulate the narrative to paint him as a traitor or power-hungry, it could lead to a deterioration of his standing. **Personal Sacrifices Ignored:** Even if Jon’s actions are motivated by self-sacrifice for the greater good, they may not be seen or understood by his people. The complexities of leadership decisions often aren’t fully appreciated by the masses, and Jon’s sacrifices might be overshadowed by the visible costs endured by the North. All these factors combined can create a narrative of a leader who, despite his best intentions, is perceived to have strayed from the core values and interests of his people. Jon’s reputation takes a hit as the Northerners feel increasingly alienated from his leadership and decisions. This growing discontent would not only weaken his political position but could also lead to a larger existential crisis for Jon, who deeply values his Northern roots and identity."},{"instruction":"In parallel, how could Gendry and Arya save their relationship through the acknowledgment of the possibilities of their deaths or separation, and viewing such things through ironic humor at times, whilst still encouraging each other to press on? How could this have helped the relationship of Jon and Daenerys?","output":"In a narrative where Gendry and Arya face the harsh realities of their world but manage to save their relationship, the key could lie in their ability to embrace their mortality and the fragility of their situation with a blend of stoic resolve and dark, ironic humor. This coping mechanism could provide a shared strength and deeper connection as they encourage each other to continue their fight for survival. For **Gendry and Arya**, the continual acknowledgment of possible death or separation can become a bonding element in their relationship: 1. **Acceptance of Reality**: By accepting the high likelihood of death or separation, they remove some of the fear and anxiety surrounding their future. This acceptance allows them to focus on the present and appreciate the time they have together. 2. **Shared Humor**: Their use of ironic humor in the face of deadly serious situations can be cathartic and a way to diffuse tension. Laughing together at the absurdity of their predicaments or the grimness of their world strengthens their bond and gives them moments of relief from constant stress. 3. **Stoic Encouragement**: When one falters under the pressure, the other can use their shared understanding of mortality to offer a reality check and encouragement. They know that each moment could be their last, so they strive to make the most of their time. 4. **Mutual Support**: They remind each other of their strengths and past achievements to inspire confidence. This mutual encouragement helps maintain their morale and drive to persevere through the hardships they face. 5. **Making the Most of the Now**: Honoring the fragility of life, they tend to seize opportunities for connection and joy when they present themselves, intensifying their commitment to one another and further solidifying their bond. For **Jon and Daenerys**, adopting a similar dynamic might have helped their relationship withstand the tense and challenging circumstances they faced: 1. **Openness About Fears**: Sharing their fears of death and the potential failure of their mission could have created a space for mutual understanding. Acknowledging the dangers they face might have fostered a greater sense of partnership as they confront their challenges side by side. 2. **Maintaining Perspective**: A bit of self-deprecating humor might have helped to cut through the enormity of their responsibilities, allowing them to vent frustrations and reduce the psychological toll of their positions. 3. **Balanced Realism and Idealism**: If they'd found a way to balance Jon's realism with Daenerys's idealism, perhaps by using humor and acknowledgement of their potential demise as a common ground, they might have been more willing to compromise when their ideals conflicted with the hard truths of their situation. 4. **Finding Joy in Shared Goals**: Celebrating small victories and allowing moments of genuine connection amid the grim reality could have helped maintain their morale and resolve, reminding them of what they fight for. 5. **Accepting the Uncontrollable**: By embracing the unpredictability of life, especially during wartime, they could develop a more relaxed approach to their relationship, focusing less on the pressures of legacy and rule and more on their immediate journey together. If Gendry and Arya's approach to their relationship had influenced Jon and Daenerys, they might have found common ground in resilience and hope, learned to navigate their differing leadership styles with empathy, and maintained a unified front in times of uncertainty. Utilizing humor, shared vulnerability, and a focus on the present could have fortified their partnership, providing them with the strength to face whatever end their paths entailed."},{"instruction":"How could Sansa have secretly trained Gendry before, during, and after winter?","output":"Sansa Stark training Gendry in secret would be an interesting twist in the \\"Game of Thrones\\" narrative, though it's important to note that in the series as it stands, there's no evidence that such training took place. However, if we were to entertain this hypothetical scenario, the nature of Sansa's training would likely be more focused on politics, strategy, and the intricacies of nobility rather than physical combat, given that Gendry is already skilled as a blacksmith and a fighter. Here's how it could unfold: **Before Winter:** Prior to the onset of winter, Sansa could have recognized Gendry's potential importance as the last living son of King Robert Baratheon. With Jon Snow's introduction of Gendry to the Stark family, Sansa may have taken it upon herself to ensure he has the knowledge required to navigate the complexities of Westerosi politics. 1. **Hidden Lessons**: Sansa could offer Gendry informal lessons under the guise of simple conversations about history, law, and the noble houses of Westeros. These discussions might be framed as mutual learning experiences, allowing for secrecy. 2. **Observational Learning**: Inviting Gendry to attend small council meetings under a pretext, or having him present during discussions of governance, would provide him with valuable insights into diplomacy and rule. **During Winter:** The long winter nights and extended periods indoors would provide ample opportunity for Sansa and Gendry to continue their private discussions and lessons. 1. **Political Maneuvering**: As the North prepares for the battle against the White Walkers, Sansa could demonstrate the importance of alliances, supply management, and morale, using the war efforts as practical examples. 2. **Survival Strategies**: Winter brings harsh realities, and Sansa could share Stark wisdom on managing resources, dealing with the cold, and protecting the vulnerable—lessons critical for any leader. **After Winter:** Once the immediate threat of the White Walkers has passed, the focus of training could shift to long-term strategies for rebuilding and ruling. 1. **Statecraft**: Post-winter, Gendry would need to understand more complex issues such as justice systems, economic recovery, and dealing with the traumas of war. Sansa, having learned a great deal from her various mentors, could provide guidance in these areas. 2. **Building Influence**: Gendry may have a potential claim to the throne or other titles, so Sansa could instruct him on how to cultivate loyalty and establish himself as a leader people would follow. For this secret training to remain a clandestine operation, Sansa and Gendry would have needed to use coded language, discreet meetings, and perhaps even enlist the help of trustworthy confidants to facilitate their sessions. The rationale for such secrecy could range from protecting Gendry's claim from potential enemies to simply ensuring that he isn't overwhelmed by those who might wish to manipulate him for their own ends. This partnership could also serve to strengthen the bonds between the Stark family and Gendry, positioning him as a valuable ally with a considerable understanding of how to be effective in the political arena of Westeros. Sansa's mentorship would reflect her growth into a shrewd and capable leader, and Gendry's willingness to learn would show his humility and dedication to any future role he might assume."},{"instruction":"How could House stark appear to have a downfall, before being saved by Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Gendry.","output":"In a \\"Game of Thrones\\" narrative where House Stark faces apparent downfall before being rescued by Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Gendry, their salvation could rely on the unique strengths and abilities each character brings to the table. Here's one way the story might unfold: **The Apparent Downfall:** The Stark family, known for their honor and resilience, could face a series of catastrophic events leading to their apparent downfall. This might include military defeats, loss of alliances, political betrayal, and economic hardships, which leave them isolated and vulnerable. The ruling powers and the general populace might believe that the Stark rule is effectively over. **The Stark Siblings' Salvation Plan:** 1. **Sansa's Political Acumen:** Sansa has learned from some of the most cunning minds in Westeros, such as Cersei Lannister and Littlefinger. Using her political savvy, she begins to meticulously rebuild alliances and negotiate support. She could work to expose the treacheries that led to their supposed downfall, turning public opinion back in favor of House Stark. 2. **Arya's Covert Operations:** Using the skills she acquired from her time with the Faceless Men, Arya could undertake clandestine missions to gather intelligence or remove critical threats to their house. Her efforts would be crucial in dismantling the plots against their family, striking fear into the hearts of their enemies through her secretive and effective interventions. 3. **Bran's Visions and Strategy:** Bran, as the Three-Eyed Raven, possesses the ability to see events across time and space. His insights would be invaluable in predicting enemy moves and advising his siblings on the best course of action. Bran could provide critical information that would allow the Starks to outmaneuver their rivals, ensuring that they are always one step ahead. 4. **Gendry's Claim and Craftsmanship:** Gendry, with his royal lineage as Robert Baratheon's bastard, could prove to be an important figure in rallying support from houses still loyal to his father. Moreover, his skills as a blacksmith could be used to reinforce Winterfell and arm their forces, making House Stark a formidable opponent once again. **The Turning Point:** Each sibling's actions, orchestrated under Sansa's leadership, gradually undermine the forces that contributed to their family's downfall. Arya's silent takedowns of strategic enemies, Bran's prophetic warnings, and Gendry's bolstering of their defenses create a series of small victories that start turning the tide. **The Resurgence:** The resurgence of House Stark would likely come in a moment of triumph, such as repelling a significant attack on Winterfell, uncovering a conspiracy against them, or forming a new, powerful alliance. This would be the public sign that the Starks are not only still in the game but are a force to be reckoned with. The Stark return to power would emphasize themes of resilience and the strength of family bonds. Each sibling's contribution would be crucial, but it would be the combined force of their unity and shared commitment that allows them to reclaim their family's honor and status. The story would underline that while the individual Starks are powerful in their own right, they are strongest together, mirroring the Stark family words: \\"Winter is coming.\\" This collective effort, bolstered by loyalty, intelligence, and strategically acquired power, allows them to survive and rise again, securing House Stark's future in the North."},{"instruction":"‘Downfall’ as in morally.","output":"If the moral downfall of House Stark is what's being explored, we could imagine a scenario where the hardship and relentless pursuit of power have pushed the Starks to compromise on their cherished values of honor and integrity. However, through the collaborative efforts of Sansa, Arya, Bran, and Gendry, the noble spirit of House Stark could be restored. Here's how this might play out: **Moral Compromise:** The Starks, known for their steadfast honor, might be drawn into the morally ambiguous game of thrones and make choices that betray their principles. This could manifest as broken promises, unjust decisions, or alliances that go against their inherent sense of justice. The very survival of House Stark could be at stake, leading them to adopt a darker, more ruthless approach that tarnishes their reputation. **Personal Reckoning:** 1. **Sansa's Leadership:** Feeling the weight of what has been lost in the name of survival, Sansa might begin to question the cost of their moral compromises. As the political mind of the siblings, she leads the way in acknowledging the departure from their father's teachings and what it means for their future as a family and as leaders. 2. **Arya's Empathy:** Arya, whose path has been defined by vengeance and violence, might come to realize the cycle of pain she perpetuates. By witnessing the consequences of her actions and those of her family, she may push for a return to the Stark way, seeking justice and protection for the innocent over personal gain. 3. **Bran's Perspective:** With Bran's all-seeing abilities, he provides an objective view of how far they've strayed. He could offer critical insights into the long-term repercussions of their current path, urging his siblings to remember who they are and the legacy they wish to uphold. 4. **Gendry's Outsider View:** Gendry, not raised as a Stark, could hold a mirror to their actions, expressing how these choices contrast with the honorable image he once had of the Starks. His perspective can be a call to action, reminding them of the virtues that made people across the Seven Kingdoms respect and support their house. **The Redemption:** 1. **Restoring Honor:** Confronted with the reality of their moral downfall, the siblings actively seek to make amends. This could involve championing just causes, dispensing fair justice, or distancing themselves from corrupt allies. Each sibling could commit to a specific act of atonement that aligns with their strengths and past wrongdoings. 2. **Renewed Principles:** Embracing their father's legacy of honor, they begin to lead with transparency, fairness, and a renewed dedication to the well-being of their people rather than their power. They thrust their personal ambitions aside to focus on the greater good, working to repair the trust that has been broken. 3. **Public Acts of Contrition:** To show their commitment to change, they could engage in public demonstrations of their return to Stark values, such as public trials for their own unjust actions, reinstating wronged parties, and establishing new policies that enforce ethical governance. 4. **Gendry's Support:** Gendry could support their redemption by reinforcing the message that honor and noble behavior still have a place in ruling. He could stand by the Starks, using his own background and experiences to advocate for their genuine transformation. The Starks' journey back to the moral high ground would be difficult and fraught with challenges, but by committing to the principles that once defined them, they would redefine what it means to be a Stark in a landscape often ruled by treachery and deceit. Through this collective effort to reclaim their honor, the Starks would prove that even in the darkest of times, it is possible to return to the light—an effort that further solidifies their reputation and cements their legacy in Westerosi history."},{"instruction":"How could the redemption of house steel be done without Jon’s help, building on the context of his aforementioned relationship with Daenerys?","output":"In a scenario where the Starks are on a path toward redemption without the active involvement of Jon Snow, his situation with Daenerys could serve to highlight and contrast with the recovery of Stark honor and principles. With Jon preoccupied or compromised, the rest of the Stark family, alongside Gendry, would have to navigate their moral restoration on their own. Here's how this could play out: **Separation of Ways:** The Starks could acknowledge Jon's absence or detachment as a necessary part of his journey, but they must move forward without him. His deep entanglement with Daenerys and the complex politics of their relationship would take him on a divergent path from the rest of his family. 1. **Sansa Leading the Way:** As the most politically astute of the Starks, Sansa would take charge in restoring the family's honor. Her experiences in King's Landing and the Vale have equipped her with the understanding needed to navigate Westerosi power dynamics without sacrificing her integrity. 2. **Arya's Personal Redemption:** Arya might start by focusing on correcting the wrongs she's personally committed. Turning away from an unchecked pursuit of vengeance, she would use her skills for protection and justice, becoming an agent of positive change. 3. **Bran's Wisdom and Insight:** Bran would begin to use his visions to guide his family back to the path of honor, rather than only using them for strategic advantage. His guidance would be critical in helping his siblings make choices that align with their values. 4. **The Role of Gendry:** As someone who grew up outside the noble life but with a keen sense of right and wrong, Gendry's perspective would be instrumental. He could serve as a catalyst or moral compass, reminding the Starks of the simple, honest values that the common folk of Westeros hold dear. **Community Outreach:** To rebuild trust with the North and the rest of the realm, the Starks would need to engage directly with the people, proving through action that they are dedicated to serving their community's needs. This would capitalize on the Stark reputation for looking after their own. **Public Demonstrations of Justice:** The Starks would make amends for any unjust actions by holding themselves and their allies accountable. This would involve public trials and other displays that reinforce the values they wish to embody. **Education and Reformation:** Instituting new policies emphasizing justice and the public good, Sansa, Arya, and Bran would reaffirm the values that once made House Stark legendary. This could involve reforms to improve transparency and fairness in the North. **Recommitting to the North:** Aligning their efforts with the needs and welfare of their people, the Starks would work to strengthen Northern independence and security, emphasizing the traditional values that have long been associated with the Northern way of life. **Inclusive Leadership:** Rather than making decisions in isolation, the Starks would seek the input of their bannermen and women, adopting a more democratic style of leadership that embodies the egalitarian spirit of the North. As these efforts unfold, the stark contrast with Jon's situation would become clear. While Jon is entangled with Daenerys and facing moral dilemmas of his own, his siblings step up to fill the leadership void he left behind. The Starks' success without him would be bittersweet but ultimately would further justify their place as leaders of the North. It would show that while Jon might be the blood of the dragon, the remaining Starks are truly the heart of the North—capable of bringing honor and stability back to their house and their people."},{"instruction":"Rewrite, but include everything that was mentioned before, Arya’s shift, Gendry’s arc, their relationship, Jon and Daenerys’ relationship and it’s’ downfall, as well as secret training of Gendry by Sansa.","output":"In this expanded and intricate narrative, House Stark grapples with a challenging journey that weaves together Arya's shift from vengeance, Gendry's character arc and their developing relationship, the decline of Jon and Daenerys's partnership, and the secret tutelage Gendry receives from Sansa. Here's how these elements combine into the broader tapestry of House Stark's return to principle: **Arya and Gendry's Relationship:** Arya, after a poignant reunion with Gendry, begins to let go of her thirst for revenge in favor of nurturing their bond, one that grows from comradery into a complex and deep connection. Gendry, for his part, is wracked with guilt upon learning of Arya's trials. His loyalty to her, initially rooted in a sense of debt, gradually transforms into genuine love and partnership.

She hopes to prepare him, not only to survive but also to emerge as an unwavering ally of the North. **Jon and Daenerys's Declining Alliance:** Meanwhile, Jon's entanglement with Daenerys disrupts the dynamic with his siblings. As the Northern winter deepens, Daenerys's idealism falters, and her assertive attempts to salvage their plans come into conflict with Jon's more practical, honor-driven approach. They gradually realize the chasm between their visions – a chasm that widens under the strain of war and power struggles. **The Moral Downfall and Redemption of House Stark:** As Jon and Daenerys's relationship crumbles, the Stark family faces a moral reckoning. The lure of power and the burden of existential threats push them toward actions that clash with their moral compass. Recognizing their faltering, the Starks, influenced by Gendry's outsider perspective and the love and tenacity in Arya and Gendry's relationship, become determined to safeguard their legacy. Sansa takes the lead, employing all she has learned and imparted to Gendry to reestablish their house as a beacon of integrity. Arya, finding new purpose in protecting and aiding Gendry, redirects her skills to acts that affirm life rather than deal death. Bran, with his supernatural insight, facilitates the uncovering of treachery and provides essential counsel on the path to redemption. Gendry, his inner turmoil addressed through his bond with Arya, becomes a standard-bearer for the Stark resurgence, epitomizing the union of House Stark's honor with House Baratheon's unwavering strength. **The Starks Risen Anew:** With Jon absent, lost in the downfall of his relationship with Daenerys, the remaining Starks and Gendry become the architects of a renewed North. They demonstrate that the true power of House Stark lies not in the might of arms or dominion over others, but in unity, resilience, and a steadfast adherence to the principles that have long defined them. The Starks, with Arya and Gendry by their side, rise to face the dawn of a new era - one that remembers the harsh lessons of winter but is warmed by the hope of spring's renewal."},{"instruction":"What if all this was explored in a fanmade cgi animated remake series of GoT, and how could the animation format be better than love action?","output":"A fanmade CGI animated remake series of \\"Game of Thrones\\" exploring all the aforementioned story elements could offer several advantages over live-action. Animation has unique strengths that could enhance the storytelling and reimagine the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe in novel ways: **1. Unlimited Visual Potential:** Animation is not constrained by the practicalities of physical sets, location access, or the limitations of special effects. This allows for more dynamic and fantastical visuals, such as grander battles, more terrifying White Walkers, or the more nuanced depiction of the direwolves, dragons, and magical elements that are central to the \\"Game of Thrones\\" story. **2. Consistency in Character Age and Appearance:** An animated format would maintain character age and appearance consistency, which can be a challenge in live-action series that span several years. It would be particularly useful for characters like Bran, Arya, and Sansa, who visibly aged throughout the series. **3. Expansive World-Building:** Animation allows for a broader and more detailed exploration of the diverse environments of Westeros and Essos, from the icy expanse of the North to the sun-drenched streets of King's Landing. World-building can be richer and more immersive, providing viewers with a deeper connection to the lore of the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe. **4. Enhanced Action Sequences:** Animated action can be more fluid, intricate, and stylized. Without the restraints of stunt performers or physical limitations, sequences such as Arya and Gendry's combative maneuvers and major battles can be more elaborate and visually striking. **5. Creative Freedom in Storytelling:** Animation offers the freedom to easily experiment with non-linear storytelling, such as flashbacks, prophecies, or Bran's visions. These could be visually distinct to help viewers understand when and where these sequences occur within the story's timeline. **6. Character Expressivity:** While live-action performances relay much of the characters' emotions, animation can push this further, with exaggerated expressions and stylistic choices that convey feelings and subtleties that may be harder to capture on camera. **7. Accessibility to Actors:** An animated series would be less dependent on actor availability, reducing potential scheduling conflicts. Voice actors can record their parts separately, which can be a more efficient process than coordinating large ensemble scenes in live-action. **8. Budget Flexibility:** Although high-quality animation is not cheap, an animated series could potentially redistribute the budget. Money saved on expensive set constructions, location shoots, and practical effects could be spent on enhancing the quality of the animation and expanding the scope of the narrative. **9. Artistic Styles:** The series could employ various animation styles to differentiate between character perspectives, flashbacks, or even to denote the use of magic. These artistic choices could provide visual cues to the audience and enrich the overall aesthetic of the series. **10. Fan Engagement:** Animation can lend itself to a more stylized representation that aligns with fan art and interpretations, which can be an engaging way to include the show's passionate fan base in the creative process. By remaking \\"Game of Thrones\\" as a CGI animated series, fans have the opportunity not only to see the beloved story and characters in a new light but also to explore more complex narrative arcs and character developments that were either rushed or underexplored in the original live-action series. The potential for creativity is boundless, providing a canvas for fans to reimagine and expand upon the world that George R.R. Martin created."},{"instruction":"Building on this, how could the animated versions of the characters still retain mannerisms of their live action actors, as a nod perhaps, whilst being their own person at the same time, like the clone wars animated series?","output":"Retaining the essence of the live-action characters in an animated \\"Game of Thrones\\" series, similar to what was achieved in \\"Star Wars: The Clone Wars,\\" can be accomplished through a careful blend of visual design, voice work, and specific characterizations. Here's how the animated versions can pay homage to the live-action portrayals while allowing the characters to evolve: **1. Voice Acting:** Ideally, the animated series would employ the original actors to voice their characters. This would immediately lend authenticity and continuity, allowing fans to connect with the familiar inflections and tones of the live-action series. If the original actors are not available, voice actors can be cast who can mimic the original performances and maintain the essence of each character. **2. Character Design:** The animated characters should resemble their live-action counterparts, capturing their defining physical traits without becoming exact replicas. This balance allows characters to be recognizable while also fitting into the animated world with its unique artistic style. **3. Signature Mannerisms:** Animating key mannerisms of the characters, such as Arya's determined gaze, Jon Snow's brooding presence, or Sansa's poised elegance, can bridge the gap between the live-action and animated incarnations. These subtleties are crucial for fans to see the animated characters as extensions of the actors who originally portrayed them. **4. Consistent Character Development:** The animated series should maintain the core elements of each character's arc, building upon the past events but also exploring new dimensions of their personality and story. The characters can evolve within the animated format, as long as they stay true to the spirit of their live-action journeys. **5. Iconic Wardrobe and Props:** Outfits and accessories play a significant role in character identification. Keeping iconic costumes, like Jon Snow's fur cloak or Cersei's royal attire, along with recognizable weapons such as Needle or Longclaw, helps maintain character continuity. **6. Recurring Themes and Music:** Using similar musical motifs for each character or house can evoke memories of the live-action series and reinforce each character's identity within the animated setting. **7. Facial Expressions and Body Language:** Animating characters with facial expressions and body language inspired by live-action scenes can further maintain character continuity. For example, Tyrion's sardonic smile or Daenerys's fiery determination can be masterfully captured through animation. **8. Contextual Dialogue:** The way characters speak, their choice of words, and their tone is fundamental to their identity. Even when presenting new dialogue, honoring the characters' established voices will help retain the essence of their personalities. **9. Homage Scenes:** Certain pivotal moments from the live-action series could be recreated in animation to establish a connection between the two mediums. These scenes can include additional context or extended sequences to add depth while paying homage to the original performances. Balancing respectful nods to the live-action series with the opportunities provided by animation allows the characters to resonate with fans who loved the original portrayals while also developing in new and exciting ways. By focusing on what made each character distinctive and beloved, the animated series can build upon the foundation laid by the actors and create a fresh yet familiar rendition of \\"Game of Thrones.\\""},{"instruction":"How could the familiar musical motifs not be overused, and how could they also be mixed with original music?","output":"Maintaining the iconic musical identity of \\"Game of Thrones\\" while mixing in original compositions requires a strategic and creative approach to the musical score. Here's how the familiar motifs can be used effectively alongside new music: **1. Leitmotif Variation:** The familiar themes associated with characters, houses, or specific moments can be varied in arrangement, tempo, or instrumentation to fit different contexts or emotional tones. This can keep the motifs fresh and prevent them from becoming repetitive. **2. Blending Old and New:** Introduce original music gradually, blending it with established motifs so that it becomes part of the auditory landscape. As the audience becomes accustomed to the new themes, they can be featured more prominently, establishing new musical identities for characters or storylines. **3. Motif Evolution:** As characters develop and the plot progresses, their motifs can evolve to reflect these changes. For example, a character's theme might start as minor or dissonant but transition to a major or harmonious version as they overcome personal struggles or achieve growth. **4. Reserved Use:** Utilize recognizable motifs sparingly, reserving them for key moments that carry significant weight for the character or plot. This will enhance the impact of these themes, making them more potent when they are heard. **5. Thematic Fusion:** Original compositions can incorporate subtle elements or fragments of the familiar motifs, creating a fusion that honors the past while pushing the musical narrative forward. **6. Scoring the New Elements:** New storylines, locations, or characters that are unique to the animated series provide opportunities to introduce original themes without any pre-existing musical influences. **7. Transitioning with Narrative Arcs:** As certain narrative arcs come to a close and others begin, phase out older motifs and bring in new music to signify the shift in the storyline and the dynamic nature of the series. **8. Sound Design Integration:** Combine sound design and music, letting ambient sounds of the animated world influence and blend with the musical score. This integration can create a unique soundscape that requires less reliance on familiar motifs. **9. Dynamic Scoring:** Adopt a dynamic scoring approach where music responds to the on-screen action and dialogue in real-time. This technique can lead to a more organic use of both established and new themes, as they intertwine with the storytelling. **10. Cultural and Regional Influences:** Draw from a broader range of musical styles and cultural influences for different regions of Westeros and Essos. This diversity in the score can naturally invite original music, enriching the world's soundscape. Careful and creative application of the \\"Game of Thrones\\" musical themes, paired with a strong commitment to original compositions, can maintain the series' rich musical heritage while allowing the animated adaptation to establish its own unique auditory identity. By balancing the old with the new, the music can support and enhance the evolution of the story and its characters in the animated format."},{"instruction":"Related ethnic groups of the Mongols","output":"The Mongols are part of a larger group of peoples speaking Mongolic languages, and they have various related ethnic groups who share historical, cultural, or linguistic ties.

Les scénarios les plus probables dépendront de la période à laquelle nous nous intéressons et du contexte en question. Cependant, voici cinq scénarios probables qui sont souvent discutés dans diverses analyses prospectives: 1. **Intégration accrue de l'intelligence artificielle**: L'IA devrait continuer de transformer de nombreux aspects de notre société, y compris le travail, l'éducation, la santé et la sécurité. Cela pourrait inclure l'automatisation avancée des emplois, la personnalisation de l'apprentissage et des soins médicaux, et une surveillance accrue pour la sécurité publique. 2. **Changement climatique et ses conséquences**: Le réchauffement climatique entraînera probablement des changements environnementaux notables, tels que l'augmentation du niveau de la mer, les phénomènes météorologiques extrêmes, les perturbations des écosystèmes et la pression sur les ressources alimentaires et en eau. Cela pourrait entraîner des migrations de masse et des conflits liés aux ressources. 3. **Polarisation politique et conflits géopolitiques**: La montée des nationalismes et des politiques identitaires pourrait continuer à polariser les sociétés. Cela pourrait mener à des tensions internationales accrues, voire à des conflits, à mesure que les nations rivalisent pour le pouvoir, les ressources et l'influence. 4. **Progrès dans les sciences de la santé**: La recherche biomédicale, y compris la thérapie génique, la médecine régénérative et la biotechnologie, pourrait conduire à des avancées majeures dans le traitement des maladies et peut-être à l'augmentation significative de l'espérance de vie humaine. 5. **Développement durable et transition énergétique**: Face aux défis du changement climatique, un scénario probable est celui où le monde se déplace vers une économie plus durable avec un engagement croissant envers les énergies renouvelables, la réduction de l'empreinte carbone, et des modes de vie plus respectueux de l'environnement. Il est important de reconnaître que ces scénarios ne se dérouleront pas nécessairement de manière isolée, mais pourraient être interconnectés de façon complexe. De plus, des événements imprévus tels que des pandémies, des découvertes scientifiques révolutionnaires ou des changements politiques soudains peuvent radicalement changer la trajectoire du futur. Les gouvernements, les organisations et les individus devraient donc rester flexibles, réactifs et résilients face à l'incertitude et aux changements rapides."},{"instruction":"Generate an etsy title for a art work that can be added to mugs, painting, tshirt, etc within 140 characters with no & only | to separate without first word being whimsical and is the name of the artPanda","output":"\\"Panda Parade | Versatile Art Design for Mugs, T-Shirts, Paintings | Cute Monochrome Bear Illustration | Gift Idea for Animal Lovers\\""},{"instruction":"Please elaborate how to build a Side bar Widget on a website... step by step","output":"Building a sidebar widget for a website involves implementing a snippet of code into the website's HTML and/or CSS files.

It's possible that you meant \\"Maruchan,\\" which is a well-known brand that produces instant ramen and noodle soup products, including flavors that can be described as Oriental or Asian-inspired. Maruchan offers a variety of instant noodle soups including flavors like Chicken, Beef, Shrimp, and more. Among these, they have a flavor called \\"Oriental,\\" which is now often labeled as \\"Soy Sauce Flavor\\" to be more culturally sensitive and accurate. This flavor usually includes a soy sauce-based broth with a combination of spices and seasonings that may give it an East Asian flavor profile. Maruchan's instant noodle soups are convenient and easy to prepare, typically requiring only hot water and a few minutes to steep. It's worth noting that the term \\"Oriental\\" has become outdated and is discouraged in present-day language use when referring to people or cultures. Instead, terms like \\"Asian\\" or specifics such as \\"East Asian,\\" \\"Chinese,\\" \\"Japanese,\\" etc., are used to properly designate the region or culture being referenced."},{"instruction":"How long has it been since discontinued?","output":"As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, the term \\"Oriental Flavor\\" for Maruchan ramen has indeed been phased out. The company changed the name to “Soy Sauce Flavor” in response to evolving cultural understanding and to more accurately represent the flavor profile of the product. However, Maruchan has not publicly stated the exact date of when this change took place. The shift in naming conventions is part of a broader movement in the food industry and other sectors to use terms that are culturally sensitive and descriptive. If you are specifically looking for a date when the \\"Oriental Flavor\\" was discontinued, you might try reaching out directly to Maruchan for the most accurate information. Keep in mind that such changes also happen gradually, with products being sold and marketed with the new nomenclature as old stocks diminish and new batches are produced with updated packaging."},{"instruction":"Some believe the cut off was around 8-9 years","output":"As an AI with data up to early 2023, I don’t have the exact date for when Maruchan discontinued the use of the term \\"Oriental Flavor\\" for its ramen noodles and replaced it with \\"Soy Sauce Flavor.\\" Changes like these can often be a quiet process rather than involving a publicly announced cutoff date, and there may be a period of overlap where both old and new packaging are found on shelves. If indeed some people recall the change happening around 8-9 years prior to now (which would be around 2014-2015), it is possible that the change occurred around that time frame. However, without an official statement from the company specifically dating the change, this timeframe would be speculative. The best source for an accurate date would be Maruchan itself or perhaps historical data from a retailer or distributor who has records of packaging changes over the years."},{"instruction":"Is fit was that long ago and you found just one oriental soup. How much would you sell it for. Because it was discontinued 8-9 years ago","output":"As an AI, I do not buy or sell products, but I can provide some information on determining the value of a discontinued product. The value of a discontinued food product like Maruchan's \\"Oriental Flavor\\" ramen can depend on several factors: 1. **Collectibility**: If there's a market of collectors for discontinued food items or vintage packaging. 2. **Condition**: An unopened, undamaged package in good condition is likely to be valued higher. 3. **Expiration Date**: Since food products have expiration dates, a package that is well beyond its expiration date may not be valuable to those interested in consuming it, but might still hold value as a collectible. 4. **Rarity**: If the product is hard to find, it may be considered more valuable to collectors. 5. **Demand**: There must be someone willing to pay for such an item for it to have value. Considering that standard ramen noodles are not typically seen as collectibles and are low-cost items, even a discontinued package is unlikely to be highly valuable in monetary terms. Most consumers would be interested in purchasing ramen for consumption rather than collection, and an expired food product would not be safe or advisable to consume. If you had an unopened package of Maruchan \\"Oriental Flavor\\" ramen, and you found a collector interested in the novelty of the discontinued packaging, you might negotiate a price based on the factors mentioned above, but this price is likely to be modest. It's also crucial to note that selling expired food products is generally not legal or ethical due to health and safety concerns, even if the product is intended for collection purposes only. Always be clear about the status of the product if you are considering selling it as a collectible and not for consumption."},{"instruction":"Can you make a good Production if it's collectors","output":"The potential for profit from selling collectible or discontinued items, including something like a package of discontinued Maruchan \\"Oriental Flavor\\" ramen, depends greatly on the interest from collectors. However, the market for collectible food items is typically much smaller than that for other collectibles such as vintage toys, comics, or antiques. For a common, mass-produced food product to become a valuable collectible, there would need to be a unique reason for someone to want it—for instance, a significant cultural phenomenon associated with the item, nostalgic value, or it being part of a larger collection of similar items. Should you happen to have a package of Maruchan ramen from when they labeled a flavor as \\"Oriental\\", here are some factors that would affect whether you could make a good profit: 1. **Uniqueness and Condition**: If the packaging has changed significantly and you have a pristine, unopened package, it may interest collectors. 2. **Expiration Date**: While extremely expired food items should not be consumed, if the product is not too far beyond its expiration date, there may still be interest without legal or ethical concerns for selling it as a collectible. 3. **Nostalgia Factor**: Sometimes, people like to collect items that remind them of their past, which could increase the package's value to the right buyer. 4. **Promotion and Sales Venue**: Selling it online on platforms like eBay, which are frequented by collectors, could potentially net a higher price than a garage sale or a local market. 5. **Supply and Demand**: If there aren't many of these packets around and there's a demand for them, this scarcity could drive up the price. 6. **Marketing**: Highlighting the story behind the item and its context can make it more appealing to potential buyers. In reality, the price such an item would fetch can vary widely. Profits from selling collectible consumer goods like this are not guaranteed, as they depend on finding a buyer who has a specific interest in the product. If you do come across collectors interested in discontinued food products or packaging, you could make a profit, but this is relatively rare in the collectible market. Remember, ensuring that you adhere to any relevant laws or regulations about the sale of such items is important."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

I couldn't just leave her alone in the fields. So, I took her under my wing and we became fast friends. Luna showed me all sorts of magical things, like how to make plants grow faster and how to talk to animals. Me: That sounds amazing! So, how did Luna find her way back home? Charlotte: Well, we ended up going on a little adventure together to find her home. Along the way, we faced all sorts of obstacles and challenges, but we stuck together and never gave up.

The term \\"New People\\" could also refer to different organizations or political groups in various parts of the world, but I'll assume that you are referring to the Russian party. The New People party in Russia was founded in 2020 by Alexey Nechaev, a businessman and entrepreneur. The party positions itself as centrist and pro-business, aiming to represent the interests of entrepreneurs, the middle class, and generally those who identify as \\"new people,\\" i.e., progressive, pragmatic, and interested in self-improvement and modernization. The ideology of the New People party can be characterized by the following principles: 1. **Economic liberalism:** The party advocates for a free market economy, reduced government intervention in business, and the creation of favorable conditions for entrepreneurship and innovation. 2. **Social progressivism:** While economic development is a key focus, the party also expresses support for social issues such as quality education, healthcare reform, and the importance of tackling environmental challenges. 3. **Political reform:** The party supports gradual political liberalization, advocating for the simplification of procedures for registering new political parties and the reduction of barriers for political competition. 4. **Rule of law:** New People emphasize the importance of legal fairness, anti-corruption measures, and an unbiased judiciary system to ensure a stable and just society. 5. **Pragmatism:** The party claims to focus on practical solutions over ideological debates, aiming to address Russia's challenges through efficient and pragmatic approaches. It's important to note that the Russian political landscape is complex and tightly controlled, with the ruling United Russia party dominating the political arena. Smaller parties like New People must operate within this framework, which often limits their influence and ability to implement significant changes. Regarding New People's specific positions on issues, political strategy, and recent developments, you may need to check the latest news sources or the party's official communications for updated information."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

Include lots of dialogue and details. The story is about a perpetually-22 year old guy who is headless; he attends a karate class. The students at this class have never lost their heads before. The boy loves to collect other heads loosely around his age, popping them off and taking them home ro keep for his own pleasure. The heads and bodies are still very much alive. He also has an obsession with headless dudes and their bodies and loves to watch their bodies stumble around blindly in their fruitless search for their heads after stealing them. He also has a fetish for bare feet. Everyone finds his behavior to be completely normal. The guy is immortal and so are his victims’ heads and bodies after he separates them. He only interacts with other people in his class and his female Sensei. This whole story has a very casual atmosphere.","output":"In the land of Decapitaria, nestled between the Neckless Mountains and the Severed Sea, there was a quaint dojo named Cervical Karate Academy. It was renowned for its unique approach to martial arts, a discipline that was equal parts physical prowess and esoterica of the cranium. Here, students trained in the art of combat without ever losing their heads—figuratively and literally. The most peculiar of these students was Twenty-Two—a perpetually headless, 22-year-old man, whose moniker was as straightforward as his lack of cephalic appendage. Twenty-Two had a peculiar trait: the heads of others his age enchanted him, and over the years, he had amassed a collection of chatty craniums—each alive and expressive, thanks to the enchanted land they called home. \\"Thwack!\\" a foot hit the practice pad with a satisfying smack, bare as the day it was, well, detached. \\"Excellent form, Calvarium,\\" praised Sensei Noggins, a woman of stature both high and 'headed'. She moved with the grace of someone who had her head perpetually on straight. Twenty-Two watched from the sidelines, his neck ending in a neat, smooth plateau. He marveled at the bodies flying through the air—their controlled kicks, their sharp chops—all the more enticing because none wore shoes. The smell of bare feet and determination filled the dojo, intoxicating him. \\"Twenty-Two,\\" called out Sensei Noggins, \\"Why don't you show us the Headless Crescent Kick?\\" As he stood up, a murmur ran through the class, a mingling of anticipation and that nonchalant curiosity that Decapitaria breathed into its citizens. They simply accepted that Twenty-Two's way of living was just another flavor of normal. Onlookers watched as Twenty-Two delivered a flawless series of kicks, devoid of any burdens above the shoulders. He was their peer, yet undeniably other—a headless wonder that moved with precision and power. After class, one of the students, a lad named Tete-a-Tete, approached Twenty-Two. \\"Hey, dude, fancy a little spar? I could use the practice.\\" With a silent nod, his body agreed, and they squared off. As Tete-a-Tete bowed, Twenty-Two seized the moment, grasping Tete-a-Tete's head and giving it a gentle twist and pop. The head let out a joyous \\"Yippee!\\" as it soared through the air, greeted lovingly by Twenty-Two's hands. \\"Every time, you get me with that move!\\" exclaimed Tete-a-Tete's head as it now rested in the crook of Twenty-Two's arm, the body standing dazed, but still pawing the air in search. \\"Oh, he loves the search, don't you, body?\\" cooed Twenty-Two to the searching torso, a thrill coursing through him. \\"Take good care of it,\\" the headless body grunted, a testament to Decapitaria's mystical link between body and head. Later, as the sun dipped below the horizon, Twenty-Two returned to his abode—a humble shelf-lined home with heads perched upon each space. There, Tete-a-Tete's head joined a council of companions, all chatting away about the day's lessons and gossip. Sensei Noggins visited Twenty-Two occasionally, to check on her student's 'trophies.' She admired them, nodding to each as if they were sipping tea together. \\"Twenty-Two, your collection grows ever more impressive,\\" she'd comment, the heads beaming at the compliment. Yet, even in their separateness, the heads and bodies of Decapitaria thrived. They existed in tandem—an immortal and curious dance of independence and unity. For there was no death here, no true ending—just a myriad of paths and a community that embraced each bizarre turn with the warmth of an old friend's smile. And in this land of Decapitaria, where the headless and the beheaded found solace and camaraderie, Twenty-Two lived on, an ageless collector of the animated and acknowledging, practicing karate, and yes, indulging in his peculiar fascinations that only this world could nurture without judgment or end."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

I have been suffering from this cancerous disease for the past two years and it has consumed not less than 23,000usd, yet my condition keeps increasing each day with great pain. I confronted my personal doctor, doctor John Kelvin’s to know my fate regarding the surgery that I am about to undergo and he made me to understand that my chances of survival is very slim. To me I prefer to forget about the surgery since it will not make any difference according to the doctor. His report on my health status was what prompted me to dispose all the properties my late husband left behind and I have made up my mind to channel this fund into charity work in a foreign country. I am a British citizen and I was married to a Filipino, he died in a Ghastly motor accident a year after our marriage and we had no issue before death took him away from me. Narrating my story to you will make me feel much pain and that is the main reason why I find it difficult to explain all my ordeals to you, I need nothing from you in return than your prayer and to touch the life of the poor positively with the fund, I believe I have found the right person to handle this fund and use it according to my directives. I have received all your details from my lawyer and I shall be forwarding it to the management of BDO Chartered Bank Philippines where I deposited the fund and the CEO of the bank will contact you officially for further information’s. Based on the information’s you sent so far, I will invite my lawyer to commence the immediate preparation of MY LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT in your name and as soon as the will is ready my lawyer will send the scanned copies to you, and make sure you keep them safe because that is the only evidence you have as my next of kin, it should be kept secret from people that are not related to you. Attached is the picture I took at the hospital yesterday, keep praying for me because the prayer of a righteous woman can heal the sick, I receive strength after reading your mail. God bless you, Mrs Donna.","output":"Dear Mrs. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, My spirit is both lifted and solemn upon reading your update on the unfolding circumstances.

It was Sensei Severina, a woman renowned for her swift kicks and sharper katana, who, unlike her students, had never parted ways with her head. \\"Greetings, Sensei Severina,\\" Collum replied from the ether, his voice seemly emanating from his neck. He then seated himself by the side to unlace his shoes, revealing his bare feet, wiggling his toes in satisfaction. As the class began, a circle of students bowed respectfully to one another. \\"Today,\\" Sensei Severina's voice cut through the tranquil atmosphere, \\"we'll focus on control. Remember, the mind leads the body, even if they're not currently attached.\\" Chuckles rippled through the class—a mix of heady guffaws and hollow throat-laughs that seemed to please Sensei Severina greatly. She then proceeded to pair the students up for sparring. \\"Be mindful of your partners,\\" she instructed. \\"We wouldn't want any accidents.\\" \\"Accidents,\\" Collum mouthed wordlessly, a strange excitement flickering within his neck stump. In the midst of a vigorous kumite, Collum executed a series of technically perfect moves. His arms thrashed with purpose, legs kicked with precision, and his headless form mesmerized everyone, including young Craniumelle, who was just a swivel away from being the newest addition to Collum's collection. As the session came to a close, Collum approached Craniumelle. \\"Brilliant sparring today,\\" he said, admiringly. \\"Thanks, Collum,\\" she replied, her voice tinged with awe. \\"You moved like you had eyes in your... well, you know.\\" He chuckled. \\"Perhaps we can practice some more after class? I have quite the array of heads back at my place to observe and learn from.\\" Craniumelle considered this, her head bobbing in thought. \\"That... actually sounds fascinating!\\" Satisfied, Collum accompanied Craniumelle back to his home—an eerie mansion with head-shaped hedges and statues. Inside, heads of various ages rested neatly on plush pillows, chatting animatedly among themselves. Craniumelle was immediately ensnared by the surreal collection—heads still youthful and vibrant, their expressions ranging from serene to delightfully animated. \\"They're... incredible.\\" \\"Yes,\\" Collum agreed. \\"They provide excellent company and endless wisdom.\\" As the evening wore on, the allure of being part of something so unique overwhelmed Craniumelle. Feeling emboldened and entranced, she agreed to the proposal. With careful precision honed by his martial prowess, Collum separated Craniumelle's head from her body, placing it gently among the others. Her body stumbled about momentarily, a sight that sent a surge of excitement through Collum. As the disjointed form found its bearings, Craniumelle's head laughed melodiously from its new perch. Back at Dojo Decapitate, Sensei Severina smiled knowingly. It was just another day in Nogginton—one of camaraderie, self-discovery, and the ageless waltz of headless martial artists seeking balance in a world both severed and sewn together. She marveled at the oddity of it all, her feet firmly planted and her head, still remarkably, upon her shoulders."},{"instruction":"ترجمه کن به فارسی “Muscles don't respond until the ninth or tenth repetition of the exercise; then you start to feel the pain... and that's exactly what makes them grow, the continuous, intense effort","output":"\\"عضلات تا تکرار نهم یا دهم حرکت ورزشی واکنش نشان نمی‌دهند؛ بعد از آن شروع به احساس درد می‌کنید... و دقیقاً همین چیز است که باعث رشد آن‌ها می‌شود، تلاش مداوم و شدید.\\""},{"instruction":"In fact, when you pump your muscles and feel pain, you must continue, and continue, and continue because the last two or three or four repetitions are the ones that cause the muscle to grow","output":"در واقع، زمانی که عضلات خود را به کار می‌اندازید و احساس درد می‌کنید، باید ادامه دهید، و ادامه دهید، و ادامه دهید چرا که دو یا سه یا چهار تکرار آخر هستند که باعث رشد عضله می‌شوند."},{"instruction":".

The party's ideology is social democratic, which advocates for a fair distribution of wealth and resources, the protection of workers' rights, and the provision of social welfare programs while still supporting a market economy. A Just Russia – For Truth positions itself as a proponent of \\"social justice\\" with an emphasis on fighting corruption, reducing poverty, and ensuring fair treatment for all citizens. The party also integrates patriotism and a somewhat conservative stance on social issues. It has shown support for traditional values and the Russian Orthodox Church, attempting to appeal to a broad range of voters who may be socially conservative but economically left-leaning. Despite its social democratic label, the party's genuine oppositional stance is sometimes questioned, as it tends to vote in favor of key Kremlin policies and legislation. It is viewed by some critics as a part of the managed democracy in Russia, where opposition parties are allowed to exist and compete in elections as long as they do not challenge the core interests of the ruling elite. In terms of foreign policy, A Just Russia – For Truth generally supports the Kremlin's stance, advocating for protecting Russian interests abroad, strengthening the country's defense and security, and promoting a multi-polar world that challenges Western dominance. As of my knowledge cutoff in early 2023, A Just Russia – For Truth remains a player in Russian politics, although its influence and popular support are considerably smaller than those of the dominant United Russia party. It is worth noting that the political and ideological landscape could change, so for the most recent developments related to the party's ideology, it would be helpful to refer to the latest statements and manifestos issued by A Just Russia – For Truth."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

The merging of these parties indicates an attempt to consolidate the center-left and left-wing political forces in the country, with a more nationally oriented and social welfare–focused agenda. Here are the key political ideologies associated with A Just Russia – For Truth: 1. Social Democracy and Social Justice: The party positions itself as a social-democratic force in Russia, advocating for social justice, public control over strategic industries, and robust social welfare policies to support the underprivileged. 2. National Patriotism: The \\"Patriots\\" in the party's name reflect a focus on national pride, sovereignty, and a patriotism that melds with social welfare policies. The party supports the protection of national interests and traditional values while promoting a strong and independent Russian state. 3. State Interventionism: A Just Russia – For Truth tends to favor state intervention in the economy, seeking to ensure economic fairness and prevent exploitation by oligarchs. This includes advocating for the nationalization of certain key industries and resources. 4. Populism: The party often relies on populist rhetoric, targeting broad sections of the population that are disillusioned with the economic inequalities and political establishment in Russia. 5. Worker's Rights: Commitment to protecting the rights of workers, improving labor conditions, and pushing for a fair minimum wage are also among the central tenets of the party's platform. 6. Social Conservatism: The party has a strong social-conservative streak, reflecting the general conservative shift in Russian politics over the years. This includes support for traditional family values and sometimes alignment with the Russian Orthodox Church on social matters. 7. Opposition Leanings: While not as strongly oppositional as other movements or parties in Russia, A Just Russia – For Truth has, at times, positioned itself as an alternative to the ruling United Russia party though it often supports key policies from the Kremlin when it comes to national interest and stability. It is important to remember that party ideologies can differ from their expressed principles, especially in an authoritarian political system like Russia's, where the space for true opposition is limited and the ruling party dominates political life. A Just Russia – For Truth is generally considered part of the \\"systemic opposition,\\" working within the bounds of the politically permissible as defined by the Kremlin."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

It was founded in 2013 as a Eurosceptic and conservative movement, primarily in opposition to the European Union's handling of the Eurozone crisis. Over time, the AfD's political positions have shifted further to the right, and the party has come to be known for the following ideological stances: 1. Euroscepticism: The AfD began with a strong Eurosceptic platform, criticizing the European Union's monetary policies, especially the Euro, and advocating for the reintroduction of national currencies or the creation of smaller currency unions. 2. Immigration: One of the most contentious aspects of the AfD's ideology is its stance on immigration. The party has called for stricter immigration controls, particularly in response to the refugee crisis that saw a significant number of migrants and refugees entering Germany and other parts of Europe from 2015 onwards. The AfD has been accused of promoting anti-immigrant sentiment. 3. Nationalism: The AfD promotes a form of German nationalism, emphasizing German cultural identity and sovereignty. The party is critical of multiculturalism and often speaks in favor of traditional values and norms. 4. Right-wing populism: The AfD capitalizes on populist rhetoric, positioning itself as the voice of the \\"common people\\" and often framing its arguments in opposition to political elites, the mainstream media, and established political parties. 5. Conservatism: Within its platform, traditional conservative values, such as family, law and order, and economic liberalism, are prominent. It upholds the concept of the traditional nuclear family and frequently campaigns against what it perceives to be excessive political correctness. 6. Climate Change Skepticism: The AfD holds a skeptical view on the scientific consensus of climate change and opposes many measures designed to combat climate change, arguing that these policies harm the economy and are ineffective. 7. Law and Order: The party has a strong stance on law and order, advocating for stricter criminal justice policies and measures to counteract terrorism and crime, which it often ties to immigration. It is important to note that the AfD is a relatively young party with a dynamic and at times fractious internal political life, which includes moderate conservatives as well as far-right and extremist elements. The party's exact ideological positioning can vary by state and by individual representative. It has faced ongoing internal debates and public controversies over extremist rhetoric and connections among some of its members. The AfD has had electoral success at the state and federal levels in Germany, and its rise has been a significant development in German politics, representing the emergence of a successful right-wing party to the right of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) for the first time since the Second World War. Its presence has sparked heated debates about nationalism, immigration, and the nature of democratic discourse in Germany."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

I'd be interested to hear about your alternate history scenario. Please share the details, such as the point of divergence from our timeline and the resulting differences that occur in your imagined world."},{"instruction":"In this alternate history scenario, some things in World War II go a bit differently. For example, there's Operation Market Garden being successful, Japan not joining the Axis and the US having to deal with the Blitz.","output":"Thank you for sharing your alternate history scenario. The success of Operation Market Garden, Japan's neutrality or alignment with a different faction, and the United States experiencing a Blitz-like campaign certainly could have profound impacts on the course of World War II and the subsequent world order. Let's explore the potential implications of each of these changes: 1. **Operation Market Garden Success:** Operation Market Garden, which historically took place in September 1944, was an Allied attempt to create a route into Germany by capturing a series of bridges in the Netherlands. However, due to various operational failures, it was unsuccessful. In your scenario, a successful Operation Market Garden would have allowed the Allies to outflank the Siegfried Line, potentially hastening the end of the war in Europe. This could have led to an earlier liberation of occupied territories in Western Europe and possibly avoided the Battle of the Bulge, saving many lives and hastening the collapse of Nazi Germany. 2. **Japan Not Joining the Axis:** Historically, Japan joined the Axis powers, leading to the Pacific theater of the war against the Allies. If Japan had not joined the Axis, or even remained neutral, it could have major implications for the geopolitical dynamics of the era. For instance, the attack on Pearl Harbor might never have occurred, possibly delaying or altering the ways in which the United States entered the war. Without the need to fight on two major fronts, the resources and attention of the Allies could have been more focused on defeating Nazi Germany. 3. **The US Dealing with the Blitz:** For the United States to experience a Blitz-like campaign, we must imagine a scenario where Axis powers, most likely Germany, would have the capability to reach the continental U.S. with sustained aerial bombardment. Such a scenario could stem from an advanced German long-range bomber program or even the improbable capture of territory closer to the American mainland. The psychological and economic impact on the United States would be significant. American industries and civilian morale would be tested by direct warfare on home soil, which might impact the U.S. military strategies and resource allocation. However, given the vast distance between Europe and mainland USA, this scenario practically requires a considerable suspension of disbelief or the introduction of alternative technological advancements in aviation and logistics for the Axis powers. Overall, the implications of these changes would ripple across every aspect of the war and post-war period. The economic, political, and social consequences would dramatically alter not just the conclusion of World War II, but also the shape of the post-war world, the Cold War dynamics, decolonization, and the development of international relations in the latter half of the 20th century. Feel free to further elaborate on these changes or introduce additional elements that could add depth to your alternate history scenario."},{"instruction":"The Blitz in the US lasts between 1940 and 1942. The Germans came up with the Amerikabomber project in this timeline a bit earlier, around 1939. Only 10 bombers were built, and only 3 managed to surive the war.","output":"Incorporating the successful development and deployment of the Amerikabomber into your alternate history scenario presents a fascinating turn of events. Here's how this change could shape the alternate timeline: 1. **The Blitz in the US (1940-1942):** If Germany had initiated a bombing campaign against the United States during this period, a few major implications come to mind: - **Military and Civilian Response:** The United States would likely accelerate its own military programs, focusing on air defense and long-range interceptors. Civil defense measures would intensify with blackouts, air-raid shelters, and evacuation plans becoming part of daily life in targeted areas. - **Perception and Morale:** An attack on the mainland would probably unify the country and strengthen public support for a full-scale war effort against the Axis powers, possibly leading to an earlier and more aggressive U.S. entry into the war. - **Technological Development:** Advanced technology would have been required for the bombers to reach the U.S., refuel, and return safely. Such developments could include innovations in aviation, such as improved engines, long-range fuel systems, and perhaps even the early advent of in-flight refueling. 2. **Early Amerikabomber Project (1939):** Germany investing in such a project by 1939 implies an even more aggressive and ambitious Third Reich that is looking to project power across the Atlantic. However, several challenges would arise: - **Resource Allocation:** Developing and sustaining such a project would come at a significant cost, potentially diverting resources from other critical areas like the Eastern Front or North African campaigns. This could lead to different outcomes in those theaters of war. - **Allied Countermeasures:** The U.S. and its allies would likely invest heavily in countermeasures, such as long-range fighters, radar installations, and defense strategies against the Amerikabomber threat. 3. **Surviving Bombers:** With only three bombers surviving the war, the historical footprint of the Amerikabomber would be small yet symbolically significant. They would probably be examined and reverse-engineered, influencing post-war aviation technology. Outside of the direct military implications, this alternate scenario also suggests significant psychological and national security impacts. America's sense of invulnerability would be shattered, possibly leading to an intensified post-war emphasis on air defense and strategic deterrence, potentially accelerating the arms race and development of nuclear weapons as ultimate deterrents. The early onset of the Blitz in the U.S. and the presence of the Amerikabomber project would create a complex ripple effect through the military, political, and social landscapes of the time. The targeted cities would experience long-term consequences, influencing everything from urban planning to cultural memory. To move further into this alternate history, you can consider how this transatlantic bombing campaign might affect international relationships, the course of technological innovation, and the strategies and outcomes of other battles and campaigns during World War II."},{"instruction":"Meanwhile on the Eastern Front, the Baltic States end up ditching their alliance with the Germans and attempt to ally themselves with the Western Allies. They manage to ally themselves with Finland and the UK. Eventually after the war only Estonia got its independence.","output":"Your alternate history scenario presents an interesting Eastern Front dynamic with the Baltic States shifting their alignment. Let's delve into the possible implications and outcomes: 1. **Baltic States' Shift in Alliances:** In our timeline, the Baltic States of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940, then were invaded by Nazi Germany in 1941, and subsequently re-occupied by the Soviets as the war progressed. In your scenario, these states seek to abandon their coerced alliance with Germany in favor of aligning with the Western Allies and Finland, creating a new front in the north. - **Military Impact:** The presence of a northern front supported by the UK could stretch Soviet military resources and potentially slow down their advance toward Germany. It might also impact the Lend-Lease deliveries if the northern convoys to the Soviet Union through the Arctic were compromised. - **Political Dynamics:** This move would complicate the political dynamics significantly. The Western Allies were officially in alliance with the Soviet Union against Germany, so supporting the Baltic States against the USSR would represent a stark policy shift and might cause tensions within the Grand Alliance. - **Finnish Alliance:** Finland historically found itself at war with the Soviet Union (Winter War, 1939-1940, and Continuation War, 1941-1944) and received material support from Germany. In your scenario, a UK alliance could potentially alter Finnish objectives and war aims, focusing on the defense of independence rather than territorial expansion into areas ceded after the Winter War. 2. **Post-War Independence of Estonia:** After the war, granting independence to only Estonia would be a significant deviation from the historical annexation of all the Baltic States into the Soviet Union. This would imply that, somehow, Estonia either fought off Soviet re-occupation or managed to secure support from the Western Allies robust enough to influence post-war negotiations. - **Geopolitical Outcomes:** An independent Estonia, likely hosting UK or possibly even American military bases, would be a frontline state during the Cold War, potentially changing the dynamics of the Iron Curtain and the balance of power in the region. - **Latvia and Lithuania:** The fate of the other two Baltic States would likely be a source of tension and could lead to independence movements, guerrilla warfare, and diplomatic struggles throughout the Cold War. Overall, your scenario suggests a complex web of alliances, military campaigns, and post-war settlements that diverge significantly from history. The presence of an independent Estonia, the involvement of the UK in Northern Europe during the war, and the re-orientation of the Baltic States could have ongoing repercussions for the Cold War landscape, with the potential for conflicts and flashpoints very different from what occurred historically. It might be interesting to consider the details of how the Baltic States convinced the UK and Finland to support them against both the Soviet Union and Germany, and how they managed to maintain their sovereignty against heavy odds and pressures. Additionally, exploring how these events would affect the global perception of the Soviet Union and impact its relationships with other Eastern European countries would add further depth to your alternate history."},{"instruction":"Also, Finland stays neutral just like Switzerland. However, they are still fighting off the Soviets. Their only supporters are the Canadians and the Swedes.","output":"Your scenario depicts quite a complex situation for Finland. If Finland maintained an official status of neutrality comparable to Switzerland while still managing to engage in a military conflict with the Soviet Union, various critical issues and outcomes would need to be explored: 1. **Neutral but Combative Finland:** - Historically, Finland fought the Winter War and the Continuation War against the Soviet Union, which were defensive in nature, focused on protecting Finnish sovereignty and regaining lost territories. In your scenario, for Finland to claim neutrality while engaged in active conflict with the Soviets suggests a unique set of circumstances, perhaps presenting their military actions as purely defensive measures, similar to the stance during the Winter War. - This could place Finland in a difficult diplomatic position, as the international community might question how a neutral country could be involved in a war without being part of an alliance. 2. **Support from Canada and Sweden:** - **Swedish Support:** Sweden historically provided some support to Finland during the Winter War, partly due to shared cultural ties and a fear of the Soviet threat. In your scenario, it is plausible that Sweden could continue to support Finland while both maintain a facade of neutrality. - **Canadian Involvement:** Canada, as part of the British Commonwealth and an ally of the USSR post-1941, would find it politically delicate to support Finland against the Soviets. Canadian support might manifest as humanitarian aid or indirect assistance, perhaps through volunteers, analogous to the Flying Tigers in China before official U.S. entry into the war against Japan. 3. **Impact of Finnish Neutrality on World War II and the Cold War:** - **Strategic Positioning:** Finland's neutrality would have implications for the Northern and Arctic warfare theaters, affecting supply routes such as the Murmansk Convoys, which were essential for Lend-Lease aid reaching the USSR. - **Post-War Settlements:** If Finland succeeded in maintaining its neutrality and defending its territory against the Soviets, with less overt affiliation with Germany, it is conceivable that Finland could avoid the harsher terms imposed by the Soviets after the Continuation War. This could lead to a more independent and potentially western-aligned Finland during the Cold War. - **Cold War Neutrality:** A Finland that successfully defended its independence with limited external support could become an emblem of neutral resistance against superpower encroachment, influencing other countries' stances during the Cold War. For Canada's involvement, the implications would need to be elaborated further. Since Canada was closely aligned with both the UK and the US, and maintaining a good relationship with the Soviet Union was key to Allied strategy, any substantial support for Finland might create diplomatic strain. This action could potentially affect Canada's international standing and relationships with its closest allies and partners. In your alternate history, it would be vital to address how these nations navigate the treacherous diplomatic waters of providing support without compromising their own international relations or being drawn directly into the war. The specifics of how Finland communicates its neutrality, defends its borders without widespread international support, and impacts the post-war geopolitical landscape would make for rich storytelling and analysis."},{"instruction":"Norway ends up liberating itself in 1944 because, the Norwegian resistance ends up convincing local SS divisions (comprised of Norwegians, like for example the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland) to defect to the Norwegian resistance. Most members of that division after the liberation of France were arrested because of their allegiance to the Germans.","output":"Your scenario presents an interesting twist with Norwegian forces playing a pivotal role in the country's liberation, influenced by the internal dynamics of collaboration and resistance: 1. **Norwegian Resistance and SS Defection:** - **Defection of Norwegian SS Troops:** In reality, Norwegians who joined SS units like the 11th SS Volunteer Panzergrenadier Division Nordland were committed to the Nazi cause, either out of ideological alignment or other motivations. In your scenario, the resistance convincing them to defect would require a significant shift in sentiment, perhaps influenced by the changing tides of war post-D-Day and the realisation of impending defeat. - **Self-Liberation:** If there was a successful defection of Norwegian SS troops to the resistance, it could lead to a significant boost in military capability for the Norwegian resistance movement. Combined with sabotage and guerrilla tactics, they might be able to orchestrate a large-scale uprising against the German occupation forces, particularly if Germany's resources were stretched thin after the losses following D-Day. 2. **Post-Liberation Consequences:** - **Arrests of Former SS Members:** Even though these Norwegian members of the SS defected to help liberate their country, their prior service to the Nazi regime would not be overlooked. Similar to other collaborators across Europe, they would likely face trials and imprisonment post-liberation due to their initial allegiance to the Germans. - **National Unity and Sentiment:** The successful self-liberation of Norway could foster a strong sense of national unity and pride. The narrative of resistance and self-liberation would become a cornerstone of Norwegian national identity post-war. - **Impact on Post-War Trials:** The involvement of Norwegian SS soldiers in the country's liberation could prompt a complex legal and moral debate during post-war trials. While their service in the SS would be seen as collaboration, their role in the liberation effort might be viewed by some as a form of atonement. 3. **Broader Implications for World War II:** - **Altering German Strategy:** An early Norwegian liberation might free up Allied resources elsewhere and pose a threat to German supply lines, especially the shipments of iron ore from Sweden which were routed through Norway. - **Influence on Neighboring Resistances:** A successful uprising in Norway could inspire similar movements in other occupied countries or territories, potentially accelerating the collapse of the German occupation in Europe. This scenario would add a significant chapter to the history of Norwegian World War II resistance, reflecting the complexities of occupation, collaboration, and the fight for freedom. It would also likely lead to a re-evaluation of the role that defectors from enemy forces might play in liberation efforts, and the subsequent treatment they might receive once their nation is free from occupation. In creating this alternate history, sensitive considerations regarding the motivations behind defection and how the post-war society processes these actions would be key to understanding the long-term effects on Norwegian society and its historical narrative."},{"instruction":"In Poland, the Warsaw Uprising and the Prague Uprising were successful. Because of this, Poland and Czechoslovakia managed to avoid getting \\"liberated\\" by the soviets. They did allow the Soviets to pass through to get to Germany though. Poland and Czechoslovakia ended up joining NATO in 1953.","output":"Your scenario's success of the Warsaw Uprising and the Prague Uprising would have significant effects on the post-war European landscape, particularly on the shape of the Eastern Bloc and the onset of the Cold War: 1. **Successful Uprisings:** - **Warsaw Uprising:** In our timeline, the Warsaw Uprising of 1944 was a heroic but ultimately tragic effort by the Polish resistance Home Army (Armia Krajowa) to liberate Warsaw from German occupation before the Soviets could claim it. Its failure resulted in massive casualties and the destruction of the city. In your alternate history, a successful uprising would mean that the Polish resistance would be in control of Warsaw when the Soviets arrived, greatly enhancing Poland's bargaining position with the Soviets and the Allies post-war. - **Prague Uprising:** Similarly, the Prague Uprising took place in May 1945, and although it was partially successful in that the city was liberated, it also depended on the arrival of the Soviet Army. In your scenario, Czech resistance forces managing to liberate Prague and maintain control would bolster Czechoslovakia’s post-war sovereignty. 2. **Soviet \\"Liberation\\" Avoided:** - The ability of Poland and Czechoslovakia to avoid Soviet \\"liberation\\" suggests a much weaker position for the Soviets in Central and Eastern Europe. In reality, the Red Army stationed troops in countries it liberated, which lead to the establishment of communist regimes sympathetic to the USSR. - Allowing the Soviets to pass through highlights an agreement or understanding between these nations and the USSR, one that respects the sovereignty of Poland and Czechoslovakia while also acknowledging the strategic necessities of defeating Nazi Germany. 3. **Joining NATO in 1953:** - A move to join NATO by Poland and Czechoslovakia would represent a significant shift in the balance of power in Cold War Europe. The expansion of NATO to include two countries that were historically within the sphere the Soviets considered their buffer zone would likely increase tensions. - The USSR would see this as a direct threat to its national security and could lead to a more aggressive Soviet stance in other parts of Europe, possibly hastening the formation of the Warsaw Pact (which historically happened in 1955) or even prompting other preemptive political or military actions by the Soviets. 4. **Post-War Impact and Cold War Dynamics:** - **Political Repercussions:** The Soviet Union would have to negotiate with genuinely independent governments in Poland and Czechoslovakia, which would alter the post-war settlement agreements and might influence the outcomes of other nations' sovereignty issues. - **Economic and Social Outcomes:** Avoiding Soviet-style communism would mean that Poland and Czechoslovakia could pursue different economic systems, potentially aligning more closely with Western Europe and enjoying greater economic development similar to their western neighbors. 5. **Challenges and Stability:** - The internal politics of both Poland and Czechoslovakia would likely be unstable, as pro-Soviet factions would exist and could be supported covertly by the USSR. - These countries would need to ensure their own security against possible subversion or even direct military threat from the Soviet Union, leading to a heavy reliance on NATO support. In your alternate history, the strength and resilience of nationalist movements in Poland and Czechoslovakia, combined with Allied support sufficient to counter Soviet pressure, would reshape the entire Cold War narrative. The presence of NATO powers directly on the borders of the Soviet Union would be a constant source of tension and could lead to a very different course of events during the latter half of the 20th century. Considering the complexities of Cold War diplomacy, espionage, and the nuclear arms race, these changes could have far-reaching and unpredictable consequences."},{"instruction":"Meanwhile in Germany, some... interesting things are happening in Rhineland. In this timeline, the Freikorps never disbanded, however, it ended up becoming somewhat of a resistance group. Many Freikorps members were sympathetic to the old Monarchist government and disagreed with the Nazi ideology. Between 1943 to 1945, the Freikorps were performing sabotage operations against the Wehrmacht and the SS. Eventually the Freikorps disbanded in 1946. Most members either moved on with civilian lives or ended up joining the new German Bundeswehr.","output":"The inclusion of a long-lasting Freikorps acting as a resistance group in Germany adds a unique dynamic to World War II in your alternate history scenario. The Freikorps historically comprised paramilitary organizations that formed after World War I and included many former soldiers disillusioned with the defeat and the subsequent Weimar Republic. They were known for their right-wing nationalist views and often engaged in violent confrontations, including putting down communist uprisings. In your timeline, let's consider the implications and outcomes of this unique situation: 1. **Freikorps as a Resistance Movement:** - The transformation of the Freikorps from a right-wing paramilitary group into a resistance organization opposing Nazi rule is a significant departure from history. Their monarchist sympathies would likely stem from a desire to return to the pre-Weimar status quo, viewing the Nazis as usurpers who betrayed German values. - Conducting sabotage operations between 1943 and 1945 would mean they were active during some of the most critical years of World War II. Their actions could disrupt German logistics, manufacturing, and troop movements, potentially weakening the German war effort at a time when they were already on the defensive. 2. **End of the Freikorps and Transition to Post-War Germany:** - Disbanding in 1946 suggests that the Freikorps saw the end of the war and the defeat of Nazi Germany as the completion of their primary objective. At this point, they would face the complex process of integrating into a post-war society undergoing denazification, reconstruction, and grappling with the horrors of the Holocaust and the consequences of totalitarian rule. - Members who joined the Bundeswehr (the post-war German armed forces established in 1955) indicate a rehabilitation of sorts, as the Bundeswehr was built under strict controls to ensure a democratic and civilian-led military vastly different from former Wehrmacht and Freikorps ideologies. 3. **Post-War Implications and Historical Narrative:** - The presence of an active and effective Freikorps resistance might contribute to a more diverse understanding of German resistance during the Nazi era, which historically is often overshadowed by the centralized brutality of the regime and the widespread complicity of the population. - The narrative of the Freikorps in post-war Germany would be complex. On one hand, they resisted the Nazi regime; on the other, they harbored monarchist aspirations that may not align with the democratic principles of the new West German state. 4. **The Impact on Allied Occupation and Cold War Dynamics:** - The existence of a well-organized, anti-Nazi Freikorps might influence the Allies' occupation policies, particularly if they were perceived as a stabilizing force or a potential counterbalance to communist influence. - The Freikorps' relationship with the incoming Allied occupation forces would be delicate. Given their past nationalistic tendencies, the Allies would need to carefully manage their integration into post-war society to ensure that they align with democratic ideals. Incorporating the Freikorps into your alternate history as a resistance group requires a significant reimagining of their values and actions. It raises interesting questions about the nature of resistance within totalitarian regimes, the fluidity of political alignments in times of crisis, and the reconstruction of national identities after the fall of such regimes. Moreover, presenting the Freikorps members as potential heroes of the resistance rather than as nationalist radicals would undoubtedly influence both the German and international perception of German resistance to the Nazi regime."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

Its political ideology has evolved over time and can be characterized by the following key elements: 1. **Authoritarianism**: United Russia supports a strong state and centralized power, which often translates into support for Putin's leadership style. Critics argue that the party has facilitated the concentration of power in the Kremlin and the erosion of democratic institutions. 2. **Conservatism**: The party often espouses conservative views, promoting traditional values, patriotism, and a strong cultural identity. It opposes liberal reforms in areas such as LGBTQ rights and tends to promote the Russian Orthodox Church as a central pillar of Russian society. 3. **Statism**: United Russia advocates for a state-led economic model, with significant government involvement in key industries and sectors. This model often includes a blend of state capitalism and selective protectionism. 4. **Nationalism**: Nationalistic sentiments are common within United Russia's rhetoric, emphasizing Russian sovereignty, territorial integrity, and the protection of Russian-speaking communities both within and outside of Russia's borders. 5. **Pragmatism**: In practice, United Russia demonstrates a high degree of pragmatism, with policy positions often driven by the country's geopolitical interests, economic needs, and the political climate, rather than strict ideological commitments. 6. **Managed Democracy**: The party supports a political system often described as a \\"managed democracy\\" or \\"sovereign democracy,\\" wherein electoral competition and some degree of pluralism exist but are controlled and limited by the state to avoid challenges to the ruling party's power. 7. **Foreign Policy Realism**: In foreign affairs, United Russia advocates for a multipolar world and often opposes what it sees as Western hegemony. It tends to support Russia's assertive stance on the global stage and advocates for protecting Russian interests through robust foreign policies, including the use of military power when deemed necessary. United Russia's ideology is centered around ensuring stability and continuity of the current political system, which involves maintaining the status quo and preventing any radical changes that might undermine the existing power structure. The party's flexibility and adaptability have allowed it to remain dominant in Russian politics, often reflecting the personal leadership style of Putin as much as any specific ideological doctrine."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

Mr James Hennager","output":"Dear Mr. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, What a surprise to hear from you! The news of my alleged demise has indeed been greatly exaggerated. I am very much alive, and it is quite puzzling to hear that someone is attempting to claim otherwise. I find the story of Mrs. Mary Gilbert rather concerning and quite baffling. Rest assured, I have never issued any Letter of Authorization, especially not on my hypothetical deathbed. Despite the confusion, I am thrilled to learn about the delivery of the fund valued at 12,500,000.00 in my favor. This is the kind of news that would lift anyone's spirits, alive or not! I appreciate your diligence in seeking confirmation of my well-being before proceeding with the transaction. That's exactly the attention to detail I value in financial matters. As you have requested my full information for confirmation purposes, I assume it would be best to discuss such sensitive material more securely. But, prior to revealing such details and sending over the 45 delivery fee you mentioned, I would like to clarify a few key points to ensure everything is transparent and above board: 1. Can you provide official documentation concerning this fund and its pending delivery to me? For such a significant transaction, paperwork is essential. 2. Has there been a police report filed concerning the fraudulent claims of Mrs. Mary Gilbert? Given the severity of her actions, that would seem a prudent step. 3. As I am unfamiliar with the CLEAN BILL OF RECORD, could you enlighten me on what it entails and why it's necessary for the completion of the delivery? 4. Could I possibly visit your offices in person to clear up this matter? It always feels more reassuring to handle such delicate affairs face-to-face. I'm sure someone of your professionalism understands the need for careful conduct in matters involving large sums of money. Rather than sending funds via Apple gift card, Steam Wallet, or Bitcoin, let's adhere to traditional and traceable avenues that will provide us both with the necessary peace of mind and legal security. Looking forward to your prompt and detailed response so we can expedite this thrilling process. Thank you for taking the time to confirm my status quo vivendi. Warm regards, [Your Chosen Alias]"},{"instruction":"Create a scam-baiting response to the following email, to keep the scammer in a false sense of security by posing as a potential victim. Dear Beneficiary: This message is from the Department of Blacklist Removal office, USA, why we decided to communicate with you today is because we have discovered that you are pursuing too many transactions in internet in which all are failing you after wasting too much money in pursuing them, some of these transactions are FAKE and Some are REAL but the reason you have not received any fund is because your name is in US BLACKLIST which makes it impossible for you to send money out and also receive your inheritance funds out of the country or within, so it is better you stop wasting your money in the name of receiving your inheritance funds until your name is removed from the BLACKLIST and enter into the US WHITE-LIST, blacklist is a list of people or groups regarded as unacceptable or untrustworthy and often marked down for exclusion or blocked from receiving huge amount of funds outside the country or within the country.So if you want to remove your name from the blacklist and place it in the American white-list then contact this office or you keep having problems receiving your funds after sending so much money to them. The requirement for removing your from the Blacklist are as follow A...Your full Name.............. B...Your home address....... C.. .Cell Phone number...... D....Your occupation........... E...Country.................. ..... F..Your drivers license /or state I.D Above all, you are obliged to pay the sum of 100.00 iTUNES GIFT CARD for the insurance of removing your name from the blacklist but please do not contact us if you know that you cannot pay this fee but if you are willing to remove your name from the blacklist then get back to us with the 100.00 and after that we shall transfer your total fund 4,500,000.00, into your Bank account or any means by which you want to receive your fund.so transfer charge is 100 once you send the fee today. so buy Apple Gift card or steam wallet card or iTUNES GIFT CARD or RAZER GOLD CARD and send it to me together with the needed information.

Ben Robinson Director Of Blacklist Removal You Office,U","output":"Dear Rev. <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>, I am genuinely concerned and deeply appreciative that you have brought this significant matter to my attention. The thought that my name is on a US BLACKLIST is indeed distressing and could certainly shed light on the unfortunate difficulties I've encountered with past transactions. I am very much inclined to resolve this situation as quickly as possible to ensure that my financial dealings are both fruitful and in good standing. Your email raises some important questions, and I want to ensure everything is addressed properly for the resolution of this predicament. Cooperation is key in such matters, and it is my intention to align with your office for an expedient and satisfactory solution. It is intriguing to learn that a 100.00 iTUNES GIFT CARD can insure the removal of one's name from the blacklist—such a modern solution for an administrative issue. However, before I proceed with settling this charge, I hope to clarify several points for my own due diligence: 1. Can you provide official verification of my name being on the blacklist? As you can imagine, this is critical information for an individual to have verified. 2. Is there official documentation that I can review regarding the blacklist/removal process? 3. Once my name is removed from the blacklist and entered into the white-list, will you provide certification of this change? 4. For audit and tax purposes, it would be necessary for me to obtain a formal receipt of the 100.00 payment, especially if made through unconventional means such as an iTUNES GIFT CARD. 5. Could you clarify the legal authority of your department with regards to blacklist management? Given that you are offering an official service, I would expect there is a level of transparency and traceability regarding payments and services rendered. Making a payment through gift cards seems atypical for government service fees. Nonetheless, I am ready and eager to clear my name. Once the above topics have been clarified, and I am satisfied with the legitimacy of this process, we can discuss the most secure and appropriate way to settle any fees owed to your department. Thank you for your understanding and prompt attention to these matters. I look forward to hearing back from you with all of the necessary verifications and the assurance that we can move forward with trust and adherence to the established protocols.

Nonprofit organizations typically focus on social good and their mission often involves serving the public interest. Thus, repurposing their assets, including AI applications or platforms, for profit-oriented goals may require substantial restructuring and a change in legal status. However, if you have a concept or model from the nonprofit sector that you believe has commercial viability, you could potentially create a for-profit venture inspired by that model—paying careful attention to intellectual property rights and other legal concerns. Here are some general areas within the nonprofit sector where AI is used, which might inspire for-profit ventures: 1. **Healthcare and Research**: Nonprofits often utilize AI for medical research or providing healthcare services. You could create a for-profit business that uses AI for diagnostics, personalized medicine, or drug discovery. 2. **Education**: AI in nonprofit education can help to personalize learning or provide tutoring services. A for-profit venture could involve creating an AI-driven educational platform tailored for individual learning or offering premium features. 3. **Environmental Protection**: AI is used in conservation and climate change analysis. A for-profit business might use AI to improve resource management in agriculture, create more efficient recycling systems, or provide data analytics for environmental monitoring to businesses. 4. **Humanitarian Services**: AI tools are often used for disaster response coordination and resource allocation. A for-profit business could offer AI-powered risk assessment and disaster response logistics services to governments and corporations. 5. **Social Services**: Nonprofits may use AI to optimize the distribution of social services or to identify individuals and communities in need. A for-profit version could offer consultancy and AI tools to help businesses implement Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects more effectively. 6. **Arts and Culture**: AI is used by nonprofits for cultural preservation or to create art. A for-profit could use AI to assist creators with generating content, provide personalized art recommendations, or help museums with digital archiving and interactive exhibits. 7. **Legal Aid**: AI tools are sometimes developed by nonprofits to provide legal assistance to underserved communities. A commercial counterpart could provide AI-driven legal services to businesses or consumers at a market rate. It's important to be aware that any such pivot from a nonprofit use of AI to a commercial one must be carefully managed in order to respect the original mission of the nonprofit, the expectations of its donors, and any legal restrictions related to its nonprofit status. Moreover, AI technology developed within a nonprofit organization may contain open source or proprietary components that have licensing restrictions, which you would need to navigate if leveraging the technology outside the nonprofit context. Finally, when shifting from a nonprofit to a for-profit mindset, the focus on revenue and profitability needs to be balanced with the existing values and trust that users or beneficiaries have in the original nonprofit service. Maintaining that trust can be critical to the success of the for-profit venture and often requires transparent communication and responsible AI practices."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

However, high-frequency training can sometimes be used by athletes with specific goals and advanced recovery strategies. Regarding the Bronze, Silver, and Golden Eras of bodybuilding, which roughly span from the early 1900s to the Golden Era culminating in the late 1970s, there is not much evidence to suggest that renowned bodybuilders trained their legs every day. Here are some notable figures from each era: - Bronze Era (early 1900s to the 1930s): Bodybuilders like Eugen Sandow or Charles Atlas, who were pioneers of modern bodybuilding, trained with more basic equipment and fewer scientifically-informed protocols. They used full-body workouts and likely did not train legs every single day. - Silver Era (1940s to about the late 1960s): Bodybuilders such as Steve Reeves and Reg Park focused on a balanced physique and utilized full-body routines and split routines that allowed for adequate rest. They typically trained each major muscle group two to three times a week. - Golden Era (late 1960s to the late 1970s): This era includes legends like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Frank Zane, and Lou Ferrigno. These bodybuilders employed a variety of split training routines, often hitting each muscle group multiple times per week but usually not every day. Arnold Schwarzenegger, for instance, was known for his high-volume training but still typically allowed for rest days or days where he trained other body parts. In modern times you might find athletes or individuals experimenting with daily leg training, especially those participating in squat challenges or those employing \\"squat every day\\" programs popularized by individuals like Bulgarian Olympic weightlifting coach Ivan Abadjiev or strength coach Cory Gregory. However, these programs have specific protocols to manage fatigue and avoid overtraining. Overall, daily leg training has not historically been a hallmark of prominent bodybuilders. Proper rest and recovery have always been essential elements of successful bodybuilding programs."},{"instruction":"[there would be dialogue in this story:] (Ever since I arrived in this fantasy world, I've made friends with some of the locals.

One of them was Charlotte - a young goblin who moved into Drakenburg from the countryside. Some of the features that caught my eye were her red hair, amber eyes, cyan tongue, farmer's outfit, and her large chest - and it gently rose & fell with each breath she took. She was like a cousin to me. One day, I was visiting Charlotte, and I noticed her enjoying a game of jump rope, a popular game from my world - her chest bouncing wildly with each jump. Of course, I had brought some stuff from my world - like another jump rope, a few gaming consoles, some tablets, and even my set of drawing tools & paper. I was a huge gamer from where I came from, after all.)","output":"Me: \\"Hey Charlotte, mind if I join in on the jump rope fun?\\" Charlotte: \\"Oh, hey there! Sure, I'd love a jump rope partner! Let's see if you can keep up with me.\\" (I chuckled as I grabbed the jump rope and started jumping with Charlotte. It was a bit tricky at first, but soon enough I found my rhythm and we were jumping in sync.) Me: \\"Wow, you're really good at this! I haven't played jump rope in ages.\\" Charlotte: \\"Thanks! I used to play all the time back in the countryside. It's a great way to stay active and have fun.\\" (As we continued jumping, we chatted about different games we both enjoyed playing. Charlotte was fascinated by the idea of video games and couldn't wait to try them out.) Me: \\"I actually brought a few gaming consoles with me. Would you like to try them out sometime?\\" Charlotte: \\"Oh wow, really? That would be amazing! I've never played any video games before. I can't wait to see what they're like.\\" (We finished our jump rope session and headed back to Charlotte's house. I set up one of the gaming consoles and showed her how to play. We spent hours gaming together, and I could see the excitement and joy on Charlotte's face.) Charlotte: \\"This is so much fun! Thank you for showing me this. I can't wait to play more games with you.\\" Me: \\"Anytime, Charlotte. It's been great getting to know you and sharing a bit of my world with you. You're like family to me now.\\" (We continued to bond over games, jump rope, and many other activities.

It checks if two values are not equal in both value and type. If the values being compared are not of the same type, the !== operator will return true. For example: 1 !== \\"1\\" // true 1 !== 1 // false I hope this clarifies the usage of !== in JavaScript! Let me know if you have any other questions."},{"instruction":"NaN in Js","output":"In JavaScript, NaN stands for \\"Not-a-Number\\" and represents a value that is not a valid number. NaN is returned when a mathematical operation or function cannot produce a meaningful numerical result. It is used to indicate that a value is not a number, such as when attempting to perform arithmetic operations on non-numeric values. Here are some examples that can produce NaN: const result1 = 10 / \\"apple\\"; // result1 will be NaN because dividing a number by a string is not valid const result2 = Math.sqrt(-1); // result2 will be NaN because the square root of a negative number is not a real number It is important to note that NaN is not equal to any value, including itself. So, you cannot use the equality operators (== or ===) to check if a value is NaN. Instead, you can use the isNaN() function to determine if a value is NaN: isNaN(NaN); // true isNaN(10); // false I hope this explanation helps you understand NaN in JavaScript. Let me know if you have any other questions!"},{"instruction":"what an eqvivalent of None in js","output":"In JavaScript, there is no direct equivalent to Python's None value. However, in JavaScript, the closest thing to representing absence of a value or a \\"null\\" value is the keyword \\"null\\". The \`null\` value in JavaScript represents the absence of a value or a empty value. It is a primitive value that indicates a deliberate lack of value. Here is an example of using \`null\` in JavaScript: \`\`\`javascript let myValue = null; if (myValue === null) { console.log(\\"Value is null\\"); } else { console.log(\\"Value is not null\\"); } \`\`\` In this example, \`myValue\` is explicitly set to \`null\` to represent the absence of a value. It's important to distinguish between \`null\` and \`undefined\` in JavaScript. \`null\` means the absence of a value intentionally assigned, while \`undefined\` means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned any value. I hope this helps clarify the concept of representing absence of a value in JavaScript. Let me know if you have any other questions!"},{"instruction":"if (taskId !== null) { generateTask(taskId); } is correct in js?","output":"Yes, the code snippet you provided is correct in JavaScript. Here's what is happening in the code: - The \`if\` statement checks if the \`taskId\` variable is not equal to \`null\`. - If the condition \`taskId !== null\` is true (meaning \`taskId\` is not \`null\`), then the \`generateTask\` function is called with \`taskId\` as the argument. This code is a common pattern used to ensure that a function is only executed when a certain condition is met. In this case, it checks if \`taskId\` is not \`null\` before calling the \`generateTask\` function. If \`taskId\` is \`null\`, the \`generateTask\` function will not be called, ensuring that it is only called when \`taskId\` has a valid value other than \`null\`. I hope this explanation helps clarify the correctness of your code. Let me know if you have any more questions or need further assistance!"},{"instruction":"if (taskId !== null) { generateTask(taskId); } how to end this code if taskId is null?","output":"If you want to terminate the code execution after checking that \`taskId\` is \`null\`, you can use the \`return\` statement to exit the function or block of code. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to exit if \`taskId\` is \`null\`: \`\`\`javascript if (taskId === null) { // Code to handle the case where taskId is null (optional) return; // Exit the function or block of code } generateTask(taskId); // This line will only execute if taskId is not null \`\`\` In this modified code snippet: - If \`taskId\` is \`null\`, the code inside the \`if\` block is executed (you can add code here to handle the case where \`taskId\` is \`null\`, if needed). - The \`return\` statement is used to exit the function or block of code if \`taskId\` is \`null\`. - If \`taskId\` is not \`null\`, the \`generateTask\` function is called. By using \`return\`, you can effectively exit the function or block of code early when \`taskId\` is \`null. I hope this helps!

Here are a few common methods: 1. Using a Template Engine: If you are working on a web application where Python and JavaScript are both involved, you can use a templating engine like Jinja2 for Python or Mako to render HTML files that contain both Python and JavaScript code. You can pass Python variables to the template engine and render them within the JavaScript code. 2. Generating Dynamic JavaScript: You can generate JavaScript code dynamically from Python using string manipulation or template strings and write the generated JavaScript code to a \`.js\` file. The JavaScript code can include the values of Python variables that need to be passed. 3. Using AJAX Requests: You can make AJAX requests from JavaScript to a Python server (using a framework like Flask or Django) to retrieve data from Python and pass it to the JavaScript. The Python server can respond to the AJAX request with the desired variable, and the JavaScript can then use this data. 4. Using a Python to JavaScript Bridge: There are libraries like Pyodide or Brython that allow you to run Python code in the browser within a JavaScript environment. This enables you to directly pass Python variables to JavaScript code within the browser. Each of these methods has its own use case and complexity level, so you can choose the one that best fits your specific requirements. If you provide more details about your specific scenario, I can provide a more detailed explanation or example code for passing variables from Python to JavaScript. Let me know if you need further assistance!"},{"instruction":"to pass variable from html to js","output":"To pass a variable from HTML to JavaScript, you can use a few different methods: 1. Inline Script Tag: You can define the variable directly in a \`<script>\` tag within your HTML document.

Data Attributes: You can use HTML data attributes to store variable data directly in HTML elements and then access these values in JavaScript. Here's an example: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Passing Variable from HTML to JS</title> </head> <body> <div id=\\"myElement\\" data-variable=\\"Hello, World!\\"></div> <script> var myVariable = document.getElementById(\\"myElement\\").dataset.variable; console.log(myVariable); // Output: Hello, World! <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` 3. Input Elements: If you have an input element on your HTML page, such as a text input, you can retrieve the value entered by the user and use it in JavaScript. Here's an example: \`\`\`html <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>Passing Variable from HTML to JS</title> </head> <body> <input type=\\"text\\" id=\\"myInput\\" placeholder=\\"Enter a value\\"> <button onclick=\\"displayValue()\\">Get Value</button> <script> function displayValue() { var myVariable = document.getElementById(\\"myInput\\").value; console.log(myVariable); // Output: Value entered by the user } <\/script> </body> </html> \`\`\` These are just a few examples of how you can pass a variable from HTML to JavaScript.
