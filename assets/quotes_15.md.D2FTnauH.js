Context: The dumbest thing that actually worked? I joined Tinder. Reason I say it was the dumbest is because I still acknowledge that it’s not my kind of dating scene even though I ended up meeting the love of my life through the app. Other than that? Nothing was wrong or dumb. I have done nothing much because the man I am currently dating sent me a superlike after I was on the app for less than 12 hours. I joined, created profile, went through possible matches, and then went to bed. I didn’t have enough time to do something dumb. Now my boyfriend on the other hand was on the app for 4–5 months prior to me joining and him finding me. His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to. If I hadn’t have found his joke funny, he probably wouldn’t have asked me out on a date. I hope that answers your question. I know it wasn’t very…. eventful.

Given the background: Geologists study earthquake waves to “see” Earth's interior. Waves of energy radiate out from an earthquake’s focus. These waves are called seismic waves ( Figure below ). Seismic waves go different speeds through different materials. They change speed when they go from one type of material to another. This causes them to bend. Some seismic waves do not travel through liquids or gases. They just stop. Scientists use information from seismic waves to understand what makes up the Earth’s interior.  and the situation: Two friends met after 20 years and had a beer together.

What is the best way to: How to get more volume in your hair","output":"The best way to get more volume in your hair involves a combination of proper hair care, styling techniques, and using the right hair products. Here's a detailed guide to help you add volume and thickness to your locks: 1. Choose the right shampoo and conditioner: Select volumizing shampoos and conditioners that are specially formulated to add volume and body to your hair. These products typically contain ingredients that help remove excess oil, residue, and build-up from the hair shaft while moisturizing and nourishing the scalp. 2. Avoid heavy hair products: Using heavy, oil-based products weigh down your hair, reducing volume. Instead, look for lightweight products like mousses and serums that add volume without weighing your hair down. 3. Shampoo effectively: To maximize your hair's volume potential, be sure to thoroughly cleanse your roots and scalp when shampooing. Focus on massaging the shampoo into your scalp with your fingertips for at least 30 seconds, then rinse out completely to remove any dirt, oil, and residues. 4. Use a microfiber towel or shirt: Instead of using a regular towel to dry your hair, opt for a microfiber towel or an old cotton T-shirt. This will help prevent breakage and friction that leads to flat, lifeless locks. 5. Apply a volumizing mousse or root-lifting spray: Dampen your hair and then apply a lightweight mousse or a root-lifting spray from roots to mid-lengths. This will provide extra volume and hold throughout your hair. 6. Utilize hair rollers: Hair rollers are an old but effective method that helps add volume and bounce to your hair. Choose large velcro or hot rollers for the best results. Apply the rollers to your hair (preferably to dried or slightly damp hair) and let them set for at least 30 minutes before removing them. Comb your hair gently to maintain the volume. 7. Master the right blow-drying technique: Blow-drying your hair upside-down can create more volume by lifting the roots. Use a round brush to help maintain tension as you pull your hair upward and away from your scalp. Additionally, use the cool-shot feature on your hairdryer to set the style and add extra volume. 8. Use dry shampoo: On days when you don't wash your hair, apply dry shampoo at the roots. This will absorb excess oil and add instant volume and texture. 9. Add layers to your haircut: Ask your hairstylist for a layered haircut if your hair is long. Layers help remove some of the weight from your locks and create a more voluminous appearance. 10. Tease your hair: Use a fine-toothed comb or a teasing brush to gently tease the hair at your roots. This method creates additional volume by lifting the hair away from your scalp. Be sure not to over-tease, as it can cause damage to the hair shafts. 11. Use hair extensions or clip-ins: If your hair is naturally thin or you want to create extra volume for a specific event, consider using hair extensions or clip-in pieces. These can add instant fullness and length to your hair without causing damage. 12. Maintain healthy hair habits: Trim your hair regularly to avoid split ends and hair breakage, which can make your hair appear thinner. Also, practice good hair care routines like using a heat protectant spray before applying heat tools and eating a balanced diet. By following these tips, you can achieve a voluminous, fuller hair look. It might take some practice and experimentation, but with patience and the right techniques, you'll be able to add lasting volume to your locks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You ' ve sold them on the idea that McCain is n't a bad egg , and they do not hear the rest of what you have to say : \\" But John McCain is four more years of George W. What type of ideology is the narrator showing here ?","output":"In order to answer the question, let's break down the steps I will take: 1. Analyzing the text to understand its content and underlying message. 2. Identifying the narrator's attitude towards the subject matter. 3. Determining the type of ideology that the narrator is showing based on the analyzed content and attitude. Step 1: Analyzing the text The text seems to be discussing the narrator's thoughts on someone mentioning that John McCain is \\"good on global warming\\" and campaign finance. The narrator then explains how when people hear this statement repeatedly, they begin to believe that McCain is a positive choice. However, the narrator also implies that there's more to the story, which people might not listen to if they're already convinced that McCain is a good option. Step 2: Identifying the narrator's attitude The narrator appears to be skeptical or critical of the idea that McCain is a good choice simply because of his stance on global warming and campaign finance. By using phrases like \\"say that enough\\" and \\"you've sold them,\\" the narrator suggests that this portrayal of McCain is more about manipulation and persuasion than accurate representation. Step 3: Determining the type of ideology Based on the narrator's skeptical and critical tone towards persuasion and manipulation, one could argue that the narrator is showing a more liberal or progressive ideology. This is because the narrator seems to be urging others to question the oversimplified representation of McCain's stance and consider other aspects as well before making a judgment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The CGI monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way. The fight scenes weren't even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all. When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro. In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets. They may not look as fancy but at least they interact, just look at Peter Jacksons early films. As for the acting Beowulf did an descent job but the rest of the cast were either not trying or they forgot where they where. The script seemed confused to me. One minute they would be talking as if it were a modern day setting the next you get drama club Shakespeare speech. I'm not say it should be all 'ye' and 'that it be' but you need to find a cohesive balance so the lines sound like they come from the same person. I did notice one part near the start when Beowulf was quoting the old testament which would have been find had he not spent the rest of the films talking about the gods and portents. In short, this film is a very slightly polished turd, but a turn none the less.","output":"Okay little buddy, this person who wrote the review didn't really like the movie. They thought the monster looked okay, but the way it was put in the movie wasn't good. They also think the actors didn't do a great job, except for the one playing Beowulf.

I would not expect this from a so-called Michelin star rated restaurant (according to the concierge).  Customer service is just as important as the quality of the food.

Please answer the following question: Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... What experience does the author credit with teaching him about knowledge workers?

While in the field, she collected two flowers to examine in detail. She puts the first flower, flower X, under a microscope and begins to look at it. After examination she determines it's an anemophilous plant. She then takes flower Y and repeats the same process to determine that it's an entomophilous type of plant.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which flower has a less exposed stamen?  Hint: Anemophilous pollen grains are light and non-sticky, so that they can be transported by air currents. They are typically 20–60 micrometres (0.0008–0.0024 in) in diameter, although the pollen grains of Pinus species can be much larger and much less dense. Anemophilous plants possess well-exposed stamens so that the pollens are exposed to wind currents and also have large and feathery stigma to easily trap airborne pollen grains. Pollen from anemophilous plants tends to be smaller and lighter than pollen from entomophilous ones, with very low nutritional value to insects. However, insects sometimes gather pollen from staminate anemophilous flowers at times when higher-protein pollens from entomophilous flowers are scarce. Anemophilous pollens may also be inadvertently captured by bees' electrostatic field. This may explain why, though bees are not observed to visit ragweed flowers, its pollen is often found in honey made during the ragweed floral bloom. Other flowers that are generally anemophilous are observed to be actively worked by bees, with solitary bees often visiting grass flowers, and the larger honeybees and bumblebees frequently gathering pollen from corn tassels and other grains.

The film then shifts to a conversation between Abby (Frances McDormand) and Ray (John Getz) in a car as it drives through a heavy downpour at night. They seem to be discussing Abby's bad marriage and Ray indicates that he's driving her to Houston. But instead of driving Abby to Houston, Ray drives to a motel and they have sex. We later find out that Julian Marty (Dan Hedaya), who owns a Texas bar, has suspected Abby's affair with Ray, one of his bartenders, so he hires private detective Loren Visser (M. Emmet Walsh) to take photos of them. When Visser reports back to Marty, he teases him about being cuckolded. The morning after their tryst, Marty makes a silent phone call to Ray and Abby. The following day Ray goes to the bar to collect his earnings, two weeks worth of work, but instead confronts Marty and quits his job. Marty threatens Ray's life and advises him not to trust Abby, that she will one day tell him she \\"hasn't done anything funny\\" and he won't believe her. Marty then hires Visser to kill the couple. Visser suggests he take a fishing trip to Corpus Christi to establish an alibi. He then breaks into Ray's home, steals Abby's gun, and photographs the sleeping couple through the bedroom window. Visser presents an edited photo of their fake corpses to Marty, who dumps four dead fish on his desk. Marty goes to the bathroom to vomit, then opens the safe to give Visser his 10,000 fee. Visser then shoots Marty with Abby's gun in a double cross, leaving her gun at the scene as evidence that she killed Marty. But he accidentally leaves his cigarette lighter and does not realize that Marty has stolen one of the incriminating photographs and locked it in the safe.

Although Joel - who works as a mechanic in the family garage - is wary of Lauryn's decision to enroll, he eventually gives her his blessing. When Lauryn enters the stage, however, her dance (mostly a hip hop routine) was halted by the judge, who hostilely rejects her, saying that they need to see something more \\"sensual and feminine\\". Dejected, Lauryn goes to a diner to down her sorrows, but soon finds her car towed off. Upon seeing her misfortunes, Dana (Tessa Thompson), a friendly waitress from the diner invites Lauryn to her apartment and out of the pouring rain. Dana subsequently offers Lauryn a place to stay, considering Lauryn could not go back home and face her brother. The next day, Dana brings Lauryn to a club called Ruby's (whose dances are rooted in burlesque), where she meets with Russ (Riley Smith), the slick-talking disc jockey, and Brenda (Karen LeBlanc), the club owner. Brenda hires Lauryn as a bookkeeper, in light of her skills with numbers. Lauryn watches as a dancer, Carmen (Julissa Bermudez) performs impressively on the stage.

The group was formed in 1992, and featured Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden. After several self-released records and cassettes, the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the V2 subsidiary Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios. Common lyrical themes include technology and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as \\"one's attempt to transcend the glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral\\". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band \\"provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen\\". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's \\"geeky identification with technology\\". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's \\"sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape\\". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating \\"I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects\\" and how the song \\"I'm on Standby\\" is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: \\"I was spending so much time learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'\\".  Lytle said of the tracks on Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla: \\"For some reason, they are tied together by the idea of being fed up with your environment.\\" He stated in 2001: \\"I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. I get that from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it.\\"  There is also much humor in Lytle's songwriting, including the band's promotional Christmas single released in 2000, \\"Alan Parsons in a Winter Wonderland\\", which was also included on the charity compilation It's a Cool Cool Christmas, described by AllMusic's Tim DiGravina as possibly \\"the funniest song from 2000\\".

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person to whom Bartok dedicated the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928?  Szigeti was an avid champion of new music, and frequently planned his recitals to include new or little-known works alongside the classics. Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would...

Private investigator Patrick Kenzie (played by Casey Affleck) and his partner and girlfriend Angie Gennaro (played by Michelle Monaghan) are hired by the child's Aunt Beatrice to find her. Kenzie and Angie discover Amanda's mother Helene and her boyfriend \\"Skinny Ray\\" had recently stolen money from a local drug lord. After Ray is murdered, Patrick and Angie join the police detectives investigating the case, Nick Poole and Remy Bressant, to arrange a trade of the money for Amanda.

First, let's find out how many g's we have: 198*g - 23*g That's like having 198 apples with the letter \\"g\\" on them and taking away 23 apples with letter \\"g\\". So, 198 - 23 = 175 Now, we have 175g! Next, let's rewrite our problem using this number: 175g + 353 = -764 - 1508 Now, we're going to solve for g (the letter we want to find!). To do this, we first need to deal with that \\"+353\\" by moving it to the other side. When we move it, we'll change its sign to \\"-353\\". So our new problem is: 175g = -764 - 1508 - 353 Now let's add the numbers on the right side: -764 - 1508 - 353 = -2625 So, our problem now looks like this: 175g = -2625 Next, we want to find out what \\"g\\" is, so we need to get rid of that \\"175\\" next to it.

Step 2: Consider the reviewer's critique The reviewer mentions that the movie's main fault is spending too much time in a plane. However, they do not appear to think that this detracts significantly from the overall quality of the movie. Step 3: Assess the relevance of the critique to your preferences Since the critique focuses on the setting of the movie and not the overall story or acting, it might not be a deal-breaker for me if I generally enjoy movies with twists and suspense.

Your task is to generate the question for the answer based on the given article. Input: Article: A recent survey in the United States showed that the average family spent more money on its pets than on its children. Although rather shocking, it should not surprise anyone who has seen the doggy parlors  where loved pets rest. Are Americans unique in treating their little friends in this way? No, the English, too, pay more attention to their pets. This can clearly be seen when we look at pet foods, which often contain more vitamins than human food. They certainly cost much. Last year the British public spent two hundred million pounds on pet food alone, to say nothing of veterinary bills or animal furniture. It is difficult not to feel angry about this when considering what the same amount could do for victims of starvation and poverty, so it is not unusual for me _ when I read an old man left all his money to his dog instead of his children. There are a variety of reasons why I find pets-raising alarming. They cause physical problems. An example of this is New York where they have great difficulty getting rid of the mess that dogs leave on the streets. Many people find this funny, but in a number of large cities it is a major problem. Animals can cause disease, too. It is the threat of rabies -- a disease with no known cure. Another problem is the carelessness of pet owners. Most little children want a dog or a cat, and they continually push their mothers and fathers until they get one. It is only when the \\"sweet little thing\\" has been brought home that the parents realize how much time and money must be spent on \\"Rover\\" or \\"Bonzo\\". Then they just abandon it. As a result, they are allowed to run free. English farmers lose hundreds of sheep a year, killed by someone's pet and you must have read of children being hurt by some pets of their own. Lastly, I would only suggest that we have got our priorities wrong and that something should be done about it. In my view, it's time we stopped being sentimental about pets. I can see no reason why we should get upset when animals are cut up for medical experiments. This will lead us to discovering cures for serious human diseases, then I say, \\"keep cutting!\\"   Answer: Sports.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century  Question: \\"What notes did Whalen Lai say about Madame White Snake?\\" Answer: \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

At age six-and-a-half, Matilda begins to lose patience with her parents, expressing a desire to go to school. In retaliation for her father constantly berating her, she adds hydrogen peroxide to his hair tonic, turning his hair an unhealthy blonde.

For about a week, the nation's Catholic bishops enjoyed some measure of their bygone political clout. The bishops launched a vigorous grassroots campaign to protest a rule from the Obama administration's health care mandate that would force many Catholic institutions to cover birth control through their employee health plans. Catholic churchgoers have seen such campaigns attempted before, with bishops issuing stinging denunciations that are repeated in church publications and in letters read to parishioners at every Mass. But this time, to the surprise of many, the bishops' effort seemed to work. President Barack Obama quickly modified the rule. He didn't satisfy the bishops -- but still, the clergymen had upset the political calculus that they no longer affect Catholic voters. The bishops were able to wield influence because their message against the contraception mandate was framed in a way that appealed to a broad spectrum of Catholics. For moderates and liberals, there were calls to freedom and conscience, rather than blunt declarations to heed ecclesial authority. For conservatives, there was the opportunity to circle the wagons against secularism. But if the bishops insist on coming across as shrill and partisan, as some are wont to do, they'll wind up once again preaching to half the choir. Moderate and liberal Catholics won't stand behind the bishops if they perceive a partisan position. And it won't take much to trigger that reaction because certain bishops were transparently opposed to Obama during the 2008 election campaign, and many more of them later maligned the University of Notre Dame for granting the president an honorary degree. I noticed a letter to the editor in the diocesan newspaper in Brooklyn, where I live, that captures the unease I believe a good number of Catholics feel. The writer said she understood the church's position on the birth-control mandate, but she practically pleaded with the editor, who had accused the Obama administration of pushing socialism, to take a less polarizing tone. If the bishops really want to gain back some of the clout they used to hold, they would do well to consider the community organizing tactics that their own parishes have adopted in many poor urban neighborhoods. It is an approach that relies heavily on building consensus. Guided by the writings of Saul Alinsky, coalitions of houses of worship have organized around specific issues, such as a plan to build low-cost housing. The community organizers' first step was to secure the enthusiastic support of parishioners, demonstrated through massive rallies. Once pastors really do speak for their people, they are then in a position to demand that elected officials of whatever party support their agenda. Obama once was a community organizer for just such a church-funded coalition, working from a Catholic rectory on Chicago's South Side. Like the Chicago politicians he encountered as a young man, Obama knows that a church's grassroots campaign is only as effective as it is unified. I'm not sure how many bishops know that.

Furthermore, in 1994, a significant amount of zinc was used to produce billions of pennies in the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Review: I have a six month old baby at home and time to time she fights sleep really bad. One morning she was having a particular difficult time getting to sleep when the doodle bops theme song came on T.V. She stopped crying almost instantly, and for the rest of the show was content. I sat her in her bouncy seat and watched her kick her legs, swing her arms, and actually laugh at this show. The kept her entertained and happy the entire time. I also got a video of them so that at times when my little one is flustered I have something to calm her. Granted, late at night if she awakes with colic to fuss the doodle bops are not her cup of tea, but they sure do come in handy when I need a little time to do housework,etc. The biggest surprise about the doodle bops is that my child doesn't even like watching T.V. She'd rather be in the floor playing with a toy or with our small toy poodle than watch T.V. yet, the doodle bops have totally captured her attention. I don't know if she will continue to like them in the future but for now she's attached. Now, what is this review like? Options are: (i). negative; (ii). positive;","output":"(iii). mixed; Step 1: Read the review carefully. Step 2: Identify the various aspects mentioned in the review. Step 3: Check for positive or negative statements about each aspect. In this review, the user mentions that the doodle bops theme song helped calm their baby and even made her laugh. They have mentioned that their baby doesn't usually like watching TV, but the doodle bops have captured her attention. The user also mentions that the show keeps their child entertained and happy while they can do house chores. The only slightly negative point mentioned is that the doodle bops don't help when their baby awakes with colic in the middle of the night.  Step 4: Weigh the positive and negative aspects. The review mainly has positive comments about the doodle bops and how it impacts their baby. Step 5: Choose the most appropriate option based on the analysis. Based on the review, I would classify it as a (ii). positive review. While there is one slightly negative point, the overall sentiment of the review leans more towards the positive side."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(III) see the other man lift the first man and slam him on the sidewalk.. (IV) see a man in a white shirt talking..","output":"Based on the given context, let us consider each of the provided options before choosing the most appropriate ending for the next paragraph. Option (I): \\"see men partying with dogs in a van.\\" This ending seems somewhat unrelated to the previous events described. The paragraph is discussing a slow-motion replay of a slam and the appearance of a title on the screen. This option introduces new characters and an entirely different scene, which does not naturally follow the existing paragraph. Option (II): \\"see a man throw a blue ball and the title comes on the screen.\\" This ending presents a scene where a man throws a blue ball and the title appears on the screen. While it adds a new element (the man with the blue ball), it still maintains continuity by mentioning the title on the screen. This could signify a transition to a related scene or the introduction of a topic. Option (III): \\"see the other man lift the first man and slam him on the sidewalk.\\" Although this ending does involve the first man being lifted and slammed on the sidewalk, it does not seem to relate to the slow-motion replay or title mentioned earlier in the paragraph. This ending would make more sense if the paragraph was discussing the continuation of a physical altercation, rather than focusing on a slow-motion replay and a title. Option (IV): \\"see a man in a white shirt talking.\\" This option introduces a man who is talking, but it doesn't provide any context or connection to the previous scene. It is quite a vague ending and does not give any indication of why this man in a white shirt is relevant or how the slow-motion replay and title relate to his talking. Considering the provided options, Option (II) - \\"see a man throw a blue ball and the title comes on the screen\\" - seems the most plausible and coherent ending for the next paragraph. This option connects well with the mentioned title on the screen and introduces a new element that may signify a transition to a related scene or the introduction of a topic. The other options either do not maintain continuity with the existing paragraph or lack sufficient context to create a natural flow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

As there is no camera that will read whether light is distributed evenly over any given scene the proposed use of setting the exposure through the Disc is a mute point.

The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance.

Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

The Mockingjay Part 1 was initially released on November 21, 2014.

The Hunger Games series revolves around the character of Katniss Everdeen, portrayed by Jennifer Lawrence, in a dystopian society called Panem, which is set in a post-apocalyptic version of North America. The story follows Katniss as she becomes a symbol of rebellion against the oppressive government after surviving the annual Hunger Games event. In Mockingjay Part 2, the storyline comes to a conclusion when Katniss, along with her closest friends, embarks on a mission to assassinate President Snow, played by Donald Sutherland. The movie is filled with intense action sequences and emotional moments as the characters face their final battle for freedom. The film series received positive reviews from critics and was a global box office success. In addition to Jennifer Lawrence, the movie features a star-studded cast, including Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark, Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne, and other notable actors such as Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, and the late Philip Seymour Hoffman.

Review: I realized a couple of days ago that the makers of this film put a play on words into its title. This movie is not primarily about the act of \\"riding giants,\\" but mostly about the people who are the giants of the sport, RIDING giants, to change the emphasis. In my teens I lived a block from the Wedge, one of the hardest-breaking and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I've been out in 15-to-18 foot surf, and have ridden and been hammered by 10 and 12-foot waves on many occasions. That experience is why I am in complete awe of the surfers in this film. The idea that Jeff Clark, to all appearances a normal mortal, could get away with riding Maverick's BY HIMSELF for over a decade is beyond my grasp. The first safety rule of any water sport is \\"Never surf/dive/swim by yourself.\\" He went where sane people would not, and lived to tell about it. I wouldn't go out there if the water were 75 degrees and the sharks all left.  In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves at Jaws always makes the skin tingle over my entire body. These are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled-bowel-evacuation waves. When we see Laird Hamilton not only surviving 40-to-60 foot waves (I can hardly type those numbers), but actually working the faces like a fun day at Rincon, I'm blown away. There is a dedication and focus in big-wave riders which is comparable to that of anyone in the world.  This a great film. I gave it a 9 instead of a 10 only because it neglects to mention that there are great big-wave riders in the world outside the Hamilton/Kalama crew, and I think they deserved mention. Splice in Ken Bradshaw at outside Log Cabins and a 10 it is! Now, what is this review like? Available options: I. negative; II. positive;","output":"III. mixed; This review is a mix of positive and critical elements. The reviewer discusses their admiration for the surfers and their awe at the waves these athletes face. There is also a high rating given (9 out of 10). However, the reviewer points out that the film could have included more big-wave riders outside of the main crew, which is a slightly critical comment.

I believe that if this particular native of Galifrey is to be viewed as a renegade on the run from his own people, then criss-crossing the time-stream and meeting himself seems like a natural occurrence. Dick's story allows one to go into one's own memory matrix and conjure up the prior doctors, while maintaining the EIGHTH's own persona. This is also the first meeting with the EIGHT's newest companion, SAM JONES. It also helps clear up some of the incontinuities of the 1996 tele-film. Answer: Answer:","output":"Yes, this product review is positive. The reviewer appreciates the writer Terrance Dicks' ability to bring the many voices of the Doctor together and enjoys the concept of the Doctor meeting himself within the story. They also mention that the story allows them to recall memories of prior doctors while maintaining the Eighth's persona, and it introduces a new companion, Sam Jones. Additionally, the reviewer appreciates the clarification of some inconsistencies from a previous tele-film. Overall, the review expresses enjoyment and satisfaction with the book."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Now the big question is how many of the party's new voters will choose them again at the general election. Newsbeat met a young UKIP voter in Rochester who says it's unlikely he'll still support them in May 2015. Nineteen-year-old Piers says his vote was a protest against the other main parties. \\"I voted for UKIP in this by-election, but I don't want them to win the general election and I don't want Nigel Farage to be prime minister,\\" Piers told Newsbeat. \\"I've had a read of UKIP's ideas in the pamphlets they've been giving out here. \\"To me, they don't seem to have a lot of policies on the important things like the economy. \\"That's the main reason I wouldn't want to see them in power.\\" UKIP's candidate Mark Reckless won the Rochester and Strood by-election with 16,867 votes.

Newsbeat interviews a 19-year-old UKIP voter named Piers who reports that, despite voting UKIP in the by-election, he is unlikely to vote for them in the general election in May 2015. Piers explains that his vote was a protest against the other main political parties and does not want to see UKIP in power due to their lack of policies on important matters such as the economy. However, he agrees with UKIP's notion that the UK wastes a lot of money staying in the European Union. The young voter emphasizes that he wants the other political parties to realize they are not doing enough to address the country's problems, such as housing and tertiary education costs. In the interview, Piers mentions that he is struggling with the idea of moving out of his parents' house and the cost of going to university. He also points out that immigration is an issue as the country is over-populated and lacks employment opportunities. UKIP leader Nigel Farage denies that the by-election result was just a protest vote against the government. UKIP's primary policy is to leave the European Union. Prime Minister David Cameron and Labour leader Ed Miliband recognize the need for their respective parties to win voters back from UKIP to regain power, with Cameron pledging to win the seat back in the next general election. The article highlights how certain voters may use UKIP as a means to protest against other main political parties, but ultimately, they may not support UKIP in the general elections due to the party's limited scope on policies beyond their stance on the European Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When an apparent terrorist hijack attempt blows a hole in the (Boeing 747) airliner, Terry is sucked out to his death, and the terrorists parachute out of the same hole, taking Leedy with them. Ex-DEA agent and renegade skydiver Ty Moncrief (Gary Busey) is the mastermind behind the attack, which culminated in the first ever parachute jump from a commercial jet at 30,000 feet. Ty plans to use Leedy to hack into the DEA mainframe computer in Washington DC so Ty can auction off the names of undercover agents to drug cartels worldwide. Ty has scheduled this to be accomplished during an Independence Day parachute exhibition and fireworks display, which is the one day every year when security is loosened around the airspace above Washington DC. Pete believes that the assault may have been an elaborate prison break meant to free Leedy. However, the FBI declares that sneaking a parachute through airport security is impossible, and that parachuting at the jet's altitude and speed is not survivable. A devastated Pete is blamed for overreacting to the incident, and forced to turn in his badge. Undeterred, Pete consults a U.S. Navy High-altitude military parachuting instructor who confirms that he and his team have parachuted from that height and speed, but also states that the high-density metal rings in the parachutes would not pass airport metal detectors and that the operation required either rare skills or suicidal recklessness. The instructor believes the world class skydiver Dominic Jagger (Luca Bercovici) could perform the jump, but does not know his current whereabouts. Pete is instead referred to Jagger's reckless ex-wife, ex-con Jessie Crossman (Yancy Butler) - who is unaware that Jagger is part of Ty's crew.

Article: Brigham Young University is a part of the Church Educational System of LDS Church. It is organized under a Board of Trustees, with the President of the Church (currently Thomas S. Monson) as chairman. This board consists of the same people as the Church Board of Education, a pattern that has been in place since 1939. Prior to 1939, BYU had a separate board of trustees that was subordinate to the Church Board of Education. The President of BYU, currently Kevin J Worthen, reports to the Board, through the Commissioner of Education. Question: Who acts as chairman of BYU?","output":"The chairman of Brigham Young University (BYU) is the President of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. BYU falls under the Church Educational System (CES) of the LDS Church, and its organization falls under a Board of Trustees. The President of the LDS Church acts as the chairman of this Board. As of the information given in the text, Thomas S. Monson is the current President of the LDS Church and therefore, he is the chairman of BYU.  The Board of Trustees includes the same members as the Church Board of Education, following a pattern that has been in place since 1939. Before the year 1939, BYU operated differently with a unique board of trustees that was subordinate to the Church Board of Education. But this has since changed, and the current structure has remained consistent. This setup makes the President of BYU, at the time being Kevin J Worthen, obliged to report to the Board of Trustees, with the communication being facilitated by the Commissioner of Education.  Under this organizational structure, the LDS Church President in the capacity of BYU's chairman provides religious, philosophical, and organizational direction, and it allows the Church to maintain governance and supervision over the university. This underscores the interlinkage and integration of the institution's religious and educational objectives serving both secular-academic and LDS Church education needs.  Thus, to sum up, the person holding the position of the LDS Church President also functions as the chairman of the Board of Trustees at Brigham Young University, and as such, he holds significant influence over the broader operational structure and policy direction of the institution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While organizing some paperwork pertaining to real estate cases, she is puzzled when she notices medical records in one of the files. On a whim, she does a little investigating of her own, and comes to suspect that land purchased by Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E;) is the same land on which chromium contamination resulted from PG&E;'s environmentally irresponsible actions.Examination of local water records and interviews with residents ill from exposure to poisonous chromium confirm Erin's suspicions, but pursuit of legal proceedings against PG&E; would seem beyond the capabilities of the small law firm she works at. Still, Erin succeeds in making her boss, Ed Masry (Albert Finney), as passionate about the case as she is, and he takes it on. Both Ed and Erin must make great sacrifices in their lives, as the legal costs spread Ed very thin, and the round-the-clock work takes Erin out of touch with both her boyfriend and her kids.Erin's kids resent the lack of attention from her, and her attempts to explain the merits of what she is doing to her eldest son are futile ..... but, one day her eldest son happens across one of the many documents pertaining to the PG&E; case. He reads of a child his own age who is very ill, and knowing that Erin's work will help this child, asks her why the child's mother cannot provide the needed help. When Erin explains that it is because the child's mother is very ill, too, her son, for the first time, appreciates the nature and importance of Erin's work.In the end, Erin's special ability to bond with the victims of chromium contaminaton and their families and Ed's legal and administrative prowess are the key ingredients to making the case against PG&E.; As a team, they manage to successfully lay the groundwork for the payment of legal damages by PG&E; to those harmed.

I can't lay claim to much in the way of literary knowledge, but I do know that Proust's 'Remembrance of Things Past' was prompted by his biting into a pastry and feeling a sense of overwhelming pleasure with no recognizable cause. In my case, I was instantly transported back to the grandmother's kitchen as she and my mother grated potatoes in order to make 'poutine râpée', also known as 'poutines'. People will immediately flash to the Quebecker ethnic food known by the same name. However, in spite of all the Franco-culinary posturing, this is really only French Fries with gravy and, oh yeah, can I have some cheese curds on that? One etymological source indicates that 'poutine' really means 'mess'. If you come from my part of the country, the Quebecker poutine is just another entry in the long list of dishes that will cause you to keel over from a myocardial infarction while shoveling a foot of snow out of the driveway shortly after you've retired; sometimes before. Nope, poutines as I know them are a different creature entirely. They seem to be more of an Acadian thing and none of my friends had even heard of them, much less eaten a single one. Because of the work involved, my mother only made poutines for special times: Christmas, say or Easter. My mother would borrow this grater that was about two feet long and she and my grandmother would set to work.

Q: SEOUL — Arms control experts estimate that the dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program could take a decade to complete, and cost 20 billion, if a nuclear agreement is reached between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un when they meet in Singapore on June 12. “The hard work has not yet begun, and it is gong to take sustained energy on the part of the United States, South Korea, Japan, China and North Korea. It’s going to be a multiyear long process,” said Daryl Kimball, the executive director of the Arms Control Association in Washington. President Trump has said he expects a \\"very positive result\\" from the North Korea nuclear summit, but he also said it will likely be the beginning of a process to resolve differences over the extent of the North’s denuclearization, and the specifics regarding what sanctions relief, economic aid and security guarantees would be offered in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Sunday that North Korea would only receive sanctions relief after it takes \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" This position aligns closer to the Kim government’s stance that denuclearization measures and concessions be matched action for action. And it backs away from demands made by some in the president’s national security team that Pyongyang quickly and unilaterally dismantle all its weapons of mass destruction before any concessions would be offered. North Korea is estimated to have 20 to 80 nuclear warheads, both known and covert nuclear research and processing sites, and thousands of ballistic missiles that can be launched from mobile vehicles, and submarine based launchers have been tested in recent years. With such an extensive nuclear arsenal it could cost 20 billion to achieve the U.S. goal of complete, irreversible, and verifiable nuclear dismantlement (CVID), according to a recent study conducted by Kwon Hyuk-chul, a Kookmin University professor of security strategy. Kwon based his assessment in part on past nuclear deals... Question: Why did North Korea have a chance at sanction relief === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"North Korea had a chance at sanction relief because they were willing to engage in negotiations with the United States and other countries, and possibly take \\"verifiable and irreversible steps to denuclearization.\\" By participating in discussions and demonstrating a commitment to the denuclearization process, North Korea could potentially receive relief from sanctions, economic aid, and security guarantees in return. U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis mentioned that sanctions relief would be granted if North Korea took the necessary steps towards denuclearization, which aligns with the Kim government's stance that both actions and concessions should be matched during the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: America's Leftward Tilt? - NYTimes.com The presidential election is now a close contest, but barring an Electoral College tie, someone is going to win, someone is going to lose, and both sides will have to make sense of it all. The obvious story line of this election, whoever wins, is that Americans want pragmatic solutions to the relentless distress they have experienced for over a decade, whether that means a more active or a more passive government. They are looking for anyone who can provide a coherent vision of how to fix an economy that is not working for people who work for a living. But rather than a victory for pragmatism, we may well see both the winners and losers take away a very different lesson: that this election was a mandate for another shift to the right. If Mitt Romney loses, conservatives will no doubt conclude that he just wasn’t conservative enough, that they should have picked someone more appealing to their base. If President Obama loses or squeaks out a victory just four years after President George W. Bush destroyed the economy (which should have discredited conservative economics once and for all), many Democrats are likely to conclude that he tried to move too left too fast when he pushed for a stimulus and health care reform for which Americans were simply not ready, rather than that he simply sold both programs poorly (something he now acknowledges). Similarly, whichever candidate wins, the first order of business will be deciding which programs to cut — unless a deal to prevent us from going over the fiscal cliff is reached during the lame-duck session of Congress after the election. Most voters intuitively understand that jobs and deficits are linked — too much of an emphasis on deficits leads to too few jobs — because working people with money in their wallets drive demand, whereas wealthier people with money in their wallets drive Jaguars (and send the rest of their income to their hedge fund managers). Even in the heart of red America, people understand that high unemployment and income disparities of the magnitude we are now witnessing are bad for economic growth. But you have to speak in a way that brings out their inner Keynes, as I discovered when testing the following message in the Deep South: “The only way to cut the deficit is to put Americans back to work.” That message beat the toughest austerity message by over 30 points. The reality is that our government hasn’t become this dysfunctional because the parties are so “polarized.” It’s because there is only one pole in American politics today, and its magnetic field is so powerful that it has drawn both parties in the same direction — rightward. And it is in that same direction that the magnetic field of contemporary American politics is likely to pull the stories the two parties tell after the election — and the policies the winner pursues. The data, however, suggest just the opposite — that both candidates have benefited in the general election every time they have taken a left turn. President Obama was in deep political trouble 15 months ago when he cut the closest thing he could to a “grand bargain” with House Speaker John A. Boehner to slash the federal budget by trillions, and he did nothing for his popularity nine months earlier when he extended the Bush tax cuts to the wealthy. Not until he began talking like a populist did he begin picking up steam in the polls. Indeed, one of the most powerful messages the Democrats chose not to use in the 2010 midterm elections — which would have supported a policy that was extremely popular then and remains as popular now — was a simple message on taxes I tested nationally, which won in every region and with every demographic, including Tea Partyers: “In tough times like these, millionaires ought to be giving to charity, not getting it.” Once that position (and other populist appeals) became central to Mr. Obama’s presidential campaign, the election looked like it would be a rout. BUT then in the first debate, Mr. Romney moved to the center, taking back his promise of tax cuts for the rich and proposing instead to let people choose which tax deductions they wanted to take (for their home mortgages, for example) but limiting the amount that can be deducted. Perhaps understandably, the president didn’t know what to do with a Republican challenger who was outflanking him half the time on his left, and suddenly the race was competitive again. For both men, a pragmatic left-hand turn helped them steer their way toward a middle class desperate for hope. This should have come as no surprise. A majority of Americans still holds Bush accountable for the Great Recession, and with good reason. We are still breathing the fumes of his toxic brew of deregulation, massive transfers of wealth to the rich and a doubling of the national debt. His policies, and those of a Republican Congress that had its way with the economy for six years, were in fact the culmination of a right-wing ideological revolution led by Ronald Reagan, which changed the way Americans view their government. Mr. Reagan’s shadow continues to loom large, because Democrats have yet to make the case for a compelling alternative and have too often accepted the premises of the right. There are, of course, differences in how both sides view the role of government. But too often the consensus among the parties is that the solution to what ails us is deficit cutting and attacks on, or failure to support, the unions that gave us the weekend, 20th-century benefits and the eight-hour day. Both candidates have implicitly or explicitly blamed “public employees” with their “bloated pensions” and waste-filled jobs for our economic woes (with Mr. Obama sending a signal by freezing the pay of federal workers, as if tightening their belts would somehow loosen the noose around the Treasury). The term “public employees” itself evokes faceless bureaucrats, rather than images of firefighters and police officers, E.P.A. scientists monitoring our air and water to protect our children’s health, or the people who get up at the crack of dawn to pick up our trash. Both candidates have been as relentless in their attacks on teachers’ unions as Mr. Reagan was with the air traffic controllers whom he summarily fired for going on strike. Both parties have seen the austerity so many Americans are feeling at the kitchen table and concluded that the answer to austerity is more austerity — with “grand bargains” and “sequestrations” that promise to undo the effects of a stimulus that virtually all economists agree kept us from falling deeper toward a depression in early 2009. Austerity has been a failure almost everywhere governments have tried it, with Spain, where one in four working people is no longer working, being the most recent example. Both parties preach the gospel of free trade, which polls poorly because ordinary Americans can see with their own eyes how we have freely traded the good American wages and benefits away. SO what underlies this powerful pull to the right? Many factors, but two stand out. The first is campaign money. When Americans saw the scope of the savings and loan scandal in the 1980s, which today seems like just a bad day on the unregulated derivatives market, Ronald Reagan’s attorney general, Edwin Meese III, put nearly a thousand bankers behind bars. In contrast, Mr. Obama’s attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., can’t seem to smell the stench of a fraud that cost millions of people their jobs or homes. The second is an ideological vacuum. For years, even Republicans accepted the premises of the New Deal, which drew them leftward just as today’s political winds blow everything in their path rightward. President Dwight D. Eisenhower created the Interstate highway system. President Richard M. Nixon created the Environmental Protection Agency. Neither believed in the radical dismantling of programs that protected ordinary Americans, and both believed that a crucial role of government is to provide the infrastructure that makes economic prosperity possible. Then came the conservative movement that ushered in Reagan, whose ideology has dominated our political discourse ever since, even after its proven failure. If Nixon and Bill Clinton were the last gasps of Roosevelt’s breath, then Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama and perhaps Mr. Romney may well be the last gasps of Reagan’s. If the centrifugal pull of the 2012 election is likely to be to the right, is there any potential counterweight? Perhaps one: both presidential candidates want a legacy. The most important legacy Mr. Obama could have would be to spend his second term using executive orders, judicial appointments and the bully pulpit to return democracy to everyday Americans by demanding clean elections, uncorrupted by money. If Mr. Obama wins a close election on the strength of the country’s changing demographics, he may feel a special responsibility to tackle the seemingly intractable problems that a second-term president can more easily address. If Mr. Romney wins and wants a second term, he would be wise to wed an economic narrative about innovation with a narrative that will save his party from extinction by making comprehensive immigration reform a central item on his agenda. If Mr. Romney succeeds in reviving a moderate Republicanism that recognizes that an increasingly interconnected world will require an increasingly diverse work force, he could potentially drag his party into the 21st century. In other words, if the candidate who wins takes a left turn like the one that won him the presidency, the Reagan era would finally be over. We can only hope.

News article: An investigator and his dog search a wooded area Sunday, July 21, 2013 near where three bodies were recently found in East Cleveland, Ohio. Searchers rummaging through vacant houses in a neighborhood... (Associated Press)      Authorities who responded to a report of a foul odor and found the bodies of three women in a low-income U.S. neighborhood ended a daylong search without finding others. A registered sex offender was in custody.      East Cleveland Police Chief Ralph Spotts had warned searchers to be prepared to find one or two more victims Sunday, but he declined to elaborate.      The discovery was the Cleveland area's latest high-profile case of missing women. Earlier this year, three women in an unrelated case were found and freed after being held captive in a home for years.      Spotts identified the suspect as 35-year-old Michael Madison and said he was expected to be formally charged Monday.      Mayor Gary Norton said the suspect indicated he might have been influenced by Cleveland serial killer Anthony Sowell, who was convicted in 2011 of murdering 11 women and sentenced to death. Sowell was arrested after a woman escaped from his house and said she had been raped. Police found the 11 women's mostly nude bodies in garbage bags and plastic sheets throughout the home.      In this latest case, one body was found Friday in a garage. Two others were found Saturday _ one in a backyard and the other in the basement of a vacant house. The three female bodies, all wrapped in plastic bags, were found about 200 yards (182 meters) apart, and authorities believed the victims were killed in the last six to 10 days.      Spotts said the suspect's comments hadn't provided clarity on whether more bodies might be found.      \\"He really hasn't stated that there's any more, but he hasn't said anything that would make us think that there's not,\\" Spotts said.      Sunday's search included 40 abandoned houses. Authorities want to be thorough, the mayor said.      \\"Hopefully, we pray to God, this is it,\\" he said.      The bodies were each in the fetal position, wrapped in several layers of trash bags, Norton said.      Cuyahoga County medical examiner Dr. Thomas P. Gilson said the bodies were in advanced stages of decomposition and that it would take several days to identify them and how they died.      It wasn't immediately clear whether Madison had an attorney. No one commented at the address he registered.      Madison was classified as a sex offender in 2002 when he was sentenced to four years in prison for attempted rape, according to Cuyahoga County court records. He had previous convictions in 2000 and 2001 for drug-related charges.      One neighbor, Nathenia Crosby, said she was familiar with the suspect and had seen him walking through the neighborhood. She said she had told him to stop chatting with her 19-year-old daughter.      \\"When I found out how old he was, I said, \`You need to move on, she's too young,'\\" Crosby said.      ___      Associated Press writer Peggy Harris in Philadelphia contributed to this report. ||||| EAST CLEVELAND, Ohio -- For the second time in three months and the third time in four years, evidence of haunting crimes against women sprouted in one of Greater Cleveland’s inner-city neighborhoods.      Police here Sunday ended a weekend-long search for bodies near East 139th Street and Shaw Avenue, finding no victims besides the three discovered Friday and Saturday.      It was a scene familiar for its landscape of abandoned homes, overgrown weeds and television cameras. The world was watching, as it did in May, when three young women were rescued from a Cleveland home after being missing for nearly a decade.      Sunday’s scene, where three dead women were found wrapped in plastic bags, also brought reminders of Anthony Sowell, a serial killer from Cleveland’s recent past.      Michael Madison was arrested and is expected to be charged today in connection with the deaths. He indicated he was influenced by Sowell, captured in 2009 after killing 11 women and burying them in and around his Imperial Avenue home, said East Cleveland Mayor Gary Norton.      Sowell, who is on death row, was a registered sex offender at the time of his crimes.      Madison, 35, registered as a sex offender with the Cuyahoga County sheriff after a four-year prison sentence for a 2002 attempted rape conviction. He had pleaded guilty and was given the least serious offender status, which requires yearly registration for 10 years.      Madison “said some things in questioning that led us to believe he was influenced by Sowell,” Norton told The Plain Dealer. But Police Chief Ralph Spotts disputed Norton’s account and said Madison never talked admiringly of Sowell.      “He’s not being cooperative,” Spotts said of Madison. “He’s not saying there aren’t any more bodies, but he’s not saying there are. He’s playing both sides of the fence.”      None of the women, who Norton said were black, has been identified. Spotts said he hopes at least one body is identified today.      All three were in advanced states of decomposition, said county Medical Examiner Thomas Gilson.      Authorities believe the women had been killed within the last 10 days.      The first body was found in a garage Friday morning near the corner of Hayden Avenue and East 139th Street. The other two bodies were found Saturday afternoon, one in heavy weeds about 150 feet from the garage, the other near a broken window inside the basement of a vacant home on East 139th Street.      Dozens of law enforcement officials from East Cleveland and other agencies — the FBI, Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation and Cuyahoga County Sheriff’s Office — returned to the neighborhood Sunday. They spent the afternoon combing an area of vacant homes, overgrown lots, railroad tracks — even bushes and brush behind the Martin Luther King Jr. Civic Center.      Crews worked north from Strathmore Avenue to Elm Avenue and east from Hayden to Manhattan Avenue. Cues from cadaver dogs raised the possibility of more bodies.      At one point in the afternoon it appeared at least one other body had been discovered. Officers had pulled out evidence bags and raised a tarp to block onlookers behind an occupied house at 1374 E. 139th St.      But Spotts called off the search about 7 p.m.      “We officially found nothing,” he said. “We will not pick up the search again.”      Spotts also said officials do not expect to find bodies outside the search area.      “We don’t think he took anything he couldn’t carry,” Spotts said.      Madison was arrested Friday night after a two-hour standoff at his mother’s Cleveland home. Residents of the East Cleveland neighborhood police searched told reporters that Madison hung out at an apartment near the garage where the one body was discovered. He often walked the neighborhood and talked to women aggressively, they said.      Eric Wilson, 40, said he’s known Madison since their days at Euclid High School, where Wilson was four years ahead of Madison. Wilson said he saw Madison frequently in the area where the bodies were found. Several weeks ago Madison appeared in the neighborhood with scratches all over him, Wilson said. He told people he had gotten into a fight with a woman.      “He was kind of quiet,” Wilson said. “He never created a conversation. But if you talked to him too long he’d say some kind of demented things.”      When pressed for an example, Wilson said: “He hated women.”      The weekend discoveries made international news, with organizations such as CNN and the BBC devoting attention to the case. The same organizations poured into Cleveland in May when Amanda Berry, Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight escaped a Seymour Avenue home where authorities said they had been held captive for roughly a decade.      Ariel Castro, 52, faces 977 criminal counts in that case, including charges of kidnapping, rape and two counts of aggravated murder related to claims that he beat and tortured one of the women into miscarrying a child.      Prosecutors have accused Castro of kidnapping the women and raping them repeatedly in his home, where he sometimes kept them chained or tied. The first of the victims was kidnapped in 2002.      A lawyer for Castro has said some of the charges against his client cannot be refuted and that if the death penalty is not sought, a plea deal could be worked out.      Sowell was convicted in 2011 of killing Tonia Carmichael, Nancy Cobbs, Tishana Culver, Crystal Dozier, Telacia Fortson, Amy Hunter, Leshanda Long, Michelle Mason, Kim Y. Smith, Diane Turner and Janice Webb. Prosecutors said he lured his victims to his Imperial Avenue home, where he bound, strangled and discarded them.      Sowell was convicted of multiple counts of aggravated murder and a slate of other offenses for their deaths. He also was found guilty of attempting to kill three other women. A judge sentenced him to death, based on a jury's recommendation. |||||             EAST CLEVELAND, Ohio -- Law enforcement officials here have ended their search for more bodies in a neighborhood where three others have been found since Friday.      After hours of work involving dozens of officers and dozens of buildings, Police Chief Ralph Spotts told reporters about 7 p.m. Sunday that crews were done for the time being.      \\"We officially found nothing,\\" Spotts said.      Authorities had been searching the area near East 139th Street and Hayden and Shaw avenues since Saturday, after the bodies of two dead women were found close to where a third women's body was found Friday. Cadaver dogs brought to the scene Sunday signaled the possibility of more bodies.      At one point in the afternoon it appeared another body had been discovered. Officers had pulled out evidence bags and raised a tarp to block onlookers behind an occupied house at 1374 E. 139th St.      A suspect, arrested Friday, hung out at an apartment near the garage and often walked the neighborhood and talked to women, residents said.      Michael Madison, 35, of Cleveland, was arrested Friday night after a two-hour standoff at his mother's home on Chickasaw Avenue. Spotts said charges against Madison are likely Monday. A news conference is scheduled for 11 a.m.            Spotts also said Sunday evening that Madison is not being cooperative. The chief did not believe crews would search beyond for bodies beyond the Hayden and Shaw area.      “We don’t think he took anything he couldn’t carry,\\" said Spotts, meaning that police believe it's unlikely there would be bodies far from the scene.      The three women have not been identified.      The Cuyahoga County Medical Examiner's Office said Sunday that the bodies are in advanced stages of decomposition, so determining identities and cause of death may take several days.      \\"We are not currently requesting families of missing persons to submit DNA specimens as part the identification process, but we will advise the public should this step become necessary,\\" Medical Examiner Thomas Gilson said in a news release.      Sunday's search focused on weeded lots, railroad tracks and 50 or more abandoned homes in the area was winding down today. About 30 residents and police fanned out at noon, hoping to find nothing.      The three dead women found Friday and Saturday were wrapped in multiple plastic bags.      Spotts said earlier Sunday that police have received many calls from people missing family members, but the three dead women have yet to be identified.             ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Authorities in East Cleveland, Ohio, have ended their search for more bodies in a neighborhood where three female bodies were found since Friday.

Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. Ben studied more about magnesium, zinc and molybdenum, while his buddy Andy studied about sodium and potassium.  Hint: Sodium and potassium are two of the most important elements in living things. They are present mainly as positively charged ions dissolved in water. The sodium-potassium pump moves sodium ions (Na + ) out of the cell and potassium ions (K + ) into the cell. In both cases, the ions are moving from an area of lower to higher concentration. Energy in ATP is needed for this \\"uphill\\" process. Figure below shows how this pump works. Trace these steps from left to right in the figure Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, both Ben and Andy studied minerals and micro-nutrients. However, Andy studied about sodium and potassium, elements that are directly related to the sodium-potassium pump, which in turn is connected to the energy in ATP. Since Ben studied about magnesium, zinc, and molybdenum, which are not mentioned as being related to energy in ATP, we can conclude that Ben studied less about Energy in ATP than Andy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They were introduced by gallery owner John Dunbar. Lennon was intrigued by Ono's \\"Hammer A Nail\\": patrons hammered a nail into a wooden board, creating the art piece. Although the exhibition had not yet begun, Lennon wanted to hammer a nail into the clean board, but Ono stopped him. Dunbar asked her, \\"Don't you know who this is? He's a millionaire! He might buy it.\\" Ono had supposedly not heard of the Beatles, but relented on condition that Lennon pay her five shillings, to which Lennon replied, \\"I'll give you an imaginary five shillings and hammer an imaginary nail in.\\" Ono subsequently related that Lennon had taken a bite out of the apple on display in her work Apple, much to her fury.Ono began to telephone and visit Lennon at his home. When Cynthia asked him for an explanation, Lennon explained that Ono was only trying to obtain money for her \\"avant-garde bullshit\\". While his wife was on holiday in Greece in May 1968, Lennon invited Ono to visit. They spent the night recording what would become the Two Virgins album, after which, he said, they \\"made love at dawn\\". When Lennon's wife returned home she found Ono wearing her bathrobe and drinking tea with Lennon who simply said, \\"Oh, hi.\\" Ono became pregnant in 1968 and miscarried a male child on 21 November 1968, a few weeks after Lennon's divorce from Cynthia was granted.Two years before the Beatles disbanded, Lennon and Ono began public protests against the Vietnam War. They were married in Gibraltar on 20 March 1969, and spent their honeymoon at the Hilton Amsterdam, campaigning with a week-long Bed-In for Peace. They planned another Bed-In in the United States but were denied entry, so they held one instead at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, where they recorded \\"Give Peace a Chance\\". They often combined advocacy with performance art, as in their \\"Bagism\\", first introduced during a Vienna press conference. Lennon..., what would be the answer ?

Afraid for his life, he frequently tries to enlist in martial arts classes at a local dojo, only to have his applications mysteriously (read: deliberately) vanish. To further matters, the local minister turns the sermon at an Easter mass from the passion and resurrection of Christ to matters of Sodom and Gomorrah at the very sight of McClain and his mother entering the church to join in the ceremony. In the dojo's defense, they turn young McClain away not directly because of his sexual orientation, but because they fear losing their students over the matter. In fact, the family that runs the dojo has had some acceptance issues of their own to deal with, not just because of being Asian, but actually because of being multi-ethnic, with Irish, Asian, and even Filipino members and relatives. They're also of mixed faiths, with the grandparents devout Buddhists and one of their sons a Christian actively involved with the local church. The family has a very proud tradition of teaching the martial arts throughout the generations, a tradition that sadly is not open to the women of the family, as we learn when we are introduced to Karen O'Neil (played by the film's director D.

Q:Given the below context:  Temperley writes: \\"After 1855 [Bennett] was spurred by belated honours, and occasional commissions, to compose a respectable number of significant and substantial works, though it was too late to recapture his early self-confidence.\\" Works from his later years included the cello Sonata Duo for Piatti; a pastoral cantata, The May Queen, Op. 39, for the opening of the Leeds Town Hall in 1858; an Ode (Op. 40) with words by Alfred, Lord Tennyson for the opening of the 1862 International Exhibition in London; an Installation Ode for Cambridge University (Op. 41) with words by Charles Kingsley, which included a lament for the late Prince Albert; a symphony in G minor (Op. 43); a sacred cantata,The Woman of Samaria for the Birmingham Triennial Music Festival of 1867; and finally a second Piano Sonata (The Maid of Orleans, Op. 46). Many of these works were composed during his summer holidays which were spent at Eastbourne. The Ode for the Exhibition was the cause of a further imbroglio with Costa, who although in charge of music for the Exhibition refused to conduct anything by Bennett. Eventually it was conducted by Prosper Sainton, between works by Meyerbeer and Daniel Auber also commissioned for the occasion. The affair leaked into the press, and Costa was widely condemned for his behaviour.In March 1856 Bennett, while still teaching at the RAM and Queen's College, was elected Professor of Music at the University of Cambridge. He modernised the system of awarding music degrees, instituting viva voce examinations and requiring candidates for doctorates to first take the degree of Bachelor of Music. Two years later on 8 June 1868 the newly formed (later Royal) College of Organists awarded him an Honorary Fellowship.In 1858 came yet another clash involving Costa, when the autocratic Earl of Westmorland, the original founder of the RAM, saw fit to arrange a subscription concert for the Academy to include a Mass of his own composition, to be conducted by Costa and using the orchestra and singers of the Opera, over the...

The distinctions are primarily concerning their method of approval.

The panel concluded that chemical weapons have been used \\"against civilians, including children, on a relatively large scale.\\" The inspectors were only tasked with determining whether chemical weapons had been fired, not who fired them, the AP explains; though CNN reports that the report will cover \\"signs of culpability.\\" Earlier today, a separate UN commission said it was investigating reports of 14 chemical attacks, but that it had already determined that both sides had committed war crimes, with or without chemicals. The Assad regime has committed both war crimes and crimes against humanity, the commission determined. The rebels hadn't committed crimes against humanity only \\"because there is not a clear chain of command.\\" The reports follow Syria's admission that it has chemical weapons, as part of a deal to disarm. Some recent fallout of that deal: The Assad government called the disarmament deal a \\"victory,\\" and the rebels seem to agree, the New York Times reports. They expect Assad to break his word, and to step up his conventional weapons offensives. Indeed, the violence escalated appreciably last week, the Washington Post points out, with some towns facing their first airstrikes in weeks, and more than 1,000 killed. Now that the threat from the US has evaporated, \\"the regime has regrouped and is back on the offensive with a vengeance,\\" one expert on the region says. Some rebels said arms shipments from foreign backers had increased, but complained that they were light weapons, and speculated that their backers only want to see the war drag on. \\"We won't get advanced weapons,\\" a spokesman for a brigade in Aleppo says, \\"Because that would mean we would achieve victories.\\" Article:","output":"Once upon a time, some really smart people called UN weapons inspectors found important clues.

They found that both sides in a big disagreement had done bad things called war crimes. The people in charge of the Assad regime had also done something called crimes against humanity. The other side, the rebels, didn't do this, but only because their leaders are harder to figure out. All of this happened after Syria said they have chemical weapons and agreed to stop using them.

Later, a journalist named Alan Foster (Anthony Franciosa) visits Poe to drive him out of madness, but he is forced to challenge the horror writer on the authenticity of his stories. This leads to Foster's accepting a bet from Lord Blackwood to spend the night in a haunted castle on All Soul's Eve. Foster is surprised by ghosts who appear to be half-humans, in very effective and horrifying special effects. Ghosts of the murdered inhabitants appear to him throughout the night, re-enacting the events that led to their respective deaths and driving Foster to madness. He meets the following ghosts: Elisabeth Blackwood (MichÃ¨le Mercier) who falls in love with Foster; the annoying and easy-to-hate Julia (Karin Field); the rough criminal William Perkins (Silvano Tranquilli); and the most despicable one of all, Dr. Carmus (Peter Carsten). Near the end of the film, the ghosts reveal their true nature: they aren't actually ghosts but vampires with ghostly powers, and they need Foster's blood in order to maintain their existence. Because she loves him, Elisabeth tries to save Foster by aiding his escape. He succeeds in escaping the castle, but not the garden... Distracted and careless, he pushes the door so hard that he is smashed between the two gates and is sliced to death by razors on the main gate. But at least he isn't transformed into a vampire. Answer:","output":"What supernatural creatures are the ghosts revealed to be in the film, who need Foster's blood to maintain their existence?"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Question: \\"What is the modern-day name for the fuel Marco Polo found when he reached the capital of China?\\" Response: \\"Black stones\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Last month, President Barack Obama boosted the minimum pay for federal contractors hired in the future to 10.10 per hour.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was in ever-present danger of relapse on drugs? ?  Kiedis was lyrically influenced by love, his girlfriend, and the emotions expressed when one fell in love. Songs written for the album such as \\"By the Way,\\" \\"I Could Die for You,\\" \\"Dosed,\\" \\"Warm Tape\\" and non-album tracks \\"Someone\\" and \\"Body of Water\\" all digressed into the many sides of love. Drugs also played an integral part in Kiedis' writings, as he'd only been sober since December 2000. Tracks like \\"This Is the Place\\" and \\"Don't Forget Me\\" expressed his intense relationship with narcotics, the harmful physical and emotional effects they caused him and the ever-present danger of relapse (as Kiedis has suffered chronic relapse into drug-dependency). He referenced early Chili Peppers guitarist Hillel Slovak in \\"This Is the Place\\" and describes how drug use forced him to miss the funeral: \\"On the day my best friend died/I could not get my copper clean.\\" \\"Venice Queen\\" was composed lyrically as an ode to Kiedis' drug rehabilitation therapist, Gloria Scott, who died shortly after he purchased her a home on California's Venice Beach. It mourned her death as a painful loss: \\"We all want to tell her/Tell her that we love her/Venice gets a queen/Best I've ever seen.\\" By the Way diverged from the band's previous styles, containing few funk-driven songs. \\"Can't Stop\\" and the title track were the only songs which revisited the Chili Peppers' once trademark style of short, rapped verses. \\"Throw Away Your Television,\\" while not having any rapidly sung lyrics, also contained a funk-oriented bass line, though hinted at experimental rock due to the heavy use of distortion throughout the verse and chorus.

You need sports tape to tape your foot using this method. You can get rolls of sports tape at superstores, supermarkets, or drugstores.","output":"Step 1: Clean and dry your foot Before taping, make sure your foot is clean and dry. This will ensure that the tape adheres properly and stays in place during movement. Remove any dirt, oil, or sweat by washing your foot and then thoroughly drying it with a clean towel. Step 2: Cut strips of sports tape Depending on the size of your foot, cut four to five strips of sports tape about 10-12 inches long. This should be enough for taping your foot for plantar fasciitis. Step 3: Apply anchor strips Sit down and position your foot so that the sole is facing up. Apply a strip of sports tape horizontally across the ball of your foot (just below your toes), making sure not to pull the tape too tight. This is the anchor strip, which will hold all your other tape strips in place. Make sure that the tape adheres well to your skin by pressing it down and smoothing out any wrinkles or air bubbles. Step 4: Apply support strips Starting from the anchor strip, apply a support strip diagonally across the bottom of your foot, pulling it up and around your heel, and then overlapping the anchor strip on the other side of your foot. Make sure to keep the tape taut, but avoid applying too much tension. You want the tape to provide support without restricting blood flow or movement. Repeat this process with two or three more strips, applying each strip in a crisscross pattern to provide maximum support. Step 5: Apply top anchor strip To secure the support strips in place, apply another horizontal strip across the top of your foot, just below your ankle. This will act as the top anchor, holding the support strips in place and providing additional stability. Again, don't pull the tape too tight – you want to be able to move your foot comfortably. Step 6: Smooth out the tape and test for comfort Smooth out any wrinkles or air bubbles in the tape to ensure it is securely adhered to your skin. Then, gently flex and move your foot to test the tape for comfort and effectiveness. Step 7: Adjust if necessary If the tape feels too tight or uncomfortable, carefully peel it off and reapply it with less tension or using fewer support strips. The goal is to provide support and alleviate pain, so it's essential to feel comfortable with the tape. Step 8: Wear supportive footwear While taping is helpful in providing support and relieving pain, it is also important to wear supportive footwear when walking or exercising to help prevent further injury to your plantar fascia. Shoes with proper arch support or orthotic insoles designed for plantar fasciitis can be beneficial. By following these steps, you'll successfully tape your foot for plantar fasciitis and potentially experience relief from pain and discomfort associated with this condition. Remember to check the tape periodically and replace it as needed, especially after activities that cause sweating or if it becomes loose."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since his death, Thomson's work has grown in value and popularity. Group of Seven member Arthur Lismer wrote that he \\"is the manifestation of the Canadian character\\". Another contemporaneous Canadian painter, David Milne, wrote to National Gallery of Canada Director H. O. McCurry in 1930, \\"Your Canadian art apparently, for now at least, went down in Canoe Lake. Tom Thomson still stands as the Canadian painter, harsh, brilliant, brittle, uncouth, not only most Canadian but most creative.

Few major canvases remain in private collections, making the record unlikely to be broken. One example of the demand his work has achieved is the previously lost Sketch for Lake in Algonquin Park. Discovered in an Edmonton basement in 2018, it sold for nearly half a million dollars at a Toronto auction. The increased value of his work has led to the discovery of numerous forgeries on the market.In 1967, the Tom Thomson Art Gallery opened in Owen Sound. In 1968, Thomson's shack from behind the Studio Building was moved to the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg. Many of his works are also on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. His influence can be seen in the work of later Canadian artists, including Joyce Wieland. In 2004, another historical marker honouring Thomson was moved from its previous location near the centre of Leith to the graveyard in which he is now buried. The grave site has become popular spot for visitors to the area with many fans of his work leaving pennies or art supplies behind as tribute.","output":"The last name of the person whose works are on display at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario is Thomson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"difficulty understanding the owner's project performance expectations.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"a hard time comprehending what the owner wants\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"difficulty understanding the owner's project performance expectations,\\" it is accurate to assume that the hypothesis \\"a hard time comprehending what the owner wants\\" is indeed true. The premise and the hypothesis are aligned in describing the situation where someone struggles to understand the project owner's desired outcomes and expectations. In order to delve further into this, let's examine each segment of the hypothesis and correlate it with the given premise. 1. \\"A hard time\\" - This directly connects to the term \\"difficulty\\" used in the premise and signifies that the person is facing challenges in grasping the expectations. 2. \\"Comprehending\\" - This word echoes \\"understanding\\" in the premise and denotes the mental process of grasping or assimilating information. 3. \\"What the owner wants\\" - This key phrase ties back to \\"the owner's project performance expectations\\" from the premise. Both expressions suggest that the challenge experienced by the individual revolves around understanding the desired outcomes or goals set forth by the owner of the project. From this detailed analysis, it is evident that the hypothesis \\"a hard time comprehending what the owner wants\\" is true based on the provided premise. The hypothesis essentially rephrases the premise in a slightly different, yet equally valid way. Having established the link between the premise and the hypothesis, it is essential to consider how this comprehension issue could impact the overall project. If team members or project managers have difficulty fully understanding the performance expectations, it can lead to misalignment in project objectives and deliverables, delayed timelines, and possibly unsatisfactory outcomes for the project owner. It is crucial for effective communication, goal setting, and monitoring to be in place to ensure everyone involved in the project is on the same page and works towards a common objective that meets the owner's expectations. This can be facilitated by using detailed project scopes, regular meetings, and various communication channels tailored to the project's needs and the owner's preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"The government hopes to significantly alleviate the tax burden and increase foreign investment. This sentence in Turkish conveys that the government is planning to take measures to reduce the tax burden on its citizens, businesses, and other entities in a significant way. The primary goal of this action is to attract more foreign investment into the country by creating a more favorable economic environment for investors. By reducing the tax burden, the government aims to make the country more competitive on the global stage and encourage foreign companies to invest, expand, or even relocate their operations. Foreign investment is a key driver of economic growth, as it provides an inflow of capital, new technologies, and business practices, as well as promoting competitiveness and creating jobs. Providing a more attractive tax environment can incentivize investors to choose a country over others and bring positive economic impacts. There can be various ways for the government to alleviate the tax burden, such as lowering the corporate tax rates, providing tax exemptions or tax holidays for specific industries or investment projects, and simplifying the tax system for easier compliance. Additionally, the government may introduce other policies to support and complement these tax measures, such as improving the regulatory environment, investing in infrastructure, and ensuring a stable political landscape. While these measures can foster a more investment-friendly climate and contribute to the country's economic growth, there can also be potential drawbacks. Reduced tax revenues may limit the government's capacity to fund public services and social programs, and increased foreign investment can lead to concerns about preserving national interests. Therefore, striking a balance between attracting foreign investment and maintaining adequate public resources is essential for implementing such policies effectively. In summary, the government's plan to significantly alleviate the tax burden as expressed in the Turkish sentence aims to attract more foreign investment, ultimately contributing to the country's economic growth and development. However, it is crucial to consider potential drawbacks and maintain a balanced approach when implementing these measures."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 45*p - 1703 = -15*p - 83 for p.","output":"To solve the equation 45 * p - 1703 = -15 * p - 83 for p, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Add 15 * p to both sides of the equation. This will isolate the variable p on one side of the equation and all constants on the other side.  45 * p - 1703 + 15 * p = -15 * p - 83 + 15 * p Simplifying both sides of the equation: (45 * p + 15 * p) - 1703 = -83 Step 2: Combine the p terms on the left side. Sum the coefficients of p terms: 45p + 15p = 60p So the equation becomes: 60 * p - 1703 = -83 Step 3: Add 1703 to both sides of the equation. This will move the constant term to the other side of the equation and leave only the term with the variable on the left side. 60 * p - 1703 + 1703 = -83 + 1703 Simplifying both sides of the equation: 60 * p = 1620 Step 4: Divide both sides of the equation by 60. This will isolate the variable p on the left side. (60 * p) / 60 = 1620 / 60 Simplifying both sides of the equation: p = 27 So the solution for the equation 45 * p - 1703 = -15 * p - 83 is p = 27."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

We have this equation: 0 = 45*k + 65 - 181 - 109 First, let's deal with the numbers. We need to combine them. So, let's add 65, then subtract 181, and finally subtract 109. Here's what we get: 65 - 181 = -116 Now, -116 - 109 = -225 Now our equation looks like this: 0 = 45*k - 225 We need to solve for k, which means we want to find the value of k that makes the equation true. Let's add 225 to both sides of the equation to get rid of the -225: 0 + 225 = 45*k - 225 + 225 This simplifies to: 225 = 45*k Now, we just have to divide both sides of the equation by 45 to find the value of k: 225 / 45 = 45*k / 45 Which simplifies to: 5 = k And there you have it!

This is because the majority of those sales in 1954–55 were to the \\"hillbilly\\" market in the South and Southwestern United States, where replacing the family 78 rpm player with a new 45 rpm player was a luxury few could afford at the time. By the end of 1957, RCA Victor announced that 78s accounted for less than 10% of Presley's singles sales, essentially announcing the death throes of the 78 rpm format. The last Presley single released on 78 in the United States was RCA Victor 20-7410, I Got Stung/One Night (1958), while the last 78 in the UK was RCA 1194, A Mess Of Blues/Girl Of My Best Friend (1960).\\". Can you tell me what it is?","output":"Certainly! The passage you provided primarily discusses the transition from 78 rpm records to 45 rpm records in the mid-1950s, using Elvis Presley's early singles as an example. However, it does not explicitly mention the media platforms on which music could be found. In a broader context, music can be found on various media platforms depending on the era and technological advancements. Here is a comprehensive list of the main media platforms for music: 1. Vinyl Records (1948 - present): Music was first produced on vinyl records available in different formats, including 78 rpm (mentioned in your passage), 45 rpm (singles), and 33⅓ rpm (albums). 2. Reel-to-Reel Tapes (1940s - 1980s): These magnetic tapes were used by professionals and audiophiles before being phased out in favor of cassette tapes and other formats. 3. 8-Track Tapes (1960s - 1980s): A popular car audio format, 8-track tapes allowed users to switch between tracks quickly, although they faced limitations in sound quality and durability. 4. Cassette Tapes (1960s - 1990s): Cassettes were a portable and affordable medium for music consumption, contributing to the rise of the mixtape culture in the 1980s and 1990s. 5. Compact Discs (CDs) (1982 - present): CDs offered a digital format with better sound quality and durability than previous formats but became less popular due to the rise of digital downloads. 6. Digital Downloads (late 1990s - present): With the launch of platforms like iTunes and Napster, consumers could purchase and download individual songs or entire albums, paving the way for digital music consumption. 7. Streaming Services (mid-2000s - present): Online platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube provide access to vast music libraries and playlists through monthly subscriptions or free ad-supported options. In summary, although the passage you referenced focuses on 78 rpm and 45 rpm records, music can be found on a variety of media platforms, including vinyl records, reel-to-reel tapes, 8-track tapes, cassette tapes, compact discs, digital downloads, and streaming services, depending on the era and available technology."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Look for emotional cues or adjectives describing the food The reviewer uses several adjectives and phrases to describe their experience: - \\"Options are few\\": This might seem like a negative point, as it indicates limited choices. - \\"the food is delicious\\": This is a clear indication of a positive sentiment, as \\"delicious\\" is a word usually used to express enjoyment of food. - \\"The gf cheese ravioli was good times\\": The use of \\"good times\\" signifies positive enjoyment and denotes a positive sentiment. - \\"The trio of cupcakes was also very good\\": The phrase \\"very good\\" indicates satisfaction with the cupcakes, reinforcing the positive sentiment. Step 3: Weigh the intensity of positive and negative cues - The phrase \\"Options are few\\" does not carry as much weight as the other positive adjectives and phrases used in the review. Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment Based on the analysis, the overall sentiment of this review is predominantly positive. The language used in the review indicates that the reviewer enjoyed the food and had a satisfactory experience, despite the limited options available."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: One of the strongest hip-hop albums ever... Review: As with many people here, my original 3rd Bass cassette got some definite wear. While I was young when this album came out, I continued to listen to and appreciate it more and more as I got older and to this day, still listen to it at least once a week.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person who gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate?  While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". On 1 March 1951 Mao sent a cable to Stalin, in which he emphasized the difficulties faced by Chinese forces and the urgent need for air cover, especially over supply lines. Apparently impressed by the Chinese war effort, Stalin finally agreed to supply two air force divisions, three anti-aircraft divisions, and six thousand trucks. PVA troops in Korea continued to suffer severe logistical problems throughout the war. In late April Peng Dehuai sent his deputy, Hong Xuezhi, to brief Zhou Enlai in Beijing. What Chinese soldiers feared, Hong said, was not the enemy, but that they had nothing to eat, no bullets to shoot, and no trucks to transport them to the rear when they were wounded. Zhou attempted to respond to the PVA's logistical concerns by increasing Chinese production and improving methods of supply, but these efforts were never completely sufficient. At the same time, large-scale air defense training programs were carried out, and the Chinese Air Force began to participate in the war from September 1951 onward.

Q: David Gauntlett makes a good point in his newest book (Making Media Studies: The Creativity Turn in Media and Communications Studies) and that is that traditional forms of media studies are no longer applicable. Gone are the days of massive institutions and production companies, gone are the traditional audiences and simplistic texts. In, is the new age media companies, the everyday media makers, the consistent consumers and the fantastical mess of The WWW. While universities are pumping out the same content areas since the 1980’s (e.g. institutions, production, audiences and texts) that are only relevant to a handful of media forms (cinema, television, online broadcasting and publications), the rest of the world is moving on. David Gauntlett so rightly says that creativity in media, should also refer to thinking creatively about the subject. What are the new ways of running media and communication studies? How has the subject itself changed? What approaches and methods can help media and communications studies to become innovative and useful in spheres beyond itself? David Gauntlett encourages a kind of call to arms, an acquiescence of the incapacities of the old system and a redirected gaze to the future needs of media students and media studies programs. Inspired by Tim Ingold’s book Making, David believes media studies should have making at it’s front and centre. He also believes the ability to do things with media should be embraced over and above the ability to talk about what others do with media, or what media does to us. The notion is that media studies should be hands on, that it should be all about ideas and critical engagement and this should be expressed through actual making. To borrow three key distinctions from the anthropologist Tim Ingold: 1. It’s about learning WITH media rather than ABOUT media. 2. There is an intent to move FORWARD rather than looking BACKWARDS at how things are. 3. It’s aims are TRANSFORMATIONAL rather than DOCUMENTARY.

His data showed that in the beginning or twentieth century there were hardly any loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time period as time A. Further inquiry revealed that things didn't go well at the end of twentieth century - when there were severe loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time as time B.  But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Starting college can be a difficult experience. You have to deal with new responsibilities and growing independence, a challenging course load and, of course, the social scene. When a roommate is thrown into the mix, it may feel like you're struggling with all that stuff while living in a small box with a stranger. But having a roommate doesn't need to be one more thing to worry about. When students go into their living situations with realistic expectations and a willingness to compromise, things can work out just fine. When you first meet your roommate, chances are you'll be on your best behaviour. You want to get along, since this is the person who's going to be sharing your living space for the next year. But try to think ahead to potential   worst cases, too. For example, imagine it's 2 a.m. and you're working on a paper that should be finished in 8 hours. Your roommate comes in from a party and wants to continue the party in your room. At times like these, you won't be feeling good. That's why talking about problems that might come up ahead of time -- and respecting each other's wishes when the time comes -- is so important. Talk about the things that are really important to you, and make sure your roommate understands. Then encourage him or her to do the same. For example, does it make you angry when people take things without asking first? Let your roommate know your feelings about these types of things from the start, so that both of you have a feel for each other's likes, dislikes, and habits. Answer:","output":"Question: What is an essential aspect of successfully sharing a living space with a roommate in college? A. Ignoring each other's habits and preferences B.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is displeased by Mimi-Siku's arrival?  Michael Cromwell is a self-absorbed, successful commodities broker living in New York City. Wanting to marry his new fiancée Charlotte, he needs to obtain a final divorce from his first wife Patricia who left him some years earlier. Patricia now lives with a semi-Westernised tribe in Canaima National Park, Venezuela. Michael travels there to get her signature on divorce papers, but upon arriving, discovers that he has a 13-year-old son named Mimi-Siku. Michael attempts to bond with Mimi-Siku in his brief stay with the tribe and promises to take him to New York \\"when he is a man.\\" Michael is also given a new name, Baboon, as is a custom in the tribe. That night, Mimi-Siku undergoes the traditional rite of passage of his tribe, who then considers him to be a man. The tribal elder gives Mimi a special task: to become a tribal leader one day, Mimi must bring fire from the Statue of Liberty and he looks forward to traveling with his father. Against his own protests, Michael brings Mimi-Siku to New York with him. Michael works as a trader at the World Trade Center in building 7. Michael's fiancée, Charlotte, is less than pleased about the unexpected visitor in a loin cloth outfit, who tries to urinate in front of her at a fake tree (as is usual in his tribe), suggests eating her cat, and Maitika, his enormous pet tarantula escapes from his box and into her apartment. Mimi-Siku wears traditional dress during much of his stay in New York. As Michael attempts to adapt Mimi-Siku to city life, cross-cultural misunderstandings occur when Mimi-Siku reverts to customs considered acceptable by his tribe. On climbing the Statue of Liberty to reach the flame, Mimi-Siku is disappointed when he sees that the fire is not real. Answer:","output":"Charlotte, Michael Cromwell's fiancée, is displeased by Mimi-Siku's arrival in New York City. Michael, a successful commodities broker, brings his 13-year-old son Mimi-Siku to the city after discovering his existence during a trip to Canaima National Park, Venezuela. Mimi-Siku, who had been living with a semi-Westernized tribe with his mother Patricia, is not accustomed to the norms and conventions of urban American life. Several incidents contribute to Charlotte's displeasure with Mimi-Siku's presence. Firstly, due to a cultural misunderstanding, Mimi-Siku tries to urinate in front of her at a fake tree, as this is a common practice in his tribe. Additionally, he suggests eating Charlotte's pet cat and allows Maitika, his enormous pet tarantula, to escape from its box and enter her apartment. Moreover, Mimi-Siku's traditional dress and unfamiliarity with city life create further cross-cultural misunderstandings as he attempts to adapt to his new environment. For example, he is disappointed to discover that the fire in the Statue of Liberty is not real during an attempt to fulfill his tribal task of obtaining fire from the iconic monument. Overall, Charlotte's displeasure with Mimi-Siku's arrival stems from the unexpected nature of his presence, cultural differences, and the disruption he causes to her life with Michael. As Mimi-Siku's father, Michael is responsible for helping his son adapt to a new culture and lifestyle, which creates tension between him, Charlotte, and Mimi-Siku as they navigate this challenging situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnny Depp and Amber Heard have been forced to make a straight-faced apology video by the Australian government for breaching biosecurity laws in the country. The duo smuggled their dogs, Pistol and Boo, into the country in May. Heard faced court on Monday, where she was given a A1000 good behaviour bond, for her total disregard of Australian law.      The unbelievable video, which looks like the couple have been held hostage in North Korea, was played to court on Monday as Heard and Depp were in attendance. It was later released by their No. 1 enemy, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce, on his Facebook page.      \\"Australia is free of many pests and diseases that are commonplace around the world. That is why Australia has to have such strong biosecurity laws,” Heard said. \\"Australians are just as unique, both warm and direct. When you disrespect Australian law, they will tell you firmly,” Depp continued.

However the service was severely, SEVERELY lacking.  Positives: Like I said, food was good. Drinks were brought promptly, etc. etc.  Negatives: Our waitress. She said she was new, so maybe the blame should ultimately be placed on the management for lack of adequate training. First off, we had a table of 7 and she said for tables of 8 or more they don't do separate checks. So when we repeated that we only had 7 at our table, she still gave us attitude about having to split checks. I know it's a pain in the butt but no one in our party had cash.... Then she forgot a few of our drinks. They were brought promptly but when you forget a few, and also forget the waters we ordered and never come back to check on us again until you bring our food out, we may have a problem.

When we went to order our food, a guy we were with asked what came on his sandwich and she replied \\"well you can read can't you?\\" Um. Ok. Then our food came out. We ate it, liked it, and then sat there for about a half hour after we had all finished eating. We were upstairs and there was almost nobody else up there so I'm not sure why it took so long for her to come back and pick up our plates (or ask us if we wanted more drinks?) She finally came back and we asked for the checks, she brought them and we paid. And then sat there again for about a half hour. At this point we were all super frustrated. It took a bartender to realize how long we'd been sitting there and he finally came and took care of our checks. UGH.

The reviewer expresses a sense of disappointment and frustration with the service they experienced at the restaurant. They really wanted to give the place more than 2 stars, likely due to their previous positive experiences at the other locations and the good food they had at this particular visit. There are several factors contributing to the negative sentiment: 1. The service: The reviewer explicitly complains about the poor service they received, calling it \\"severely, SEVERELY lacking.\\" They mention the waitress's (who was new) shortcomings, including attitude while splitting checks, forgetting drinks, not checking on the table frequently enough, and leaving them waiting for a long time before clearing their table or processing their payment. 2. Management: The reviewer suggests that perhaps the blame should be placed on the management for not providing adequate training to the new waitress, which might have led to the subpar service. However, there are elements that convey positive aspects as well: 1. The food: The reviewer acknowledges that the food was quite good, which appears to be the primary reason they wish they could give the place more stars. 2. Prompt drinks: The drinks were brought promptly by the waitress, which is appreciated by the reviewer. 3. Gluten-free offerings: The reviewer appreciates the restaurant's catering to gluten-free customers, indicating that they would still consider the place for its food offerings. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review can be characterized as mixed with a tendency towards negative, largely due to the dissatisfaction with the service.

But by the time you finish this puzzle by Joel Fagliano and Byron Walden, you’ll be seeing them. I can almost guarantee it. And the most evil part of the joke in today’s puzzle is that the revealer is staring you right in the face the whole time. It just hits us MUGGLES late in the game, as Mr. Walden says below, because it uses the crossword convention of starring clues to trick the solver into complacency. Then it delivers a one-two punch when you realize that those starred clues are starred not just to call our attention to the theme. They’re there because they are part of the clues themself. This was one of the hardest Sunday puzzles I can remember doing, mostly because 1) Byron “I’ve Read Shelley’s ‘Epipsychidion,’ Haven’t You?” Walden is involved, and b) there is no obvious indication that you are supposed to mentally add the word “star” to the beginnings of each clue to get the answers. Well, there is, but it took me a while to get that. (It’s the asterisks, Deb.) I stumbled onto RIGHT SIDE at 38A through the crossings, but I couldn’t for the life of me figure out what the starred clue “Board” had to do with it. I knew something was up, because of the starred clue, but that was way before I understood what was happening. The way it’s supposed to be read is “[Star] Board,” which is, of course, the nautical RIGHT SIDE. Similarly, at 60A, we have “”[Star]Ted talks, say” for BROKERED A SETTLEMENT. Oh, and Mr. Fagliano’s and Mr. Walden’s clues are pretty tough, too. Although “Take its toll” made me laugh. Please wait here while I go bang my head on something hard. O.K., I’m back. You’ve got this, right? You understand that ROMEO AND JULIET are not literally a “Crossed pair,” right? Nicely done, Mr. Fagliano and Mr. Walden. Absolutely “Stellar Work.” Byron Walden: The idea for the puzzle was Joel’s. I was psyched when he asked me to collaborate on it, because I like puzzles that play with crossword conventions, and I am a big fan of Joel’s puzzles generally. For an easy puzzle, you want the structure of the theme to be evident right away. For a trickier puzzle, you want the revelation to come right at, or possibly just after the end. For this one, I envisioned the typical solver getting it somewhere in the middle, maybe just past halfway through. Too soon, and it becomes just a slightly odd themeless. Too late, and the joy of the joke gets washed away. Hopefully, we found the right mix. Joel Fagliano: Had a ton of fun putting this together with Byron. One thing we debated in the theme stage was whether a clue like “*Search party?” for ED MCMAHON was fair game — after all, it completely eliminates the quote marks used in the show “Star Search,” not to mention the space between “Star” and “Search.” In the end, we agreed it might be a little cheap, but that hopefully it would add an extra “aha” layer for the solver. We both favor wide-open grid patterns and constructing challenges, so our styles meshed pretty well when it came time to fill the grid. I’ve always felt that Byron is one of the best themeless constructors, so the task of working on a Sunday with him with big chunky corners like this was very cool. In the end, I think we kept the compromises to a relative minimum while working in some nice longer fill, but I’ll be interested to read how solvers felt. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Sunday crossword puzzle by Joel Fagliano and Byron Walden challenges solvers by using asterisks as part of the clues, requiring players to add the word \\"star\\" to the beginning of each clue to reveal the correct answers, resulting in a tough yet entertaining experience that plays with traditional crossword conventions. The constructors aimed to strike a balance between providing a tricky puzzle and maintaining the joy of solving by allowing the realization of the theme to emerge partway through the game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(B). positive.).","output":"Title: Timeless Horizon Rating: 1.5/5 stars In the world of cinema, Timeless Horizon was expected to deliver an experience that would be memorable, leaving audiences wanting more. Unfortunately, it failed to live up to those expectations and ultimately earned itself a negative sentiment. Despite featuring a star-studded cast, the film turned out to be a disappointing endeavor, and this review will be dissecting the aspects of the movie that left much to be desired. To begin with, the most stunning aspect is the lackluster plot that spectators had to endure. Timeless Horizon promised to deliver a thrilling adventure and emotional ride in a breathtaking world, while the plot ended up feeling like an unseasoned dish. The movie follows a group of astronauts, embarking on a journey to explore uncharted territories in search of a new habitable planet. Unlike other films in the genre, the storytelling fell short, leaving audiences disconnected from both the characters and the overall adventure. It seemed as though the plot was filled with countless subplots that only served to confuse, rather than enhance the narrative. Performance-wise, it is quite unbelievable that experienced and talented actors such as Emily Watson, Joseph Owens, and Richard Sparks were unable to save this sinking ship. Their performances were underwhelming, which can be attributed to a poorly-written script and weak character development. The dialogue was uninspiring and often felt forced, while the chemistry between the stellar cast was unexpectedly non-existent. This resulted in the characters coming across as one-dimensional and not at all relatable. The fact that none of the actors seemed to have a genuine connection with their respective characters became apparent throughout the movie. Moreover, Timeless Horizon is plagued with inconsistencies and plot holes. It feels like the filmmakers failed to pay attention to even the most basic details in the story. Scientific inaccuracies, unclear timelines, and unexplained character actions only serve to create more confusion and frustration for the viewers. Even in the realm of science fiction, a certain level of cohesion and plausibility is expected, but this film overlooks these essential elements. However, one aspect that could have redeemed this movie was its visuals. Yet, the special effects employed in Timeless Horizon were mediocre at best, and served as another source of disappointment. The CGI seemed rushed, unrealistic, and not in sync with the surroundings. Considering the genre and the film's potential to deeply explore the vast landscapes of space, greater emphasis on the visual elements could have significantly improved the cinematic experience. In conclusion, Timeless Horizon stands out as a perfect example of a wasted opportunity in the realm of science fiction and adventure. With a weak plot, poor character development, unconvincing performances, and sub-par visuals, the movie falls far short of reaching its purported epic status. It is a film that undeniably earns its negative sentiment and serves as a cautionary tale for future filmmakers delving into the exploration of the great beyond."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Buy Photo A shoplifting suspect fleeing from police caused a three-vehicle crash near Fountain Square that killed a woman and left two people in critical condition, Monday, June 8, 2015. (Photo: Kelly Wilkinson/The Star)Buy Photo      A theft suspect fleeing police ran a red light in Fountain Square and slammed his SUV into a pickup truck and car Monday morning, killing the 63-year-old woman driving the truck and seriously injuring two others.      Matthew Edmonds, 21, Indianapolis, is facing preliminary charges of resisting law enforcement, theft and driving while suspended with a prior conviction in the incident, which began shortly after 8 a.m. at the Walmart in Beech Grove and ended 12 minutes later at Prospect Street and State Avenue.      The crash killed Donna Niblock, 63, Indianapolis, who was pronounced dead at Eskenazi Hospital. Her 11-year-old grandson was listed in critical condition Monday at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health. LaDonna Rogers, 37, Indianapolis, another passenger in the pickup driven by Niblock, was listed in serious condition at Eskenazi Hospital.      The driver of the other car was not injured.      Details of the theft-in-progress report that prompted Edmonds to flee police were not available Monday.      Beech Grove police received the report at 8:07 a.m. A responding officer spotted the suspect's vehicle, a silver Chevy Tahoe, leaving the store parking lot and began to follow it north in the 4600 block of South Emerson Avenue.      The Beech Grove officer activated his emergency lights in an attempt to stop Edmonds but, instead of stopping, the vehicle sped off on Emerson. Beech Grove police briefly chased Edmonds — who was driving at a high rate of speed and briefly traveling west in the eastbound lanes of Raymond Street — before calling off the pursuit three minutes later because of safety concerns.      As police from Beech Grove chased Edmonds north on Emerson, then west on Raymond, the pursuit moved into the jurisdiction of the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. A statement from IMPD said department officers, who share the same police radio frequency as Beech Grove officers, \\"were already aware of the initial theft run at the Walmart and subsequent pursuit headed towards Southeast District.\\"      At 8:14 a.m., Beech Grove officials called off the pursuit as Edmond's SUV turned north on Perkins Avenue. At that point, IMPD officers also were instructed by a supervisor not to chase the SUV because of safety concerns.      \\"At this point due to children getting onto a school bus on Perkins Avenue, an IMPD supervisor made the determination for IMPD officers to also terminate the vehicle pursuit,\\" the IMPD statement said.      Edmonds briefly evaded police after the pursuit was halted, but an IMPD officer on Pleasant Run Parkway soon spotted the SUV. The IMPD officer followed the SUV and provided radio updates to other officers in the area but did not have his siren on and was not traveling at a high rate of speed, said Lt. Richard Riddle, an IMPD spokesman.      Riddle said that it appears Edmonds saw the IMPD vehicle as he drove north on State \\"and actually sped up through this intersection\\" of Prospect and State, where he slammed into the pickup truck traveling west on Prospect. His SUV then careened into a sedan stopped at the intersection for a red light.      After the collision, Riddle said, Edmonds got out and tried to flee on foot. He was quickly arrested by officers in the area.      Edmonds, who listed a Gary address in recent police and court records, previously appeared in court in Marion County on several misdemeanor charges, including battery, criminal mischief and theft.      He pleaded guilty in 2013 to a theft charge and was sentenced to probation. Last July, Edmonds was arrested on charges that included criminal mischief and battery resulting in bodily injury. Edmonds agreed to a guilty plea on the criminal mischief charge, while the battery charge was dismissed. He was sentenced to a day in jail and was put on probation. A no contact order also was filed against him in connection with the case.      Gilbert Torres said he didn't see the crash Monday, but he heard the crunching metal as the vehicles collided in the intersection. After police arrived, Torres was among the dozens of community members who walked to the crash site to see what happened.      \\"I was just a few doors down on Prospect, so we heard the loud boom and all the craziness,\\" Torres said. \\"I just can't believe it. And they said he was shoplifting? This isn't worth that. For a little kid to get hurt over shoplifting, that's crazy, man.\\"      Pam Shireman had seen Edmonds fleeing police as she waited at a bus stop.      \\"I was standing there waiting for the bus (on Emerson), and all of a sudden I seen that silver Tahoe in the wrong lane, driving like 100 miles per hour into oncoming traffic,\\" she said. \\"Me and the bus driver was praying that he didn't hit anybody head-on. Then we get up here on the bus and see ... it's sad. It's just horrible.\\"      Even though police had called off the pursuit, \\"the psychology has already been put in motion\\" in the suspect's mind, said Ellen Deitz Tucker, spokeswoman for PursuitSafety, a national nonprofit working to reduce pursuit deaths and promote law enforcement alternatives to chasing nonviolent suspects.      At least one person dies, on average, every day in the United States in police pursuits, according to data from PursuitSafety. Innocent bystanders such as Niblock account for an average of three deaths a week, and one law enforcement officer dies on average every six weeks, Tucker said.      Many of those deaths occur after police have suspended chases, she said.      Star reporter Jill Disis contributed to this story.      Call Star reporter Justin L. Mack at (317) 444-6138.

(Kelly Wilkinson / The Star)      When IMPD is involved in pursuits      Indianapolis police officers have wide discretion to initiate pursuits in cases ranging from those involving felons to traffic infractions.      Although officers do not need permission to initiate a pursuit, a supervisor determines how long a pursuit should continue and when it should be terminated.      Before initiating and during the course of any pursuit, the pursuing officer and supervisors must consider the following:      Seriousness of the offense.      Knowledge of the identity of the pursued suspect(s).      Other occupants of vehicle (such as children).      Weather and lighting conditions.      Road conditions (such as intersections, traffic controls, overhead lighting, curves, hills, construction, etc.).      Density of vehicular and pedestrian traffic.      Locality of pursuit (residential, highway, etc.).      Familiarity with area.      Nature of pursuit (such as the manner of operation of suspect vehicle, speeding, erratic or reckless driving, etc.).      Vehicle's speed.

By Friday, the city's police chief made the decision to declare the store a public nuisance after a summer of high profile incidents.      Mayor Buckley cites nearly 500 police calls in just 5 months to the store and says something has to change. \\"I want Wal-mart to be a better corporate partner with us and it's not happening,\\" said Mayor Buckley. \\"They can really be a productive business in our city if they want to be, but we can't continue down this road,\\" he added.      It's a road that has seen the store in the news all summer. The first time was in June when two women got into a brawl in the shampoo aisle. Video of the incident went viral.Days later, police were called to the store for a shop-lifter who led them on a chase. During that pursuit, police say the suspect crashed his car and killed a woman, injuring others.      This past week, Beech Grove got another shop lifting call after police say two suspects were stopped by security for shoplifting. During questioning, one of the men ran after pulling out a gun and shot himself nearby.Later that same night, according to Mayor Buckley, Beech Grove police were at the Walmart again for another shoplifter who ran. \\"For a period of time, there were not any Beech Grove police officers patrolling the streets of Beech Grove because we were down at Walmart again dealing with an irrelevant shop lifter,\\" said Buckley.      Now the store has ten days to address some of its issues, according to the Mayor or they could be fined each time police are called to the store. \\"That store is a real problem,\\" said the mayor.      According to a Walmart spokesperson, the company has hired off duty police to patrol the store and implemented a program where low level shoplifting offenses will be handled in house so police don't need to be called. A Walmart spokesperson said the company enjoys great relationships in communities across the country. Mayor Buckley said Beech Grove has not been one of those communities. ||||| The Beech Grove mayor pushed for a public nuisance designation for Wal-Mart after suspected shoplifter Gillace Monroe Samples, 42, fled the store and shot himself at a nearby restaurant.      Gillace Monroe Samples, 42, is suspected of shoplifting at Walmart in Beech Grove before running to a nearby restaurant and shooting himself in the head. He remained in critical condition as of Friday afternoon. (Photo: Photo provided by Beech Grove Police Department)      Update: Beech Grove police said Monday that 42-year-old Gillace Monroe Samples died over the weekend from his self-inflicted gunshot wounds.      Monroe, suspected of shoplifting, had been stopped Thursday by Wal-Mart workers, including an off-duty deputy. Monroe pulled a gun and ran out of the store. He was found shot in the restroom of a nearby restaurant.      Earlier:      When a man shot himself following an incident at Wal-Mart in Beech Grove, it was the last straw for that town's mayor. He's declared the business a public nuisance.      On Thursday morning, 42-year-old Gillace Monroe Samples tried to steal from the store, police said. After being caught by security, Samples waved his gun at employees before running to a nearby restaurant and shooting himself in the head as police closed in.      He remained in critical condition at Eskenazi Hospital as of Friday afternoon.      The shooting is the latest in a string of high-profile incidents that have been connected to the troubled Wal-Mart store over the last two months, joining a brawl between two women in the store's shampoo aisle and a separate act of shoplifting that ended with a crash that killed a 63-year-old woman.      As a public nuisance, Wal-Mart can be assessed fines when officers are needed there.      To Beech Grove Mayor Dennis Buckley, it's one of the only remaining options.      \\"We're better than that, our community is better than that and I don't want to get a phone call every day saying that somebody pulled a gun at Wal-Mart and has done something out of line,\\" Buckley said.      Police said Thursday's incident began around 11 a.m. Samples and another suspect, 42-year-old Johnny Maxey, were caught shoplifting at Wal-Mart, located in a shopping center in the 4600 block of South Emerson Avenue.      Two Wal-Mart employees — one an off-duty Marion County Sheriff's Department deputy working as a security guard and another assisting him — escorted the suspects to the store's loss prevention office.      That's when Samples pulled out a handgun before fleeing the store, police said. The deputy, assisted by Beech Grove and Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department officers, chased Samples.      Witnesses helped the officers track down Samples in the restroom of Egg Roll No. 1, a restaurant located just north of Wal-Mart on South Emerson. Officers were moving in to make an arrest when they heard a gunshot, police said.      Samples was wanted for parole violation and battery by means of a deadly weapon, and for being a serious violent felon in possession of a firearm, police said. The battery and gun possession charges are connected to a shooting reported in Indianapolis on July 29.      Like Buckley, Wal-Mart spokesman Brian Nick expressed frustration with the latest confrontation. He also commended Wal-Mart employees and security for keeping other shoppers safe.      \\"We're thankful that our security measures helped identify a dangerous individual who could have caused harm to others in the community,\\" Nick said.      The aftermath of previous incidents saw police discussing how frequent runs to Wal-Mart have stretched the department's resources. Between February 2014 and mid-June, Beech Grove police made 1,278 runs to the store resulting in 473 arrests.      Officials from both sides met and eventually implemented a restorative justice program at Wal-Mart.      The voluntary program, Nick said, is designed to reduce the number of police runs to the store. It gives Wal-Mart associates the ability to offer some shoplifters a chance to opt into a program that results in a fine instead of being arrested.      It's usually targeted at people during first-time offenses when police aren't necessary, Nick said.      \\"That is something the store will continue to work on with law enforcement, and something that we've seen success with in other parts of the country,\\" he said.      While he's pleased with the program's early results, Buckley said he's noticed police activity has increased over the last two weeks.      Once the public nuisance designation is finalized, Wal-Mart will be notified and given a 10-day grace period before receiving fines, Buckley said.      Then officers will have the option to issue tickets when they're called to the store. Each ticket could carry a 2,500 penalty and court fees.      In response to the designation, Nick said Wal-Mart officials will work to keep the store peaceful.      Call Star reporter Justin L. Mack at (317) 444-6138. Follow him on Twitter: @justinlmack.

As one critic described it, the song projected \\"something hymnal and heartfelt that spoke of the father in Dylan\\", and Dylan himself commented: \\"I wrote it thinking about one of my boys and not wanting to be too sentimental.\\"Columbia Records simultaneously released Dylan, a collection of studio outtakes (almost exclusively covers), widely interpreted as a churlish response to Dylan's signing with a rival record label. In January 1974, Dylan returned to touring after seven years; backed by the Band, he embarked on a North American tour of 40 concerts. A live double album, Before the Flood, was on Asylum Records. Soon, according to Clive Davis, Columbia Records sent word they \\"will spare nothing to bring Dylan back into the fold\\". Dylan had second thoughts about Asylum, miffed that while there had been millions of unfulfilled ticket requests for the 1974 tour, Geffen had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves. Dylan returned to Columbia Records, which reissued his two Asylum albums. After the tour, Dylan and his wife became estranged. He filled a small red notebook with songs about relationships and ruptures, and recorded an album entitled Blood on the Tracks in September 1974. Dylan delayed the release and re-recorded half the songs at Sound 80 Studios in Minneapolis with production assistance from his brother, David Zimmerman.Released in early 1975, Blood on the Tracks received mixed reviews. In the NME, Nick Kent described \\"the accompaniments [as] often so trashy they sound like mere practice takes.\\" In Rolling Stone, Jon Landau wrote that \\"the record has been made with typical shoddiness.\\" Over the years critics came to see it as one of Dylan's greatest achievements. In..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The answer to the question is David. David Geffen is the person who owns the company (Asylum Records) that had sold only 700,000 copies of Planet Waves."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I Am Number Four (film) In 2011, screenwriter Noxon told Collider.com that plans for an imminent sequel were shelved due to the disappointing performance of the first installment at the box office. Options are: (1). no; (2). yes; Is this statement correct \\"is there going to be another i am four movie\\"?","output":"The statement \\"Is there going to be another I am Number Four movie?\\" is subject to speculation as there has been no definitive answer or confirmation from the movie studios involved. However, based on available information, it seems unlikely that a sequel will be produced in the near future. I Am Number Four is a science fiction action film released in 2011. It is directed by D.J. Caruso and is based on the novel of the same name written by Pittacus Lore. The story revolves around nine alien teenagers who escape their war-torn home planet, Lorien, and seek refuge on Earth. They are pursued by a group of hostile aliens called Mogadorians, who intend to exterminate them. The protagonist, John Smith (played by Alex Pettyfer), possesses unique powers and is one of the nine aliens on the run. In a 2011 interview with screenwriter Marti Noxon, she revealed that plans for a sequel were halted due to the film's underwhelming performance at the box office. The movie received mixed reviews from critics and audiences, which has contributed to the lack of an immediate follow-up. The film was initially planned to be a franchise, as the book series by Pittacus Lore comprises seven novels, providing ample source material for potential sequels. While a sequel is not impossible, several factors make it appear less likely as time passes. The core cast, including Alex Pettyfer, Dianna Agron, and Teresa Palmer, have aged, and it would be challenging to continue the story naturally after a considerable gap in production. Additionally, many members involved in the initial film have moved on to other projects, further complicating the feasibility of a sequel. In conclusion, given the available information, it is unlikely that another I Am Number Four movie will be produced in the near future. Fans of the series should not expect a sequel, as current circumstances strongly suggest that the 2011 film was a standalone adaptation of the novel."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Alps (/ælps/; Italian: Alpi [ˈalpi]; French: Alpes [alp]; German: Alpen [ˈʔalpm̩]; Slovene: Alpe [ˈáːlpɛ]) are the highest and most extensive mountain range system that lies entirely in Europe, stretching approximately 1,200 kilometres (750 mi) across eight Alpine countries: Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Slovenia, and Switzerland. The Caucasus Mountains are higher, and the Urals longer, but both lie partly in Asia. The mountains were formed over tens of millions of years as the African and Eurasian tectonic plates collided. Extreme shortening caused by the event resulted in marine sedimentary rocks rising by thrusting and folding into high mountain peaks such as Mont Blanc and the Matterhorn. Mont Blanc spans the French–Italian border, and at 4,810 m (15,781 ft) is the highest mountain in the Alps. The Alpine region area contains about a hundred peaks higher than 4,000 m (13,123 ft), known as the \\"four-thousanders\\".  The altitude and size of the range affects the climate in Europe; in the mountains precipitation levels vary greatly and climatic conditions consist of distinct zones. Wildlife such as ibex live in the higher peaks to elevations of 3,400 m (11,155 ft), and plants such as Edelweiss grow in rocky areas in lower elevations as well as in higher elevations. Evidence of human habitation in the Alps goes back to the Paleolithic era. Answer the following questions: 1. What is the most extensive mountain range system in Europe? 2. How far do they stretch? 3. Through how many countries? 4. How many of them start with S? 5. How many of them start with C? 6. Is rain consistent in these mountains? 7.

Given the question: Information:  - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941.  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.  - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.  - Raymond Towers \`\` Ray '' Holmes ( 20 August 1914 -- 27 June 2005 ) was a British fighter pilot who was feted by the press as a war hero who saved Buckingham Palace from being severely damaged by German bombing during the Battle of Britain .

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: This is the most compelling and excellent performance that Robert Taylor ever gave. It even surpasses his wonderful performance as \\"Johnny Eager\\" coming a full 14 years after that film. His looks are still a wonder to see, but he has a maturity now that gives him the edge in this gritty, violent role. Charlie Gilson (Taylor) is the last of his breed, a buffalo hunter who kills not for the money but for the pleasure. His wild eyed killing of not only buffalo but human beings, is stunning to watch. He is basically a lonely man, needing the people around him, but they dislike him because of his sociopath behavior. His partner is Sandy McKenzie (Stewart Granger) who is sick of the hunt, and only goes along, because he is a failure at anything else. Along the way Charlie kills a family of Indians and captures the beautiful Debra Pagent. Charlie tries to seduce her to no avail, but sees that Sandy is interested in her also. Granger is kind of sad to watch, so fed up with the hunt, longing to go away with the girl and her baby. Lloyd Nolan as the drunken skinner is wonderful with his wise cracks and accordian playing. Russ Tamblyn plays the half breed trying to fit in a white world. The group is an odd mix of good and evil, young and old. In the end Taylor gets spooked by the buffalo, as many hunters before him had, and runs off leaving Sandy with the girl. Upon his return, that night Sandy leaves with the woman, setting Charlie off on a rampage of killing in a quest to get Sandy and have the girl for himself. The final confrontation comes in a snow storm and the last scene is so shocking that you will never forget it. It is Taylor's film all the way and he was truly a much underrated actor of the era.

Question 1: What are the martial arts techniques for self-defense? Question 2: What is the best martial art to use for self-defense and other practical situations? Why? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1 and Question 2 are related but not the same. Question 1 is asking for various martial arts techniques specifically meant for self-defense, while Question 2 is asking for the best martial art suited for self-defense and practical situations and the reasoning behind it. Regarding Question 1: Martial arts techniques for self-defense can be found across many different disciplines, and the effectiveness of these techniques often depends on the skill and experience of the individual applying them. Some popular martial arts that teach self-defense techniques include Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, Krav Maga, and Muay Thai. Here are some key techniques from these martial arts: 1. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu:    - Rear naked choke: This technique involves attacking the opponent from behind, wrapping one arm around their neck while using the other to hold it in place. By applying pressure with your forearm to the side of the neck, you can quickly put someone to sleep or force them to submit.    - Armbar: From various positions, you can isolate an opponent's arm, extending it and applying pressure on the elbow joint by using your hips and legs. This can lead to submission or serious injury to the opponent if they do not give up.    - Guard: A position from your back that allows you to control the opponent's movements using your legs, protecting yourself from strikes and setting up other attacks like chokes, joint locks, and sweeps. 2. Krav Maga:    - Groin strike: A quick and effective self-defense technique is to target the groin. Using a swift kick or knee, you can cause severe pain and incapacitate an attacker.    - Eye gouge: By using your fingers to apply pressure to an attacker's eyes, you can inflict pain and temporarily disorient them, allowing for a possible escape.    - Hammer fist strike: Instead of a traditional closed-fist punch, a hammer fist strike uses the bottom of the fist to deliver a powerful blow, which can minimize the risk of injury to your own hand. 3. Muay Thai:    - Low kicks: Aiming for an opponent's legs, especially the thigh area, can cause significant pain and weaken their ability to stand and move. Repeated low kicks can eventually lead to an attacker being unable to continue their assault.    - Clinch: By controlling an opponent's head and neck, one can land devastating knees to the body and head, breaking their posture and limiting their ability to strike back.    - Elbows: Muay Thai incorporates elbow strikes which can prove useful in close-quarters self-defense situations where punches may be less effective. Properly executed elbow strikes can cause significant damage or even knock an opponent out. Regarding Question 2: The best martial art to use for self-defense and practical situations is subjective, as it depends on an individual's personal preferences, physical attributes, and the time and effort they are willing to commit to training. That being said, many people consider Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu as an ideal martial art for self-defense and practical situations because of the following reasons: 1. Efficient use of technique and leverage: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has a core principle of using leverage, timing, and proper technique over pure strength or aggression. This allows smaller or less physically dominant individuals to successfully defend against larger or stronger attackers. 2. Focus on ground fighting: Most real-life confrontations end up on the ground, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu has a comprehensive system for ground fighting and submissions, which can effectively neutralize opponents and give practitioners a significant advantage in these situations. 3. Non-lethal: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu primarily utilizes joint locks and chokes to control or incapacitate an opponent. This allows practitioners to effectively neutralize a threat without causing severe injury, if not necessary, which can be useful in self-defense situations where the use of force must be proportionate to the threat. 4. Stress-tested in competition: Many Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioners participate in realistic and competitive sparring, commonly referred to as \\"rolling,\\" which helps them to become comfortable and composed in high-pressure situations. However, it's important to recognize that no single martial art is perfect for every situation or person. Many martial artists benefit from cross-training in multiple disciplines so that they may become well-rounded individuals with a diverse range of skills and tactics to draw upon in self-defense or practical situations. Ultimately, the best martial art for an individual is the one they are most passionate and consistent in learning and practicing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

He always looked forward to his evening rendezvous with Bonnie--his nickname for the Bonneville. He liked to put her top down, and drive her around town in the moonlight. Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan. \\"I would like a large--\\" \\"--a large dipped cone, the usual. Right?\\" The Dairy Queen drive-thru ordering station was located out in front of the restaurant, on the right side. He looked up, and saw the 19 year-old waving at him. She looked so cute in her little Dairy Queen outfit. Fontana was in her first year at Kilgore College. She planned to be an elementary teacher. He knew she would be a good one. Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone. How did the worn out guitar sound? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. Mellow  B. not enough information  C. Bad  D. Flat Answer:","output":"A.

News article: The mayor who rose from poverty to transform a Georgia town Evelyn Wynn-Dixon, the mayor of Riverdale, Ga., tells NBC News' Maria Shriver how she persevered through homelessness and difficult times to become the successful mayor of an American city.Â By Jay Kernis, Producer, NBC News RIVERDALE, Ga. -- In 1973, Evelyn Wynn-Dixon was standing at the Pryor Street Bridge overlooking Atlanta’s I-75, preparing to jump. She had four babies, no husband, no job and no self-esteem. At the time, she never would have believed what her life would become decades later. If she killed herself, she thought, her children “would be rich” from her insurance policy. “I saw a tractor-trailer comin’. I said, ‘I am not gonna be able to do that.’ So I went home and I had a .22. It had no bullets.” She also tried over-dosing on aspirin and cutting her wrist, without success. After those suicide attempts, she says she heard her late mother’s voice telling her, “School is the answer.” That’s when Wynn-Dixon says she decided to turn her life around. She had been to college, but became pregnant early on and dropped out. So years later, wanting a new life for her children, she earned a nursing certificate, then a bachelor of science, a masters in social work and gerontology, and eventually, a Ph.D. in public health. Many times, she walked miles from her home to her classes, and worked a series of jobs -- cleaning and cooking among them -- to pay tuition and support her children. In 2007, Wynn-Dixon ran for the office of mayor of Riverdale, Ga., a city of around 16,000 people at the edge of Atlanta. She was 58 years old at the time and had no political experience. After a campaign that cost 2,318.57, she was elected. Wynn-Dixon’s first term lasted until 2008, and during her second term, which runs until 2016, she ran unopposed. NBC News' Special Anchor Maria Shriver interviewed the mayor as part of a series of stories covering “The Shriver Report: A Woman’s Nation Pushes Back from the Brink.” The report, co-authored by Shriver and The Center for American Progress, documents the estimated 42 million women across the country—and 28 million dependent children—who live at the edge of poverty and economic disaster. Wynn-Dixon told NBC News that Riverdale needs more white-collar jobs, and she’d like to re-brand the town’s image as a great place to live. So far, as mayor Wynn-Dixon has built a new city hall complex — including a new town hall, courtroom, gym and amphitheater--and cleaned up the town. She ended her first term with a balanced budget, and even a small surplus. Chief of Police Samuel Patterson said that the mayor has encouraged citizens from all walks of life, from children to seniors, to get involved in the life of the town. \\"Dr. Wynn-Dixon has been an absolute ambassador for the city,” Patterson said. “She has opened doors that otherwise would not have been opened, had it not been for her vivacious personality. She has done more for the city in her first term than most of the mayors we’ve had who were her predecessors.\\" And according to mayor pro tem An’cel Davis, her leadership style “brought the city together.\\" \\"She took over when the city was going through turbulent times—crime, changes in demographics, and economic challenges,\\" Davis said. \\"She has sort of a mother personality about her — everybody is 'baby.' She has that mother image.” The mayor’s children are grown now. Two of her sons attended the University of Georgia where they had considerable success as athletes. One later went to Harvard for his MBA. Her daughter, an attorney, is getting her Ph.D. Another son served a nine-year prison sentence, but earned his veterinarian degree while incarcerated. Wynn-Dixon says she’ll run one more time, “If the people will have me.” “My zip code didn’t make me. My size didn’t make me,\\" said Wynn-Dixon, who describes herself as “voluptuously full-figured.\\" \\"It was the fact that I dared to get up. I kept saying, ‘This is not going to defeat me. I’m going to prove to people that I can make it.’” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The news article highlights the inspiring story of Evelyn Wynn-Dixon, who overcame poverty, homelessness, and multiple suicide attempts to eventually become the mayor of Riverdale, Georgia. Key aspects of her journey include: 1. Wynn-Dixon's early struggles: She faced extreme hardship, with four children, no husband, no job, and no self-esteem. At one point, she attempted suicide multiple times. 2. The turning point: After hearing her late mother's voice, Wynn-Dixon decided to focus on her education. She went on to earn a nursing certificate, a bachelor of science, a master's in social work, and gerontology, and a Ph.D. in public health. 3.

They first try to get the cat in a residential home to eat them. When the cat refuses, they attempt various tactics, including pleading and bullying, in order to achieve their goal. Throughout the film, the mice's determination to be eaten creates a chain reaction of events that affect the other characters.

They carry out oxidation reactions that break down fatty acids and amino acids. They also detoxify many poisons that may enter the body. Alcohol is detoxified by peroxisomes in liver cells. A byproduct of these oxidation reactions is hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, which is contained within the peroxisomes to prevent the chemical from causing damage to cellular components outside of the organelle. Hydrogen peroxide is safely broken down by peroxisomal enzymes into water and oxygen.   Q: Peroxisomes carry out oxidation reactions that break down what acids?

Group G had people over 65 in it, and group Y had people under 65 years old in it.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which group had more people that had decreased stamina?  Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. The answer is:","output":"The answer is group G had more people with decreased stamina. This is because group G consists of people over 65 years old, and the paragraph provided mentions that stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age. Additionally, the immune system becomes less efficient and the risk of serious illnesses increases. Since group G includes individuals in this older age range, they are more likely to experience decreased stamina compared to group Y, which consists of people under 65 years old."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In both sentences, the word \\"seize\\" is used to convey the act of taking control or possession of someone by force or without their consent.

This article: The band members grew uncomfortable with their success, with much of the burden of Pearl Jam's popularity falling on frontman Vedder. While Pearl Jam received four awards at the 1993 MTV Video Music Awards for its video for \\"Jeremy\\", including Video of the Year and Best Group Video, the band refused to make a video for \\"Black\\" in spite of pressure from the label. This action began a trend of the band refusing to make videos for its songs. Vedder felt that the concept of music videos robbed listeners from creating their own interpretations of the song, stating that \\"Before music videos first came out, you'd listen to a song with headphones on, sitting in a beanbag chair with your eyes closed, and you'd come up with your own visions, these things that came from within. Then all of a sudden, sometimes even the very first time you heard a song, it was with these visual images attached, and it robbed you of any form of self-expression.\\" The United States Department of Justice was investigating the company's practices at the time and asked the band to create a memorandum of its experiences with the company.

Background: The Colbert Report () is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News's The O'Reilly Factor. Context: The character first made appearances on the short-lived sketch comedy series The Dana Carvey Show in 1996, described as \\"a self-important, trench-coated reporter who does on-location stories in a way that suggests his own presence is the real scoop.\\"  When The Daily Show ran short on time, a short piece starring Colbert, advertising a fictional program titled The Colbert Report, was added into the program. In these sketches, Colbert began to amplify his character to parody news pundits. Colbert anchored many sketches in his persona, including \\"Even Stepvhen\\", in which he debated current issues with fellow correspondent Steve Carell, often devolving into petty name-calling and insults. Colbert and Carell were viewed as potential breakout stars by staff, and when Carell left the series in 2004 to start a US version of The Office, Comedy Central made attempts to keep Colbert at the network. Stewart and Karlin were already looking to expand the Daily Show franchise and their production company, Busboy. The duo supposedly came up with the idea for The Colbert Report after watching coverage of the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against Bill O'Reilly. Colbert met with network president Doug Herzog the day following the 2004 Emmy Awards to first discuss the concept. The one-line pitch Colbert, Karlin and Stewart developed was \\"Our version of the O'Reilly Factor with Stephen Colbert.\\" Herzog committed to an eight-week tryout period without a pilot.  By the time of the 2004 election, the character was fully developed. In creating the character, which is designed to be repellant but entertaining, Colbert conferred with Stewart and Karlin. In expressing his hope that his character not be \\"an asshole,\\" Stewart remarked, \\"You're not an asshole. You're an idiot. There's a difference.\\" Head writer Allison Silverman reiterated this trait in a later interview, commenting, \\"There is an essential innocence to his character.\\" Colbert initially felt the character might not be sustainable in a longer format. Despite this, The Colbert Report was designed as an extension of the satiric goals of The Daily Show, combining it with general silliness and character-driven humor. To make sure there was no overlap in subject matter with The Daily Show, Karlin made trips between the studios during the show's early days to supervise scripts. For the first several years of the program, Colbert made an appearance at the end of each Daily Show in split-screen, having a short discussion with Stewart preceding his show. Question: What do you find most interesting in the article? Answer:","output":"One of the most interesting aspects of the article is the evolution and development of Stephen Colbert's character as a satirical news pundit. The character's beginnings on The Dana Carvey Show and its transformation and amplification in The Daily Show, leading to the creation of The Colbert Report, showcase the creative process behind this iconic character. Additionally, it's fascinating to see how the collaboration between Stephen Colbert, Jon Stewart, and Ben Karlin led to the successful and influential show, as well as the specific influence of the Bill O'Reilly sexual harassment lawsuit in sparking the idea for The Colbert Report."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Context: U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November.

Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: Why did Donald Trump ask his supporters to not pay attention to Democrats?

Amusement parks have a fixed location, as opposed to travelling funfairs and traveling carnivals, and are more elaborate than simple city parks or playgrounds, usually providing attractions meant to cater specifically to certain age groups, as well as some that are aimed towards all ages. Theme parks, a specific type of amusement park, are usually much more intricately themed to a certain subject or group of subjects than normal amusement parks.  - The Royal Court of Sweden is the official name for the organisation (royal households) that supports the monarch, and the royal house.

Djurgården is home to historical buildings and monuments, museums, galleries, the amusement park Gröna Lund, the open-air museum Skansen, the small residential area \\"Djurgårdsstaden\\", yacht harbours, and extensive stretches of forest and meadows. It is one of the Stockholmers' favorite recreation areas and tourist destinations alike, attracting over 10 million visitors per year, of which some 5 million come to visit the museums and amusement park. The island belongs to the National City park founded in 1995. Since the 15th century the Swedish monarch has owned or held the right of disposition of Royal Djurgården. Today, this right is exercised by the Royal Djurgården Administration which is a part of the Royal Court of Sweden.  - The Nordic countries or Nordics are a geographical and cultural region in Northern Europe and the North Atlantic, where they are most commonly known as Norden (lit., \\"The North\\").

It is also the capital of Stockholm County.  - Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Rosendals slott ) is a Swedish palace pavilion located at the Djurgården , an island in central Stockholm . It was built between 1823 and 1827 for King Karl XIV Johan , the first Bernadotte King of Sweden . It was intended as an escape from the formalities of court life at the Royal Palace . Rosendal Palace was largely designed by Fredrik Blom , one of the leading architects of the time , who received a royal commission to draw and build the palace building after the original buildings burned down . Fredrik August Lidströmer , Stockholm 's City Architect from 1818 to 1824 , had been King Karl XIV Johan 's primary architect at the construction of the original Rosendal Palace . After it burned down in 1819 , Lidströmer also created the initial drawings for the replacement palace . These were then adapted and redrawn by Fredrik Blom , who had been an assistant to Jonas Lidströmer , father of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The Queen 's Pavilion at Rosendal Palace ( Swedish : Drottningpaviljongen ) ) and Guard 's Cottage ( Swedish : Vaktstugan ) remained entirely the work of Fredrik August Lidströmer . The creation of the Rosendal Palace in the 1820s marked the beginning of the development of Djurgården into a stately residential area . When King Oskar II died in 1907 , his heirs decided to make Rosendal Palace a museum of the Karl Johan period and of the life of Karl XIV Johan . This makes Rosendal Palace a unique documentation of the European Empire style , in Sweden also known as the Karl Johan style . The Karl Johan style remained popular in Scandinavia even as the Empire style disappeared in other parts of Europe . The palace stands today largely as it did in Karl XIV Johan 's lifetime . During the summer months the palace is open to visitors for guided tours .  - Biography. Early life. It is known that Birger grew up and spent his adolescence in Bjälbo, Östergötland but the exact date of his birth remains uncertain and available historical sources are contradictory. Examinations of his mortal remains indicate that he was probably about 50 upon his death in 1266 which would indicate a birth around 1216. However, his father Magnus Minnesköld is assumed to have died no later than 1210, which would lead to an assumed birth a few years earlier. Under any circumstance, he was the son of Ingrid Ylva, who according to Olaus Petri was a daughter of Sune Sik and granddaughter of King Sverker I of Sweden, which would make Birger a matrilineal member of the House of Sverker. His brothers or half-brothers  Eskil, Karl, and Bengt  were all born long before 1200, and it can therefore be assumed that they had another mother. He was also a nephew of the jarl Birger Brosa from the House of Bjelbo. The combination of this background proved to be of vital importance.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe.

Plains Indians, Interior Plains Indians or Indigenous people of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies are the Native American tribes and First Nation band governments who have traditionally lived on the greater Interior Plains (i.e. the Great Plains and the Canadian Prairies) in North America. Their historic nomadic culture and development of equestrian culture and resistance to domination by the government and military forces of Canada and the United States have made the Plains Indian culture groups an archetype in literature and art for American Indians everywhere. Plains Indians are usually divided into two broad classifications which overlap to some degree. The first group became a fully nomadic horse culture during the 18th and 19th centuries, following the vast herds of buffalo, although some tribes occasionally engaged in agriculture. The earliest Spanish explorers in the 16th century did not find the Plains Indians especially warlike. The Wichita in Kansas and Oklahoma lived in dispersed settlements with no defensive works. The Spanish initially had friendly contacts with the Apache (Querechos) in the Texas Panhandle.  Three factors led to a growing importance of warfare in Plains Indian culture. First, was the Spanish colonization of New Mexico which stimulated raids and counter-raids by Spaniards and Indians for goods and slaves. Second, was the contact of the Indians with French fur traders which increased rivalry among Indian tribes to control trade and trade routes. Third, was the acquisition of the horse and the greater mobility it afforded the Plains Indians. What evolved among the Plains Indians from the 17th to the late 19th century was warfare as both a means of livelihood and a sport.  The Plains Indians raided each other, the Spanish colonies, and, increasingly, the encroaching frontier of the Anglos for horses, and other property. They acquired guns and other European goods primarily by trade. Their principal trading products were buffalo hides and beaver pelts.  Although they could be tenacious in defense, Plains Indians warriors took the offensive mostly for material gain and individual prestige. The highest military honors were for \\"counting coup\\"--touching a live enemy. Battles between Indians often consisted of opposing warriors demonstrating their bravery rather than attempting to achieve concrete military objectives. The emphasis was on ambush and hit and run actions rather than closing with an enemy. Success was often counted by the number of horses or property obtained in the raid. Casualties were usually light. \\"Indians consider it foolhardiness to make an attack where it is certain some of them will be killed.\\"  Due to their mobility, endurance, horsemanship, and knowledge of the vast plains that were their domain, the Plains Indians were often victors in their battles against the U.S. army in the American era from 1803 to about 1890. However, although Indians won many battles, they could not undertake lengthy campaigns. Indian armies could only be assembled for brief periods of time as warriors also had to hunt for food for their families. The exception to that was raids into Mexico by the Comanche and their allies in which the raiders often subsisted for months off the riches of Mexican haciendas and settlements. The basic weapon of the Indian warrior was the short, stout bow, designed for use on horseback and deadly, but only at short range. Guns were usually in short supply and ammunition scarce for Native warriors.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Who did the plains indians have battles with","output":"The Plains Indians had battles with different groups during their history. According to the shared information, they had conflicts with the Spanish during the Spanish colonization of New Mexico, which led to raids and counter-raids for goods and slaves. The contact with French fur traders also resulted in hostilities as there was increased rivalry among Indian tribes to control trade and trade routes.  As the expansion of colonialism continued, the Plains Indians increasingly came into conflict with the encroaching frontier of the Anglos (another name for European settlers, particularly of English descent). The Plains Indians also had warfare with different tribes, as is evidenced by mention of intertribal raids for horses and other properties.  Notably, the period from 1803 to about 1890 was marked by frequent battles against the U.S. army. The quote, \\"Due to their mobility, endurance, horsemanship, and knowledge of the vast plains that were their domain, the Plains Indians were often victors in their battles against the U.S. army in the American era from 1803 to about 1890\\", denotes this period of conflict with the U.S. army. Furthermore, The Plains Indians, specifically the Comanche and their allies, also launched raids into Mexico, with the quote detailing: \\"The exception to that was raids into Mexico by the Comanche and their allies in which the raiders often subsisted for months off the riches of Mexican haciendas and settlements.\\" Therefore, the battles of the Plains Indians spanned across different groups and periods, largely shaped by the colonial and territorial expansions of foreign powers, and also encompassing conflicts with neighboring tribes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This is an exciting development in the region that is poised to rekindle the art of whisky production, draw thriving tourism, and reawaken a part of the area's proud heritage. The proposed distillery will stand on a former industrial site, providing a blend of the old and the new, honoring the history of the Borders while embracing its future as a premier whisky producer. History of Whisky Production in the Borders The Borders, an area rich in history and blessed with natural resources, were once home to thriving whisky production. Distilleries thrived in this region until the introduction of the Excise Act in the early 1800s, which led to the closure of many small-scale, independent operations. Now, nearly 180 years after the last distillery closed its doors, the Borders are set to reclaim their place as a center of whisky production. The Former Industrial Site The new distillery will be constructed on a former industrial site, which offers a fitting location as it blends the region's proud industrial heritage with its future as a whisky producing powerhouse. This sustainable approach ensures that valuable land is preserved while the disused land is revitalized, breathing new life into an already historical location. The Investment and Economic Impact The establishment of a new whisky distillery carries profound economic implications for the Borders. In addition to providing jobs directly related to production, sales, and management of the distillery, it will create numerous indirect opportunities for employment in fields ranging from tourism to logistics. This economic impact is expected to reverberate throughout the region, bolstering local businesses and improving the overall quality of life for residents. The Distillery Experience With many curious visitors and connoisseurs expected to flock to the distillery once it's operational, the distillery will serve as a hub of whisky education and appreciation. Not only will guests have the opportunity to experience firsthand how whisky is made with traditional methods, but they will also learn about the history of the industry in the Borders. By preserving and promoting the cultural heritage of the region, the distillery will also contribute to the growth and continuity of this remarkable tradition. Environmental Stewardship and the Use of Local Resources Beyond economic benefits, the new distillery will also emphasize environmental stewardship and the use of local resources. Production will prioritize sustainable practices that minimize the environmental footprint of the facility, promote soil health, and conserve water. Furthermore, the whisky will be produced with high-quality, local grains and water sources, ensuring the unique flavor profile that can only come from the Borders region. Conclusion The proposed whisky distillery heralds a renaissance for Borders whisky production and brings forth the potential to revitalize the regional economy, breathe new life into former industrial sites, and reintroduce the rich whisky-making heritage of the region to the world. With environmental sustainability at its core and a focus on honoring the local landscape and history, the distillery will form a cornerstone of industry, tourism, and culture for generations to come. The time is ripe for a resurgence of whisky production in the Borders, and the founding of this new distillery signals a bright and prosperous future for the area and its proud people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Combine like terms on one side of the equation. 2. Add or subtract constants on the other side of the equation. 3. Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable. Let's begin solving the equation 0 = 153*p - 80 + 29 - 102 for p. Step 1: Combine like terms on one side of the equation. 0 = 153*p - 80 + 29 - 102 There are three constants: -80, 29, and -102. To combine them: -80 + 29 - 102 = -153 The updated equation becomes: 0 = 153*p - 153 Step 2: Add or subtract constants on the other side of the equation. To get rid of the constant on the right side of the equation, we will add 153 to both sides: 0 + 153 = 153*p - 153 + 153 Which can be simplified to: 153 = 153*p Step 3: Divide both sides by the coefficient of the variable. Now, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 153 to solve for p: 153 / 153 = (153*p) / 153 This simplifies to: 1 = p So the solution to the equation is p = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: A Dutch man barely out of his teens is leading one of the most ambitious ocean cleanup efforts ever: to halve the amount of plastic debris floating in the Pacific within a decade.      The man’s name is Boyan Slat, and he’s come up with a pretty ingenious way of doing it. Instead of clamoring around the globe on a never-ending junk hunt, he wants the ocean to “clean itself.”      Advertisement      Every year, 8 million tons of plastic are dumped into the oceans. Slat’s plan is to place enormous floating barriers in rotating tidal locations around the globe (called gyres), and let the plastic waste naturally flow into capture. These barriers aren’t nets—sea life gets tangled in those. They’re big, V-shaped buffers anchored by floating booms.      Slat’s nonprofit, the Ocean Cleanup, says the current will flow underneath those booms, where animals will be carried through safely. The buoyant plastic is funneled above and concentrates at the water’s surface along the barriers for easy gathering and disposal.      Advertisement      Last month, it was announced that this ocean-cleaning system—which the company says is the world’s first—will be deployed in 2016. They’re planning to station it near the Japanese island of Tsushima, situated in between Japan’s Nagasaki prefecture and South Korea. The detritus-catching apparatus will be 6,500 feet wide and is being called the longest floating structure ever placed in the ocean.      Eventually, more of these storm-resistant, plastic-gathering structures will be placed around the world, if all goes according to plan.      This August, meanwhile, the Ocean Cleanup is sending 50 vessels to scour the area between Hawaii and California to make the first hi-res map of plastic floating in the Pacific.      Advertisement      Slat leads a team of 100 oceanographers, naval engineers, translators, designers, and others. He’s also getting support from key political figures, like the mayor of Tsushima and the mayor of Los Angeles.      The Ocean Cleanup started with a crowdfunding campaign last year that raised 2 million. Pretty incredible for a 20-year-old with a big idea.      Concept art credits: The Ocean Cleanup ||||| The world's first system designed to rid the oceans of plastic pollution will be deployed near Japan in 2016, with the aim of eventually capturing half of the plastic found in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch — a large concentration of marine debris located between Hawaii and California.      Boyan Slat, the 20-year-old Dutch CEO of The Ocean Cleanup, an organization dedicated to cleaning the world’s oceans, designed the system dubbed The Ocean Cleanup Array.      “I’ve always been interested in technology, and I was launching rockets at 12 years old,” Slat said. “Eventually I started studying aerospace engineering, but I dropped out to try to develop this ocean clean up idea.”      He said his inspiration for the organization came after a diving holiday in Greece where he realized he was coming across more plastic bags than fish.      “I wondered, ‘Why can’t we clean this up?’” Slat said.      Plastic debris, most of it in the form of tiny beads known as microplastics, can be found on up to 88 percent of the surface of all five oceans, according to a recent study published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Because of swirling ocean currents, known as gyres, this plastic pollution has become concentrated in certain areas.      In other cases, ocean currents send plastic pollution toward certain islands or coastal areas in greater concentration than others. One such area is the Japanese island of Tsushima.      “The reason we picked that location is because the current and wave conditions are very favorable for our tests, and there really is a lot of plastic,” Slat said. “The island where we performed the test sees 30,000 cubic meters of trash wash ashore per year.”      So much plastic washes up on Tsushima’s shores that both the Japanese government and the island’s residents have agreed to work with The Ocean Cleanup on its pilot project planned for 2016.      The Ocean Cleanup Array — based on research by a team of 100 scientists and engineers and funded by a crowd-funding campaign — is a long, floating barrier that is moored to the seabed in an area that plastic debris gathers due to ocean currents, Slat said. As currents move plastic trash toward the area, the barrier blocks and gathers it onto a collection platform.      The array will span over 1 mile, making it the longest floating structure ever deployed in the ocean, according to a press release by The Ocean Cleanup.      The system works because most plastic trash floating in the ocean is found in the top two meters of the water, Slat discovered after leading four expeditions in different ocean locations to measure how deep the plastic could be found.      The array will be operational for two years, catching plastic before it reaches the shores of Tsushima, which is currently researching whether it can use the material for an energy source.      If the pilot project is successful, The Ocean Cleanup will begin a series of deployments of arrays of increasing scale, Slat said.      Within five years, the organization aims to deploy a 62-mile-long array that will be capable of capturing about half of the trash in the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, Slat said. According to a feasibility study conducted by the team of 100 scientists and engineers working with Slat, the giant array will be able to do that over 10 years.      Critics argue that prevention and interception — stopping the plastic trash before it reaches waterways and oceans — is a more sustainable way to stop ocean pollution.      Tony Haymet, a professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at University of California, San Diego, said peer-reviewed studies from his former students’ 2009 SEAPLEX expedition showed that nearly all plastic pollution in the oceans is in microplastic form — “smaller than the size of about half a little finger nail.”      No system is able to extract the microplastic, Haymet said in previous comments.      “As far as I know — sadly — this remains true today,” Haymet said. “It’s a horribly tricky issue.”      Besides being hard to filter, microplastic — either from microbeads in popular beauty products or the broken down pieces of larger plastic items — gets into the stomachs of small fish, which are then eaten by medium-size fish, and on up the food chain, Haymet said.      In order to better the world’s understanding of the scale and size of plastic pollution in the Pacific Ocean, The Ocean Cleanup will carry out a “mega expedition” in August to measure the amount of trash found in the ocean between California and Hawaii.      “Up to 50 vessels will go to the Patch, thereby becoming the largest research expedition in history,” Slat said. The ships will stay there for about three weeks, taking measurements of the amount and size of plastic contained in the area.      “In that period we will take more measurements [of the Patch] than in the past 40 years combined,” Slat said. The Ocean Cleanup has recruiters throughout the U.S. looking for people with boats to join the expedition. They already have 15 confirmed, and a little over two months until the trip begins.      “It’s 63 days to go, so the pressure is on,” Slat said. ||||| Take advantage of natural oceanic forces      The Ocean Cleanup is developing a passive system, using the natural oceanic forces to catch and concentrate the plastic. Both the plastic and system are being carried by the current.      However, wind and waves propel only the system, as the floater sits just above the water surface, while the plastic is primarily just beneath it. The system thus moves faster than the plastic, allowing the plastic to be captured. ||||| This site makes use of third-party cookies for analytics.

Here is a 5R rule for us: 1.  Reduce If you want to reduce waste, you should use things wisely. Millions of trees are being cut down to make paper. If everyone uses a little paper carelessly and throw it out, soon we would not have any trees left. Other things are also being wasted, and people don't know what to do with the waste in big cities. So it is necessary to reduce the waste 2.  Reuse You should always think of reusing the usable things before throwing them out. Give your clothes you do not use or the ones which are too small to the poor. With a family, you may pass on such clothes to younger brothers or sisters. 3.  Recycle Bottles, cans and paper can easily be recycled. By doing so, we save lots of time and money. For example, coke cans are sent to a factory, where they are smashed flat and melted   and the melted things are made for new coke cans. 4.  Recover When you buy a box of apples, there may be a few rotten apples. You have two choices: one is to throw the whole apple away, or you could cut off the rotten parts and eat the good parts. In this way, you are recovering the eatable parts of food. 5.  Repair If one of the legs of your table is broken, you can repair it instead of throwing it away.

The conflict in Darfur, which began in 2003, is a human rights crisis that has garnered international attention due to the extensive violence, displacement, and suffering experienced by the people of the region. The root of the crisis lies in the power struggle between armed rebel groups (comprised primarily of non-Arab ethnic groups) and government forces and government-backed Arab militias known as the Janjaweed. As mentioned in the sentences, the conflict has taken on racial overtones, with the Arab-dominated government and its allied forces often targeting black African Darfuris. The second sentence highlights the racial distinction between the people of Darfur, who are primarily black Africans, and the government forces, who are of Arab descent. Consequently, the conflict has often been described as a racially charged issue, with the Arab government and militia groups targeting black African locals. The third sentence addresses some of the human rights abuses that have occurred in the conflict, including kidnapping and slavery. These atrocities are considered manifestations of racism and ethnic persecution. In light of the racial aspect of the conflict, a strong argument can be made that Western nations, with their historical commitment to condemning racism and promoting human rights, have an ethical responsibility to intervene in the Darfur crisis. The debate on this topic revolves around whether the Western world, particularly nations like the United States and countries in the European Union, should take a more proactive role in resolving the conflict in Darfur. While some argue that direct intervention is necessary to save lives and stop the violence, others contend that it is not the responsibility of Western nations to resolve conflicts in other parts of the world, particularly when there are political, economic, and cultural complexities involved. Additionally, opponents of intervention may argue that Western nations should focus on their own domestic issues related to racism and inequality before intervening in foreign conflicts. Ultimately, the debate on this topic centers on the ethical and political implications of Western intervention in the Darfur conflict, which is characterized by strong racial and ethnic aspects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea?  The Danube and Volga rivers both form large deltas, but the Danube river delta is larger and grows faster every year.  Hint: River deltas form when a river carrying sediment reaches either (1) a body of water, such as a lake, ocean, or reservoir, (2) another river that cannot remove the sediment quickly enough to stop delta formation, or (3) an inland region where the water spreads out and deposits sediments. The tidal currents also cannot be too strong, as sediment would wash out into the water body faster than the river deposits it. The river must carry enough sediment to layer into deltas over time. The river's velocity decreases rapidly, causing it to deposit the majority, if not all, of its load. This alluvium builds up to form the river delta.[7] When the flow enters the standing water, it is no longer confined to its channel and expands in width. This flow expansion results in a decrease in the flow velocity, which diminishes the ability of the flow to transport sediment. As a result, sediment drops out of the flow and deposits. Over time, this single channel builds a deltaic lobe (such as the bird's-foot of the Mississippi or Ural river deltas), pushing its mouth into the standing water. As the deltaic lobe advances, the gradient of the river channel becomes lower because the river channel is longer but has the same change in elevation (see slope). The answer to this question is:","output":"The Danube river's speed decreases more rapidly when it reaches the sea, as it has a larger delta and grows faster every year compared to the Volga river. This suggests the Danube river carries more sediment and deposits it more quickly, forming a larger delta."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Going about his day, Toddy, a performer at Chez Lui in Paris, sees Labisse, the club owner, auditioning a frail, impoverished soprano, Victoria Grant (Julie Andrews). After the audition, Labisse drily writes her off, and she responds by sustaining a pitch to shatter his wine glass using resonant frequency. That night, Richard comes to Chez Lui as part of a straight foursome and Toddy incites a brawl by insulting Richard and the women in his group. Labisse fires Toddy and bans him from the club. Walking home, he spots Victoria dining at a restaurant, and she invites him to join her. As neither of them can pay for the meal, she dumps a cockroach in her salad to avoid paying their check, but it escapes and the whole place breaks out in havoc.

Quintanilla. Kumbia All Starz are not to be confused with Los Kumbia Kings although some members are originally from Los Kumbia Kings. Their 2006 debut album \\"Ayer Fue Kumbia Kings, Hoy Es Kumbia All Starz\\" reached number one on United States Billboard's Latin Pop Albums chart, number one on the Top Latin Albums chart, and number sixty-eight on the United States \\"Billboard\\" 200.

It began as a courtship dance practiced among the African population on the Caribbean coasts of Colombia and Panama. It later mixed with Amerindian and European instruments, steps and musical characteristics and spread throughout Latin America and abroad. While other genres of Latin American music have remained associated with specific countries or regions, cumbia has grown to be one of the most widespread and unifying musical genres to emerge from Latin America.  - \`\` Rica y Apretadita '' is a song by Panamanian reggae singer El General featuring Anayca . The song was released in 1995 and is one of El General 's signature songs . \`\` Rica y Apretadita '' was later cover by Mexican - American cumbia group A.B. Quintanilla y Los Kumbia All Starz featuring Mexican - American singer Melissa Jiménez . It was released on May 20 , 2008 as the second single from their second studio album Planeta Kumbia ( 2008 ) . Ricky Rick and Melissa Jiménez provide the vocals .  - Edgardo Armando Franco, better known as El General, is a Panamanian reggae artist considered by some to be one of the fathers of \\"Reggae En Español\\". During the early 1990s, he initiated the Spanish spoken dancehall. Early examples of this were the international and somewhat mainstream songs, Te Ves Buena and Tu Pun Pun. Both songs, performed in Spanish rap, were very successful in North America. After getting his foot in the door of the commercial market, many other Spanish rappers became famous in the mainstream as well, such as Vico C and DJ Negro. He has a unique, easy to listen to style of dance music and has produced many well-known songs all over Latin America. His musical works have become popular in Latin America over the last few years. This style is called Reggae en Español, because he makes dancehall reggae music with Spanish-language lyrics.  - Los Kumbia Kings was an American Mexican cumbia group from Corpus Christi, Texas, created by A.B. Quintanilla and Cruz Martinez. Their music encompasses the styles of cumbia (hence their name), hip hop, and R&B. They produce songs in both Spanish and English. The band's producers from the beginning have been Quintanilla and Cruz Martínez. Quintanilla is the brother of the late \\"Queen of Tejano\\", Selena. Quintanilla played bass guitar for the group, while Martínez, husband of international artist Alicia Villarreal, played keyboards. Both co-wrote songs for the Kumbia Kings. Though the group has gone through a revolving door of members in recent years amid controversy and finger-pointing, and the Kumbia Kings of today are vastly different from what originated in Corpus Christi over eight years ago, Quintanilla and Martínez were always the soul of the group. Gone are original members Frankie J and DJ Kane, both of whom have gone on to significant success as solo artists, as well as the group K1 (Kingz One), a collaboration of founding members of Kumbia Kings who have defected from the group for reason of \\"internal dissension\\". Quintanilla, Irvin \\"Pee Wee\\" Salinas, as well as Selena's widower Chris Pérez, also decided to leave the group due to that same \\"internal dissension\\". Martínez kept Los Kumbia Kings but changed the name to Los Super Reyes for legal issues. In October 2009, Quintanilla and Martínez solved their differences, and announced that the Kumbia Kings would reunite for a series of concerts lasting from late 2009 through early 2010.  - Dancehall is a genre of Jamaican popular music that originated in the late 1970s. Initially dancehall was a more sparse version of reggae than the roots style, which had dominated much of the 1970s. Two of the biggest stars of the early dancehall era were Yellowman and Eek-a-Mouse. Dancehall brought a new generation of producers, including Linval Thompson, Gussie Clarke and Jah Thomas. In the mid-1980s, digital instrumentation became more prevalent, changing the sound considerably, with digital dancehall (or \\"ragga\\") becoming increasingly characterized by faster rhythms. (The word \\"bashment\\", a term originating in the 1990s, was used to describe a particularly good dance; for example \\"to go to a bashment dance\\".

Summarize this article: The US, Britain and others said Australia should stop turning back migrant boats and using offshore detention centres. The UN Human Rights Council conducts a review of every country's human rights record once every four years. The criticism comes amid  after the death of an asylum seeker who tried to escape. Australia asylum: Why is it controversial? More than 100 country representatives were critical of Australia's policies during the review including Sweden, Norway, Canada, Fiji, France, Germany and Switzerland. \\"We remain concerned about Australia's protection of the rights of migrants, especially of women and children at offshore facilities,\\" Turkey's delegate told the review, according to media reports. Australian officials, who were given opportunities to respond, argued that the country's controversial polices save lives by discouraging dangerous ocean voyages, and allow it to resettle more refugees. \\"The ensuring substantial and sustained reduction in maritime ventures as a result of Australia's managed approach to migration has resulted in Australia being able to resettle more refugees for our humanitarian programs,\\" said Steve McGlynn, according to the ABC. Australia began turning around migrant boats trying to reach its shores after the election of the current Liberal-National coalition government in 2013. Intercepted asylum seekers are sent to Christmas Island - an Australian territory in the Indian ocean, as well as Manus Island in Papua New Guinea and Nauru in the South Pacific. Iran and North Korea also reportedly voiced concern, according to Australia's Fairfax Media. Iran expressed its \\"deep concern about the mandatory immigration detention regime\\", according to the report. Sweden's delegate told the UN session Australia was the only country that used offshore processing and mandatory detention of irregular immigrants, according to ABC. Recently Australia announced a bid for a seat on the Human Rights Council for a three-year term starting in 2018. Domestically, asylum is a hot political issue. Polls have shown that a significant number of Australians approve of taking a tougher stance. The two biggest rival political groupings adopted tough policies ahead of the September 2013 polls. The Liberal-National coalition, which won, had campaigned in part on a \\"stop the boats\\" platform. The government says the journey the asylum seekers make is dangerous and controlled by criminal gangs, and they have a duty to stop it. However, critics say opposition to asylum is often racially motivated and is damaging Australia's reputation. Australia granted close to 13,800 refugee visas between 2013 and 2014. It granted about 20,000 visas between 2012 and 2013.","output":"The US, UK and other countries have asked Australia to stop turning back migrant boats and not use offshore detention centres.

Context: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Mary has been experiencing some health issues lately.  Hint: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to.

It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which of the two pieces of land has a high filtration capacity?  Hint: Alkali, or Alkaline, soils are clay soils with high pH (> 8.5), a poor soil structure and a low infiltration capacity. Often they have a hard calcareous layer at 0.5 to 1 metre depth. Alkali soils owe their unfavorable physico-chemical properties mainly to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate, which causes the soil to swell[1] and difficult to clarify/settle. They derive their name from the alkali metal group of elements, to which sodium belongs, and which can induce basicity. Sometimes these soils are also referred to as alkaline sodic soils. Alkaline soils are basic, but not all basic soils are alkaline. A:","output":"Given the information provided, Jim's land has clay soil with a high pH, which indicates it is an alkali or alkaline soil. As mentioned, alkali soils have poor soil structure and low infiltration capacity due to the dominating presence of sodium carbonate that causes the soil to swell and become difficult to settle.

He is told unequivocally: \\"No bicycle, no job.\\" His wife Maria pawns their bedsheets in order to get money to redeem his bicycle from the pawnbroker.Early on in the film, Ricci's coveted bicycle is stolen by a bold young thief who snatches it when he is hanging up a poster.Antonio thinks that the police will take the theft very seriously, but they are not really interested in the petty theft of a bike. The only option is for Antonio and his friends to walk the streets of Rome themselves, looking for the bicycle. After trying for hours with no luck, they finally give up and leave.Desperate for leads and with his better judgement clouded, Antonio even visits the dubious backstreet fortune teller that he had earlier mocked, in the hope that she may be able to shed light upon the bike's whereabouts. However, she merely doles out to him one of the truisms that form her stock in trade: \\"you'll find the bike quickly, or not at all.\\" Feeling cheated, a crestfallen Antonio hands over to her some of the last money that they have. After a rare treat of a meal in a restaurant, Antonio admits to his son that if he isn't able to work, they will simply starve.Antonio finally manages to locate the thief (who, it seems, had already sold the bicycle) and Bruno slips off to summon the police to the apartment. Antonio meanwhile, angrily accuses the thief of stealing his bike but the boy denies all knowledge of the crime. When the policeman arrives, he sees the accused boy lying on the floor feigning a seizure and surrounded by irate neighbours who blame Antonio's accusations for causing the \\"innocent\\" boy's fit.The policeman tells Antonio that although he may have seen the boy stealing the bike, he did...

Write a title for this article: The Obama administration responded Sunday to the prison release of a Mexican drug lord who was serving 40 years for the 1985 kidnapping, torture and murder of U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique “Kiki” Camarena. “We are deeply concerned by the release of Rafael Caro Quintero from prison in Mexico,” said National Security Council spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden. “We remain as committed today in seeing Quintero and others involved in this crime face justice in the United States as we were in the immediate aftermath of Kiki Camarena's murder and will work closely with the Mexican authorities on this.” The statement follows a lawyer for Mexican drug traffickers Ernesto Fonseca Carrillo, also imprisoned in the Camarena case, saying his legal team had filed an appeal based on the same procedural grounds used by Caro Quintero and that he expects his client to be freed within 15 days by a different court. Caro Quintero was released Friday by a Mexican court that overturned the conviction, saying he had been improperly tried in a federal court for state crimes. The Justice Department said it found the court's decision \\"deeply troubling.\\" \\"The Department of Justice, and especially the Drug Enforcement Administration, is extremely disappointed with this result,\\" the agency said in a statement. The Justice Department also said it \\"has continued to make clear to Mexican authorities the continued interest of the United States in securing Caro Quintero's extradition so that he might face justice in the United States.\\" The DEA said separately it \\"will vigorously continue its efforts to ensure Caro Quintero faces charges in the United States for the crimes he committed.\\" Caro Quintero still faces charges in the United States. The Mexican government said Friday it was reviewing what legal moves it might take in the case, according to The Wall Street Journal. The country’s attorney general's office said in a statement it disagrees with the immediate liberation and the court should have handed over the case to the proper court for review. The office also said Caro Quintero’s charges were too serious to free him without exhausting all legal channels. In recent years, Mexico has stepped up extraditions of alleged drug kingpins to the U.S., usually after they have served some prison time in Mexico, according to The Journal. The whereabouts of the 61-year-old Quintero is unclear, after serving 20 years and walking out of prison. The Association of Former Federal Narcotics Agents in the United States said it was \\"outraged\\" by Caro Quintero's early release and blamed corruption within Mexico's justice system. \\"The release of this violent butcher is but another example of how good faith efforts by the U.S. to work with the Mexican government can be frustrated by those powerful dark forces that work in the shadows of the Mexican 'justice' system,\\" the organization said in a statement. Mexican authorities did not release the full decision explaining the reasoning of the three-judge panel, in the western state of Jalisco, in setting free Caro Quintero. But some experts said the ruling may have been part of a broader push to rebalance the Mexican legal system in favor of defendants' rights, from both law-enforcement officials and the independent judicial system. Mexico's Supreme Court has issued several recent rulings overturning cases while saying due process wasn't followed. However, Mexican and current and former U.S. officials alike expressed deep skepticism that correct procedures were followed in the decision to free Caro Quintero. Caro Quintero was a founding member of one of Mexico's earliest and biggest drug cartels. He helped establish a powerful cartel based in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa that later split into some of Mexico's largest cartels, including the Sinaloa and Juarez cartels. But he wasn't tried for drug trafficking, a federal crime in Mexico. Instead, Mexican federal prosecutors, under intense pressure from the United States, put together a case against him for Camarena's kidnapping and killing, both state crimes. Mexican courts and prosecutors have long tolerated illicit evidence such as forced confessions and have frequently based cases on questionable testimony or hearsay. Such practices have been banned by recent judicial reforms, but past cases, including those against high-level drug traffickers, are often rife with such legal violations. Mexico's relations with Washington were badly damaged when Caro Quintero ordered Camarena kidnapped, tortured and killed, purportedly because he was angry about a raid on a 220-acre (89-hectare) marijuana plantation in central Mexico named \\"Rancho Bufalo\\" -- Buffalo Ranch -- that was seized by Mexican authorities at Camarena's insistence. Camarena was kidnapped in Guadalajara, a major drug trafficking center at the time. His body and that of his Mexican pilot, both showing signs of torture, were found a month later, buried in shallow graves. Caro Quintero was eventually hunted down in Costa Rica.

Istanbul, Turkey (CNN) -- One day after Syrian rebels accused government forces of a deadly bombing near a hospital in the besieged city of Aleppo, opposition groups said another 151 people had been killed in the fighting Thursday. The majority of those deaths occurred in the Syrian capital of Damascus and its suburbs, according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a London-based opposition group. Another 34 were killed in Aleppo, where some of the heaviest fighting has occurred. The 20-month civil war has claimed more than 42,000 lives, according to the latest tally from the opposition Center for Documentation of Violations in Syria. The group counts 3,133 government soldiers among the dead. A letter to","output":"the United Nations from the Syrian National Coalition, the main opposition group, called for an immediate investigation into the hospital bombing and urged the international community to take a stronger stance on the ongoing violence in the country. Amid growing concern over the mounting death toll and the deteriorating humanitarian situation, the UN Security Council convened an emergency session to discuss the escalating crisis. During the session, several member nations expressed their alarm at the continued bloodshed and urged for a united effort to address the situation. Despite the calls for action, the Council remained divided on the best course of action, with Russia and China backing the Syrian government and the United States, the European Union, and regional powers supporting the opposition forces. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres sternly condemned the hospital bombing and called upon all parties involved in the conflict to respect international humanitarian law and protect civilians. As the crisis worsened, the UN continued to push for a political solution to the conflict, amid growing fears that the violence could spill over into neighboring countries and further destabilize the region. Several international humanitarian organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross and Médecins Sans Frontières, stepped up their efforts to bring much-needed aid to those affected by the conflict, particularly to those displaced internally and refugees who sought shelter in neighboring countries. Despite the international response to the crisis, the violence in Syria continued unabated, as both government forces and opposition groups engaged in fierce battles for control over key territories. The relentless fighting deepened the suffering of ordinary Syrians and raised further questions over the future of the nation. As the conflict entered its third year, the persistence and intensity of the fighting spurred additional attempts by world leaders to broker a peace deal. Ultimately, diplomatic efforts, along with mounting pressure from the international community, led to the initiation of negotiations between the Syrian government and opposition forces. Under the auspices of the United Nations, representatives from both sides of the conflict came together for several rounds of talks in the Swiss city of Geneva. After months of intense negotiations, the parties finally reached a comprehensive peace agreement centered on a power-sharing deal and a roadmap for future democratic reforms in Syria. In the following months, the peace deal was implemented, as the warring factions agreed to a ceasefire, and a transitional government was formed with representatives from both the Syrian government and the opposition. The international community, led by the United Nations, played a crucial role in overseeing the transitional period, ensuring the implementation of agreed-upon initiatives, monitoring the ceasefire, and providing much-needed humanitarian assistance. The establishment of the transitional government marked the beginning of a long and arduous process of rebuilding the war-torn nation. With millions displaced and a devastated infrastructure, the challenges of reconstruction loomed large. However, the Syrian people's resilience, and the sense of solidarity and resolve from the international community, gave hope for a brighter future for a peaceful and united Syria."},{"instruction":"Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy in 1916 and continued there until his death? , can you please find it?   Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [kɑːl ˈnelsn̩]; 9 June 1865 – 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor yet musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. He premiered his Op. 1, Suite for Strings, in 1888, at the age of 23. The following year, Nielsen began a 16-year stint as a second violinist in the Royal Danish Orchestra under the conductor Johan Svendsen, during which he played in Giuseppe Verdi's Falstaff and Otello at their Danish premieres. In 1916, he took a post teaching at the Royal Danish Academy and continued to work there until his death. Although his symphonies, concertos and choral music are now internationally acclaimed, Nielsen's career and personal life were marked by many difficulties, often reflected in his music. The works he composed between 1897 and 1904 are sometimes ascribed to his \\"psychological\\" period, resulting mainly from a turbulent marriage with the sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen. Nielsen is especially noted for his six symphonies, his Wind Quintet and his concertos for violin, flute and clarinet. In Denmark, his opera Maskarade and many of his songs have become an integral part of the national heritage. His early music was inspired by composers such as Brahms and Grieg, but he soon developed his own style, first experimenting with progressive tonality and later diverging even more radically from the standards of composition still common at the time. Nielsen's sixth and final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, was written in 1924–25. He died from a heart attack six years later, and is buried in Vestre Cemetery, Copenhagen. Nielsen maintained the reputation of a musical outsider during his lifetime, both in his own country and internationally. It was only later that his works firmly entered the...

Background Paragraph: Reptiles are a class of animals comprising turtles, tuataras, lizards, snakes and crocodiles. They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw and eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi. The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.Lizards have skulls with only one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly attached which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off the ground by short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.Snakes are closely related to lizards, having branched off from a common ancestral lineage during the Cretaceous period, and they share many of the same features. The skeleton consists of a skull, a hyoid bone, spine and ribs though a few species retain a vestige of the pelvis and rear limbs in the form of pelvic spurs. The bar under the second fenestra has also been lost and the jaws have extreme flexibility allowing the snake to swallow its prey whole. Snakes lack moveable eyelids, the eyes being covered by transparent \\"spectacle\\" scales. They do not have eardrums but can detect ground vibrations through the bones of their skull. Their forked tongues are used as organs of taste and smell and some species have sensory pits on their heads enabling them to locate warm-blooded prey.Crocodilians are large, low-slung aquatic reptiles with long snouts and large numbers of teeth. The head and trunk are dorso-ventrally flattened and the tail is laterally compressed. It undulates from side to side to force the animal through the water when swimming. The tough keratinized scales provide body armour and some are fused to the skull. The nostrils, eyes and ears are elevated above the top of the flat head enabling them to remain above the surface of the water when the animal is floating. Valves seal the nostrils and ears when it is submerged. Unlike other reptiles, crocodilians have hearts with four chambers allowing complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood.

A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered. She asked me what I (middle-aged white guy) would do in a spot like that. All I could answer was to offer it up to God. Hot day, no air conditioning on the bus, people just want to get to their destinations. Question: What did Meg do after her anger simmered? Options:  A.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

Murray Newton Rothbard (; March 2, 1926 - January 7, 1995) was an American heterodox economist of the Austrian School, a historian, and a political theorist whose writings and personal influence played a seminal role in the development of modern right-libertarianism. Rothbard was the founder and leading theoretician of anarcho-capitalism, a staunch advocate of historical revisionism, and a central figure in the twentieth-century American libertarian movement. In 1953, in New York City, he married JoAnn Schumacher (1928-1999), whom he called Joey. JoAnn was his editor and a close adviser, as well as hostess of his \\"Rothbard Salon\\". They enjoyed a loving marriage, and Rothbard often called her \\"the indispensable framework\\" behind his life and achievements. According to Joey, patronage from the Volker Fund allowed Rothbard to work from home as a freelance theorist and pundit for the first fifteen years of their marriage. The Fund collapsed in 1962, leading Rothbard to seek employment from various New York academic institutions. He was offered a part-time position teaching economics to the engineering students of Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute in 1966, at age 40. This institution had no economics department or economics majors, and Rothbard derided its social science department as \\"Marxist.\\" However, Justin Raimondo writes that Rothbard liked his role with Brooklyn Polytechnic because working only two days a week gave him freedom to contribute to developments in libertarian politics.  Rothbard continued in this role for twenty years, until 1986. Then 60 years old, Rothbard left Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute for the Lee Business School at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where he held the title of S.J. Hall Distinguished Professor of Economics, an endowed chair paid for by a libertarian businessman. According to Rothbard's friend, colleague and fellow Misesian economist Hans-Hermann Hoppe, Rothbard led a \\"fringe existence\\" in academia, but was able to attract a large number of \\"students and disciples\\" through his writings, thereby becoming \\"the creator and one of the principal agents of the contemporary libertarian movement.\\" Rothbard maintained his position at UNLV from 1986 until his death. Rothbard founded the Center for Libertarian Studies in 1976 and the Journal of Libertarian Studies in 1977. In 1982, he co-founded the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn, Alabama, and was vice president of academic affairs until 1995. The Institute's Review of Austrian Economics, a heterodox economics journal later renamed the Quarterly Journal of Austrian Economics, was also founded by Rothbard in 1987.  After Rothbard's death, Joey reflected on Rothbard's happiness and bright spirit. \\"...he managed to make a living for 40 years without having to get up before noon. This was important to him.\\" She recalled how Rothbard would begin every day with a phone conversation with his colleague Llewellyn Rockwell. \\"Gales of laughter would shake the house or apartment, as they checked in with each other. Murray thought it was the best possible way to start a day.\\" Rothbard was irreligious and agnostic toward the existence of God, describing himself as a \\"mixture of an agnostic and a Reform Jew.\\" Despite identifying as an agnostic and an atheist, Rothbard was critical of the \\"left-libertarian hostility to religion\\". In Rothbard's later years, many of his friends anticipated that he would convert to Catholicism, but he never did. The New York Times obituary called Rothbard \\"an economist and social philosopher who fiercely defended individual freedom against government intervention.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they have a good marriage?","output":"Yes, they had a good marriage.

It's just a word, but for millions of Americans it brings much more than a word. Hot dogs. Cold beers. Sunny afternoons. Baseball is the game of fathers and sons. Fathers and sons catch with each other on lawns   in the US. A father's favorite team becomes his son's. Grandfathers talk to their grandsons about games played long ago. Many American kids collect baseball cards. The cards have pictures of their favorite players on them. In school, friends trade   baseball cards just like they trade their lunches. Players are known as \\"the boys of summer\\" because people often play the sport mostly in warm months. You don't need to be of a certain size or shape to play baseball.

A large hoard of coin moulds belonging to the Corieltauvi tribe have been uncovered in this area and dated to the late Iron Age. It was occupied by the Romans, and then by the Anglo-Saxons. The place-name Slioford first appears in 852, meaning \\"crossing over a muddy stream\\", in reference to the Slea. The settlement around the crossing came to be known as \\"Old\\" Sleaford in 13th-century sources to distinguish it from developments further west, around the present-day market place, which came to be known as \\"New\\" Sleaford. The origins of New Sleaford are not clear, leading to a theory that it was planted by the Bishop of Lincoln in the 12th century as a means of increasing his income, hence the epithet \\"New\\". The town's compass-point layout, the 12th-century date of St Denys' stonework and other topographical features offer evidence for this theory.A speculative reassessment of Domesday Book (1086) material suggests that St Denys' origins may be earlier. Two manors called Eslaforde (Sleaford) were recorded in the Domesday Book, one held by Remigius, Bishop of Lincoln, the other by Ramsey Abbey. The Bishop succeeded a Saxon thegn, Bardi, and held 11 carucates with 29 villeins, 11 bordars, 6 sokemen, a church and priest, as well as 8 mills, 1 acre of woodland, 320 acres (130 ha) of meadow and 330 acres (130 ha) of marsh. Ramsey Abbey had been granted land in Sleaford and surrounding villages before the Norman Conquest of England; in Domesday its fee consisted of 1 carucate, 1 sokeman, 2 villeins and 27 acres of meadow. It was sokeland of the abbot of Ramsey's manor of Quarrington, where he held two churches. There is no evidence for a second church at Quarrington, which suggests that the record is alluding to one in another of the abbot's manors for which Quarrington was an estate centre.

The process may seem intimidating, but with this step-by-step guide, you will master the art of preparing a perfectly stuffed pork tenderloin in no time. So, let's get started on this scrumptious journey. Step 1: Prepare the Pork Tenderloin Place the pork tenderloin on a clean, stable cutting board. Ensure that the pork is fresh and of high quality for the best results. Prepare your knife by sharpening it for an accurate and smooth cut. Step 2: Butterfly the Pork Tenderloin With a sharp knife, make a vertical cut down the length of the pork tenderloin, keeping the knife blade parallel to the cutting board. Stop the cut about 1 inch from the end of the tenderloin. The idea here is not to cut completely through the meat but to leave enough intact so that it can be opened up and laid flat like a book. Step 3: Flatten the Butterflied Pork  After you've butterflied the pork tenderloin, open it up and lay it flat on the cutting board. Use a meat mallet or a rolling pin to pound the meat gently and uniformly, aiming for an even thickness throughout. This step ensures that the pork tenderloin will cook evenly and allows for more space for the stuffing. Step 4: Chill the Meat  Once you have achieved the desired thickness, wrap the flattened pork tenderloin in plastic wrap and refrigerate it for about 30 minutes. Chilling the meat while you prepare the stuffing will help retain its shape and texture, ensuring a delicious outcome. Step 5: Prepare Your Favorite Stuffing  While the pork tenderloin is chilling, prepare your stuffing. You can choose any stuffing that you like, such as a classic mix of breadcrumbs, herbs, and spices, or a combination of vegetables, fruits, and nuts. Just make sure your stuffing complements the flavor of the pork. Step 6: Stuff and Roll the Pork Tenderloin  Remove the chilled tenderloin from the refrigerator and unwrap it. Place your prepared stuffing onto the flattened meat, spreading it evenly across the surface. Carefully roll up the tenderloin, encasing the stuffing, and ensuring that the stuffing stays inside the meat. Step 7: Tie the Stuffed Pork Tenderloin  Once rolled up, use butcher's twine to securely tie the stuffed pork tenderloin. The ties should be spaced about an inch apart to keep the shape of the stuffed tenderloin intact and ensure even cooking. Step 8: Cook the Stuffed Pork Tenderloin  Follow the cooking instructions in your chosen recipe, adjusting the cooking time based on the thickness of the meat and the type of stuffing used. Cooking methods can include roasting, grilling or even sous vide for more precise temperature control. Cook the tenderloin to an internal temperature of 145°F (63°C) for safe consumption, using a meat thermometer to verify the temperature. Conclusion: Now that you have successfully stuffed, rolled, and tied your pork tenderloin, you are ready to enjoy a delicious and satisfying meal. Serve your expertly prepared stuffed pork tenderloin with sides like mashed potatoes, asparagus, or a fresh green salad for a complete dining experience that will impress your family and friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution?","output":"In order to solve the equation -13 = -4*q + 3 for q, you will need to isolate the variable q by using algebraic operations. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do this: 1. Start with the given equation: -13 = -4*q + 3 2. Your goal is to get q alone on one side of the equation, so you want to get rid of the constant term on the right side (in this case, 3). To do this, subtract 3 from both sides of the equation. -13 - 3 = -4*q + 3 - 3 This simplifies to: -16 = -4*q 3. Now, you need to isolate q by getting rid of the coefficient in front of it (in this case, -4). To do this, divide both sides of the equation by -4.

The New York Lottery has had losers.","output":"To determine whether the statement \\"The New York Lottery has had losers\\" is true or not, let's analyze the information provided step by step: 1. The New York Lottery began in 1967. This information tells us the beginning of the New York Lottery, which implies it has been operating since then. 2. It is a part of the New York State Gaming Commission. This information confirms that it is an officially run lottery under the commission's umbrella. 3. It provides revenue for public education. This statement suggests that the lottery generates money, which typically comes from people participating and buying tickets. Based on this information, we can infer that people have been participating in the New York Lottery since 1967. In any game of chance such as a lottery, there are always winners and losers. The money generated from ticket sales comes from a large pool of participants, and only a few people win big prizes while the majority do not.  There isn't information explicitly stating that there have been losers; however, it's reasonable to conclude that the sentence \\"The New York Lottery has had losers\\" is true because, logically, a lottery system with participants and winners will inherently have losers as well."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Paragraph: Background An ongoing outbreak of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) started in December, 2019, in Wuhan, China. Information about critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection is scarce. We aimed to describe the clinical course and outcomes of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. Methods In this single-centered, retrospective, observational study, we enrolled 52 critically ill adult patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia who were admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Wuhan Jin Yin-tan hospital (Wuhan, China) between late December, 2019, and Jan 26, 2020. Demographic data, symptoms, laboratory values, comorbidities, treatments, and clinical outcomes were all collected. Data were compared between survivors and non-survivors. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality, as of Feb 9, 2020. Secondary outcomes included incidence of SARS-CoV-2related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and the proportion of patients requiring mechanical ventilation. Findings Of 710 patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia, 52 critically ill adult patients were included. The mean age of the 52 patients was 59·7 (SD 13·3) years, 35 (67%) were men, 21 (40%) had chronic illness, 51 (98%) had fever. vs 9 [45%] patients), and more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (30 [94%] patients vs 7 [35%] patients), either invasively or non-invasively. Most patients had organ function damage, including 35 (67%) with ARDS, 15 (29%) with acute kidney injury, 12 (23%) with cardiac injury, 15 (29%) with liver dysfunction, and one (2%) with pneumothorax. 37 (71%) patients required mechanical ventilation. Hospital-acquired infection occurred in seven (13·5%) patients. Interpretation The mortality of critically ill patients with SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia is considerable. The survival time of the non-survivors is likely to be within 1-2 weeks after ICU admission. Older patients (>65 years) with comorbidities and ARDS are at increased risk of death. The severity of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia poses great strain on critical care resources in hospitals, especially if they are not adequately staffed or resourced. Funding None.

Anthony Weiner, hours after he admitted to lying about posting an explicit photo on his Twitter account and carrying on inappropriate relationships with women he'd met online. Two Democratic sources said that Weiner, in a brief telephone conversation Monday with House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, made it abundantly clear that he was not going to resign. At his press conference later that day, the New York Democrat said that Pelosi was \\"not happy\\" but \\"also told me that she loved me and wanted us to ... pull through this.\\" Pelosi, D-California, who until last January was House speaker, reacted by calling for the chamber's Ethics Commission to open an investigation into the seven-term congressman \\"to determine whether any official resources were used or any other violation of House rules occurred.\\" Weiner apologizes for lying, 'terrible mistakes' Such a probe is rare, especially when called by a member of one's own party, the Democratic sources said. One question that is sure to be central to such an investigation is whether Weiner used congressional resources while sending -- as he admitted -- explicit photos and messages to \\"about six women\\" over a three-year period.

Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, chastised his fellow New Yorker for what he called \\"a deep personal failure and inappropriate behavior that embarrassed himself, his family and the House.\\" He threw his support behind the ethics probe \\"to remove all remaining doubt about this situation.\\" Katie Grant, the spokeswoman for House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, told CNN that \\"if there have been any questions regarding ethics that have been raised in the public sphere that the Ethics Committee should look at them.\\" But while some Democrats are touting the ethics probe as a bold and significant step, one Republican source calls it \\"hollow.\\" The GOP source said it is noteworthy that Pelosi called for an investigation but did not demand Weiner step down -- as happened with former Rep.

Pelosi reacted by calling for the Ethics Commission to investigate whether Weiner had violated any House rules or used any official resources for his illicit activities, a move that is rare especially when called by a member of one's own party. One key focus of the investigation would be to determine if Weiner had used congressional resources to communicate explicit photos and messages to these women over a three-year period. Despite Weiner claiming that he did not use any government resources for these affairs, stating specifically that his BlackBerry device was not government-paid, Pelosi and other Democrats, who were initially supportive of Weiner, backed the call for investigation.

Spokeswoman for House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, Katie Grant, expressed a similar sentiment, stating that the Ethics Committee should investigate any ethical issues that have been raised in the public sphere regarding Weiner's conduct. However, a GOP source described the move as \\"hollow\\", since Pelosi did not demand Weiner's resignation. This is in contrast to the case of former Rep.

How do you do this: Make a locket using a shotgun shell.","output":"Crafting a locket using a shotgun shell is a creative way to upcycle, and it can also serve as a unique piece of jewelry or keepsake. Prior to starting, please always remember that you should be careful when handling spent ammunition and should only use shotgun shells that have already been fired and are completely empty. It is always best not to try to dismantle a live or loaded shell since it's incredibly dangerous. Please ensure your own safety and engage in this project only if you are confident in doing so.  What You'll Need: 1. A spent shotgun shell 2. A picture to put in the locket 3. Jewelry glue or hot glue gun 4. Craft knife  5. Plier 6. Sandpaper  7. Locket bail and jewelry chain 8. Clear resin or clear, hard-drying glue 9. Protective gloves Steps: 1. Clean the Shotgun Shell: The first step is to clean your spent shotgun shell thoroughly. Use warm soapy water and a brush to scrub off any residue. Rinse well and let the shell air dry. 2. Cut the Shotgun shell: Once the shell is dry, cut around the circumference of the shell casing using a craft knife. The cut should be just above the middle of the shell - you want to keep as much of the decorative ‘brass’ part of the shell as possible. Be very careful while doing this step. 3. Create the Locket Top: After the shell is cut, you'll have two pieces. The part with the circular, concave end will make the top of the locket. If there's any sharp edge, use sandpaper to smooth it out. 4. Create Locket Bottom: The other piece forms the bottom of the locket, where the picture will go. You'll need to remove any remaining plastic lining or metal. You can use a small pair of pliers for this. 5. Glue the Picture: Once both parts are ready, cut your desired picture to match the inside of the bottom shell piece. Glue the picture into the base of the shell using jewelry glue or a hot glue gun. Allow the glue to dry. 6. Apply Resin or Clear Glue: After the glue holding the picture dries, apply a clear resin or clear, hard-drying glue over the picture to protect it and give the locket a nice, shiny finish. Make sure you cover the whole picture. Let this dry as well but make sure it's dry completely before moving on. 7. Attach the Locket Bail: Once everything is dry, you can attach the locket bail to the top part of the shell using your jewelry glue or hot glue gun. Remember to ensure that the glue is dried properly before moving on. 8. Assemble the Locket: Now you can place the top part onto the bottom part, it should sit nicely. If you want to be able to open and close the locket, consider using a metal hinge or latch, but this would make the project more advanced.  9. Add Chain: Finally, thread a jewelry chain through the locket bail. Voila! You have made your own unique and personalized shotgun-shell locket. Always remember to respect the nature of what you're working with, and make sure you're safe at all times."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write an article based on this \\"Police in Austria have arrested two people suspected of having links to the Paris attacks at a refugee shelter in Salzburg, prosecutors say.\\"","output":"Title: Suspected Paris Attack Affiliates Arrested in Austrian Refugee Shelter Introduction In a significant development with implications for European security, police in Austria have arrested two individuals suspected of having links to the 2015 Paris attacks, at a refugee shelter located in the city of Salzburg. This case has reignited the debate on the infiltration of terrorists amongst the refugee population, while highlighting the persistent challenges faced by security agencies in tracking down terror links across the continent. In this article, we will examine the details of this arrest, the Paris attacks context, the ongoing security challenges faced by Europe, and the potential implications on refugee policies in the region. Arrest Details Austrian prosecutors announced that two individuals were arrested at a refugee shelter in Salzburg, on suspicion of having connections with the November 2015 Paris attacks, which left 130 people dead and hundreds more injured. The identities of the arrested individuals have yet to be revealed, pending investigations. However, it has been confirmed that they were arrested on charges of 'participating in a terrorist organization.' Authorities have remained tight-lipped about further details, since the case touches upon sensitive issues of national and international security. The Paris Attacks Context On November 13, 2015, a series of coordinated terrorist attacks were carried out in Paris by members of the extremist group, the Islamic State (ISIS). The attackers targeted multiple locations, including the Bataclan Theatre, the Stade de France, and several cafés and restaurants. In total, 130 people lost their lives, and numerous others were injured. These attacks shocked the world and prompted several European countries, including Austria, to enhance cross-border security measures and intensify efforts to identify and apprehend potential affiliates and supporters of terrorist organizations. Security Challenges in Europe Europe has been grappling with the growing threat from terrorism over the past few years, with numerous attacks having been perpetrated across the continent. The rise of extremist groups like ISIS and their sophisticated recruitment tactics pose a significant challenge to security agencies. The terror threat intensified as an unprecedented influx of refugees sought asylum in Europe, escaping conflict zones like Syria and Iraq. Amidst this chaotic situation, there have been legitimate concerns that terrorists could be masquerading as refugees, exploiting the humanitarian crisis to gain entry into European countries. The refugee crisis has tested the security apparatus of European nations, which are now confronted with a dual challenge of providing humanitarian assistance to genuine refugees while also ensuring that potential terrorists are not allowed to slip through the cracks. This requires an unprecedented level of intelligence sharing, inter-agency cooperation, and effective border controls – which comes with its own set of logistical, legal, and personnel hurdles. Implications on Refugee Policies The arrest of the suspected Paris attack affiliates in Salzburg has once again put a spotlight on the potential risks associated with hosting refugees. Across Europe, concerns over the possibility of terrorists infiltrating refugee communities have already prompted a number of countries to tighten their asylum policies, adopt stricter vetting processes, and even close their borders. This latest development is likely to fuel further debate and may push some countries to adopt more conservative immigration policies. However, it is essential that measures to counter terrorism do not infringe upon the rights of genuine refugees, who are themselves victims of the same forces of extremism and violence that the international community seeks to combat. Policymakers must walk a fine line between ensuring security and upholding humanitarian principles, even as they confront the challenges posed by terrorism in a rapidly changing global landscape. Conclusion The arrest of two individuals in Salzburg, suspected of having links to the 2015 Paris attacks, underscores the ongoing threat of terrorism and represents a significant breakthrough for European security forces. As the situation continues to evolve, it is incumbent upon governments and security agencies across the continent to collaborate, share intelligence, and maintain comprehensive security measures – while also safeguarding the rights and welfare of legitimate refugees seeking safety and shelter in Europe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs  after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer. A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV)   radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics. John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light. The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn. The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes.

Answer:","output":"In the James Bond films between 1995's \\"Goldeneye\\" and 2002's \\"Die Another Day,\\" the character of Miss Moneypenny is portrayed by the talented British actress Samantha Bond. Samantha Bond is a well-regarded stage and screen actress who was born on November 27, 1961, in London, England. She comes from an acting family, as her parents Philip Bond and Pat Sandys were both actors, and her brother Matthew Bond is a journalist. Samantha studied at the prestigious Bristol Old Vic Theatre School in Bristol, England, before embarking on her professional acting career. She has appeared in various stage productions, television shows and films throughout her career, working with esteemed organizations like the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theatre. In 1995, Samantha Bond was approached to take on the iconic role of Miss Moneypenny in the James Bond film series. Miss Moneypenny is the secretary to M, the head of the British Secret Service and a recurring character in the James Bond series. Moneypenny is usually present in a supporting capacity, often providing some light relief and flirting with Bond. Her first appearance in the James Bond series was in \\"Goldeneye\\" (1995), opposite Pierce Brosnan as James Bond. This film marked not only Bond's return after a six-year hiatus but also a new era for the franchise, as both the character of Bond and Miss Moneypenny were updated for a more modern sensibility. Samantha Bond's portrayal of Miss Moneypenny was notable for updating the character with a more assertive personality, and her on-screen chemistry with Pierce Brosnan added a playful yet professional dynamic between the characters. She reprised the role in the three subsequent Bond films featuring Brosnan as 007: \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" (1997), \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" (1999), and \\"Die Another Day\\" (2002). These movies were widely successful and helped reestablish the Bond franchise as a contemporary and engaging action film series. After the last film with Brosnan, \\"Die Another Day,\\" the Bond franchise was rebooted once more with Daniel Craig taking on the iconic role. As a result, characters like Miss Moneypenny were recast, and the role was eventually played by actress Naomie Harris in \\"Skyfall\\" (2012) and subsequent films. In addition to her work in the James Bond series, Samantha Bond has enjoyed continued success both on stage and in television, with roles in popular series such as \\"Downton Abbey\\" and the British comedy \\"Outnumbered.\\" She has been nominated for several awards for her acting performances and continues to work as a highly regarded actress to this day."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Gud\\" A:","output":"It is difficult to determine a specific star rating based only on \\"Gud\\" without more context.

Eight years later, Norrington is promoted to Commodore and proposes to Elizabeth, but her corset makes her faint and fall into the sea. Captain Jack Sparrow comes to Port Royal to commandeer a ship, and rescues her. Norrington identifies Jack, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a blacksmith and swordsman. They duel, and Jack is captured and imprisoned. That night, the Black Pearl, which Elizabeth saw as a child, attacks Port Royal searching for the medallion. Pirates capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet Captain Barbossa for negotiations. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner, to conceal her identity as the governor's daughter, but Barbossa takes her prisoner. Elizabeth learns that after Barbossa's crew took the treasure of CortÃ©s from Isla de Muerta, they were cursed as immortals; they appear as heavily decomposed corpses in moonlight. To lift the curse, they need to return all 882 gold pieces with the blood of the owner of each piece. Elizabeth's medallion is the final piece. Will Turner frees Jack to rescue his love Elizabeth.

Please answer the following question: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance.

Input: Passage: The 6-3 Patriots played the 6-3 Indianapolis Colts and their rookie quarterback Andrew Luck. Though both offenses were potent, the Patriots ran roughshod over the Colts. The Colts took the opening drive 80 yards in 7 plays, added by a 40-yard defensive pass interference penalty on Kyle Arrington to score on a 1-yard touchdown run by Delone Carter. The Patriots countered, racing 81 yards in 8 plays, scoring on Brady's 4-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski(his 42nd consecutive game with a touchdown pass). The Colts retook the lead on their next drive, covering 84 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 14-yard touchdown pass from Luck to T. Y. Hilton. McCourty returned the ensuing kickoff 23 yards to the Patriots 25. From there the Patriots drove all the way to the Colts 18, but Gostkowski shanked a 36-yard field goal. After forcing a Colts three-and-out, Julian Edelman ran back the punt for a 68-yard touchdown, tying the game 14-14. On the Colts ensuing drive, Aqib Talib in his first game with New England following a trade from Tampa Bay, intercepted Luck on the first play and ran it back for a 59-yard touchdown, giving the Patriots a 21-14 lead. The Colts drove down the field again on their next possession, reaching the Patriots 29 and Adam Vinatieri was good from 47 yards, making the score 21-17. After returning the kickoff 29 yards to the 25, the Patriots drove all the way to the Colts 13, but could only add a 31-yard field goal for a 24-17 lead. The Colts drove to the Patriots 40 and attempted a 58-yard field goal right before halftime, but it was no good and the score remained 24-17. The Patriots received the opening kick-off of the second half and stormed 76 yards in 10 plays, scoring on a 2-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Edelman, increasing the lead to 31-17. The Colts almost caught a break when on the drive when Darius Butler forced Wes Welker to fumble,  but the ball rolled out of bounds, and the Patriots retained possession. The Colts drove to the Patriots 39 on their next drive, but punted rather than risk a 57-yard field goal attempt. On the second play of their next drive, Luck was stripped-sacked by Rob Ninkovich at the Colts 24-yard line. On the very first play of the Patriots ensuing drive, Brady connected with Gronkowski for a touchdown, increasing the lead to 38-17. The Colts just couldn't catch a break. Despite driving all the way to the Patriots 23, Luck was intercepted by Alfonzo Dennard, who returned it 87 yards for a touchdown on the first play of the fourth quarter, increasing the lead to 45-17. The Colts finally responded on their next drive, racing 74 yards in a mere 5 plays, with Luck throwing a 43-yard touchdown to T. Y. Hilton to cut the score to 45-24. However, the Patriots couldn't be stopped. The Patriots raced 80 more yards against an overwhelmed Colts defensive, scoring on Ridley's 1-yard touchdown run, upping the blowout to 52-24. Aided by a 49-yard punt return by Edelman, the Patriots moved 39 yards and scored on a Vereen 4-yard touchdown run, running up the score to 59-24. Gronkowski suffered a freak arm injury on kick-protection on the PAT. The Colts stormed to the Patriots 45 on their next drive, but Luck was intercepted Wilson at the Patriots 22, who it returned it 20 yards to the Patriots 42.  After a Patriots punt, the Colts ran out the rest of clock. Luck completed only 27/50 for 334 yards and 2 touchdowns but 4 interceptions. Hilton was his leading receiver with 6 catches for 100 yards. Vic Ballard rushed 16 times for 72 yards.  Tom Brady was excellent going 24/35 for 331 yards 3 touchdowns and 0 interceptions. Gronkowski was his leading receiver with 7 catches for 137 yards and 2 touchdowns. Edelman, Vereen, and Ridley combined for 115 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns.

Daoud Abdel Sayed (Arabic: داود عبد السيد‎ ‎   ] ) is an Egyptian director and screenwriter. He was born in Cairo in 1946. He started as the assistant of Youssef Chahine in The Land. He made several critically acclaimed films, and won several international awards notably for \\"The Land of Fear\\" which was produced in 1999. Can we draw the following conclusion? Daoud Abdel Sayed is a very wealthy man","output":"While it is known that Daoud Abdel Sayed is a successful and renowned director and screenwriter, the provided information does not give a concrete basis to conclusively determine that he is a very wealthy man.  Wealth does not necessarily equal success in a creative field such as film. Many factors contribute to an individual's wealth within the film industry including salary, residuals, and the financial success of their films. Award wins, critical acclaim, and fame can definitely contribute to a person's earning potential, but these factors alone do not guarantee wealth.  Additionally, wealth can be subjective and dependent on costs of living, personal expenditures, investments, and numerous other factors. Therefore, it is not always accurate to equate career success and wealth, especially with limited fiscal information. Furthermore, Sayed's wealthiness could also depend on the financial compensation structures within the Egyptian cinema industry. In some cases, directors may earn more from successful international sales, licensing agreements, or syndication deals rather than an initial salary. While Daoud Abdel Sayed's acclaimed career, and the resulting prestige and awards, suggest he might possibly have substantial earnings from his work, it's also possible he may have reinvested this capital into furthering his filmmaking or contributed it towards other ventures. It's important to remember that many successful people in the arts dedicate their earnings back into their passion projects, which might not always lead to personal wealth accumulation. Therefore, financial wealth may not necessarily be an accurate measure of their success. In cases such as these, career satisfaction, artistic expression, and crucial contributions to the art form can be seen as rewards in their own right. Hence, while it would not be unfeasible to imagine Daoud Abdel Sayed has earned a considerable income from his successful career, it is not possible to definitively conclude he is a very wealthy man based solely on this information. To come to a solid conclusion about Sayed's wealth, we would need more information about his personal finances, revenue from his films, and other potential income sources, which isn't provided here."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't worry, I'll break it down into simple steps, so it's easy for you to follow along. Let's start by going through the steps we'll take together to make this tasty bean feast! 1. Gather your supplies and ingredients. Before we start cooking, let's make sure we have everything we need. Ask a grown-up to help you collect the supplies and ingredients. You will need: - A pot (for cooking the beans) - A skillet or frying pan (for the yummy toppings) - Measuring cups and spoons - A large colander (to clean the beans) - A chopping board - A knife (with the help of a grown-up) - Tongs or a big spoon (for mixing everything together) Ingredients: - Beans (any kind you like!) - Water - Cumin seeds - Onion - Garlic - Ginger - Tomatoes - Chili powder (just a tiny bit for a little kick) - Turmeric - Garam masala (a warm and yummy spice mix) - Salt 2. Soak the beans. The first step to make our bean dish is to get them ready for cooking. With a grown-up's help, rinse the beans in the colander under running water. Then, let the beans take a little nap in a big bowl of water; they should be covered completely. They will soak up the water and become soft and friendly. Let them rest for a whole night or at least a few hours. 3. Cook the beans. After the beans are well-rested, they're ready to cook! Put them in a large pot with fresh water, and ask a grown-up to help you turn the heat on. When the water starts bubbling like a happy little fountain, lower the heat and let the beans cook until they are soft. Depending on the beans you use, this might take a while, so be patient! 4. Toast the cumin. While the beans are cooking, we can work on the toppings that will make our bean dish even yummier! Ask a grown-up to help you heat a skillet or frying pan. Then, gently spread the cumin seeds in the pan and let them dance around until they smell fragrant and delicious. 5. Sauté the onion, garlic, and ginger. Our cumin seeds are ready, so it's time to add more friends to the pan! With the help of a grown-up, chop the onion, garlic, and ginger into small pieces. Then, add them to the dancing cumin seeds and sauté (a fancy word for frying) them until they're golden brown and happy. 6. Add the tomatoes, chili powder, and turmeric. Now, chop the tomatoes into small pieces and add them to the party! Sprinkle in a tiny pinch of chili powder (just enough to make it a little spicy) and turmeric. Mix everything happily together and let it cook until the tomatoes become soft and juicy. 7. Add the beans to the sauté mixture. Our beans are cooked and ready to join the fun! Ask a grown-up to help you carefully add them to the pan with all the other ingredients. Stir everything together so that the beans make friends with all the yummy spices and veggies. 8. Season with garam masala and salt. Finally, sprinkle some garam masala and salt over our beautiful bean dish. Garam masala is a mix of warm spices that makes everything taste magical! Mix everything one more time, and voilà! Our delicious bean dish is ready to be enjoyed with family and friends. Congratulations, little buddy! You helped make a wonderful and healthy bean dish! Don't forget to thank the grown-up who helped you and share a plate while you're telling them about all the fun steps we did together!

So let's follow these steps: 1. First, we want to move the 22 to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 22 from both sides. So, it will look like this:    -14 - 22 = -18 * f 2. Now, let's do the subtraction on the left side:    -36 = -18 * f 3. Now, we want to get \\"f\\" all by itself. To do this, we will divide both sides by -18:    -36 / -18 = f 4.

Q:Given the following passage  \\"Another deck structure that can be seen is a ski-jump ramp at the forward end of the flight deck. This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\",  answer the following question.

Write a \\"ii.\\" movie review (pick from the following. i. negative; ii. positive;).","output":"ii. Positive Movie Review: The Shawshank Redemption Title: The Shawshank Redemption – A Timeless Masterpiece of Hope and Redemption Introduction: From the moment it was released in 1994, The Shawshank Redemption, directed by Frank Darabont and based on the novella \\"Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption\\" by Stephen King, has captivated audiences with its powerful storytelling, memorable characters, and a heartwarming message about the resilience of the human spirit. This review will explore why The Shawshank Redemption is hailed as one of the greatest films of all time. Step 1: Focus on story and themes The story follows the life of Andy Dufresne (played by Tim Robbins), a man accused of a crime he did not commit and sentenced to serve two consecutive life sentences at Shawshank State Penitentiary. During his time in prison, Andy forges an unlikely friendship with fellow inmate Ellis Boyd 'Red' Redding (played by Morgan Freeman). The film focuses on themes of hope, friendship, and redemption, which are masterfully woven together to create an unforgettable narrative. Step 2: Analyze performances Tim Robbins delivers an outstanding performance as the quiet and introspective Andy Dufresne. His portrayal of a man who is determined not to let his circumstances define him is captivating. Morgan Freeman, as Red, provides the film's narration and serves as the conscience of the story. His soothing voice and charismatic screen presence bring a sense of warmth and wisdom, making his character the perfect counterpoint to Andy. Step 3: Discuss cinematography and visuals The cinematography in The Shawshank Redemption enhances the film's emotive power. The use of shadows, color contrasts, and tracking shots effectively convey the passage of time and the oppressive atmosphere of the prison. Iconic scenes, such as Andy standing in the rain after crawling through the sewer pipe to freedom, are visually stunning and leave a lasting impression. Step 4: Praise the music and soundtrack The score by Thomas Newman perfectly complements the story's emotional journey. Hauntingly beautiful piano and string melodies capture the essence of hope and melancholy that permeate the film. Additionally, the inclusion of opera in a crucial scene provides an unexpected yet poignant reminder of the transformative power of art and the human spirit. Step 5: Comment on overall impact and legacy The Shawshank Redemption has left an indelible mark on the hearts and minds of viewers around the world. Its themes of hope, perseverance, and friendship continue to resonate with audiences. The film's iconic ending, which sees Andy and Red reunite on a sun-soaked beach in Zihuatanejo, serves as a powerful testament to the enduring human spirit and the belief that even the darkest of times can give way to a brighter, more hopeful future. Conclusion: In conclusion, The Shawshank Redemption stands the test of time as a cinematic masterpiece. Its captivating story, outstanding performances, stunning visuals, and soul-stirring music combine to create a film that is both emotionally resonant and deeply inspiring. The Shawshank Redemption is a powerful testament to the human spirit and an unparalleled example of the power of hope and redemption, earning its rightful place as one of the greatest films of all time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: A:","output":"It seems that the user has not provided an explicit recommendation of the product, as they mentioned that it was a gift, and they are unsure about the quality. However, there are a few key points in the review that give us some indication of their satisfaction with the product and service. Firstly, the user mentioned that they have not heard any complaints about the product. In the absence of negative feedback, we can infer that the recipient of the gift is likely satisfied with the product or has not encountered any issues that would prompt a complaint. In this sense, we can assume a neutral to positive leaning when it comes to the product's quality. Secondly, the user did mention that they appreciated the fast shipping. This indicates that they were pleased with the service provided by the seller or retailer, which is a crucial aspect of their overall experience with the product and may contribute to their willingness to recommend the product.

Christopher being the more superior art dealer.","output":"The sentence ends as: More art was sold by Steven than Christopher at the art gallery due to Steven being the more superior art dealer. To elaborate on this statement, we can consider various factors that contributed to Steven's success in selling more art compared to Christopher.  1. Expertise: Steven, being the more superior art dealer, might have a better understanding and deeper knowledge of the pieces he is selling. This expertise allows him to communicate effectively with potential buyers, explaining the significance of the art and its value, therefore convincing them to make a purchase. 2. Network and connections: A successful art dealer often has a vast network of connections within the art community, including collectors, fellow dealers, artists, and other industry professionals. By leveraging these connections, Steven could have attracted more potential buyers to the art gallery, leading to increased sales. 3. Reputation: Steven's reputation as a prominent and respected art dealer may also have contributed to his success in selling more artwork. As collectors and buyers often seek guidance and validation from industry experts, they might prefer to work with Steven due to his standing in the community, leading to higher sales. 4. Presentation and marketing: As a superior art dealer, Steven may also possess better skills in presenting and marketing the artwork at the gallery. This includes arranging the art pieces in a visually appealing manner, providing informative catalogs and descriptions, and employing effective marketing strategies to engage potential buyers. 5. Client relationships: Another crucial aspect that may have contributed to Steven's success is the ability to build and maintain strong client relationships. As a superior art dealer, Steven likely has excellent communication skills and empathizes with the needs and preferences of his clients. His ability to tailor his sales approach according to individual clients could have played a key role in selling more art compared to Christopher. 6. Negotiation skills: In the art world, negotiation skills are critical in closing deals, especially when dealing with valuable and high-priced pieces. Steven, as a more superior art dealer, likely possesses these skills, which would have helped him sell more artwork by navigating and resolving price-related concerns effectively. In conclusion, the sentence highlights that Steven's success in selling more art than Christopher at the art gallery is attributed to his superior abilities and skills as an art dealer. This superiority manifests through a combination of expertise, connections, reputation, presentation and marketing skills, strong client relationships, and effective negotiation abilities, all of which contributed to higher art sales."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Read the bio below and try to give details on ruth millar 's:    - birth name       - birth date     - name     - birth place     Bio: ruth laura millar -lrb- born in 1975 newton mearns , near glasgow , scotland -rrb- is a scottish actress , writer and producer .

Would \\"There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake ( above sea-level).\\" be a reasonable answer? pick from the following. (I) No; (II) Yes; Answer:","output":"(I) No; The first canal in Panama was located at the narrowest point of the Isthmus of Panama, which connects North and South America. However, the statement \\"There are locks at each end to lift ships up to Gatun Lake (above sea-level)\\" is specifically a description of one of the engineering features of the current Panama Canal and is not directly related to the location of the canal itself. The Panama Canal, which connects the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, is a 50-mile long waterway that took over a decade to build, from 1904 to 1914. The idea for constructing a canal in Panama can be traced back to the early 16th century when King Charles I of Spain ordered a survey to determine the feasibility of creating a water passage through the American continent. However, it wasn't until the late 19th and early 20th centuries that serious efforts were made to build the canal due to advances in technology and engineering. The French were the first to attempt building the Panama Canal in 1881, which was led by Ferdinand de Lesseps, the same engineer responsible for the Suez Canal. The French project faced major setbacks, including the difficult terrain, tropical diseases, and engineering challenges. By 1889, the project was abandoned, and tens of thousands of workers had died. The United States later took over the project in 1904 and succeeded in completing the canal using a more effective approach. The statement you provided refers to the current engineering marvel of the Panama Canal, which includes a system of locks to overcome the differences in sea level between the two oceans and to manage the elevation change between coasts. The Gatun Lake mentioned in the statement is an artificial lake that was created as part of the canal construction process, which not only serves as a transit route for ships but also supplies water for the operation of the canal’s locks. Overall, the first canal in Panama was located at the Isthmus of Panama. While the statement about the locks and Gatun Lake is informative, it does not directly address the question about the location of the first canal."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

He has been a member of the band ever since it began, and is still fully contributing to their album composition and touring.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  The placenta is a spongy structure. It consists of membranes and blood vessels from both mother and embryo (see Figure below ). The placenta passes oxygen, nutrients, and other useful substances from the mother to the fetus. It also passes carbon dioxide and other wastes from the fetus to the mother. The placenta lets blood from the fetus and mother exchange substances without actually mixing. Thus, it protects the fetus from being attacked by the mother’s immune system as a “foreign parasite. ”.

Mineral deficiency involves the diminished values of minerals. Mineral deficiency is a condition that arises when the diminished values of essential minerals in the human body fall below the necessary levels required for optimal health and well-being. Minerals are crucial elements required to carry out numerous physiological functions, such as maintaining fluid balance, forming bones and teeth, synthesizing proteins, and conducting nerve impulses. There are several factors that can contribute to mineral deficiency, including: 1. Poor dietary habits: Not consuming enough mineral-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, and seeds, can lead to a lack of essential minerals in the body. 2. Soil depletion: The depletion of essential minerals from the soil due to excessive agricultural practices can result in the reduced mineral content of the crops grown in such soil. 3. Malabsorption issues: Certain health conditions, such as celiac disease, Crohn's disease, or gut inflammation, can impair the body's ability to absorb minerals properly. 4. Increased mineral requirements: During certain life stages, such as pregnancy, lactation, and periods of rapid growth, the body's mineral requirements increase, resulting in a higher likelihood of deficiency if the increased needs are not met. 5. Interactions between minerals: Some minerals can compete with one another for absorption, leading to a deficiency in one if there is an excess of another. 6. Medications: Certain medications can interfere with the absorption, utilization, or excretion of minerals, resulting in a deficiency. Mineral deficiencies can manifest themselves through a variety of symptoms, depending on the specific mineral involved. For instance, a lack of calcium in the diet can lead to osteoporosis, while inadequate magnesium intake might result in muscle cramps, weakness, or insomnia. Similarly, a deficiency in iron could lead to anemia, which typically presents with fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath. Preventing and treating mineral deficiencies typically involve improving dietary habits to incorporate more mineral-rich foods, ensuring that the soil used for agriculture is appropriately replenished with essential minerals, addressing any underlying health issues that may be contributing to malabsorption, and consulting healthcare professionals to assess the potential impact of medications on mineral status. In some cases, supplements may be recommended to help address mineral deficiencies. However, it is crucial to consult with a healthcare professional before beginning any supplementation regimen, as the appropriate dosage, potential interactions with other medications, and the specific form of the mineral supplement must be taken into consideration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who portrayed the leading men of his day? is inside the article: James Barton Longacre (August 11, 1794 – January 1, 1869) was an American portraitist and engraver, and the fourth Chief Engraver of the United States Mint from 1844 until his death. Longacre is best known for designing the Indian Head cent, which entered commerce in 1859, and for the designs of the Shield nickel, Flying Eagle cent and other coins of the mid-19th century. Longacre was born in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, in 1794. He ran away to Philadelphia at age 12, where he became an apprentice in a bookstore. His artistic talent developed and he was released to apprentice in an engraving firm.  He struck out on his own in 1819, making a name providing illustrations for popular biographical books. He portrayed the leading men of his day; support from some of them, such as South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun, led to his appointment as chief engraver after the death of Christian Gobrecht in 1844. In Longacre's first years as a chief engraver, the Philadelphia Mint was dominated by Mint Director Robert M. Patterson and Chief Coiner Franklin Peale. Conflict between Longacre and the two men developed after Congress ordered a new gold dollar and double eagle, with both to be designed by Longacre.  Peale and Patterson nearly had Longacre fired, but the chief engraver was able to convince Treasury Secretary William M. Meredith that he should be retained.  Both Patterson and Peale left the Mint in the early 1850s, ending the conflict. In 1856, Longacre designed the Flying Eagle cent. When that design proved difficult to strike, Longacre was responsible for the replacement, the Indian Head cent, issued beginning in 1859. Other coins designed by Longacre include the silver and nickel three-cent pieces, the Shield nickel, the pattern Washington nickel, and the two-cent piece.  In 1866–1867, he redesigned the coins of Chile. Longacre died suddenly on New Year's Day 1869; he was succeeded by William Barber.  Longacre's coins are generally well-regarded today, although they have been criticized for lack of artistic..., can you guess it ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the article, the last name of the person who portrayed the leading men of his day is Longacre.

He popularized the classification of birds on the basis of the quinarian system.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)?

It was largely developed by the entomologist William Sharp MacLeay in 1819. The system was further promoted in the works of Nicholas Aylward Vigors, William John Swainson and Johann Jakob Kaup.

In 1829 he published \\"Skizze zur Entwickelungsgeschichte der europäischen Thierwelt\\", in which he regarded the animal world as developed from lower to higher forms, from the amphibians through the birds to the beasts of prey; but subsequently he repudiated this work as a youthful indiscretion, and on the publication of Darwin's \\"Origin of Species\\" he declared himself against its doctrines.

Thomas Wesley Pentz (born November 10, 1978), better known by his stage name Diplo, is an American DJ, record producer, rapper and songwriter based in Los Angeles, California. He is the co-creator and lead member of the electronic dancehall music project Major Lazer, and along with producer and DJ Skrillex, part of the electronic duo Jack U. He founded and manages record company Mad Decent, as well as co-founding the non-profit organization Heads Decent. Among other jobs, he has worked as a school teacher in Philadelphia. Diplo's first collaborative full-length record was with Switch, this time under the guise of Major Lazer. Diplo (Philadelphia-based DJ and producer Wesley Pentz), incorporates such disparate influences as Miami Bass and Baile Funk into the high-tech eclecticism of his productions. After landing a deal with Downtown Records before even recording a note of music, Diplo and Switch set out for Jamaica to record a project that, like most of Diplo's projects before it, would highlight the little-known subgenres, this time of Jamaica's dancehall scene. The two received support by many already established Jamaican artists such as Vybz Kartel, Elephant Man and Ms. Thing, and the resulting record Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do also featured vocals from Santigold, Amanda Blank, Nina Sky, Ricky Blaze and more. When discussing the Major Lazer project, Diplo described the dancehall sound as being \\" the end of the world, all the little influences--house, soca, oldies, R&B, jazz--it all ends up in Jamaica.\\" The track \\"Pon De Floor\\" from Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do was sampled for Beyonce's single \\"Run the World (Girls)\\".  Major Lazer's first album was followed up with an EP, Lazers Never Die, which was released in 2010. Switch left Major Lazer in 2011, and was replaced by DJs Jillionaire and Walshy Fire. A second album, Free the Universe, was scheduled to be released in November 2012 but was delayed to February 2013, and then to April 15. It features artists such as Ezra Koenig, Bruno Mars, Ward 21, Wyclef, The Partysquad, Shaggy, Tyga, Flux Pavilion and Wynter Gordon. On February 8, 2015, during the Grammy Award ceremony, Diplo revealed details of the third Major Lazer album. He confirmed that the album would incorporate artists such as Ariana Grande, Ellie Goulding and Pusha T. It is called Peace Is the Mission. The first single, \\"Lean On\\", is a collaboration with French producer DJ Snake and features vocals from Danish recording artist MO. The second single, \\"Powerful\\", featuring Ellie Goulding and Tarrus Riley, was released simultaneously with the album on June 1, 2015. On November 11, 2015, \\"Lean On\\" became Spotify's Most Streamed Song of All Time with over 800 million streams to date. Along with the streaming title, the official video for \\"Lean On\\" became one of the most viewed videos on YouTube. It currently has more than 2 billion views. Along with the streaming and viewing milestones, \\"Lean On\\" would also go on to achieve double platinum status.  On July 22, 2016, the group released the single \\"Cold Water\\", a collaboration with Canadian artist Justin Bieber and Danish singer MO. The track has already reached over 200 million streams on Spotify, and achieved international commercial success, reaching number one in multiple countries. Their upcoming album, Music is the Weapon, is set to be released in 2016 with collaborations including Sia, The Weeknd and Ty Dolla Sign.

What is is a Japanese collectible card game that embody's the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game for entertainment or for educational, exercise, or experimental purposes and was published by Konami  ? Answer:","output":"The Japanese collectible card game that embodies the art of applying design and aesthetics to create a game for entertainment or for educational, exercise, or experimental purposes, and was published by Konami, is Yu-Gi-Oh! Trading Card Game (TCG).  Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG was first launched in Japan in 1999, and it is based on the fictional game of Duel Monsters, which is a central theme in the original Yu-Gi-Oh! manga series created by Kazuki Takahashi. The game involves players using a combination of Monster, Spell, and Trap cards to strategically defeat their opponent by reducing their Life Points to zero or causing them to run out of cards in their deck. The Yu-Gi-Oh! TCG has since gained widespread international popularity, with numerous expansions, competitive tournaments, and an animated television series dedicated to it. The game's mechanics and aesthetic design are influenced by ancient Egyptian mythology, various historical and mystical elements, as well as the concept of strategy and dueling. The artwork and lore on the cards play a significant role in the game's appeal, alongside the strategic depth and competitive nature of the gameplay."},{"instruction":"I heard that Leed turned their eyes away from the scary movie on TV.

Just when it was easy to assume that a costume drama about royalty couldn't go anywhere, we are given a treat, a moving and intelligent drama anchored by strong and charismatic performances by Emily Blunt, a marvel in the leading role, Paul Bettany, Rupert Friend, Miranda Richardson, and Mark Strong, as the immediate forces that help shape the development of one of England's most powerful monarchs. \\"The Young Victoria\\" dramatizes the tumultuous transition of the young woman into power. Emily plays the queen, with a good combination of raw strength and innocence, someone who recognizes the complexity of the task at hand, but who possesses enough confidence to move forward. She is able to portray Victoria, as an astute young woman who knows she needs support from some key players and must be able to stand up to those who might now have her best interests at hand. Victoria must fend a barrage of intrusions on her way to the crown, and even when she takes command of her new position, she discovers the road to self sufficiency will depend on making some very important decisions and of course, the right support. Luckily for Victoria, there is Albert, a man who appears to like her and is her soul mate. There is amazing chemistry between the two performers, and there's little doubt what the outcome will be, but there is the figure of Bettany's Prime Minister, a man who provides Victoria with some wise support and is also fond of her. Miranda Richardson and Mark Strong shine in supporting roles as two parties who might be of questionable character and exert a considerable amount of power in the upbringing of the young girl. Every one of the supporting characters could use a bit more of development, but what we can see in the screen might be enough to keep us focused on the central character and a superb performance by Blunt, an actress who has shown enough fire and passion in previous performances. In here, she is given the breakout role of her career, a real life historical figure, who broke the rules and managed to rule for a very long time. She shows the seeds of the strength and character the monarch might have needed in her later years. She also has a sweetness and innocence that became the foundation of her charitable work and future intervention in social changes. \\"The Young Victoria\\" is not a royal epic portrayal of England's ruling class. It is an intimate story of how human beings grow up and whatever special circumstances surround and shape them. In the end, the movie is a lovely entry in a year that has shown much emphasis on war and destruction. In here, there is a message that good writing and good mediation can take us very far, and there is of course, a good old fashioned love story. Choose your answer.

Q: Yes; I have a rare form of cluster/ice pick headaches that can affect any part of my body. It’s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as “beeping.” Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn’t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn’t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I’ve been on them for a few years now, and it’s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn’t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel. Now I’m considering finally getting my license (considering - I still don’t like being behind the wheel), I don’t double over in white hot pain randomly anymore, and when I do get a cluster headache, I can still function. It almost sounds a little silly, but really, they were crippling, and being able to work through them on my own? It’s the greatest gift I’ve given to myself.

What would happen to the force of gravity between two soccer balls if Jim moved them farther apart it would increase or it would decrease? A:","output":"If Jim moved the two soccer balls farther apart, the force of gravity between them would decrease.  This is because the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them, as described by Newton's law of universal gravitation: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 In this case, the masses of the soccer balls (m1 and m2) remain constant, but the distance between them (r) increases. As the denominator in the formula (r^2) gets larger, the overall force of gravity (F) decreases.

Here are some examples. In the United States at the moment the three most popular names for girls are Emily,Emma and Madison. For boys,they are Michael,Joshua and Mathew. In Britain a parent today might call their little girl Grace,Jessica or Ruby. If they have a little boy they could call him Jack,Thomas or Oliver. In China names have very clear meanings. If a girl is called Mei,her name means \\"beautiful\\". If a boy is called Wu,his name means \\"like a soldier\\". Names in Englishspeaking countries are like this too. The girl's name Joy is probably partly chosen because the parents wish their daughter to be joyful and bring joy to others. If a girl is called Ruby,it may be because of the beautiful red precious stone. Parents often pick names that can be shortened. This can be confusing for Chinese people. Parents might choose such names because they want to be able to speak to their kid in a personal way. For example,a popular name is William. But William can be shortened to Will,Willy,Bill and Billy. The same is true of the favourite old name for a girl,Elizabeth. Elizabeth can be shortened to Beth,Liza and Liz. Another reason why kids get the names they do is that parents want to name their boy or girl after someone who is famous,such as an actor,a pop music star or a sports star.

Write an article based on this \\"Four men from Luton have been charged under the Terrorism Act with encouraging support for the so-called Islamic State group, the Metropolitan Police has said.\\"","output":"Title: Luton Men Charged with Encouraging Support for the Islamic State Group – A Detailed Insight Introduction Four men from Luton, a large town in Bedfordshire, England, have been charged under the Terrorism Act for allegedly encouraging support for the so-called Islamic State group (IS), as reported by the Metropolitan Police. This news highlights the ongoing threat of radicalisation and terrorism, drawing attention to the steps being taken by law enforcement agencies to counter and prevent such activities in the United Kingdom. Background on the Islamic State Group (IS) The Islamic State group, also known as ISIS, ISIL, or Daesh, is an extremist militant group that has its origins in the early 2000s. It gained worldwide notoriety in 2014 when it overran large parts of Iraq and Syria, imposing its radical interpretation of Sharia law on millions of people. At its peak, the group controlled territories spanning two countries and threatened to destabilise the entire region before losing most of its controlled territories in 2017. The group has been responsible for numerous human rights abuses, including mass executions, sexual enslavement, and the destruction of cultural heritage sites. IS has inspired or directed thousands of individuals worldwide to participate in terrorism and has claimed responsibility for attacks in European cities such as Paris, Brussels, and Manchester, among many others. The group's activities have led to international military campaigns and an ongoing focus by governments and security agencies, such as the United Kingdom's Counter Terrorism Command (CTC), to prevent, disrupt and prosecute any individual or group attempting to provide material or ideological support to the group. Charges Under the Terrorism Act The four Luton men are specifically charged with encouraging support for IS, a violation of Section 12 of the United Kingdom's Terrorism Act 2000. This section covers offences related to inviting support for a proscribed organisation, such as incitement, promotions, and recruitment activities for the organisation. Individuals found guilty of this offence may face a prison sentence of up to 14 years and potentially, an unlimited fine. Charges like these send a clear message that encouraging support for or spreading extremist ideologies will be met with severe consequences, reflecting the government's strong stance against any organisation that threatens the security and stability of the country or its international partners. Countering Radicalisation and Terrorism in the UK The United Kingdom has been at the forefront of efforts to dismantle extremist groups like the Islamic State. Various initiatives have been implemented to counter the dissemination of radical ideologies both online and offline, ultimately aiming to prevent vulnerable individuals from being recruited into terrorist organisations. One of these initiatives is the government's CONTEST strategy, which comprises four work streams: Prevent, Pursue, Protect, and Prepare. The Prevent programme specifically focuses on stopping people from supporting terrorism by providing early intervention and support to individuals who may be at risk of radicalisation. In addition to legislation against terrorism support, the government has also increased its funding for intelligence and security agencies, which are responsible for detecting and neutralising terrorist threats. This has led to arrests, disruption of extremist networks, and targeted interventions. Online platforms have also become a focus for countering radicalisation and terrorism. Social media companies and internet service providers have been encouraged to be more active in identifying and removing content that promotes terrorism, as well as monitoring for extremist activities. The introduction of new cyber laws and amendments to existing ones has enabled law enforcement agencies to keep pace with the evolving tools and tactics used by terrorist organisations. Conclusion The recent charges against the four men from Luton highlight the ongoing challenges faced by law enforcement and security agencies in combatting radicalisation and terrorism in the United Kingdom and beyond. The terrorism charges reflect a strong stance against those who encourage support for extremist groups like the Islamic State, sending a clear message that any form of support for such organisations will not be tolerated. Eliminating the threat posed by terrorism and radicalisation requires continued vigilance, government investment in security initiatives, and collaboration between communities, security agencies, and the private sector. The case of these Luton men serves as a reminder of the importance of this combined approach in ensuring public safety and upholding democratic values."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Light is an awesome director of your body's natural clock. Light naturally makes you wake up and dark naturally makes you tired. Select from: (A). The most common types of natural light there are : E-lamps air conditioners a gas stove an electric fan Install an alarm clock for school. You can either set it to be hitting your clock back and forth, or, you can simply turn the clock up to keep it going. (B). All this power actually comes from the natural way light changes your brain's circadian rhythm, which is what happens when your body's sleep clocks are shut off. Most teens will start waking up in the morning, but some teens will wake up before one. (C). The natural light shifts your body clock to sleep mode, which naturally starts the fall and finish cycle. Put a set of egg whites and a little lemon juice in your kids' room, or use aromatherapy oils like pine or rosemary infused oils. (D). Because not all areas of the globe will actually have the sun at the times you want to get up and go to bed, using a natural light lamp can work just as well. Some of these lights also have built-in sounds that can be played while your kids are falling asleep.","output":"Option D, incorporating a natural light lamp, is the ideal continuation of the paragraph on how to get your child out of bed in the morning. A natural light lamp is an excellent alternative when natural sunlight is not available or sufficient during your desired wake-up time. These lamps can simulate the sunrise by gradually increasing the light intensity, which in turn helps regulate the body's natural clock, known as the circadian rhythm. By adjusting your child's circadian rhythm to align with their waking routine, you can encourage a more natural and easier wake-up process. Furthermore, some natural light lamps come equipped with built-in sounds, such as bird songs or soothing nature sounds, that can be played while your kids are falling asleep. These additional features can not only promote relaxation during bedtime but also foster a pleasant wake-up experience when the light and sounds gradually intensify to signal the start of a new day. Besides using a natural light lamp, maintaining a consistent sleep schedule and creating a calming bedtime routine are crucial factors in promoting healthy sleep patterns for your child. This includes discouraging screen time close to bedtime, as the blue light emitted from screens can interfere with the natural production of melatonin, a hormone responsible for regulating sleep-wake cycles. In summary, to help your child wake up more easily and naturally in the morning, consider installing a natural light lamp in their bedroom. This effective tool regulates the body's circadian rhythm in the absence of actual sunlight and can be enhanced with soothing sounds for both bedtime and morning routines, fostering a seamless transition between sleep and wakefulness. Coupled with a consistent sleep schedule and a relaxing bedtime environment, your child will be better equipped to embrace both restful nights and energetic mornings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Introduction Plants have evolved different reproductive strategies for the continuation of their species. Some plants reproduce sexually, and others asexually, in contrast to animal species, which rely almost exclusively on sexual reproduction. Plant sexual reproduction usually depends on pollinating agents, while asexual reproduction is independent of these agents. Flowers are often the showiest or most strongly scented part of plants. With their bright colors, fragrances, and interesting shapes and sizes, flowers attract insects, birds, and animals to serve their pollination needs. Other plants pollinate via wind or water; still others self-pollinate.   Q: Unlike plants, animal species rely almost exclusively on what type of reproduction?

Kent village remained  traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. Long Grove on the other hand took a wider perspective and created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all played an important role in developing Long Grove village.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which village took a more complex approach to rural development?  Hint: Rural development is the process of improving the quality of life and economic well-being of people living in rural areas, often relatively isolated and sparsely populated areas.[1]  Rural development has traditionally centered on the exploitation of land-intensive natural resources such as agriculture and forestry. However, changes in global production networks and increased urbanization have changed the character of rural areas. Increasingly tourism, niche manufacturers, and recreation have replaced resource extraction and agriculture as dominant economic drivers.[2] The need for rural communities to approach development from a wider perspective has created more focus on a broad range of development goals rather than merely creating incentive for agricultural or resource based businesses. Education, entrepreneurship, physical infrastructure, and social infrastructure all play an important role in developing rural regions.[3] Rural development is also characterized by its emphasis on locally produced economic development strategies.[4] In contrast to urban regions, which have many similarities, rural areas are highly distinctive from one another. For this reason there are a large variety of rural development approaches used globally.[5]  Rural development is a comprehensive term. It essentially focuses on action for the development of areas outside the mainstream urban economic system. we should think of what type of rural development is needed because modernization of village leads to urbanization and village environment disappears.

Former Attorneys General say Justice Department's AP operation highly unusual The Justice Department is obligated to investigate leaks that could endanger national security, but the secret seizure of Associated Press telephone records – called a \\"massive and unprecedented intrusion\\" by the news organization – is unusual, according to two former attorneys general. The Associated Press announced Monday that the DOJ obtained two months of telephone records of reporters and editors without the news organization's knowledge. The records obtained by the department listed outgoing calls for the work and personal phone numbers of individual reporters, for general AP office numbers in New York, Washington and Hartford, Conn., and for the main number for the AP in the House of Representatives press gallery, according to attorneys for the AP. While the subject of the probe remains unknown, the news organization suggests it may have been related to a May 7, 2012, AP story about a foiled terror plot. Officials have previously said in public testimony that the U.S. attorney in Washington is conducting a criminal investigation into who may have provided information for the AP's story, which disclosed details of a CIA operation in Yemen that stopped an Al Qaeda plot in the spring of 2012 to detonate a bomb on an airplane bound for the U.S. - Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, who served in the Bush administration, said Tuesday that the Justice Department is \\"obligated\\" to investigate leaks of classified information that may pose a threat to national security. Gonzales, however, declined to elaborate further, noting that the facts of the DOJ's investigation are still emerging. Gonzales called such probes \\"fairly unusual,\\" but said they are necessary if information given to journalists relates to \\"something that is threatening the national security of our country or the lives of American citizens. \\"Let's say that a publication runs a story identifying the names of CIA agents overseas,\\" Gonzales told FoxNews.com. \\"Obviously that's a violation of law and a serious breach of national security. In that case, the department would feel obligated to do everything it possibly could to uncover the leak.\\" Gonzales said under the Bush administration, such an investigation would have required the approval of a deputy attorney general and likely the attorney general. But he said he could not speak for the Obama administration, saying guidance within its DOJ might not have required Attorney General Eric Holder to know of the probe. Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey, who succeeded Gonzales in the Bush administration, said leaks are serious business, but expressed reservations about the scope of the DOJ action. \\"When it comes to national security, I think the government has every right to investigate,\\" Mukasey said. \\"People do not have a right to leak confidential government information.\\" However, Mukasey noted, they have to do it with a \\"narrow focus.\\" \\"The AP suggests it was a broader gathering of information that should never have been authorized,\\" he told Fox News. Mukasey said it would be troubling if it is found that \\"they [the government] were looking more broadly to discourage people to talk to reporters.\\" Mark Corallo, chief spokesman for another Bush attorney general, John Ashcroft, called the secret probe \\"unprecedented.\\" \\"The normal course of business is very narrow and very tailored to a particular individual’s phone records,\\" said Corallo, who served for three years as director of public affairs under Ashcroft. \\"The idea that they would do two months – grab everything – in several bureaus is truly stunning and disgraceful.\\" Press organizations also lashed out at the DOJ, claiming their investigation constitutes a gross abuse of the First Amendment. \\"I don’t think there’s any justifiable situation, ever, for a subpoena this broad without contacting the organization first,\\" said Gregg Leslie, legal defense director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. Leslie said Nixon-era guidelines for the Attorney General’s Office speak directly to subpoenaing phone records of news organizations. He called them a \\"well-established body of law.\\" \\"You have to try to first negotiate\\" with the news organization, Leslie said. Rules published by the Justice Department require that subpoenas of records of news organizations must be personally approved by the attorney general, but it was not known if that happened in this case. The letter notifying AP that its phone records had been obtained through subpoenas was sent Friday by Ronald Machen, the U.S. attorney in Washington. William Miller, a spokesman for Machen, said Monday that, in general, the U.S. attorney follows \\"all applicable laws, federal regulations and Department of Justice policies when issuing subpoenas for phone records of media organizations.\\" But he would not address questions about the specifics of the AP records. \\"We do not comment on ongoing criminal investigations,\\" Miller said in an email.

Allow me to suggest some tips that may help you stick to your decisions creating long- lasting positive change in your life. Telling other people about your plan can help in many ways. First, it is always easier to stick to a decision when you have other people supporting you. Your friends are less likely to tempt you with whatever it is you are trying to control if they know that you made a decision about it. Telling other people about your decision is also helpful in that it keeps us to the pressure on you to try and stick to you plan of action. Choose a measurable and specific decision. Instead of deciding to \\"look better\\" or \\"have a better relationship with so and so\\", choose a more definable decision. Deciding to \\"eat a vegetable every day\\" or \\"go out for coffee once a week with John\\" is much easier to track and assess than a general decision to \\"be a better person\\". Build a reward system. Connected to the last tip of choosing a measurable and specific decision is that when you do accomplish this specific behavior you decided to do, give yourself small rewards along the process. For example, for every week of healthy eating treat yourself with something special. Creative visual aids. A colleague of mine decided one year for his New Year's decision to be more frugal.

Hemophilia is caused by a lack of clotting factors in the blood. Clotting factors are normally released by platelets.

The risk of internal bleeding is also increased in hemophilia, especially into muscles and joints. This disease affected the royal families of Europe.

The Reconquest: The aim of the Crusades in Spain was the eviction of the Muslims. After the recovery of Jerusalem in 1099, it took four hundred years of sieges and battles, treaties, betrayals, and yet more battles, before Christian kings and warlords succeeded in subduing the Moors. On 10 September 1229, a Catalan army led by King Jaume I of Aragón and Catalunya took the Mallorcan shore near the present-day resort of Santa Ponça. The defenders retreated inside the walls of Palma, but on the last day of 1229 the city fell, and pockets of resistance throughout the island were also defeated. Jaume I proved to be an enlightened ruler who profited from the talents of the Moors — converted by force to Christianity — as well as of the island's large Jewish and Genoese trading communities. Mallorca prospered. The Moors on Menorca speedily agreed to pay an annual tribute to Aragón and were left in peace. The island's tranquility lasted until 1287, when Alfonso III of Aragón, smarting over a series of humiliations at the hands of his nobles, found a pretext for invasion. The Moors were defeated and expelled or killed. In contrast to Mallorca, Menorca's economy was devastated for decades. Jaume I died after reigning in Aragón for six decades, but he made the cardinal error of dividing between his sons the lands he had fought for so long to unite. At first this resulted in an Independent Kingdom of Mallorca, under Jaume II, followed by Sanç and Jaume III. But family rivalry triggered the overthrow of Jaume III by his cousin Pedro IV, who then seized the Balearics for Aragón. Attempting a comeback, Jaume was killed in battle near Llucmajor in 1349. A newly unified Christian Spain under the Catholic Monarchs, Ferdinand and Isabella, completed the Reconquest, defeating the only Moorish enclave left on the Iberian peninsula, Granada, in 1492. However, the centralized kingdom failed to incorporate the Balearics politically or economically.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What was the purpose of the many battles in  Spain and how long did it take\\" is \\"To retake the land\\"?","output":"Yes, that's right! The purpose of the many battles in Spain was to retake the land from the Muslims, and it took about 400 years to complete this task.

The 27-year-old Serb, fresh from his five-set victory over Roger Federer in the men's singles final, was joined by coach Boris Becker and wore a black suit as he arrived at the Royal Opera House in London's Covent Garden. Kvitova was also in attendance following her 6-3, 6-0 victory over Canadian Eugenie Bouchard on Saturday afternoon at the All England Club.

With laughter echoing through the halls, Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova found themselves in the midst of a lighthearted conversation with other attendees, sharing stories of past victories and the challenges they had faced. In the midst of the festivities, a peculiar thought crossed Djokovic's mind, briefly drawing a smile to his face. Conclusively, the option \\"Royal Opera House doesn't add another ace to his tally\\" seems uniquely fitting for our tale.

A hush fell over the crowd as Novak Djokovic and Petra Kvitova took their positions on either side of the makeshift net. The match commenced, with both players giving their all, skillfully maneuvering around the grand chandeliers, priceless artwork, and other unorthodox hazards the venue presented. The onlookers were captivated by the raw talent and determination displayed by these two great athletes, as the air buzzed with anticipation. However, as Djokovic prepared to unleash a powerful ace, a gentle touch on his shoulder made him pause. Looking up, he found Boris Becker standing beside him, a knowing smile etched into his face. Becker gently reminded Djokovic of the unique venue they were in, suggesting that perhaps it would be best not to unleash his full fury on the gracious hosts - thus ensuring the \\"Royal Opera House doesn't add another ace to his tally.\\" Djokovic and Kvitova exchanged glances and, with a shared chuckle at the surreal nature of their situation, chose to tone down the intensity to a spirited yet friendly volley.

Djokovic and Kvitova, along with the rest of the Wimbledon Champions, left the event with a renewed sense of camaraderie, a lasting memory to be cherished by all who were fortunate enough to attend.

Translate to English English:","output":"One of the most sensational cases occurred at the beginning of the last century in Paris. This is a short statement that provides very limited context, so to generate a long and detailed response, I will have to speculate and expand on this theme. The statement implies that an event of great notoriety occurred at the beginning of the 20th century in Paris. The city of Paris has a rich history with many unique incidences that have attracted worldwide attention, so the specific case referred to could be one of many. For instance, it could refer to the infamous theft of the world-renowned Mona Lisa painting from the Louvre Museum in Paris in 1911. This was indeed one of the most sensational cases of the early 20th century. The painting was stolen by an Italian handyman named Vincenzo Peruggia, who believed that the artwork should be returned to Italy. He had worked at the museum and knew the layout well. One day, he hid inside the museum overnight and took the painting. It was missing for over two years before it was recovered in 1913. Another possible interpretation could be the scandal surrounding the Panama Canal. In the late 19th and early 20th century, French and American interests competed over the rights to build the Panama Canal. In France, this erupted into a major scandal involving government corruption and the loss of a great deal of public money, known as the Panama Scandal. Alternatively, the statement might refer to something much broader, like the myriad social and cultural changes Paris went through in the early years of the 20th century. The so-called \\"Belle Epoque\\" period, lasting from 1871 to 1914, was a time of great optimism, peace, prosperity, and progress in France, particularly in Paris. However, it was also a time of socioeconomic divide and struggles, which came to a boiling point in the years preceding World War I. These are just some of the many possible interpretations of such a general statement, which does not provide much detail or specific context.

She did, in fact, ask me for a response. I asked her if she was a happy person, and said that I suspected that she was not, as she came across as a bully and was acting like a horrible person.

Available choices: 1). no; 2). yes;","output":"First, let's answer both of the given questions. 1. What does a Hadoop engineer do? A Hadoop engineer is responsible for developing, designing, maintaining, and optimizing large-scale data processing solutions using the Hadoop ecosystem. They work with different Hadoop components like HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Pig, HBase, and others to manage and analyze massive amounts of data efficiently. 2. What is Hadoop? Hadoop is an open-source, distributed data processing framework developed by the Apache Software Foundation. It enables the processing and storage of large amounts of data across multiple clusters of computers using a simple programming model. Key components of Hadoop include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), which stores the data, and MapReduce, which allows for parallel processing. Now, let's analyze the similarities and differences between the two questions. The first question asks specifically about the role and responsibilities of a Hadoop engineer, while the second question seeks a definition and understanding of the Hadoop technology itself. These questions are related, as the Hadoop engineer's role revolves around working with Hadoop technology; however, they are requesting distinct pieces of information.

Primarily consisting of lead vocalists Jeanette Jurado, Ann Curless, and Gioia Bruno, the group achieved much of their success between 1984 and 1993, becoming the first group to have four top ten hits on the Billboard Hot 100 chart from its debut album, including the 1988 #1 hit \\"Seasons Change\\". In March 2015, Billboard magazine named the group the eighth most-successful girl group of all-time. The group was popular in dance clubs, mainstream Top 40 and adult contemporary charts in the United States. During the recording of the group's first studio album Exposure, the personnel of the group changed. Reports vary based on the source. According to People magazine, one of the original singers quit while two of the girls were fired midway through the recording of the first album, but according to Billboard, all three were fired. Arista records felt that the three original singers lacked star potential. Martinee states that he made the decision himself to replace the three girls, while Miller maintains it was all their choice, and Jurado confirms that Lorenzo wanted to leave. Shortly thereafter, Casanas pursued a solo career and Lorenzo pursued other ambitions; they were replaced by Jeanette Jurado and Gioia Bruno. Miller began a solo career; she was replaced by Ann Curless.  Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with the Vendetta Records releases \\"I Wanna Know\\" in 1988, and \\"Stop Me if I Fall in Love\\" in 1990, while Laurie Miller released the 12\\" single \\"Parallels\\" on Atlantic Records and a second single \\"Love is a Natural Magical Thing\\" on Meet Me In Miami Records. Laurie evolved into a headline performer frequently showcasing her talents on cruises with a more intimate jazz style, and formed her own entertainment company called Xica productions.  Casanas later resurfaced as a solo artist (Sandee) and released a solo album, Only Time Will Tell, which garnered the club hits \\"You're The One\\", \\"Love Desire\\", and the Clivilles & Cole-produced bassline-heavy hit \\"Notice Me\\". She continued to tour actively in dance clubs and freestyle shows, until her death on December 15, 2008, of a seizure at the age of 46. All three original members: Casanas, Lorenzo and Miller later contributed vocals on songs on the Miami group Will to Power's eponymous 1988 debut album. Gioia Bruno also provided lead vocals on Will to Power's 2004 album, Spirit Warrior. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects present in this article: 1. The Shift in Group Personnel: One key aspect that stands out is the revolving door of group members during the recording of their first album, \\"Exposure\\". Depending on the sources, explanations vary from members quitting, getting fired or replacing due to lack of star potential. With Jeanette Jurado, Gioia Bruno, and Ann Curless replacing the original members, the group's dynamics underwent a dramatic change. 2. Members' Solo Careers and Endeavours: Post their stint with Exposé, the original group members explored various opportunities - from pursuing solo careers to setting up an entertainment company. Ale Lorenzo returned to the dance charts with multiple releases while Laurie Miller turned into a headline performer, often showcasing her talents on cruises and forming her own entertainment company, Xica Productions. Sandee Casanas emerged as a solo artist with her album producing several club hits. These individual trajectories mark interesting developments in each of the members' careers. 3. Association with Will to Power: An interesting nugget is the collaboration between the former and current Exposé members with another Miami-based group, Will to Power. Both the original and new members contributed vocals on songs on Will to Power's debut album and later albums, suggesting ongoing collaborations within the music scene. 4. Tragic Loss: Sadly, original member Sandee Casanas passed away at the age of 46 due to a seizure. Her contributions to music, particularly in dance clubs and freestyle shows up to her untimely death, display a persevering spirit and dedication to her craft. This is a poignant part of the group's history. 5. Steady Success: Despite the shift in members, Exposé managed to achieve steady success throughout their active years, with multiple hits on the Billboard Hot 100. In 2015, Billboard named them the eighth most successful girl group of all time, which further signals their significance in the music industry. Overall, the continual evolution of the band, their individual strands of success, and the lasting impact they've had on the music industry makes their journey quite captivating and intriguing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Wilbur Charles \\"Weeb\\" Ewbank (May 6, 1907 - November 17, 1998) was an American professional football coach. He led the Baltimore Colts to NFL championships in 1958 and 1959 and the New York Jets to victory in Super Bowl III in 1969. He is the only coach to win a championship in both the National Football League (NFL) and American Football League (AFL). Ewbank moved back to Oxford in retirement and wrote a book in 1977 called Football Greats. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1978, but said later that year that he was glad to be out of coaching. With the expansion of the NFL, he said, talent had become diluted and fielding a good team was difficult. Coaches, meanwhile, customarily took the blame for a team's failures, and the sport had become too violent.  Ewbank's coaching style was laid-back but efficient, combining his mild personality with an orderliness inherited from Paul Brown. \\"Weeb combined a low-key style with a flair for the most dramatic of accomplishments\\", former NFL commissioner Paul Tagliabue said in 1998. \\"He led two of the legendary teams during the era of pro football's greatest growth. But he preferred to stay in the background and let the players take the credit.\\" He favored well-practiced execution of a limited number of plays over complicated offensive and defensive systems. Paul Brown \\"had the exact same approach: Don't do too much, but what you do, execute it flawlessly\\", Raymond Berry said in 2013, adding that the Colts' 1958 championship team had only six passing plays.  Ewbank is the only man to coach two professional football teams to championships, and the only man to win the NFL championship, the AFL championship and a Super Bowl. Ewbank's regular-season career record in the NFL and AFL was 130-129-7, and his playoff record was 4-1. Ewbank was selected as the head coach on the AFL All-Time Team in 1970. In addition to the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was inducted into the Miami University Athletic Hall of Fame in 1969, the Indiana Football Hall of Fame in 1974 and the Talawanda School District Athletic Hall of Fame in 1999. He also won the Walter Camp Distinguished American Award in 1987 and was inducted into the Jets' Ring of Honor in 2010.  Ewbank suffered a dislocated hip in the aftermath of the Jets' 1968 AFL championship game win, and had other health issues in his later years. He broke his leg and had two hip replacements in the 1990s. He also had myasthenia in his right eye. Ewbank died at 91 on November 17, 1998, the 30th anniversary of the \\"Heidi Game\\", after suffering from heart problems. He and his wife Lucy had three daughters.

Some people are scared of change or think the caste system is helpful for keeping things in order, even though it's not fair to everyone. 3.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Speech--the act of uttering sounds to convey meaning--is a kind of human action. Like any other constantly repeated action, speaking has to be learned, but once it is learned, it becomes a generally unconscious and apparently automatic process. As far as we can determine, human beings do not need to be forced to speak; most babies seem to possess a sort of instinctive drive to produce speech like noises. How to speak and what to say are another matter altogetner. There actions are learned from the particular society into which the baby is born; so that, like all conduct that is learned from a society--from the people around us--speech is a patterned activity. The meandering babble and chatter of a young child are eventually channeled by imitation into a few orderly grooves that represent the pattern accepted as meaningful by the people around him. Similarly, a child's indiscriminate practice of putting things into his mouth becomes limited to putting food into his mouth in a certain way. The sounds that a child can make are more varied and numerous than the sounds that any particular language uses. However, a child born into a society with a pattem of language is encouraged to make a small selection of sounds and to make these few sounds over and over until it is natural for him to make these sounds and not others.

Question: What was the effect of the Rotavirus vaccine? Answer: In the case of Rotavirus, which was responsible for around 6% of diarrheal episodes and 20% of diarrheal disease deaths in the children of developing countries, use of a Rotavirus vaccine in trials in 1985 yielded a slight (2-3%) decrease in total diarrheal disease incidence, while reducing overall mortality by 6-10%.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? OPT:  (A). yes  (B). no","output":"(A). yes The introduction of the Rotavirus vaccine had a significant impact on global health, particularly in children living in developing countries. The vaccine primarily protects against severe gastrointestinal illness caused by Rotavirus, which presents as acute diarrhea and can lead to severe dehydration. Before the vaccine's introduction, Rotavirus was the leading cause of severe diarrhea among infants and young children, resulting in an estimated 528,000 deaths annually around the world. The development and subsequent distribution of Rotavirus vaccines have profoundly changed the landscape of diarrheal diseases, especially in low- and middle-income countries. The first Rotavirus vaccine, RotaShield, entered the market in 1998 but was withdrawn shortly after due to concerns about a rare but severe side effect, intussusception. The second-generation vaccines, RotaTeq and Rotarix, received approval from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2006 and 2008, respectively, and are currently widely used. These vaccines led to a substantial decrease in childhood diarrhea and deaths caused by Rotavirus. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommended the inclusion of the Rotavirus vaccine in national immunization programs in 2009. It has since been introduced in over 100 countries, including many low- and middle-income regions where the Rotavirus burden is particularly high. Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of the Rotavirus vaccine. A study published in The Lancet in 2019 reported that the widespread use of Rotavirus vaccines saved an estimated 28,808 lives in 2016 alone. Furthermore, multiple studies have shown that Rotavirus vaccines have reduced the number of severe diarrhea cases by 40-60%. These vaccines have decreased the need for diarrhea-related hospitalizations and outpatient visits, as well. Beyond direct effects on children who receive the vaccine, Rotavirus vaccination also contributes to herd immunity. Herd immunity occurs when a large enough proportion of the population becomes immune to a disease, either by vaccination or previous infection, thereby indirectly protecting those who are not immune. This phenomenon helps reduce the overall transmission of Rotavirus, protecting vulnerable populations such as infants too young for vaccination, the elderly, and immunocompromised individuals. In conclusion, the Rotavirus vaccine has had several significant effects, such as: 1. A considerable reduction in severe diarrhea cases and diarrhea-related deaths among infants and children, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. 2. Decreased need for hospitalizations and outpatient visits due to Rotavirus infection. 3. The contribution to herd immunity, which helps protect vulnerable populations and reduce the overall transmission of the virus. Despite these successes, there is still work to do to ensure global access to Rotavirus vaccines and further reduce the burden of Rotavirus-associated disease and death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: \\"What was Antarctica once connected to?\\"  Context: \\"Antarctica continued to become more isolated and finally developed a permanent ice cap. Mountain building in western North America continued, and the Alps started to rise in Europe as the African plate continued to push north into the Eurasian plate, isolating the remnants of Tethys Sea. A brief marine incursion marks the early Oligocene in Europe. There appears to have been a land bridge in the early Oligocene between North America and Europe since the faunas of the two regions are very similar. During the Oligocene, South America was finally detached from Antarctica and drifted north toward North America. It also allowed the Antarctic Circumpolar Current to flow, rapidly cooling the continent.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"During the early Oligocene epoch, Antarctica was once connected to both South America and Australia. These land connections allowed the exchange of flora and fauna between these southern continents. As the tectonic plates shifted, South America and Australia gradually separated from Antarctica, leading to the continent's increasing isolation. The detachment of South America from Antarctica during the Oligocene caused the formation of the Drake Passage, which eventually allowed the establishment of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. This ocean current played a crucial role in the rapid cooling of Antarctica, resulting in the development of a permanent ice cap on the continent.

Republicans, led by presumptive new Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, of coal-loving Kentucky, have already criticized the Beijing agreement.      But what can McConnell and the GOP really do to stop it? The deal is not a formal treaty, so Obama will not need the Senate to approve it. And while Republicans could pass bills to block provisions of the deal from going into effect, doing so would probably not be much more than symbolic, since Obama can simply click his veto pen into action. The constitution requires two-thirds of the Senate and House to vote to override a veto, and despite their recent wins, the GOP still doesn’t have those kinds of majorities.      But while Obama and the executive branch agencies that he controls, like the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), can act on their own to implement the agreement, under the US constitution’s system of checks and balances, Congress pulls the pursestrings. When the next bill containing the EPA’s budget – or the next omnibus piece of legislation to keep the entire government running – comes round, Republicans can attach provisions called “riders” that would undermine, defund and restrict parts of the climate plan. Clinging to an unrelated bill like legislative barnacles, riders could, for example, prevent the EPA from using any money to actually enforce the rules and regulations necessary to implement the agreement.      Riders on an omnibus budget could also put the president in a pickle: unless Obama signs legislation to cripple his own major accomplishment, he could risk shutting down the government. That could flip the circumstances of the 2013 government shutdown, making Obama look like the villain who refuses to keep the government going, and turning Republicans into the reasonable lawmakers who “get us out of government shutdowns”, as McConnell put it.      Republicans could also try to bargain with the president, using narrowly written bills as leverage, getting victories of their own while perhaps conceding something to Democrats in exchange. Obama has never spoken out particularly strongly against the Keystone XL pipeline, for instance, and both parties could try to use it as a bargaining chip.      The GOP could also simply try to clog the works a bit. Senator Jim Inhofe, the author of The Greatest Hoax: How the Global Warming Conspiracy Threatens Your Future, would have some power to do that as chair of the environmental committee. Inhofe will likely launch investigations, hindering and possibly delaying implementation of the agreement with hearings and squads of investigators. Green energy projects will be examined with a microscope; green investments decried. Zones of EPA jurisdiction, as tiny as a stream or strait or islet, will be argued and bickered about, and officials in the EPA will have their lives made miserable as senators try to cow them with pressure.      Inhofe can also contest EPA rulings like the “endangerment finding”, under which the agency declared that greenhouse gases were a danger to public health and merited regulation. Reports by Inhofe’s investigators can then be used by businesses who challenge the EPA in court, sending the “war on coal and oil” into the long and expensive trenches of the judicial system.      And like most political agendas, there’s always the next election to consider: if the GOP can handcuff the EPA as long as possible, they may be able to play the electoral field into a 2016 win, getting a less-green president in office and shutting the whole thing down. ||||| A visit to Beijing by Kerry and a missive from Obama were key moments in a nine-month negotiation between the world’s biggest polluters      The climate deal announced on Wednesday between the world’s two biggest carbon polluters was struck after a personal letter from Barack Obama, and nine months of intensive diplomacy. But American and Chinese officials had been in search of an agreement – through official meetings and back-channel negotiations – since the days when George Bush was president.      The plan unveiled in Beijing by Obama and his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, commits the two countries to ambitious cuts to greenhouse gas emissions after 2020, and could spur other big polluters to similar efforts.      After years of mistrust, the deal began to coalesce last spring after Obama sent a personal letter to Xi suggesting the two countries start to move in tandem to cut carbon pollution, the White House said.      The immediate inspiration for the letter arose from a visit to Beijing by John Kerry, the US secretary of state. Kerry, who had a strong environmental record when he was a senator, raised climate change to a top priority after taking over at State. He floated the idea of setting joint targets in his meetings with Chinese officials, a senior administration official said.      “The idea was first hatched in a bilateral visit that Secretary Kerry had in early February, where he broached it with the Chinese,” the official said. “And when the Chinese side seemed potentially receptive, we followed up with that letter from President Obama to President Xi.”      What came next was a flurry of diplomatic meetings – including a pivotal encounter on the sidelines of the United Nations climate summit in September between Obama and the Chinese vice-premier Zhang Gaoli, who has charge of climate and energy.      At the time, there was speculation that China would use the spotlight of the UN summit to announce a date for peaking emissions. That did not materialise.      The timing was too close to the midterm elections and China was adamant about making the historic announcement from home turf, those who have followed the talks closely said.      But the White House said Zhang did tell Obama during a meeting that China wanted to move ahead quickly on a separate climate deal.      “The message from Vice-Premier Zhang Gaoli was that President Xi was interested in taking the president’s offer up and moving forward with this announcement when we were in Beijing,” the official said.      A number of US officials were dispatched to Beijing, including the senior White House adviser on climate policy, John Podesta, and the State Department climate change envoy, Todd Stern, the White House said.      By early November, officials were parsing the language of an eventual announcement – a process that evidently went down to the wire, in the official’s account.      “We were here the week before last and had intensive discussions about what our respective targets would look like, and then finally were able to negotiate a text which was finalised late yesterday.”      By the time it reached that crunch point, however, US and Chinese officials had spent the better part of two years trying to overcome their mutual suspicion – and nearly a decade in on-off negotiations for a two-way climate deal.      After the disaster of the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, when Obama was on the receiving end of a pointed diplomatic snub from Chinese officials, the two countries began to put in the hard work needed to repair the relationship.      As those familiar with United Nations climate negotiations recognised, there was no other way. China and America between them are responsible for 42% of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to the US EIA’s 2012 data.      Unless they were serious about cutting carbon pollution, there was no hope of fighting climate change.      The primacy of the US-Chinese relationship was familiar to a number of highly placed officials in the Obama administration.      Beginning in late 2007, when George Bush was president, a group of leading Republicans and Democrats led two secretive missions to China to try to secure a bilateral climate agreement.      The initiative included John Holdren, now the White House science adviser, and culminated in a meeting at a luxury hotel at the Great Wall of China in July 2008.      It also produced a draft agreement in March 2009, two months after Obama took office, but it was never signed. Obama’s hopes of passing a climate law died in Congress.      After his re-election, however, Obama recommitted to fighting climate change, and again took up pursuit of the China deal.      “At the beginning of the second term the president recognised that he had to both take domestic action to have credibility but also to begin bilateral negotiations with China to actually bend down the global emissions curve,” said Paul Bledsoe, a climate change official under Bill Clinton. “From the moment of his re-election, this process began. This is essentially the culmination of two years of effort, recognising that until Chinese emissions begin to decline, global emissions cannot decline. That is just the reality of the problem.”      On the diplomatic track, US and Chinese officials were signing agreements to work together on developing technologies for the smart grid, cleaner vehicles and energy-saving buildings.      The trust-building exercises paid off. In June 2013 Obama and Xi reached an agreement to phase out the super-pollutant HFCs – an extremely potent greenhouse gas used in air conditioners and refrigerators. Industrialised countries adopted the agreement a few months later.      Obama, meanwhile, began assembling evidence that he was serious about cutting greenhouse gas emissions at home – and not just demanding such actions from other countries.      Shortly after the HFC deal, Obama unveiled his signature plan to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, the single biggest source of carbon pollution.      China also began to put its own house in order, spurred in part by deadly air pollution levels from coal-fired power plants. In 2011, the Chinese government for the first time set targets for a less polluting course of growth, and began rolling out new solar and wind plants. Seven regions introduced carbon trading schemes.      By the beginning of this year, all the pieces were beginning to fall into place. It had been, in Bledsoe’s view, the work of a decade. “Todd [Stern] and Podesta and Holdren were all working on these issues in the late 1990s,” he said.      “Until about two or three years ago there was still a broader focus on the UN negotiations rather than the bilateral relationship with China as the sine qua non of climate protection. That is what changed after the re-election: the recognition that this was essentially the only game in town.” |||||Summary:","output":"The Obama administration's climate change deal with China has faced opposition from the Republican Congress, who have criticized the agreement and are looking for ways to hinder its implementation. Although the deal is not a formal treaty, which means it does not require Senate approval, the Republican Congress is exploring various tactics to undermine it. These tactics include attaching provisions called \\"riders\\" to budget bills related to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which could defund or restrict parts of the climate plan. Additionally, they can use these riders to put pressure on Obama to sign legislation to limit his own climate plan, otherwise risking a government shutdown. Another approach Republicans might take is to negotiate with the president, offering concessions in exchange for their own political victories. Furthermore, they can utilize the powers of Senator Jim Inhofe, a prominent climate change skeptic, to hinder the implementation of the agreement through investigations and legal challenges. This opposition from the Republican Congress highlights the challenges the Obama administration faces in enacting its climate change policy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Chronicon Lethrense and the included Annales Lundenses tell that Haldan (Healfdene) had two sons, Helghe (Halga) and Ro (Hrodgar). When Haldan died of old age, Helghe and Ro divided the kingdom so that Ro ruled the land, and Helghe the sea. One day, Helghe arrived in Halland/Lolland and slept with Thore, the daughter of one of Ro's farmers. This resulted in a daughter named Yrse. Much later, he met Yrse, and without knowing that she was his daughter, he made her pregnant with Rolf. Eventually, Helghe found out that Yrse was his own daughter and, out of shame, went east and killed himself.  Both Helghe and Ro being dead, a Swedish king, called Hakon in the Chronicon Lethrense proper, and Athisl in the Annales - corresponding to Eadgils - forced the Danes to accept a dog as king. The dog king was succeeded by Rolf Krage.  Rolf Krage was a big man in body and soul and was so generous that no one asked him for anything twice. His sister Skulda was married against Rolf's will to Hartwar or Hiarwarth (Heoroweard), a German earl of Skane, but reputedly Rolf had given Skulda to him together with Sweden.  This Hartwar arrived in Zealand with a large army and said that he wanted to give his tribute to Rolf, but killed Rolf together with all his men. Only one survived, Wigg, who played along until he was to do homage to Hartwar. Then, he pierced Hartwar with a sword, and so Hartwar was king for only one morning.

What about your chair,or your fridge? Probably they are not. But in the future, most things in your home may be connected, thanks to the so-called \\"Internet of things\\". The Internet of things may be coming sooner than you think. Earlier this year, A Samsung CEO spent a lot of time talking about the Internet things. He said that five years from now,every Samsung product will be part of the Internet of things,no matter whether it's a remote control or a washing machine. So, how do household  objects that are part of the Internet of things work? Well,think of a common chair. When connected to the Internet, the chair warms up when it knows the user has just walked into the room and is feeling cold. An Internet-connected camera could help people feel safer in their homes. It can know people's faces and has an infrared sensor ,so even if it's dark it can see when someone passes by and send you a message on your smartphone to let you know who's there. If the person is someone you don't know,it can tell you that ,too. But according to MIT Technology Roview, whether companies are connecting dog food bowls or security systems to the Internet, there may be some problems. For example, many early connected-home objects don't have much built-in security, which means they could be hacked . Morever, it could be difficult to get these new machines to work together especially when they are made by different companies. To fight this ,many companies have joined the Open Interconnect Consortium, which had 45 menbers by late 2014.

Article: Many articles have appeared in recent years, claiming that there are no more heroes in the world. The authors says that the young now refuse to admire anyone and that we are living in a world too well informed, too curious showing us the faults of the public figures who could become today's stars, until we lose faith and start looking for defects in any person who seems worthy of respect.  Is it true that we know too much? Were our ancestors lucky to be only partly informed? Those who read the first biographies of George Washington, Joan of Arc, or other great men and women of the past were not told that their hero had bad breath or disliked his mother; they only found a description of his great accomplishments and their admiration was strengthened. In fact, early biographers didn't hesitate to make up an admirable story or two about their hero. The man who wrote the first biography of Washington, for instance, invented the cherry tree; he admitted later that there was no truth in it, but he said that it would give young men a good example to follow. His readers didn't seem to object; the book was reprinted eighty times--a great success in those days. Modern biographers do not invent such stories; they respect the facts, as indeed they should. But we pay a price for their truthfulness, for in their efforts to show \\"the whole person,\\" they tell us more than we really need to know about private lives, family secrets, and human weakness. The true greatness of a fine man is often forgotten in the display; and people lose not only their admiration for him, but their willingness to trust any other \\"star\\" completely. It may be difficult to be a hero in the world these days, under the searching eyes of the society. But surely excellence has not disappeared completely; there are still individuals who are superior to their fellow men by their wisdom, their courage, or their character. They can be heroes if people are willing to ignore their human imperfection and to admit the respect that their admirable qualities... Question: Why do the young now refuse to admire anyone? Answer: The answer is:","output":"The article suggests that the reluctance of young people to admire anyone stems from the excessive amount of information available about public figures. With increasing access to information in our modern world, it’s easy to know almost every detail about these public figures, including their flaws, mistakes, and other shortcomings. This wider perspective reveals the human aspects and potential flaws of public figures, challenging the traditional concept of a hero, which often omits the narration of such shortcomings. The continuous exposure to such negative or unexpected details of highly respected figures could make young people skeptical and less willing to admire or respect anyone unconditionally. Unlike the earlier times, where biographies typically highlighted only the great deeds, people now have a more holistic view of other's lives which notably includes their imperfections."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

About a year ago I came out and told my second step-dad Kyle that Ryan’s father, Chris, had been sexually harassing me for the past year. To name a few things he did: -He offered to buy me a dildo. When I laughed and said my parents wouldn’t like that he said I didn’t have to tell them -I was in a night gown one night and he was making a movement with his hands and when I looked down I realized he was staring at my privates under my night gown -He would constantly rub my thighs closer to the parts I didn’t want him to touch -He would groom me by getting me foods -He shoved his hand down my shirt and tried to grab at my chest.

This is because St. John's College is categorized as a private liberal arts college, not a public college. However, we can confirm that St. John's College ranks in the top 100 Best Liberal Arts Colleges, as mentioned in the given information. It is important to differentiate between private and public colleges. Private colleges, like St. John's College, are funded by private sources, such as donations and tuition fees, and are not directly funded by the government. Public colleges, on the other hand, are supported by state governments and usually offer lower tuition rates for in-state students. The \\"U.S. News & World Report\\" website provides separate rankings for different types of schools, including national universities, regional universities, liberal arts colleges, and public colleges. While St. John's College ranks highly in the category of liberal arts colleges, we do not have information about its ranking in the public colleges category, as it does not fall under that classification. Thus, it would be incorrect to infer that St. John's College ranks in the top 100 best public colleges based on the provided information. Its distinction as one of the top 100 Best Liberal Arts Colleges, however, is well-established and should not be confused with its standing amongst public colleges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","output":"In order to solve the equation -3 = r - 0 - 1 for r, you need to follow the steps of simplification and isolating the variable r. Let's break down the process step by step: Given equation: -3 = r - 0 - 1 Step 1: Simplify the equation by removing any unnecessary terms or numbers. Since r - 0 is just r, we can rewrite the equation as: -3 = r - 1 Step 2: Isolate the variable r. In this case, we need to get r by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, we can add 1 to both sides of the equation. By doing so, we will cancel the -1 on the right side of the equation: -3 + 1 = r - 1 + 1 Which simplifies to: -2 = r Step 3: Check the solution. Now that we have the value of r, we can check if it's the correct solution by plugging it back into the original equation: -3 = (-2) - 0 - 1 Simplifying the equation: -3 = -2 - 1 Which is true, as: -3 = -3 Since our solution checks out, we can conclude that the answer is: r = -2"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The night when she thought she would finally be a star, Maria Isabella du'l Cielo struggled to calm the trembling of her hands, reached over to cut the tether that tied her to the ground, and thought of that morning many years before when she'd first caught a glimpse of Lorenzo du Vicenzio ei Salvadore: tall, thick-browed and handsome, his eyes closed, oblivious to the cacophony of the accident waiting to occur around him. Maria Isabella had just turned sixteen then, and each set of her padrinos had given her (along with the sequined brida du caballo, the dresses of rare tulle, organza, and seda, and the diadema floral du'l dama -- the requisite floral circlet of young womanhood) a purse filled with coins to spend on anything she wanted. And so she'd gone past the Calle du Leones (where sleek cats of various pedigrees sometimes allowed themselves to be purchased, though if so, only until they tired of their new owners), walked through the Avenida du'l Conquistadores (where the statues of the conquerors of Ciudad Meiora lined the entirety of the broad promenade) and made her way to the Encantu lu Caminata (that maze-like series of interconnected streets, each leading to some wonder or marvel for sale), where little musical conch shells from the islets near Palao'an could be found. Those she liked very much. In the vicinity of the Plaza Emperyal, she saw a young man dressed in a coat embroidered with stars walk almost surely to his death. In that instant, Maria Isabella knew two things with the conviction reserved only for the very young: first, that she almost certainly loved this reckless man; and second, that if she simply stepped on a dog's tail -- the very dog watching the same scene unfold right next to her -- she could avert the man's seemingly senseless death.

Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products.

The Labour leader said the government was planning to over-ride legal rulings and restrict Personal Independence Payments paid to dementia sufferers and those with mental health conditions. But Mrs May said no existing claimants would see their benefits reduced. She said the government was clarifying the scope of payments to ensure they were in line with original intentions. PIPs, which replaced Disability Living Allowance in 2013, are aimed at helping people cope with the extra costs of living with ill health or disability and are made according to the points a person scores in an assessment of their needs. Recent tribunal rulings have extended the scope of the payments and who is entitled to them - a move which the government has said will add Â£3.7bn to the benefits bill by 2023 unless it is reviewed. Clashing over the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, the Labour leader said the move - which was announced last Thursday - was a \\"nasty decision\\" and had been \\"sneaked out\\" without any warning. Mr Corbyn said the review would affect 160,000 people with debilitating mental conditions, who had been deemed eligible by the court to get help as they were suffering from \\"overwhelming psychological distress\\". Among those who would lose out, he added, were those recovering from strokes and post-traumatic stress disorder. \\"The reality is that this is a shameful decision,\\" he said. \\"Can she look at the effects of the decision to over-ride what an independent court has decided and think again?\\" \\"As a society we are judged by how we treat the most vulnerable... can't the prime minister withdraw this nasty decision and support those going through a very difficult time in their lives?\\" One tribunal ruling on PIPs in late 2016 found people who needed help take medication or monitor a health condition like diabetes would score the same on the benefits criteria as people who needed help with a therapy such as kidney dialysis A second ruling said people who struggled to travel independently because of conditions such as anxiety scored the same as someone who was, for example, blind. Mrs May said the government's review of the eligibility criteria was \\"not a policy change\\" and Parliament had been told about it in a written statement. Rejecting claims of a lack of consultation, she said the Work and Pensions Secretary had informed the Labour MP who chairs the Work and Pensions Committee about the move and the Social Security Advisory Committee could look into the issue. She said the scope of PIPs had been approved by the Tory-Lib Dem coalition government and approved by Parliament but the legal rulings were fundamentally extending their reach and must be returned to their \\"original\\" basis. \\"This is not a cut in the amount that is going to be spent on disability benefits and no-one is going to see a reduction in their benefits from what has been previously awarded,\\" she told MPs. She added: \\"The way we are dealing with disability benefits payments is to ensure payments are going to those who are most vulnerable. \\"What we are doing with regard to PIPs is ensuring\\", she said, that the intentions and decision of this Parliament \\"is being put into practice\\". The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said what the government was proposing was \\"not technically a cut\\" but would have ramifications for the benefits system. While some Tory MPs were concerned about the move and ministers were working behind the scenes to allay any fears, she said there was not currently enough \\"heat\\" in the issue to force the government to back down at this stage.","output":"UK Prime Minister Theresa May has been challenged over the government's decision to restrict Personal Independence Payments (PIPs) for dementia and mental health sufferers, but claims no existing claimants would see their benefits reduced and the government is ensuring payments are in line with original intentions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is the seventh novel featuring Bertie Wooster and his valet Jeeves .  - Bertram Wilberforce \\"Bertie\\" Wooster is a recurring fictional character in the \\"Jeeves\\" novels of British author P. G. Wodehouse. An English gentleman, one of the \\"idle rich\\" and a member of the Drones Club, he appears alongside his valet, Jeeves, whose intelligence manages to save Bertie or one of his friends from numerous awkward situations.  - Reginald Jeeves is a fictional character in a series of humorous short stories and novels by P. G. Wodehouse (18811975), being the highly competent valet of a wealthy and idle young Londoner named Bertie Wooster. Created in 1915, Jeeves continued to appear in Wodehouse's work until his last completed novel \\"Aunts Aren't Gentlemen\\" in 1974, a span of 59 years. The name \\"Jeeves\\" comes from Percy Jeeves (18881916), a Warwickshire cricketer killed in the First World War.  - Aunts Aren't Gentlemen is a comic novel by P. G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom in October 1974 by Barrie & Jenkins, London, and in the United States under the title \\"The Cat-nappers\\" on 14 April 1975 by Simon & Schuster, New York. It was the last novel to feature some of Wodehouse's best known characters, Bertie Wooster and his resourceful valet Jeeves, and the last novel fully completed by Wodehouse before his death.  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - Dulwich College is a boarding and day independent school for boys in Dulwich in southeast London, England. It was founded in 1619 by Edward Alleyn, an Elizabethan actor, with the original purpose of educating 12 poor scholars as the foundation of \\"God's Gift\\". It currently has about 1,500 boys, of whom 120 are boarders. Admission by examination is mainly into years 3, 7, 9, and 12 (i.e. ages 7, 11, 13, and 16 years old) to the Junior, Lower, Middle and Upper Schools into which the college is divided. It is a member of both the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and the Eton Group.  - Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse, (15 October 188114 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. Born in Guildford, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life.
