Let’s denote the position of the leftmost marked cell in the ( i )-th row as ( k_i ). For each row, shift the marked cells to the left by ( k_i - 1 ) cells, so that the leftmost marked cell in each row is positioned in the first column. 3. **Shifting Cells:**    Performing this shift does not alter the overall structure or property of the table concerning the existence of a parallelogram formed by marked cells. 4. **Pigeonhole Principle Application:**    After the shift, in the first column of the new table, the number of marked cells may be ( leq n ). Since there are ( 2n ) marked cells in total:    [    2n - n = n    ]    This means that there are still ( n ) marked cells distributed over the remaining ( n-1 ) columns.     5. **Ensuring Overlap in Columns:**    By the pigeonhole principle, at least one of these second marked cells must share a column (after the first one).

Let ( M ) be the midpoint of ( PQ ). Prove that ( NO = NM ).","output":"**Step 1: Construct perpendicular lines and identify important points:** 1. Pass a line GT through point G such that GT perp O_1G.  2. This perpendicular intersects the circle centered at O_1 at point T. 3. From the given problem,  angle AGT = angle ADG = angle ACB , we know that TG parallel BC. 4. Therefore, O_1G perp BC. 5. Since O_1G perp BC and OO_2 perp BC, it must follow that O_1G parallel OO_2. 6. Similarly, OO_1 parallel GO_2 can be deduced.  7. Hence, O_1OO_2G forms a parallelogram. As a result, point N is the midpoint of both OG and O_1O_2. **Step 2: Establish midpoint on the secant line:** 1. Select a point M' on the secant line HG such that (HG cdot HM' = HA cdot HB). 2. From this, we know that G, A, B, M' are cyclic quadrilateral points. 3.

Notice that E is the midpoint of PG, and F is the midpoint of GQ, hence, S is the midpoint of EF. **Step 4: Demonstrate perpendicularity and midpoint properties:** 1. Compute the angle  angle BOC = 2 angle BAC. Since angle measures add up cyclically, ( angle BAC + angle BDC = angle BM'Q + angle QM'C = angle BM'C ). Therefore, B, C, M', O are also cyclic quadrilateral points. 2. Therefore, ( angle OM'B = angle OCB = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - angle BOC) = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - angle BM'C) = frac{1}{2}(180^circ - 2 angle BM'Q) = 90^circ - angle BM'Q ). 3.

To solve x(x+1)(x-1) < 0, we find the zeros of the quadratic expression, which are x = 0, x = -1, and x = 1. 5. We test intervals determined by these zeros to find where the inequality holds:    - For x < -1, all factors x, x+1, and x-1 are negative, so the product is negative.    - For -1 < x < 0, factors x+1 and x-1 are negative, and x is positive, making the product positive.    - For 0 < x < 1, x and x+1 are positive, and x-1 is negative, making the product negative.    - For x > 1, all factors are positive, so the product is positive. 6.

The distance from a point (x_1, y_1) to a line Ax + By + C = 0 is given by the formula frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}. In this case, the center of the circle is (0, 2), and the line is x - √3y = 0. Applying the formula, we get:  text{Distance} = frac{|(1)(0) - √3(2) + 0|}{sqrt{1^2 + (-√3)^2}} = frac{|-2√3|}{sqrt{1 + 3}} = frac{2√3}{2} = boxed{√3}"},{"instruction":"Given point M(sqrt{3}, 0), and point P is a moving point on circle N: (x + sqrt{3})^2 + y^2 = 16 with center N.

Divide this circle into 6 equal parts.     - Choose 6 points on the circumference of the circle and label them as A, B, C, D, E, F.     - Connect each consecutive point to the center O (i.e., OA, OB, OC, OD, OE, OF) and you will form 6 triangles. 2. **Equality of Triangles:**      - Each triangle OAB, OBC, OCD, ODE, OEF, and OFA is equilateral because:         [         OA = OB = OC = OD = OE = OF         ]         and         [         angle AOB = angle BOC = angle COD = angle DOE = angle EOF = angle FOA = frac{360^{circ}}{6} = 60^circ         ]     These angles ensure that each segment bounded by two consecutive points on the circumference and the center forms an equilateral triangle. 3. **Subdivision of Each Part into Two Equal Halves:**     - Now, consider each equilateral triangle. To further divide the circle into more parts while ensuring that the center is not on the boundary, we divide each triangle into two equal halves.     - To do this, draw an arc centered at point A with radius AB extending from point B to point O. Similarly, draw arcs centered at points B, C, D, E, F such that these arcs intersect at O and another consecutive point. 4. **Resulting Segments:**     - These arcs cut the triangle into two smaller regions of equal area. Hence, every initial section gets divided into two equal parts.      - For visualization, draw the arc for clarity as shown in the diagram from point A to O and so forth. By doing this systematically for each of the six regions, you end up with 12 equal parts.      In summary, you have divided the circle into 12 equal parts without placing the center O on the boundary of any single part.

This can be calculated using the binomial coefficient for placing red flags among blue flags plus extra slots (to avoid adjacency). There are 12+1=13 slots created by blue flags and the formula is {13 choose 9}. 2. **Selecting the Divider Flag**: After formatting the sequence such that no two red flags are adjacent, we choose a position for an imaginary blue flag to divide the sequence into two (for the two flagpoles) without actually placing the flag. There are 12+1=13 potential positions for this imaginary divider. 3. **Ensuring Distinct Flag Counts per Pole**: Since the poles need to have different numbers of flags to meet the condition that one flagpole always has more flags than the other, poles with exactly half of the total flags each (i.e., 10.5, which is not possible in integers) are not possible. We instead enumerate ways to divide such that one side strictly has more than the other which translates to choosing poles of size ranging from 1 to 10 flags for the smaller pole and the remainder for the larger. This leads to a sum of {13 choose 9} ordered sequences and 13 potential positions for each scenario where the poles have distinct counts, minus the overcount of cases where both poles might end up with the same count which cannot happen due to odd total. 4. **Eliminate Count Where Poles Have Even Distribution**: We do not need to subtract cases for even distribution since 21 is odd. 5. **Calculate Total Valid Arrangements**: The total valid arrangements, considering all constraints, is (12+1){13 choose 9} = 13 * 715 = 9295.

Step-by-Step Solution:  1. Proving A_0 B_0 C_0 D_0 is a trapezoid: Let's start by recalling the result from problem #526. (i) From problem #526, we have the equality of areas of triangles formed by intersection points with an arbitrary line.    frac{(A B C)}{left(A_0 B_0 C_0right)} = frac{(A B D)}{left(A_0 B_0 D_0right)}  Given that   (A B C) = (A B D)  It therefore follows that:  left(A_0 B_0 C_0right) = left(A_0 B_0 D_0right)  Since the areas of the triangles left(A_0 B_0 C_0right) and left(A_0 B_0 D_0right) are equal, the line segments C_0 D_0 and A_0 B_0 must be parallel (by the converse of the basic properties of trapezoids). From this, we can conclude that quadrilateral A_0 B_0 C_0 D_0 is a trapezoid.  2. Proving the ratio of the corresponding bases of trapezoids are equal: To compute the ratio of the bases, we consider:   (ii) The provided equality:  frac{A B}{C D} = frac{(A B C)}{(C D A)}  From problem #526, we know that:  frac{(A B C)}{(C D A)} = frac{left(A_0 B_0 C_0right)}{left(C_0 D_0 A_0right)}  Since (A B C) = (C D A) due to similarity and since triangle ABC and triangle CDA share the height from the vertices B and D to the line AC, this equality holds. Therefore:  frac{left(A_0 B_0 C_0right)}{left(C_0 D_0 A_0right)} = frac{A_0 B_0}{C_0 D_0}  Combining all this, we have:  frac{A B}{C D} = frac{A_0 B_0}{C_0 D_0}   Conclusion: The quadrilateral A_0 B_0 C_0 D_0 is a trapezoid, and the ratios of the corresponding bases of the trapezoids are equal.  boxed{}"},{"instruction":"wo cars are traveling in the same direction along the same route . the red car travels at a constant speed of 40 miles per hour , and the black car is traveling at a constant speed of 50 miles per hour . if the red car is 30 miles ahead of the black car , how many hours will it take the black car to overtake the red car ?","output":"To determine how long it will take for the black car to overtake the red car, we can set up an equation based on the distance each car travels.

Given    [    frac{1}{x} > frac{1}{x+1},    ]    we start by rewriting it as 2. Clear the denominators by multiplying both sides by x(x+1) (which is valid as long as x neq 0):    [    x + 1 > x.    ]    By rearranging, we get:    [    x + 1 - x > 0 implies 1 > 0,    ]    which is always true. However, remember that we must consider the ranges where the denominators are valid: x neq 0 and x + 1 neq 0, so x neq -1. 3. Therefore, the solution to the inequality is:    [    x in (-infty, -1) cup (0, infty).    ] 4. This implies that the event A can be rewritten as:    [    A = {xi in (-infty, -1) cup (0, infty)}.    ] 5. Since xi follows a normal distribution N(0, 4), it can be standardized.

According to the information given: 1. Tommy earned half of what Lisa earned, so T = L/2. 2. Lisa earned 15 more than Tommy, so L = T + 15. Using the first equation (T = L/2), we can substitute T in the second equation: L = (L/2) + 15. Now, let's solve for L: L - L/2 = 15 L/2 = 15 L = 15 * 2 L = 30. Now that we know Lisa earned 30, we can find out how much Tommy earned: T = L/2 T = 30/2 T = 15. Now we know: Lisa earned 30. Tommy earned 15. Since the total amount earned by all three (Lisa, Jack, and Tommy) is 60, we can find out how much Jack earned by subtracting Lisa and Tommy's earnings from the total: Jack's earnings = Total earnings - (Lisa's earnings + Tommy's earnings) Jack's earnings = 60 - (30 + 15) Jack's earnings = 60 - 45 Jack's earnings = 15. Now we have: Lisa's earnings = 30 Tommy's earnings = 15 Jack's earnings = 15 Total earnings = 60. The ratio of the money earned by Lisa to the total money earned is: Lisa's earnings : Total earnings 30 : 60. To simplify the ratio, we divide both parts by 30: (30/30) : (60/30) 1 : 2.

(1) Simplify f(alpha). (2) If f(alpha) = frac{sqrt{10}}{5}, find the value of frac{1}{sinalpha} + frac{1}{cosalpha}.","output":"(1) To simplify f(alpha), we use trigonometric identities and properties of periodicity. Using the periodic properties of sine and cosine functions: - sin(2pi - alpha) = -sin(alpha) because sine is an odd function. - cos(pi + alpha) = -cos(alpha) because cosine is an even function. - cosleft(frac{pi}{2} - alpharight) = sin(alpha) due to the co-function identity. - cosleft(frac{11pi}{2} - alpharight) = -sin(alpha) using periodicity of cosine (cos(theta + 2pi k) = cos(theta) for any integer k) and the co-function identity. For the denominator: - sin(3pi - alpha) = -sin(alpha) due to the sin function being odd and periodic. - cosleft(frac{pi}{2} + alpharight) = -cos(alpha) by the same co-function reasoning as above. - sinleft(frac{9pi}{2} + alpharight) = sin(alpha) using sine's periodicity (sin(theta + 2pi k) = sin(theta) for any integer k). Thus, we can now simplify f(alpha) as follows:  f(alpha) = frac{(-sinalpha)(-cosalpha)sinalpha(-sinalpha)}{-sinalpha(-cosalpha)sinalpha} + cosalpha  The terms cancel out, resulting in:  f(alpha) = sinalpha + cosalpha  Hence, f(alpha) simplifies to boxed{sinalpha + cosalpha}. (2) Given that f(alpha) = sinalpha + cosalpha = frac{sqrt{10}}{5}, we aim to find the value of frac{1}{sinalpha} + frac{1}{cosalpha}. Squaring both sides of the equation, we get:  (sinalpha + cosalpha)^2 = left(frac{sqrt{10}}{5}right)^2  Therefore:  sin^2alpha + 2sinalphacosalpha + cos^2alpha = frac{10}{25}  Since sin^2alpha + cos^2alpha = 1, by Pythagorean identity, we have:  1 + 2sinalphacosalpha = frac{2}{5}  This leads us to determine that:  2sinalphacosalpha = frac{2}{5} - 1 = -frac{3}{10}  Therefore, sinalphacosalpha = -frac{3}{20}. Now, using the sum and difference formulas for sine and cosine, we can rewrite frac{1}{sinalpha} + frac{1}{cosalpha} as:  frac{1}{sinalpha} + frac{1}{cosalpha} = frac{sinalpha + cosalpha}{sinalphacosalpha}  Substituting the known values, we get:  frac{1}{sinalpha} + frac{1}{cosalpha} = frac{frac{sqrt{10}}{5}}{-frac{3}{20}} = -frac{20sqrt{10}}{15}  This simplifies to:  frac{1}{sinalpha} + frac{1}{cosalpha} = -frac{4sqrt{10}}{3}  The final answer is boxed{-frac{4sqrt{10}}{3}}."},{"instruction":"Point D lies on side AC of isosceles triangle ABC (where AB = AC) such that angle BAC is 100^circ and angle DBC is 30^circ.

Since triangle BDE is a 30-60-90 triangle, BE = DE/sqrt{3} and DE = 2BE. Also, since angle CDE = 50^circ, we need to find CE.  Using the fact that BE = DE/sqrt{3} and s = BD + BE, we can express DE in terms of s:   s = BD + DE/sqrt{3}  For BD = DE cdot tan(30^circ), we get  s = DE cdot frac{1}{sqrt{3}} + DE/sqrt{3} = DE left(frac{1}{sqrt{3}} + frac{1}{sqrt{3}}right)   DE = frac{ssqrt{3}}{2}  Then, since DE = 2BE, BE = frac{ssqrt{3}}{4}, and therefore BD = frac{ssqrt{3}}{4} cdot sqrt{3} = frac{3ssqrt{3}}{12} = frac{s}{4}. Hence, CD = s - BD = frac{3s}{4}. Finally, since triangles ADB and CDB share the same height, the ratio of their areas is equal to the ratio of their bases AD/CD.

For this to happen, the length of one period, frac{2pi}{omega}, must fit into the interval [0, 2pi] more than twice but less than three times. This is because each period of the cosine function has exactly two points where cos omega x = 1 (at the start and end of each period), but since we are considering the interval starting from 0, the first zero is at x=0. Therefore, we need two full periods and a part of the third period within [0, 2pi] to have exactly 3 zeros. 4. **Translate this condition into an inequality**: This requirement translates into the inequality 2 cdot frac{2pi}{omega} leq 2pi < 3 cdot frac{2pi}{omega}. Simplifying this inequality gives us the range for omega. 5. **Solve the inequality for omega**: Solving 2 cdot frac{2pi}{omega} leq 2pi leads to omega geq 2, and solving 2pi < 3 cdot frac{2pi}{omega} leads to omega < 3. Combining these gives 2 leq omega < 3.

We reorder them such that a_1 leq a_2 leq ldots leq a_{100}, and if a_i = a_j for some i < j, then b_i < b_j. 3. **Claim**: The maximum value of N, the number of good pairs, is boxed{197}. 4. **Upper Bound Proof**:    - **Key Claim**: For any fixed integer m, 1 leq m leq 100, there are at most 2 values of i with 1 leq i < m such that the pair (i, m) is good.    - **Proof by Contradiction**: Assume there exist three integers i, j, and k with 1 leq i, j, k < m such that (i, m), (j, m), and (k, m) are all good.     - **Congruence Relations**: From |a_ib_j - a_jb_i| = 1, we have:      [      a_ib_m equiv pm 1 pmod{a_m}, quad a_jb_m equiv pm 1 pmod{a_m}, quad a_kb_m equiv pm 1 pmod{a_m}      ]    - **Analysis of Congruences**: Since i, j, k < m, and a_i, a_j, a_k < a_m, we conclude that a_i = a_j = a_k or a_i = a_m - a_j = a_m - a_k. This implies at least two of a_i, a_j, a_k are equal, say a_i = a_j.    - **Case Analysis**:      - **Case 1**: a_m > 2. We derive a_mb_i - a_mb_j = pm 2, 0, leading to b_i = b_j, contradicting the distinctness of pairs.      - **Case 2**: a_m = 2. Subcases lead to contradictions either by forcing b_i = b_j or by violating the condition |a_ib_m - a_mb_i| = 1.      - **Case 3**: a_m = 1. Similar analysis leads to contradictions in subcases.      - **Case 4**: a_m = 0. This directly contradicts |a_ib_m - a_mb_i| = 1 since the expression evaluates to 0. 5. **Counting Good Pairs**:    - For m = 1, no good pairs exist.    - For m = 2, at most one good pair exists.    - For 2 < m leq 100, at most 2 good pairs exist per m.    - Summing up, we get at most 2 times 98 + 1 = 197 good pairs. 6. **Achievability**:    - Consider the sequence (1,1), (1,2), (2,3), ldots, (99,100). Here, (1, n) is good for all 1 < n leq 100, and (i, i+1) is good for all 1 < i < 100. This gives a total of 197 good pairs. Thus, the largest possible value of N is boxed{197}. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let ( x geq 0 ) and ( y geq 0 ).

Since k must be an integer, the closest values are k = 9 or k = 10. This is similar to original problem reasoning that to minimize the area, the triangle becomes degenerate if k = 9.5. Therefore, k must be those integers close to 9.5, which are 9 and 10. Calculating the area for each, just as in the original problem through vertical drops and checking minimum heights, we conclude that: - For k=9, the height relative to line ell is 0.5. - For k=10, the height relative to line ell is 0.5 as well, since both are 0.5 units away but in opposite directions from 9.5.

Sides are seen entirely when viewed from arcs subtended by diagonals emanating from the circle's center to square's vertices. 3. **Probability and Arc Calculation**: The total measure of these arcs must be ( 180^circ ) because the probability condition translates to half of the circle's circumference.

Initially, the garrison has provisions for 2000 men for 54 days. So the total amount of provisions is: 2000 men * 54 days = 108,000 man-days After 21 days, the provisions left would be enough for the remaining 33 days (since 54 - 21 = 33 days). So the provisions left are: 2000 men * 33 days = 66,000 man-days Now, reinforcements arrive, and these provisions are only enough for 20 more days. Let's denote the size of the reinforcement as R. The total number of men after the reinforcement is 2000 + R. The provisions left (66,000 man-days) must now last for 20 days for the new total number of men (2000 + R). So we have: (2000 + R) men * 20 days = 66,000 man-days Now we can solve for R: 40,000 + 20R = 66,000 20R = 66,000 - 40,000 20R = 26,000 R = 26,000 / 20 R = 1,300 So the size of the reinforcement is boxed{1,300}  men."},{"instruction":"Point P lies on line l, which is parallel to side CD of triangle CDE.

The sequence must satisfy:    - The first coordinate of each domino after the first equals the second coordinate of the immediately preceding domino.    - No domino and its reverse (i.e., ((i, j)) and ((j, i))) both appear in the sequence. 2. **Graph Representation:**    We can represent this problem using a directed graph where each vertex represents an integer from 1 to 40, and each directed edge ((i, j)) represents a domino. The problem then reduces to finding the longest path in this directed graph. 3. **Counting Possible Edges:**    Each vertex can be connected to 39 other vertices (since the integers are distinct). Therefore, the total number of possible dominos (directed edges) is:    [    40 times 39 = 1560    ] 4. **Longest Path in a Directed Graph:**    To find the longest path in a directed graph, we need to consider the structure of the graph. Since we are dealing with a complete directed graph (where every vertex has an edge to every other vertex), we can use the properties of Hamiltonian paths. 5. **Hamiltonian Path:**    A Hamiltonian path visits each vertex exactly once.

Consequently, every pair among X_0, X_1, ldots, X_{2017} is also connected by edges of color C. 5. Define Y as a vertex connected to X_0 by an edge not of color C. Such a Y must exist, otherwise all edges in the N-gon would be color C, which contradicts the given condition that not all edges and diagonals are the same color. 6.

Thus, we conclude that in a harmonious coloring, any vertex X_0 must have at most (N-1) leq 2018 times 2016 edges of the different colors.

Since 2017 is prime, these colors are uniquely determined, ensuring a unique coloring method. 13. To verify the harmonious property of this coloring method, consider any three vertices (i_1, j_1), (i_2, j_2), (i_3, j_3). If (i_1, j_1) and (i_2, j_2) and (i_1, j_1) and (i_3, j_3) have edges of the same color:     - If the color is 2017, i_1 = i_2 = i_3 and thus (i_2, j_2) and (i_3, j_3) also have an edge of this color.     - If color k neq 2017, then j_1 - j_2 equiv k(i_1 - i_2) mod 2017 and j_1 - j_3 equiv k(i_1 - i_3) mod 2017, implying j_2 - j_3 equiv k(i_2 - i_3) mod 2017, thus (i_2, j_2) and (i_3, j_3) also have an edge of this color. 14.

Since the hypotenuse (BD) is 6 miles, the side opposite the 30^{circ} angle (which is the eastward distance from B to C) is half the hypotenuse.

This means that as t increases, f(x) actually decreases, and as t decreases, f(x) increases, due to the negative exponent. 1. **Finding the Interval for t**:    - The function t=-x^{2}+2x-3 is a downward-opening parabola because the coefficient of x^2 is negative.    - The vertex of this parabola, given by x = -frac{b}{2a} for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c, is at x = -frac{2}{2(-1)} = 1.    - Therefore, t is monotonically increasing on the interval (-infty, 1) and monotonically decreasing on the interval [1, +infty). 2. **Determining Monotonicity of f(x)**:    - Since f(x)={(frac{1}{3})}^{t} and frac{1}{3} < 1, f(x) is monotonically decreasing when t is increasing and monotonically increasing when t is decreasing.    - This means f(x) is monotonically decreasing in (-infty, 1) and monotonically increasing in [1, +infty).

We will involve a smaller circle of radius ( 0.95R ) centered at ( O ). 3. **Swimming to Circle ( C ) with Radius ( 0.95R ):**     - X moves initially from ( O ) (the center) to a point on the smaller circle ( C ), which is at radius ( 0.95R ).     - This distance is ( 0.95R ) and takes ( t = frac{0.95R}{v} ) time.  4. **Swimming Around Circle ( C ):**     - Once X reaches circle ( C ), X swims around it to create confusion for Y.     - The circumference of circle ( C ) is ( 2 pi times 0.95R = 1.9 pi R ).     - Y must run around the full circumference to follow X, which will take Y time proportional to her speed, which is greater than 1/4 of the perimeter of the large pond.    5. **Timing Advantage:**     - The crucial point is that ( 1.9 pi R ) is less than ( frac{1}{4} ) of the circumference of the pond (the entire circumference is ( 2pi R ) so ( frac{1}{4} times 2pi R = 0.5pi R )).     - Therefore, X can position himself such that Y is almost diametrically opposite. 6. **Final Movement:**     - At the optimal moment, X stops swimming around circle ( C ) and heads straight for the edge of the pond from his current position on circle ( C ) (radius ( 0.95R )).     - The distance from ( 0.95R ) to the edge is approximately ( 0.05R ) (( R - 0.95R )) and then an additional distance to the edge ( R ). 7. **Calculate the Time and Prove the Escape:**     - The total distance for X to swim from the circle ( C ) to the edge of the pond is ( 0.05R + R = 1.05R).     - The total time it takes X to swim this distance is ( frac{1.05R}{v} ).     - Meanwhile, Y has to run around the arc of the pond, which is approximately ( frac{pi R}{2} ); since we previously ensured ( 1.9 pi R < frac{pi R}{2} ).     - Y’s running distance to cover this would be around ( 3.14R ), taking ( frac{3.14R}{4v} ), where ( 3.14R/4 = 0.785R ). 8. **Confirm the Inequality:**     [     frac{1.05R}{v} < frac{3.14R}{4v}     ]          Simplifying, we find:          [     1.05 < 0.785     ]          Which confirms X will reach the edge sooner. 9. **Conclusion:**     X then runs directly away from Y upon reaching the edge.

(2) Find all the rational terms in the expansion.","output":"Let us examine the given problem step by step. 1. **Understanding the Coefficients**:    Given the expansion of (sqrt{x} - frac{1}{2sqrt[4]{x}})^n, the general term of a binomial expansion takes the form:        T_{k+1} = binom{n}{k} (sqrt{x})^{n-k} left(-frac{1}{2sqrt[4]{x}}right)^k         Our focus is on the coefficients of the first three terms, which will follow the pattern binom{n}{0}, binom{n}{1}left(-frac{1}{2}right), binom{n}{2}left(-frac{1}{2}right)^2. We're told that their absolute values form an arithmetic sequence. Upon comparing these, we find that the coefficients must satisfy:         2binom{n}{1}left(frac{1}{2}right) = binom{n}{0} + binom{n}{2}left(frac{1}{4}right)         Simplifying, we get:         n = binom{n}{1} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} cdot frac{1}{4}         This simplifies to:         n^2 - 9n + 8 = 0         Solving for n yields n = 8, since n = 1 is discarded as we're looking for the first three terms. 2. **Proving There is No Constant Term**:    To prove there is no constant term, we must ensure that the exponent of x is never zero.

Consequently, the expansion does not have a constant term. 3. **Finding Rational Terms**:    To find rational terms, we need the exponent of x to be an integer. This implies:        frac{16-3k}{4} in mathbb{Z}         For k between 0 and 8 (inclusive), the only values that satisfy this condition are k = 0, 4, 8.

Therefore, the minimum of varphi(x) is varphi(0) = 0, which means f(x) geq x - x^2.        boxed{f(x) geq -x^2 + x} 3. **Solution**: If f(x) > kx holds for any x in (0, +infty),    it means k < frac{f(x)}{x} for all x > 0.    Let g(x) = frac{f(x)}{x} for x > 0, then g'(x) = frac{xf'(x) - f(x)}{x^2},    which simplifies to frac{(x-1)(e^x - x - 1)}{x^2}.    From (2), we know that for x > 0, e^x - x - 1 > 0 always holds. Therefore, when 0 < x < 1, g'(x) < 0, g(x) is decreasing, and when x > 1, g'(x) > 0, g(x) is increasing.    Thus, the minimum of g(x) is g(1) = e - 2. Therefore, k < g(x)_{text{min}} = e - 2,    which means the range of k is (-infty, e-2).        boxed{k in (-infty, e-2)}"},{"instruction":"Show that given any 9 points inside a square of side 1 we can always find 3 which form a triangle with area less than  frac 18 .\\r \\r *Bulgaria*","output":"1. **Divide the Square into Smaller Regions:**    Consider a unit square with side length 1.

Define the sequence ( {a_n} ) as follows:     [     a_1 = 6, quad a_2 = 10, quad a_n = 15 cdot p_{n+1} quad (n geq 3)     ] 2. **Checking First Criteria:**     The first criterion is that none of the numbers in the sequence should be a divisor of any other. We need to show that no ( a_n ) divides ( a_m ) for ( n neq m ).     - For ( n geq 3 ), ( a_n ) is odd because it contains the factor ( p_{n+1} ), which is an odd prime. Hence, ( a_n ) cannot be divided by ( a_1 = 6 ) or ( a_2 = 10 ) because ( a_1 ) and ( a_2 ) are even.     - ( a_1 = 6 ) and ( a_2 = 10 ) are not divisors of each other because 6 and 10 are not multiples of each other.     - For ( n geq 3 ), ( a_n = 15 cdot p_{n+1} ) and includes the prime ( p_{n+1} ) which does not divide any other ( a_m ) for ( m neq n ). Therefore, ( a_n ) cannot divide ( a_m ) for ( n neq m ). 3. **Checking Second Criteria:**     The second criterion is that any two numbers in the sequence should have a common divisor greater than 1.     - For ( a_1 = 6 ) and ( a_2 = 10 ), the greatest common divisor ( gcd(6, 10) = 2 ).     - For ( a_1 = 6 ) and ( a_n = 15 cdot p_{n+1} ) where ( n geq 3 ), ( gcd(6, 15 cdot p_{n+1}) = 3 ).     - For ( a_2 = 10 ) and ( a_n = 15 cdot p_{n+1} ) where ( n geq 3 ), ( gcd(10, 15 cdot p_{n+1}) = 5 ).     - For ( n, m geq 3 ), ( gcd(15 cdot p_{n+1}, 15 cdot p_{m+1}) = 15 ) if ( n neq m ). 4. **Checking Third Criteria:**    The third criterion is that there should not be any number greater than 1 that divides all elements of the sequence.     - If a number divides all elements of the sequence, it must divide ( a_1 = 6 ) and ( a_2 = 10 ), implying the number must be 1 or 2.     - However, ( a_3 = 15 cdot p_4 ) is odd, so it cannot be divisible by 2. Thus, 2 can be ruled out.     - Therefore, the only common divisor is 1, satisfying the third criterion.      **Conclusion:** The sequence ( {6, 10, 15 cdot p_{4}, 15 cdot p_{5}, ldots} ) meets all given criteria.

We can express the work done as the product of the number of men and the number of hours they work. The depth of the hole is a measure of the amount of work done. For the first scenario, the work done by 18 men working ( h ) hours per day to dig 30 m deep can be represented as: [ 18 cdot h cdot 30 ] For the second scenario, to dig to a depth of 50 m with 22 extra men (making it a total of 18 + 22 = 40 men) working 6 hours per day, the work done can be represented as: [ 40 cdot 6 cdot 50 ] Since the amount of work done in both scenarios is the same (they both result in a hole being dug, just to different depths), we can set these two expressions equal to each other: [ 18 cdot h cdot 30 = 40 cdot 6 cdot 50 ] Now we can solve for ( h ): [ 18h cdot 30 = 40 cdot 6 cdot 50 ] [ 18h = frac{40 cdot 6 cdot 50}{30} ] [ 18h = frac{40 cdot 6 cdot 5 cdot 10}{3 cdot 10} ] [ 18h = frac{40 cdot 6 cdot 5}{3} ] [ 18h = 40 cdot 2 cdot 5 ] [ 18h = 400 ] [ h = frac{400}{18} ] [ h = frac{200}{9} ] [ h = 22 frac{2}{9} ] So the initial 18 men were working approximately 22 hours and 13 minutes (since ( frac{2}{9} ) of an hour is boxed{13.33}  minutes) per day.

Since the bee needs to maintain a distance greater than 1 from all 6 surfaces, we can imagine a smaller cube centered inside the large cube, with an edge length reduced by 2 times 1 (since 1 unit must be maintained at both sides). This smaller cube will thus have an edge length of 3 - 2 times 1 = 1. Now, the probability of a \\"safe flight\\" can be calculated as the ratio of the volume of the smaller safe region to the volume of the larger cube where the bee can fly. Therefore: The volume of the large cube is V_{text{large}} = 3^3 = 27 (since the edge length is 3). The volume of the smaller safe region is V_{text{safe}} = 1^3 = 1 (since the edge length is 1).

Therefore, the factorized form using the grouping decomposition method is boxed{(2x+y+1)(2x-y+1)}. ② **Using the Term Splitting Method** for x^{2}-6x+8: - We start by rewriting the expression with a slight adjustment: x^{2}-6x+8 = x^{2}-6x+9-1. - Recognizing x^{2}-6x+9 as a perfect square, we rewrite it as (x-3)^{2}-1. - This gives us a difference of squares, which can be factored as: (x-3)^{2}-1 = (x-3-1)(x-3+1). - Simplifying the factors, we get: (x-4)(x-2).

This is a specific case of Ramsey’s theorem which states that for any two positive integers m and n, there exists a minimum number R(m,n) such that any group of R(m,n) people will contain either an m-clique (a set of m people all of whom know each other) or an n-independent set (a set of n people none of whom know each other).  In this case, m = n = 3, which means R(3,3) = 6. This result guarantees that in any group of six people, there will exist either a group of three who all know each other or a group of three who are all strangers to each other. # Steps of the Proof: 1. **Consider a Group of Six People:**    Let the set of six people be {A, B, C, D, E, F}. 2. **Select Any Person:**    Consider an arbitrary person from the set, say person A. 3. **Relation Analysis:**    Among the other five people (B, C, D, E, F), person A must have a specific kind of relationship with each: either acquaintance or stranger. By the pigeonhole principle, since there are five people and two kinds of relationships (acquaintance or not acquaintance), A must have at least three acquaintances or three strangers among them.    - Without loss of generality, let's assume A has at least three acquaintances among the five people. Suppose A knows B, C, and D. 4. **Check for Mutual Acquaintances:**    Among B, C, and D, check their mutual relationships:    - *Case 1: At least two among B, C, and D know each other.* Suppose B and C know each other. Because A knows both B and C, {A, B, C} form a triangular (3-clique) set of mutual acquaintances.        - *Case 2: None among B, C, and D know each other.* In this scenario, B, C, and D form an independent set of three mutual strangers. 5. **Considering Mutual Strangers:**    The same approach can be applied if we assumed initially that A had at least three people among B, C, D, E, and F as strangers. This would also lead us to identify either a group of three mutual strangers or lead back to the acquaintances scenario due to symmetry. # Conclusion:  No matter how the relationships are distributed, either three people will know each other or three people will be strangers, thus demonstrating the property required by Ramsey's number R(3,3) = 6. Therefore, it is inevitable that among any six people, there must exist three mutual acquaintances or three mutual strangers. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"triangle ( ABC ), the angle bisectors intersect at point ( O ).

The entries above the main diagonal will be linear combinations of ( a, b, ) and ( c ) with coefficients depending on ( n ).    - Specifically, the entries in the first superdiagonal (just above the main diagonal) will be ( na ), the second superdiagonal will be ( nb + text{terms involving } a ), and the third superdiagonal will be ( nc + text{terms involving } a text{ and } b ). 3. **Ensuring Perfect Squares:**    - To ensure that all entries of ( A^n ) are perfect squares, we need to choose ( a, b, ) and ( c ) such that the resulting expressions are perfect squares.    - Let's choose ( a = k ), where ( k ) is a positive integer. Then ( na ) will be ( nk ), which is a perfect square if ( k ) is chosen such that ( nk ) is a perfect square.    - Next, choose ( b ) such that ( nb + text{terms involving } a ) is a perfect square. For simplicity, let ( b = m ) where ( m ) is chosen such that ( nb + text{terms involving } a ) is a perfect square.    - Finally, choose ( c ) such that ( nc + text{terms involving } a text{ and } b ) is a perfect square. Let ( c = p ) where ( p ) is chosen such that ( nc + text{terms involving } a text{ and } b ) is a perfect square. 4. **Conclusion:**    - By carefully choosing ( a, b, ) and ( c ) as described, we can ensure that all entries of ( A^n ) are perfect squares.

After applying the discount, the friends equally split the payment, and each pays a certain amount.

After the 15% discount is applied, the friends pay 85% of the original cost, which we can express as ( 0.85C ). Since the four friends split the cost equally, each friend pays ( frac{0.85C}{4} ). We know that each friend's payment must also be a whole number because you can't pay a fraction of a cent. Therefore, ( frac{0.85C}{4} ) must be a whole number. Let's express ( 0.85C ) as a fraction to make it easier to work with: ( 0.85C = frac{85}{100}C = frac{17}{20}C ) Now, we want ( frac{17}{20}C ) to be divisible by 4 to ensure that each friend's payment is a whole number. This means that ( C ) must be a multiple of ( 20 times 4 = 80 ) because ( 17 ) is a prime number and doesn't have any factors in common with ( 20 ) or ( 4 ). Since ( C ) is a multiple of 13 and also needs to be a multiple of 80 for the friends' payments to be whole numbers, we are looking for the least common multiple (LCM) of 13 and 80. The prime factorization of 80 is ( 2^4 times 5 ), and since 13 is a prime number, the LCM of 13 and 80 will be ( 13 times 2^4 times 5 = 13 times 16 times 5 = 1040 ). Therefore, the original total cost ( C ) that satisfies both conditions (being a multiple of 13 and resulting in each friend's payment being a whole number) is ( 1040 ). Since ( C ) represents the cost of 5 bags of chips, the original cost of each bag of chips is ( frac{1040}{5} = 208 ).

Now, consider the sequence of numbers representing the positions at which candies are given. This sequence can be described by the formula for the sum of the first ( n ) natural numbers.

We need to count how many different positions (i.e., different remainders when divided by 73) these positions cover after 2020 distributions. 6.

This is the intersection with the x-axis. 2. **Calculating Areas of Triangles:** The area of a triangle is given by the formula frac{1}{2}bh, where b is the base and h is the height. - For the triangle under line l, the base is 6 (along the x-axis from 0 to 6) and the height is also 6 (along the y-axis from 0 to 6).

Each divisor ( d ) of ( n ) can be represented as ( d = prod_{i=1}^{k} p_i^{beta_i} ) where ( 0 leq beta_i leq alpha_i ).

Since each broccoli takes 1 square foot of area, the total area for 1600 broccoli would be 1600 square feet. The side length of the square area this year would be the square root of the total area, which is √1600 = 40 feet. Now, we need to find out the side length of the square area used last year.

The area of the square last year would be (40 - x)^2 square feet, and since each broccoli takes 1 square foot, this would also be the number of broccoli produced last year. We know that the number of broccoli produced last year is less than this year, so (40 - x)^2 must be less than 1600. The next perfect square less than 1600 is 1521, which is 39^2. So, the side length of the square last year was 39 feet, and the number of broccoli produced last year was 39^2 = 1521 broccoli.

When triangle =a^{2}-16leqslant 0, i.e., -4leqslant aleqslant 4, f'(x)geqslant 0, thus the function f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty) and has no monotonically decreasing interval. When triangle =a^{2}-16 > 0, i.e., a < -4 or a > 4, quad(i) If a < -4, then f′(x) > 0 always holds, thus f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,+infty) and has no decreasing interval. quad(ii) If a > 4, let f′(x)=0, we get x_{1}= frac {a- sqrt {a^{2}-16}}{4}, x_{2}= frac {a+ sqrt {a^{2}-16}}{4}.

When a > 4, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0,x_{1}) and (x_{2},+infty), and monotonically decreasing on (x_{1},x_{2}). (2) From (1), if f(x) has two extreme points, then a > 4, and x_{1}+x_{2}= frac {a}{2} > 0, x_{1}x_{2}=1, thus 0 < x_{1} < 1 < x_{2}.

Each time the wolf eats a sheep A: (a) If a friend of A was originally a friend, they are no longer friends with the wolf. (b) If a friend of A was not originally a friend of the wolf, they become friends with the wolf. The wolf repeats this procedure until it has eaten as many sheep as possible. Find the largest integer m as a function of n satisfying the following condition: there exists a choice of friendships among the sheep such that there are exactly m ways to choose the initially friendly sheep, allowing the wolf to eat all the sheep.","output":"1. **Variables and Initial Setup:**    - Let A be the number of the wolf's friends (sheep that are currently friends with the wolf).    - Let M be the number of sheep that are still alive.    - Let P be the number of pairs of friends among the sheep that are still alive. 2. **Invariant Observations:**    - Notice that, during the process, the sum (A + E + M) modulo 2 remains invariant. Let's analyze why:      - Initially, the wolf selects some sheep to be friends with.      - Each time the wolf eats a sheep A, it modifies its friendships:        - If an existing friend of A is also a friend of the wolf, it stops being a friend of the wolf.        - If an existing friend of A is not a friend of the wolf, it becomes a friend of the wolf.    Thus, in essence, eating a sheep toggles friendships and this keeps the parity of (A + E + M) consistent as follows:    - Initially, A must have the same parity as E for the invariant to hold, meaning that the wolf's selection of initial sheep must respect this parity condition. 3. **Analysis of Configurations:**       - Each specific combination of sheep friends that satisfy this condition will allow the wolf to potentially eat all the sheep.    - The total number of configurations that the wolf can start with is related to the parity relationship. Each sheep has two states: friend or not friend, thus (2^n) potential configurations in total.    - Halving these configurations (due to parity constraints) gives (2^{n-1}) valid initial configurations. 4. **Specific Case with Named Sheep \\"Gaston\\":**    - To illustrate with an example, consider a sheep \\"Gaston\\" who knows all other sheep:      - If initially, the wolf knows an odd number of sheep excluding Gaston, it starts by eating sheep while sparing Gaston until no other sheep besides Gaston remain.      - Since the wolf will always keep an odd number of friends (due to toggling friendships) until only Gaston remains, this results in Gaston eventually being a forced friend as it's the last sheep.      - The wolf then eats Gaston, and subsequently, eats the remaining single sheep, proving that the wolf can eat all the sheep following the parity conditions. 5. **Conclusion:**    - The maximum number of initial configurations allowing the wolf to eat all the sheep is therefore substantiated by the parity invariant and the explicit construction example.

To determine whether a cube can pass through a hole cut in another cube of the same size, let's analyze the projection of the cube perpendicular to its main diagonal. 2. Consider a cube with edge length a. The projection of this cube, when viewed along a direction perpendicular to one of its space diagonals, is a regular hexagon with side length given by:    [    b = frac{a sqrt{2}}{sqrt{3}}    ]    This is derived from the geometry of the cube and the relation between the side of the hexagon and the cube's edge. 3. Next, inscribe a square inside this regular hexagon such that one of its sides is parallel to one of the sides of the hexagon. Let's refer to the side length of this square as (s). 4.

Given the side length of the hexagon b above, the side length of the inscribed square s is:    [    s = frac{2b}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2 cdot frac{a sqrt{2}}{sqrt{3}}}{sqrt{3}} = frac{2 a sqrt{2}}{3}    ]      5.

We can deduce this by using properties of sequences of cubes and certain polynomial techniques. 2. **Using Polynomial Properties:**    Consider any degree-3 polynomial ( f(x) ). It's known that the difference ( f(x+h) - f(x) ) is a degree-2 polynomial, and further differences eventually simplify to a constant when taken enough times, here specifically three times. 3. **Difference Sequences Among Cubes:**    Let ( c_m = (m+u)^3 ) for some integer ( u ). We explore the differences among cubes as follows:    [    c_{1} - c_{0}, quad c_{3} - c_{2}, quad c_{5} - c_{4}, quad c_{7} - c_{6}, ldots    ] 4. **Defining Quadratic Difference Sequences:**    Define ( a_m := c_{m+1} - c_{m} ), which forms a quadratic function. Consider further differences:    [    a_2 - a_0, quad a_6 - a_4, ldots    ]    These further reduce to linear sequences. 5. **Obtaining a Constant Sequence:**    Define ( b_m := a_{m+2} - a_{m} ) and notice that ( b )-sequences simplify to constants. For instance,    [    b_{4} - b_{0} = a_{6} - a_{4} - (a_{2} - a_{0}) = a_{6} - a_{4} - a_{2} + a_{0}    ]    This ultimately results in a constant sequence of cubes:    [    b_{4} - b_{0} = c_{7} - c_{6} - c_{5} + c_{4} - c_{3} + c_{2} + c_{1} - c_{0}    ] 6. **Computing the Constant:**    Using ( u = -3 ), we compute:    [    (-2)^3 - (-1)^3 + 0^3 - 1^3 + 2^3 - 3^3 + 4^3 - 3^3 = 48    ]    Thus, we define:    [    s_u := -u^3 + (u+1)^3 + (u+2)^3 - (u+3)^3 + (u+4)^3 - (u+5)^3 - (u+6)^3 + (u+7)^3    ]    and observe ( s_u = 48 ) holds for any ( u ). 7. **Final Sum Decomposition:**    Since ( 20162016 = 420042 times 48 ), express ( 20162016 ) as a sum of 420042 instances of 8-element sum/differences of cubes:    [    N = 8 times 420042 = 3360336    ]    The repeating pattern for ( a_k ) is ( -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1 ). 8. **Conclusion:**    Hence, we have:    [    N = 3360336 text{ and } a_k text{ follows the repeating pattern } -1, 1, 1, -1, 1, -1, -1, 1.    ] (boxed{N = 3360336})"},{"instruction":"The definition of the cross product is given as _(|)_(a×b) _(|=|)_(a)_(||)_(b)_(|)_(sin ) _(θ)_ where _(θ)_ is the angle between vectors (a) and (b).

So, we can set up the following equation based on the new ratio: (4x + 8) / 3x = 2 / 1 Cross-multiplying gives us: 2 * 3x = 1 * (4x + 8) 6x = 4x + 8 Subtracting 4x from both sides gives us: 2x = 8 Dividing both sides by 2 gives us: x = 4 Now we can find the initial amounts of milk and water: Milk = 4x = 4 * 4 = 16 liters Water = 3x = 3 * 4 = 12 liters The total initial amount of the mixture in the can is: 16 liters (milk) + 12 liters (water) = 28 liters When 8 liters of milk are added, the can becomes full.

To check if these sides can form a triangle, we apply the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Here, we have: - 4 + 4 > 9 (True) - 4 + 9 > 4 (True) - 4 + 9 > 4 (True) However, for an isosceles triangle with two equal sides of length 4, having the third side as 9 violates the specific property of isosceles triangles where the two equal sides are always longer than the base if the base is the shortest side. Thus, this configuration cannot form a proper isosceles triangle. **Case 2:** When the base is 9, the sides of the triangle would be 4, 9, and 9. Again, applying the triangle inequality theorem: - 4 + 9 > 9 (True) - 9 + 9 > 4 (True) - 4 + 9 > 9 (True) In this configuration, all conditions are satisfied, and it adheres to the properties of an isosceles triangle, where the two equal sides are longer than the third side.

Given the triangle (ABC) with centroid (G), we are required to find the position of the point (P) such that the expression    [    AP cdot AG + BP cdot BG + CP cdot CG    ]    is minimized.     2. Recall that the centroid (G) of a triangle (ABC) divides each median in the ratio 2:1. This means that (G) is located at the point:    [    G = left( frac{A + B + C}{3} right)    ] 3. Consider the general inequality involving any point (P) in the plane:    [    AP cdot AG + BP cdot BG + CP cdot CG    ] 4. By placing (P) at the centroid (G), we can simplify the problem due to the symmetrical properties of the centroid. We will use vector algebra principles to formalize and further justify this choice. 5. Recall the definition and properties of the dot product in vector form:    [    AP cdot AG = overrightarrow{AP} cdot overrightarrow{AG}, quad BP cdot BG = overrightarrow{BP} cdot overrightarrow{BG}, quad CP cdot CG = overrightarrow{CP} cdot overrightarrow{CG}    ] 6. Consider the expression involving the centroid (G):    [    overrightarrow{A}G = -frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{B} + overrightarrow{C} - 2overrightarrow{A})    ]    And analogous expressions for (overrightarrow{B}G) and (overrightarrow{C}G):    [    overrightarrow{B}G = -frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{C} + overrightarrow{A} - 2overrightarrow{B}), quad overrightarrow{C}G = -frac{1}{3}(overrightarrow{A} + overrightarrow{B} - 2overrightarrow{C})    ] 7.

Thus, the given expression simplifies:    [    AP cdot AG + BP cdot BG + CP cdot CG = overrightarrow{A}G^2 + overrightarrow{B}G^2 + overrightarrow{C}G^2    ] 10. The distances from the vertices to the centroid (G) can be derived from the properties of the centroid in a triangle:     [     overrightarrow{A}G = frac{2}{3} overrightarrow{median}_A, quad overrightarrow{B}G = frac{2}{3} overrightarrow{median}_B, quad overrightarrow{C}G = frac{2}{3} overrightarrow{median}_C     ] 11.

From the midline theorem, the triangles (A_1B_1C_1) and (A'B'C') are homothetic with a shared center at the midline centroid (M) This proves that the incenter (Q_1) and (Q_2) are the same and also show on the line through the centroid and (N), thus making circle (S) coincide with (S'). 2. **Proving Circle (S) touching midlines** Under homothety centered at (M) and scaling factor (-frac{1}{2}), sides of the larger triangle map to respective triangle sides and the incenter stays consistent, thus attached to midlines proving equal distance from coordinate construction. This proves tangency. 3. **Proving Circle (S') touching mutually right side connectors** Connecting midlines and then center-based symmetrical proof with the centroid midpoint tangent properties completes the necessary systemic understanding.

This means the ratios of the coefficients of x, y, and the constant terms must be equal. Therefore, we can set up the proportion: [ frac{1}{m} = frac{m}{16} = frac{2}{8} ] 2. **Solve for m**: From the proportion, we focus on the coefficients of x and y to find m. We get: [ frac{1}{m} = frac{m}{16} ] Cross-multiplying gives us: [ 1 cdot 16 = m cdot m ] Simplifying, we find: [ m^2 = 16 ] Taking the square root of both sides gives us two possible values for m: [ m = pm 4 ] 3. **Determine the Correct Value of m**:  - When m = 4, substituting back into the original equations, we find that they represent the same line, which means the system has infinitely many solutions. - When m = -4, substituting back into the original equations would not satisfy the condition for infinitely many solutions as it would lead to parallel lines, not coinciding ones. Therefore, the correct value of m that satisfies the given condition (infinitely many solutions) is m = 4.

The task is to prove that with jumps of length (r), the grasshopper can reach at most 8 distinct points. 1. **Starting Point and Naming Conventions:**    - Let ( A_1 ) be the starting point on the circle.    - Let ( B_1 ) be the point on the straight line after the first jump.    - From ( B_1 ), the grasshopper jumps back to the circle at point ( A_2 ).    - Let ( B_2 ) be the point reached after the next jump to the line, and so on. Notice that the sequence of points alternates between the circle ((A_i)) and the line ((B_i)).  Geometric Insight: 2. **Identifying Rhombuses and Parallel Sections:**    - The segments ( A_1B_1A_2O ) and ( A_2B_2A_3O ) form rhombuses because they consist of segments of equal length ( r ).    - These rhombuses imply that ( A_1B_1 parallel B_2A_3 ). Hence, the points ( A_1, B_1, B_2, A_3 ) form a parallelogram.    - Consequently, ( A_1A_3 ) is parallel to ( B_1B_2 ), and because ( B_1B_2 ) is a segment on the line, ( A_1A_3 ) is also parallel to the line. 3. **Repeating Pattern:**    - If you apply the same reasoning and increment all indices by 2, you get ( A_3A_5 parallel text{the line} ). Thus, ( A_1 = A_5 ) after a full cycle.    - By symmetry and alternation, the sequence of points ( A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2, A_3, B_3, A_4, B_4 ) will cycle back to ( A_1 ) after ( A_4, B_4 ). No new distinct points are introduced beyond these 8 points. 4. **Concluding the Sequence:**    - Since every point has at most 2 possible moves from it (one back to the circle and one forward to the line), and these moves eventually cycle back to previously visited points, no more than 8 distinct points can ever be reached.  Conclusion: We have shown through geometric insights and the characteristics of the grasshopper's jumps that only 8 distinct points can be reached in this cyclical manner.

Since log_{3}(3^{frac{9}{2}}) = frac{9}{2}, we get: [ (2log_{3}a)^2 = frac{9}{2} ] 4. Simplifying, we find that (log_{3}a)^2 = frac{9}{4}. Given that 0 < a < 1, log_{3}a < 0. Thus, log_{3}a = -frac{3}{2}. 5. Solving for a, we get a = 3^{-frac{3}{2}}. Now, calculating frac{1}{{a}^{2}}+log_{9}a: 1. Substituting a = 3^{-frac{3}{2}}: [ frac{1}{{(3^{-frac{3}{2}})}^2} + log_{9}(3^{-frac{3}{2}}) ] 2. Simplifying, we get: [ frac{1}{3^{-3}} + frac{log_{3}(3^{-frac{3}{2}})}{log_{3}(9)} ] 3. Further simplifying gives: [ 27 + frac{-frac{3}{2}log_{3}(3)}{2log_{3}(3)} = 27 - frac{3}{4} ] 4. Therefore, we find: [ 27 - frac{3}{4} = frac{108}{4} - frac{3}{4} = frac{105}{4} ] So, the final answer is boxed{A: frac{105}{4}}."},{"instruction":"f a normal vector of the plane alpha is vec{n} = (1, 2, 2), and points A = (1, 0, 2) and B = (0, 1, 4) are given, with A notin alpha and B in alpha, find the distance from point A to the plane alpha.

The radius of each circumscribed circle is:    [    R = sqrt{(text{{side}}/2)^2 + (text{{side}}/2)^2} = sqrt{1+1} = sqrt{2}    ] 9. The height (h) of the cylinder is the sum of the vertical distances from (A') to (A), passing through the midpoints of the respective top and bottom. 10. The vertical distance between (A') at the top and (AB) includes a vertical component along with radial components due to the arrangement of the spheres. 11.

Each color (white, red, black) must appear on infinitely many horizontal lines. 2. For any white point A, black point C, and red point B, we must be able to find another red point D such that ABCD forms a parallelogram. Let's satisfy these conditions by following a systematic approach:  Step 1: Color Assignment - Let's consider the line y = x (the line with slope 1, passing through the origin) in the coordinate plane. - We'll color the points on this line alternately black and white. Specifically, we will assign:   - All points on the line y=x where x is an integer such that x mod 2 = 0 will be colored black.   - All points on the line y=x where x mod 2 neq 0 will be colored white. - The rest of the grid points will be colored red. This assignment clearly meets condition (1) because: - Every horizontal line intersects y = x, ensuring infinitely many black and white points. - By coloring all other points red, it is clear that every horizontal line will also contain infinitely many red points.  Step 2: Satisfying Condition 2 Let's now verify that for any white point A, black point C, and red point B, we can always find a red point D such that ABCD forms a parallelogram. Consider: - A white point A at coordinates A(x_1, y_1) where x_1 = y_1 and x_1 mod 2 neq 0. - A black point C at coordinates C(x_2, y_2) where x_2 = y_2 and x_2 mod 2 = 0. - A red point B(x_3, y_3).  Step 3: Finding Point D We need to find coordinates (x, y) for a red point D such that ABCD is a parallelogram. The coordinates (x, y) must satisfy: [ D(x, y) = (x_1 + x_2 - x_3, y_1 + y_2 - y_3) ] Since x_1 = y_1 and x_2 = y_2 by definition of points on y=x, we get: [ D(x, y) = (x_1 + x_2 - x_3, x_1 + x_2 - y_3) ] For D to be a red point, the following must hold: [ x neq y implies x_1 + x_2 - x_3 neq x_1 + x_2 - y_3 implies x_3 neq y_3 ] Since B is colored red, and red points are not on the line y=x, we have x_3 neq y_3 inherently from color definition. Thus, D must be a red point.  Step 4: Median Calculation for Parallelogram Finally, to confirm ABCD forms a parallelogram, the midpoints of diagonals AC and BD should be the same. Calculate the midpoint of AC: [ left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2} right) = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) text{ (since } x_1 = y_1 text{ and } x_2 = y_2 text{)} ] Calculate the midpoint of BD: [ left( frac{x_3 + (x_1 + x_2 - x_3)}{2}, frac{y_3 + (x_1 + x_2 - y_3)}{2} right) = left( frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} right) ] Therefore, A, B, C, D form a parallelogram. # Conclusion: This systematic approach satisfies both required conditions, establishing a valid way to color all the grid points.

Given that the standard deviation is ( sqrt{2} ), we can express the total variance as follows:    [    sqrt{ frac{ (x_{1} - bar{x})^2 + (x_{2} - bar{x})^2 + ldots + (x_{10} - bar{x})^2 }{ 10 } } = sqrt{2}    ]    Squared both sides gives us the following relationship:    [    frac{ (x_{1} - 6)^2 + (x_{2} - 6)^2 + ldots + (x_{10} - 6)^2 }{ 10 } = 2    ]    Simplifying further, we have:    [    (t_{1}^2 + t_{2}^2 + ldots + t_{10}^2) = 20    ] 4. By the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality applied to the sum of squares of ( t_i )'s for any subset of ( t_i )'s, we know:    [    (t_{1} + t_{2} + ldots + t_{5})^2 leq 5(t_{1}^2 + t_{2}^2 + ldots + t_{5}^2)     ]    [    text{And} quad (t_{6} + t_{7} + ldots + t_{10})^2 leq 5(t_{6}^2 + t_{7}^2 + ldots + t_{10}^2)    ] 5.

Therefore,     [    (t_{1} + t_{2} + ldots + t_{5})^2 leq 5 cdot 10 = 50    ]    Leading to:    [    -5sqrt{2} leq t_{1} + t_{2} + ldots + t_{5} leq 5sqrt{2}    ] 7.

The binomial coefficient for choosing k columns is binom{10}{2k} where k varies to account for all even column choices.    - Summing these binomial coefficients for all k gives the total number of ways to choose subsets of columns with an even number of elements.

We need to verify the given condition:    - Pairs: ( {2, 3} ):      - The absolute difference: ( |2 - 3| = 1 )      - The greatest common divisor: ( gcd(2, 3) = 1 )    - Since (|2-3| = gcd(2, 3)), this set satisfies the condition. 3. **Inductive Step**    - Suppose we have a set ( S_k = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k} ) that satisfies the given condition for some ( k ) where ( k geq 2 ).    - Define new elements ( b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{k+1} ) as follows:      [      b_1 = a_1 a_2 cdots a_k      ]      [      b_j = b_1 + a_{j-1}, quad 2 leq j leq k+1      ]    - Now, let ( S_{k+1} = {b_1, b_2, ldots, b_{k+1}} ). 4. **Verification for ( k+1 )**    - Consider any pair ( (m, n) in S_{k+1} ):        - Without loss of generality, let ( m = b_1 ) and ( n = b_2 ):        [        m = b_1 = a_1a_2 cdots a_k        ]        [        n = b_2 = b_1 + a_1 = a_1a_2 cdots a_k + a_1        ]        [        |m - n| = |b_1 - b_1 - a_1| = a_1        ]        - Now calculate ( gcd(b_1, b_2) ):        [        gcd(b_1, b_2) = gcd(a_1a_2 cdots a_k, a_1a_2 cdots a_k + a_1)        ]        - Since ( a_1a_2 cdots a_k ) is a multiple of ( a_1 ), the gcd simplifies to ( a_1 ):        [        gcd(a_1a_2 cdots a_k, a_1(a_2 cdots a_k + 1)) = a_1 times gcd(a_2 cdots a_k, a_2 cdots a_k + 1)        ]        - Notice that ( gcd(a_2 cdots a_k, a_2 cdots a_k + 1) = 1 ), since consecutive integers are coprime:        [        gcd(a_1a_2 cdots a_k, a_1 cdots a_k + a_1) = a_1 times 1 = a_1        ]    - We can similarly verify for all other pairs in ( S_{k+1} ). By this construction, we can iterate from ( k=1 ) to ( k=2011 ) to get a required set of 2011 elements which satisfies the given |m-n| = (m, n) condition for every pair of distinct elements. Thus, there indeed exists a set of 2011 positive integers satisfying the given condition.

Thus, (a + b) and (c) share the same parity (both even or both odd). 6. **Calculating the Value of (r):**    Given that (a + b) and (c) have the same parity, the expression ((a + b - c)) will be even:    [    a + b - c text{ is even}    ]    Therefore, ( frac{a + b - c}{2} ) is an integer. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since (r = frac{a + b - c}{2}) and (frac{a + b - c}{2}) is an integer, it follows that (r) is necessarily an integer for any Pythagorean triangle.

This means that for any value of x, f(1+x) will have the same value as f(1-x). This symmetry implies that f(-x) = f(2+x) because shifting the graph of f(x) one unit to the left, which gives us y = f(x+1), results in a graph that is symmetric about the y-axis. Therefore, y = f(x+1) is an even function, making statement boxed{A} correct. **Step 2: Exploring Periodicity** From the second equation, f(x-2) + f(-x) = 0, we can rewrite it as -f(x-2) = f(-x).

What is the probability that ( Q ) is within two units of the origin? Express your answer as a common fraction in terms of ( pi ).","output":"The problem requires finding the probability that point ( Q ) lies within two units of the origin. This situation is analogous to the problem of ( Q ) lying inside a circle centered at the origin with a radius of 2 units.  First, consider the area of the circle. Since the circle has radius 2, its area ( A_{circle} ) is: [ A_{circle} = pi r^2 = pi(2^2) = 4pi ] Next, the area of the square must be calculated. Since the square's vertices are at ( (pm 3, pm 3) ), it has a side length of 6 units. Therefore, the area ( A_{square} ) of the square is: [ A_{square} = s^2 = 6^2 = 36 ] Assuming the entire circle of radius 2 is within the square, the probability that point ( Q ) falls inside the circle is the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square: [ P = frac{A_{circle}}{A_{square}} = frac{4pi}{36} = frac{pi}{9} ] Thus, the probability that point ( Q ) is within two units of the origin is (boxed{frac{pi}{9}}). Conclusion: Given this configuration, where the entire circle of radius 2 fits within the boundaries of the square with side length 6, the calculations show that the final result is consistent and valid. The probability that the point ( Q ) is within 2 units of the origin is effectively given by the area ratio of the circle to the square."},{"instruction":"Two pipes A and B can fill a tank in 10 hours and 15 hours respectively, while a third pipe C can drain the tank in 20 hours. If all three pipes are opened simultaneously, how much time will be taken to fill the tank completely?","output":"Let's calculate the rate at which each pipe can fill or drain the tank per hour. Pipe A can fill the tank in 10 hours, so its rate is 1/10 of the tank per hour. Pipe B can fill the tank in 15 hours, so its rate is 1/15 of the tank per hour. Pipe C can drain the tank in 20 hours, so its rate is -1/20 of the tank per hour (negative because it drains the tank). When all three pipes are opened simultaneously, their rates are combined. So, the combined rate is: (1/10) + (1/15) - (1/20) To add these fractions, we need a common denominator. The least common multiple of 10, 15, and 20 is 60. So we convert each fraction to have a denominator of 60: (6/60) + (4/60) - (3/60) Now, we can add the fractions: (6 + 4 - 3) / 60 = (10 - 3) / 60 = 7 / 60 So, the combined rate of all three pipes working together is 7/60 of the tank per hour. To find out how long it will take to fill the tank completely, we divide the whole tank (1) by the combined rate: 1 / (7/60) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: 1 * (60/7) = 60/7 ≈ 8.57 hours Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{8.57}  hours to fill the tank completely when all three pipes are opened simultaneously."},{"instruction":"At a garage sale, all of the items were sold at different prices.

According to the given information, we have the following ratios: Y : M = 3 : 2 M : B = 4 : 5 To find the number of NY Mets fans, we need to combine these ratios to find a common ratio that includes Y, M, and B. We can do this by multiplying the two ratios in such a way that the M terms are the same in both ratios.

The total ratio of all fans is 12 + 8 + 10 = 30.

Prove that some edge has never been chosen.","output":"1. **Labeling and Initial Setup:**    - Label the positions (1, 2, ldots, 2n) in clockwise order.    - For two adjacent positions (u_1, u_2), we say that a token *goes to (u_2) from (u_1)* if it enters (u_1) and goes to (u_2) via the edge (u_2 - u_1).    - Let (T_i) denote the token initially on position (i). 2. **Claim 1:**    - **Statement:** The following cannot happen: for some (i, j) with (i < j), (T_i) goes to vertex 2 from 1 and (T_j) goes to vertex 1 from 2.    - **Proof:**      - If a token (T_i) goes to 2 from 1, then it must go through all the positions (i, i+1, ldots, 2n, 1).      - Suppose when (T_i) is at position 2, it gets swapped with some token (T_k) at position 1. Then we must have (k < i). This is because if (k > i), then (T_i) would have collided with (T_k) while going to 2 (so it can't collide again).      - Now suppose this happens for some ((i, j)) with (i < j). Let ((i, j)) be such a pair with maximal (j - i). Without loss of generality, assume (T_i) reaches 2 before (T_j) reaches 1. Note that (T_i) and (T_j) must collide before this happens since (i < j).      - After this moment (when (T_i) goes to 2 from 1), (T_i) must go through the 1-2 edge at least once again, otherwise it will block the path of (T_j) to 1. Suppose it gets swapped with (T_k) while going through the 1-2 edge again. Then we must have (k < i) and then ((k, j)) is a pair with larger (j - k), contradiction. (blacksquare) 3. **Claim 2:**    - **Statement:** For any (u, v), (S(u) cap S(v)) is a contiguous segment.    - **Proof:**      - Suppose not. Let (S(u) = [1, x]), (S(v) = [y, 2n] cup [1, z]) where (y, z < x), so (S(u) cap S(v) = I_1 cup I_2) where (I_1 = [1, z]), (I_2 = [y, x]).      - Assume (u, v) meet in (I_2) and without loss of generality (u, v) meet before (u) goes to some edge in (I_1) (otherwise reverse the process). Note that we must have (u > v), otherwise when (T_u, T_v) meet they both get trapped in (I_2). For the same reason, (T_v) cannot go to some edge in (I_1) before meeting with (T_u).      - Now note that when (T_u) goes to edge 1-2 for the first time, it must go to 1 from 2. Similarly, when (T_v) goes to edge 1-2 for the first time, it must go from 2 to 1. This is forbidden by Claim 1. (blacksquare) 4. **Claim 3:**    - **Statement:** For any (u, v, w), (S(u) cap S(v) cap S(w) neq emptyset).    - **Proof:**      - Assume otherwise. Let (S(u) = [y, 2n] cup [1, z]), (S(v) = [p, q]), (S(w) = [t, r]) where (p < z, q < t, y < r).      - Then we have (S(u) cap S(v) = I_1 = [p, z]), (S(v) cap S(w) = I_2 = [q, t]), (S(w) cap S(u) = I_3 = [y, r]). By assumption, (I_1, I_2, I_3) are pairwise disjoint.      - Among the three pairs, suppose ((T_u, T_w)) is the pair to meet first. We must have (u < w), otherwise after meeting they both get trapped in (I_3). Now suppose (T_v) meets (T_u) before (T_w). Then, since they come from opposite directions, after meeting they get trapped in (I_1). After this, (T_v) cannot meet (T_w), contradiction. (blacksquare) 5. **Claim 4:**    - **Statement:** (cap_v S(v) neq emptyset)    - **Proof:**      - For a fixed (u), consider the sets (S(u) cap S(v)). Note that (|S(u)| leq 2n - 1), so we can consider the sets (S(u) cap S(v)) as intervals in a line (they are intervals because of Claim 2).      - Now this is basically Helly's theorem: by Claim 3, the pairwise intersection of the intervals is nonempty, so their intersection must be nonempty. (blacksquare) 6. **Final Argument:**    - Without loss of generality, let the edge (1 - 2n) be in (cap_v S(v)).    - Partition the points into two parts: let (A) be the set of tokens which go to (2n) from 1 when they visit the 1-2n edge for the first time, and let (B) be the set of tokens which go to 1 from 2n when they visit the 1-2n edge for the first time.    - By Claim 1, there exists an (i) such that (A = {1, 2, ldots, i}) and (B = {i+1, ldots, 2n}).    - I claim that no token crosses the edge (i - (i+1)). Suppose some pair ((T_p, T_q)) is swapped on this edge *for the first time* with (T_p) in position (i), (T_q) in position (i+1). Note that (T_p, T_q) must have gone through the 1-2n edge before this, otherwise they are forced to collide again.    - I claim that (p in B, q in A). Assume on the contrary (p in A). Note that (T_p) must come to (i) from the 1 in the clockwise direction. Suppose it gets swapped with (T_k) when going to 2n from 1. Then it must collide with (T_k) again on its way to (i) (note that (T_k) gets trapped in ([1, i]) as the edge (i - (i+1)) is used for the first time by the pair ((T_p, T_q))). Similarly, (q in A). In particular, (p > i, q leq i).    - Now note that the path from (p) to (i) via 1 and the path from (q) to (i+1) via 1 must intersect, so (T_p, T_q) must collide before reaching (i). So the pair ((T_p, T_q)) cannot be swapped. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"A retailer buys 3 items: a radio for Rs 225, a watch for Rs 425, and a mobile phone for Rs 650.

Calculate the effective path traced by the center of the circle.    As the circle rolls along the inside of the square, the path traced by its center will form a smaller square, whose sides are 2 units shorter than the original square (since the circle's radius is 1 unit on all sides). 3.

Hence, it is always possible to arrange all volumes from 1 to 10 in ascending order.

Then we know that:    [    sum_{i=1}^n c_i sum_pi w_pi x_{pi(i)} = c_1 implies sum_pi |w_pi| geq frac{|c_1|}{max_pi left| sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_{pi(i)} right|}.    ]    By the duality of linear programming, one can show that equality holds, i.e.,    [    min sum_pi |w_pi| = max_{substack{c_1, ldots, c_n in mathbb{R}  sum |c_i| > 0}} frac{|c_1|}{max_{pi} left| sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_{pi(i)} right|}.    ]    So we have reduced it to an optimization problem on the right-hand side of the equation. 6. **Rearrangement Inequality:**    Assume without loss of generality that ( x_1 leq x_2 leq ldots leq x_n ) and ( sum x_i > 0 ). Also assume that ( c_1 leq c_2 leq ldots leq c_n ). We need to show that:    [    max_{substack{c_1, ldots, c_n in mathbb{R}  sum |c_i| > 0}} frac{max_i |c_i|}{max_{pi} left| sum_{i=1}^n c_i x_{pi(i)} right|} leq frac{2A + B}{AB}.    ]    This statement must be true because it is the same as the original problem, except with the vectors ( vec{alpha_i} ) replaced by real numbers ( c_i ). 7. **Denominator Analysis:**    The denominator can be one of two things, by using the rearrangement inequality:    [    max left( sum c_i x_i, -sum c_i x_{n+1-i} right),    ]    because ( x_1 leq x_2 leq ldots leq x_n ) and ( c_1 leq c_2 leq ldots leq c_n ). 8. **Lemma 1:**    If ( c_n > 0 ) and ( c_1 leq 0 ), we are done. This is because:    [    sum c_i x_i - sum c_i x_{n+1-i} = sum_{i=1}^{n/2} (c_{n+1-i} - c_i)(x_{n+1-i} - x_i) geq (c_n - c_1)B geq max_i |c_i| B.    ]    Therefore,    [    max left( sum c_i x_i, -sum c_i x_{n+1-i} right) geq frac{B}{2} max_i |c_i| geq frac{AB}{2A + B} max_i |c_i|,    ]    as desired. 9. **Lemma 2:**    If ( 0 < c_1 leq c_2 leq ldots leq c_n ), we are also done. It suffices to consider the case where all ( c_i ) are positive by symmetry. Also assume without loss of generality that ( c_n = 1 ), so ( max_i |c_i| = 1 ). We want to show that:    [    max left( sum c_i x_i, -sum c_i x_{n+1-i} right) geq frac{AB}{2A + B}.    ] 10. **Choice of ( d ):**     Consider a real ( 0 leq d leq 1 ). Consider the sum:     [     d sum c_i x_i - (1-d) sum c_i x_{n+1-i} = sum c_i (d x_i - (1-d) x_{n+1-i}).     ]     The sequence ( {d x_1 - (1-d) x_n, d x_2 - (1-d) x_{n-1}, ldots, d x_n - (1-d) x_1} ) is an increasing sequence. We can smooth ( c_1, ldots, c_{n-1} ) to all be the same value, and then smooth all of them to equal ( 0 ) or ( 1 ), as the expression is linear in those variables. Therefore,     [     sum c_i (d x_i - (1-d) x_{n+1-i}) geq min((2d-1) sum x_i, d x_n - (1-d) x_1).     ]     A good choice is ( 2d-1 = frac{B}{2A + B} implies d = frac{A + B}{2A + B} ). Then clearly ( 0 leq d leq 1 ). 11. **Final Inequality:**     To show that:     [     min((2d-1)A, (x_1 + x_n)d - x_1) geq frac{AB}{2A + B},     ]     it suffices to show that:     [     (x_1 + x_n) frac{A + B}{2A + B} - x_1 geq frac{AB}{2A + B},     ]     [     frac{A + B}{2A + B} x_n - frac{A}{2A + B} x_1 geq frac{AB}{2A + B},     ]     [     (A + B) x_n - A x_1 geq AB = A (x_n - x_1) Leftrightarrow B x_n geq 0,     ]     which is true as we assumed that ( sum x_i > 0 implies x_n > 0 ). Therefore, the proof is complete.

Similarly, 11 / 2 = 5.5, thus 6 tiles on each short side considering partial tiles needed for complete coverage.    - Each corner square is covered once, so add back 4 tiles for the corners.    - Total two-foot by two-foot tiles for the border = 2 times 8 + 2 times 6 + 4 = 16 + 12 + 4 = 32 tiles. 2. **Calculate the number of one-foot by one-foot tiles for the inner area:**    - The dimensions of the inner area are (15 - 4) times (20 - 4) = 11 times 16 = 176 square feet (as 2 feet border on each side reduces each dimension by 4 feet).    - Since each one-foot by one-foot tile covers 1 times 1 = 1 square foot, the number of one-foot by one-foot tiles needed is 176 tiles. 3. **Total number of tiles used:**    - The total number of tiles used is the sum of two-foot by two-foot tiles and one-foot by one-foot tiles.    - Total tiles = 32 + 176 = 208 tiles.

Let's break this down step-by-step. 1. **Initial Setup**:    Given two consecutive odd prime numbers, denote them as ( p ) and ( p' ) where ( p < p' ). We are considering odd prime numbers, which means ( p ) and ( p' ) are both greater than or equal to 3 and are odd integers. 2. **Expression for the Half-Sum**:    The average (half-sum) of ( p ) and ( p' ) is given by:    [    frac{p + p'}{2}    ]    Since both ( p ) and ( p' ) are odd, their sum ( p + p' ) is an even number. Dividing an even number by 2 results in an integer. Thus, ( frac{p + p'}{2} ) is an integer. 3. **Nature of the Integer Result**:    We know that between any two consecutive odd primes ( p ) and ( p' ), there are no other prime numbers. This means all integers strictly between ( p ) and ( p' ) must be composite. 4. **Position of the Average**:    Since the average ( frac{p + p'}{2} ) lies exactly between ( p ) and ( p' ), it must be one of the integers between ( p ) and ( p' ). Let's list it out:    [    p < frac{p + p'}{2} < p'    ]    Therefore, the integer ( frac{p + p'}{2} ) must be composite because, by definition, there are no prime numbers between ( p ) and ( p' ). # Conclusion: Thus, we have shown that the average (half-sum) of two consecutive odd prime numbers is always a composite number.

We will determine the conditions for ( AB ) to be as long as possible. 4. **Circle Tangency Argument:**    - Let ( C ) be a circle centered at ( A ) with radius ( AB ).    - If ( C ) is not tangent to the semicircle, then we could find a point ( B' ) on the semicircle such that ( AB' > AB ). Thus, ( AB ) must be tangent to the semicircle implying the longest distance is obtained when ( C ) is tangent to the semicircle.    - ( OA = OB = frac{1}{2} ), which is the radius of the semicircle. 5. **Right Triangle Maximization:**    The length ( AO ) forms a right triangle with ( AM ) and ( MO ), where:    - ( MO ) is twice the height of the equilateral triangle forming the hexagon.

Could it be that as a result, all 1985 planes ended up at 50 airfields?

We are given 1985 aerodromes in a country. Each aerodrome sends out a plane that lands in the most distant aerodrome from the point of origin. We need to determine if it is possible that all 1985 planes land on only 50 aerodromes. **Step 2**: Visualize the aerodromes and flights. Consider a geometric shape that helps us understand the distribution: A regular 50-gon (a polygon with 50 vertices) and its plane geometry principles. **Step 3**: Place the aerodromes accordingly. We place 50 aerodromes at the vertices of this regular 50-gon. The remaining 1935 aerodromes are placed at the center of the 50-gon. **Step 4** - **Define flight paths for central aerodromes**:    Flights from the center aerodromes will naturally choose the most distant vertex, we can assume these planes will land at each of the 50 vertices due to symmetry and equidistant properties of a regular 50-gon. **Step 5**: Define flight paths between vertices. Each aerodrome located at a vertex of the 50-gon will aim to fly to the diametrically opposite vertex (the farthest point on the polygon). In a regular 50-gon, each vertex has a distinct diametrical opposite vertex. Thus, because each vertex sends one plane to its farthest possible aerodrome, they will land precisely at the diametric opposite vertex. **Step 6**: Verify the condition on pairwise distances:   Because the flights between aerodromes in the center are to unique vertices and the vertex-to-vertex flights are to their specific and unique diametric vertex, all pairwise distances, as required by the problem, are distinct. **Conclusion**:  Thus, it is indeed possible for all 1985 planes to end up on exactly 50 distinct aerodromes.

Since the planes of faces triangle ABC and triangle A'B'C' are parallel, we can find the midpoints of the edges formed between these vertices. 2. **Determining Midpoints of Edges:**    The midpoints M of the edges left[AB'right], left[BC'right], left[CA'right], left[AC'right], left[BA'right], and left[CB'right] lie in a plane perpendicular to the symmetry axis passing through the center S of the octahedron.  3. **Calculating Congruent Line Segments:**    Each of these midpoints forms a regular hexagon as they are congruent and equidistant from each other. The segments joining these midpoints are congruent and equal in length to half the edge length of the octahedron.     To understand why, consider the segment between the midpoints of edges left[AB'right] and left[AC'right]. This segment is the midline of triangle AB'C', and hence, its length is half the length of the edge of the octahedron, i.e., |B'C'|/2. 4. **Area of the Regular Hexagon:**    To find the area of a regular hexagon inscribed in the plane, we need the side length of the hexagon. The side of this hexagon can be considered as tfrac{a}{sqrt{2}} since it's the distance between midpoints.     The area (A) of a regular hexagon with side length (s) is given by:     [     A = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} s^2     ] 5. **Applying the Side Length of the Hexagon:**    In our case, each side of the hexagon which connects midpoints is tfrac{a}{2}.     [     A = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} left( frac{a}{2} right)^2 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} cdot frac{a^2}{4} = frac{3sqrt{3} a^2}{8}     ] 6. **Conclusion:**    The area of the regular hexagon obtained by intersecting the octahedron with a plane such that it forms a regular hexagon is:    [    boxed{frac{3sqrt{3}}{8} a^2}    ]"},{"instruction":"Which statement is correct? mathrm{(A) } text{If } x < 0, text{then } x^3 < x. qquad mathrm{(B)  } text{If } x^3 > 0, text{then } x > 0. qquad mathrm{(C)  } text{If } x^3 < x, text{then } |x| > 1. qquad mathrm{(D)  } text{If } x^3 > x, text{then } x > 1. qquad mathrm{(E)  } text{If } x > 1, text{then } x^3 > x.

We know that M + A = 1/20, so we can substitute A = 1/20 - M into the equation: 15M + 71(1/20 - M) = 1 15M + 71/20 - 71M = 1 -56M + 71/20 = 1 -56M = 1 - 71/20 -56M = 20/20 - 71/20 -56M = (20 - 71)/20 -56M = -51/20 M = (-51/20) / -56 M = 51 / (20 * 56) M = 51 / 1120 Now, to find out how many days Micheal can complete the work separately, we take the reciprocal of his work rate: Days for Micheal to complete the work = 1 / M Days for Micheal to complete the work = 1120 / 51 To get a whole number, we can divide 1120 by 51: 1120 / 51 ≈ 21.96 Since Micheal can't work a fraction of a day, we can round this to the nearest whole number.

Let the circumcenters of triangles BCG, CAG, and ABG be D, E, F respectively. Also, let X be the intersection of the perpendiculars from E to AB and from F to AC.  2. **Characterize Intersection Points**:    Let omega_B and omega_C denote the circumcircles of triangles ABG and ACG, respectively. Also, let Y and Z denote the second intersections of the line through B parallel to AC and omega_B, and the line through C parallel to AB and omega_C. 3. **Reflection Argument**:    The lines BY and CZ intersect at A', the reflection of A across the midpoint of BC. A' lies on the A-median. Using the Power of a Point theorem with respect to A' and the circles omega_B and omega_C, we see ( A'B cdot A'Y = A'A cdot A'G = A'C cdot A'Z ). This means the quadrilateral YBCZ is cyclic. 4. **Perpendicular Bisector through Centers**:    Since BY parallel AC, the perpendicular bisector of BY passes through F, similarly, the perpendicular bisector of CZ passes through E. Therefore, X, being the intersection of these perpendiculars, is the center of the circle (YBCZ) and lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. 5. **Find Midpoints on BC**:    Let M be the midpoint of BC and N be the midpoint of EF. We aim to prove that N also lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. 6. **Intersecting Circles on BC**:    Let V and W denote the second intersections of omega_B and omega_C with BC respectively. The Power of a Point theorem applied at M with respect to omega_B and omega_C gives ( MV cdot MB = MG cdot MA = WM cdot MC ), so MV=WM, making M the midpoint of VW. 7. **Projections onto BC**:    Let E', N', and F' be the projections of E, N, and F onto BC, respectively. Since N is the midpoint of EF, N' is the midpoint of E'F'. 8. **Using Midpoints to Place N**:    Because E and F are the centers of omega_B and omega_C, E' and F' must be midpoints of segments BV and WC, respectively. Therefore, M is also the midpoint of E'F', implying N'=M. Consequently, N, the midpoint of EF, lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC. 9. **Conclusion**:    Since we have established that X lies on the perpendicular bisector of BC and N, the midpoint of EF also lies on this perpendicular bisector, we conclude that line DX bisects segment EF. boxed{text{Proved}}"},{"instruction":"( AB ) is a diameter; ( BC ) and ( AC ) are chords, with ( angle B C = 60^circ ).

In the first move, the first company should choose a prime number ( p geqslant 5 ). 2. **Response of the Second Company:**    Let the second company's response be ( q ). By the problem's assumption, ( q ) is not a multiple of ( p ), implying ( q ) is coprime with ( p ). 3. **Forming the Set ( S ):**    The set ( S ) consists of integers of the form ( ap + bq ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are non-negative integers. This follows from the fundamental result in number theory known as the Coin Exchange Problem (also known as the Frobenius Coin Problem). 4. **Application of the Coin Exchange Problem:**    By the proposition stated in Animath's arithmetic textbook (Proposition 2.4.4), an integer ( x ) is in the set ( S ) if and only if ( pq - p - q - x ) is not in ( S ). 5. **Subset of ( S ):**    Particularly, ( S ) includes all integers greater than ( pq - p - q ). Consequently, it leaves only a finite number of possible stamps to issue. This ensures the game will terminate in finite time. 6. **Existence of a Winning Strategy:**    As a result, one of the two companies must have a winning strategy to avoid punishment. 7. **Proof by Contradiction:**    - We assume for the sake of contradiction that the second company possesses a winning strategy.    - The first company could then issue a stamp of value ( pq - p - q ). According to the Coin Exchange Problem, this value cannot be formed using previously issued stamps.    - This choice of stamp does not eliminate any other potential values.     8. **Winning Strategy of the Second Company:**    The second company, following its winning strategy, would now issue a stamp of ( x ) jacomos. If the first company had issued the stamp of ( x ) jacomos in the previous round, it would have been in the current winning position of the second company. 9. **Contradiction:**    This implies that the first company would have appropriated the second company's strategy, leading to a contradiction. Therefore, the initial assumption that the second company has a winning strategy must be false. Hence, the first company must possess the winning strategy.

This is because squares are always non-negative, and the only non-negative number that can sum to 0 is 0 itself. Therefore, we break down the equation into two parts: 1.
