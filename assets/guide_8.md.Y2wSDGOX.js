In this story, Ryan didn't like collecting sand dollars as much as Samuel did. Ryan thought that sand dollars were dirty and ugly, because they often had sand and bits of seaweed stuck to them. Instead, Ryan preferred to build sandcastles or splash in the waves with Samuel. So, even though they had different opinions about sand dollars, Samuel and Ryan still had a great time together at the beach, enjoying the sun and playing in the sand.

Donald was a self-taught typist, his fingers flying across the keyboard in a haphazard dance, while Kevin was a typing maestro, his touch typist's method precise and efficient. Step 1: Determine the story's tone and setting. In this story, we see Donald and Kevin as friends who share an interest in typing. The amusing, light-hearted tone suggests that they might be involved in a friendly competition or a humorous situation. Step 2: Introduce a situation or challenge. One day, during their lunch break at the office, a few of their colleagues decided to organize an impromptu typing contest. Two keyboards were connected to the same computer, and the contenders had to type out a given text as quickly and accurately as possible. Step 3: Show their initial responses and reactions. Donald secretly welcomed the challenge, confident that his unique typing style would help him prevail against his formally trained friend. Kevin, on the other hand, felt assured, believing that his structured approach would reveal Donald's amateurish technique. Step 4: Describe the challenge or event. As the two friends sat down at the workstation, a small crowd of coworkers had gathered to witness the spectacle. The judge announced the contest's rules: the text to be typed would be a paragraph from a popular novel, and the only goal was to finish first without errors. The room grew silent in anticipation as the judge prepared to reveal the text. Step 5: Describe the progress of the task. At the word \\"go,\\" both Donald and Kevin's fingers sprang to life on the keyboards. The crowd watched in awe as Donald's fingers seemingly drummed and danced on the keys, while Kevin's fingers moved like a well-orchestrated dance troupe. Each keystroke added to the furious crescendo of clacking keys. Step 6: Introduce an unexpected twist. Halfway through the paragraph, a coworker accidentally bumped into Donald, jolting his hand and sending his fingers flying off course. Seizing the opportunity, Kevin's typing sped up even more, driven by the prospect of victory. Step 7: Show the characters' reactions and the story's resolution. Donald, refusing to give in, shook off the momentary setback and resumed his whirlwind typing, striving to catch up. Miraculously, his frenzied determination paid off - he managed to close the gap and soon, both friends were neck-and-neck. As they reached the final sentence, with hearts pounding and breaths held, the room erupted in a furious cheer as both friends finished their respective paragraphs simultaneously. Step 8: End the story with a conclusion that reflects on the characters and events. The friendly contest ended in a tie, leaving everyone in high spirits. Donald and Kevin exchanged looks, acknowledging each other's incredible skills and shared passion. Through it all, they found that their differing typing styles, though distinct in nature, were equally matched in talent. The event not only solidified the respect they had for one another but reminded everyone in the room that there is often more than one way to achieve greatness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is the word \\"keep\\" used in the same way in the following two sentences? Keep notes. Keep open the possibility of a merger.","output":"To analyze the usage of the word \\"keep\\" in both sentences, let us first break down the structure, and understand the meaning of each sentence. 1. Keep notes. Step 1: Identify structure - In this sentence, \\"keep\\" is a verb, and \\"notes\\" is a direct object. Step 2: Determine meaning - In context, this sentence means to retain, hold onto, or maintain notes, possibly for future reference or as a reminder. 2. Keep open the possibility of a merger. Step 1: Identify structure - In this sentence, \\"keep\\" is a verb, \\"open\\" is an adjective, and \\"possibility of a merger\\" is the direct object. Step 2: Determine meaning - In context, this sentence means to maintain, allow, or ensure that there remains the option for a potential merger. In both sentences, the word \\"keep\\" is used as a verb to convey the action of maintaining or continuing a certain condition. However, the specific usage in each sentence differs slightly.

Choose from the possible answers, would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? They wouldn't leave soon. Options: [+] unacceptable; [+] acceptable;","output":"[+] acceptable; The sentence \\"They wouldn't leave soon\\" can be considered acceptable by the strictest standards of a linguist, for several reasons. First, let's break down the sentence to analyze its components and why it is grammatically correct. 1. Subject: \\"They\\" is a plural pronoun that serves as the subject of the sentence. The use of \\"they\\" is correct because it can refer to multiple people or things, and it agrees with the plural verb form in the sentence. 2. Auxiliary verb: \\"would\\" is a modal auxiliary verb that is used to express a possibility or a hypothetical situation. In this case, it is used as the negative form \\"wouldn't,\\" which is a contraction of \\"would not.\\" This form is commonly used in informal spoken and written language. The use of \\"wouldn't\\" is appropriate because it helps convey the hypothetical nature of the situation being described. 3. Main verb: \\"leave\\" is the main verb of the sentence. It is an action verb that indicates departing from a place, and it agrees with the plural subject \\"they.\\" 4. Adverb of time: \\"soon\\" is an adverb of time, which provides information about when the action of the verb will occur or how long it will take. In this case, \\"soon\\" suggests that the action of leaving would not be happening in the near future. When combined, these elements form a sentence that is grammatically accurate and acceptable, according to the rules of English grammar. While the semantics of the sentence might be somewhat ambiguous and open to interpretation, the syntax and structure of the sentence are sound and adhere to standard linguistic guidelines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide some context and background, the 2010 United States House of Representatives elections took place on November 2, 2010. It occurred during President Barack Obama's first term of office. These elections were held in the backdrop of a struggling economy, slow recovery from the recession, high unemployment rates, and dissatisfaction with the Obama administration's policies - like the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. The outcomes of the 2010 elections were described as a \\"Republican wave,\\" as the Republican Party gained a significant number of seats in the House of Representatives. During the election, the Republicans gained 63 seats, which was the largest seat gain since the 1948 elections. This resulted in the Republicans taking control of the House with a total of 242 seats, compared to the Democrats' 193 seats. This shift in power had a considerable impact on the legislative agenda and dynamics in Washington. The Republican-controlled House was able to stall or block many of Obama's policy initiatives, leading to a substantial slowdown in implementing new legislation during the remainder of his presidency. Consequently, as a result of these elections and the Democrats losing control of the House, Nancy Pelosi, who served as the House Speaker from 2007 to 2011, sought to continue her leadership role within her party by running for the Minority Leader post. She was elected to the position in November 2010, remaining the House Democratic leader until she regained her position as Speaker of the House after the Democrats won the majority in the 2018 elections. So, by analyzing the provided sentence, it can be concluded that the Democratic Party was the one that lost control of the House in the 2010 elections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I saw this movie as a kid on Creature Feature when I lived in New York. It was a pretty creepy movie, though not as good as Horror Hotel. I just bought this movie on DVD, and it is different from what I remember because in the DVD that I bought there are several scenes where the actors speak in French and/or Italian and no subtitles are provided. Then the other actors respond in English to what was being said. Kind of weird. Also on the DVD box, the names of some of the actors are spelled differently than on IMDb. Aside from that, this movie is different in that the character of Elsie takes her clothes off and provides a nude shot in one scene and in another scene Julia tries to force Elizabeth (Barbara Steele) to make out with her by pushing her down on the bed and kissing her while Steele resists. That scene existed in the TV version, but it was very edited. I wonder if there is any extra footage that could be incorporated into a remastered ultra-edition? It seems sad that some of these old low budget classics have been spliced to bits and sold in all kinds of edited versions. Where are the master tapes and all the unused footage?  Aside from the first boring twenty minutes before Allen is delivered to the Castle, the rest of the movie is pretty good. There aren't too many special effects (but Herbert's face after Julia clubs him is a good one). The creepy atmosphere and the strange, exotic, and seductive look of Barbara Steele make the movie a lot better than it should be. I can honestly say that if Barbara Steele had not been in this film, it would be a big zero. She makes the movie a ten!

The reviewer has fond memories of watching the movie when they were younger, and they still find some enjoyment in the creepy atmosphere and the performance of Barbara Steele.

The Count visits Mina and her friends at the household of Lucy's father, Dr. Jack Seward (Donald Pleasence), whose clifftop mansion also serves as the local asylum. At dinner, he proves to be a charming guest and leaves a strong impression on the hosts, Lucy especially. Less charmed by this handsome Romanian count is Jonathan Harker (Trevor Eve), Lucy's fiancÃ©. Later that night, while Lucy and Jonathan are having a secret rendezvous, Dracula reveals his true nature as he descends upon Mina to drink her blood. The following morning, Lucy finds Mina awake in bed, struggling for breath. Powerless, she watches her friend die, only to find wounds on her throat. Lucy blames herself for Mina's death, as she had left her alone. At a loss for the cause of death, Dr. Seward calls for Mina's father, Professor Abraham van Helsing (Laurence Olivier). Van Helsing suspects what might have killed his daughter: a vampire. Moreover, he begins to worry about what fate his seemingly dead daughter may now have. Seward and van Helsing investigate their suspicions and discover a roughly clawed opening within Mina's coffin which leads to the local mines. It is there that they encounter the ghastly form of an undead Mina, and it is up to a distraught van Helsing to destroy what remains of his own daughter. Lucy meanwhile has been summoned to Carfax Abbey, Dracula's new home, and soon she reveals herself to be in love with this foreign prince and openly offers herself to him as his bride. After a surreal \\"Wedding Night\\" sequence (employing lasers and shot by famed James Bond title sequence designer, Maurice Binder), Lucy, like Mina before her, is now infected by Dracula's blood.

Movie plot title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[5] Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to...

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. News article: \\"It’s definitely possible,\\" said forensic scientist Ruth E. Ballard of California State University, Sacramento. \\"If they didn’t steam the stamp off and it was stored in a cool dry place, maybe there’s sufficient DNA left.\\"      The April 25 arrest of 72-year-old Joseph James DeAngelo in the Golden State Killer case has renewed interest in the state's Zodiac serial killer saga, which was the subject of a 2007 movie \\"Zodiac.\\"      But detectives say the timing is pure coincidence.      In a bid similar to the one undertaken by Golden State Killer investigators, police in Vallejo, California, sent two letters connected to the suspect to a private lab months ago, Detective Terry Poyser said. He added that the results of the newest DNA testing were expected soon and that detectives hope to submit them to a familial DNA service.      Investigators in the Golden State Killer case uploaded DNA to an open-source genealogical website, where they claim to have found a partial match to DeAngelo's distant relative.      Police who collared the former police officer said they had to produce a family tree dating back several generations before they zeroed in on DeAngelo, suspected in at least 12 murders and 50 rapes between 1976 and 1986.      Ballard is optimistic about the odds of catching the Zodiac Killer. She said the science of extracting DNA from everyday items continues to accelerate. \\"Our power of discrimination has gone through the roof,\\" she said.      Gary Harmor, director of a private lab known as the Serological Research Institute, said he's concerned the letters are too old to produce usable markers.      \\"I have worked with DNA from the 1960s and '70s at my lab,\\" he said. \\"It’s hard to get enough that hasn’t degraded to get a profile from it.\\"      Experts say another question is whether or not the evidence in the Zodiac file was stored in a cool, dry place or in a freezer. Because advances in DNA technology didn't start to change investigative protocols until the 1980s, the samples kept by Zodiac detectives would have had time to degenerate and take on bacteria. ||||| Investigators searching for the Zodiac Killer have submitted evidence to a private DNA lab in the hopes of obtaining a genetic profile of one of California's most elusive criminals — then tracking him down using the same kind of family-tree tracing recently used in the East Area Rapist case.      Vallejo police Detective Terry Poyser, who has worked the Zodiac case for four years, said his agency has submitted two envelopes that contained letters from the Zodiac Killer for a type of advanced DNA analysis that previously had not been available in the case.      Poyser declined to identify the lab, but said it would attempt to obtain a full DNA profile from saliva on the envelope flap and stamps. He said he expected to have results back from the lab as soon as in the next few weeks, and almost certainly by summer.      \\"They were confident they would be able to get something off it,\\" Poyser said.      Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP!      He said the envelopes had been sent to the lab a few months ago, before Joseph DeAngelo, who is suspected of being the East Area Rapist, was caught after investigators used a DNA profile run though an open-source database. Poyser said he hoped the same approach could be used if a complete profile of the Zodiac is obtained.      \\"If we get a good profile, then you start tracking back,\\" Poyser said. \\"It really comes down to DNA. Without it, you have nothing. It's a 50-years-old case.\\"      The use of public genealogy sites to track criminal DNA is relatively new. Prior to the case of the East Area Rapist, also known as the Golden State Killer, most investigations were limited to running DNA samples through state and federal databases that largely only contain DNA from convicted felons.      To be successful, those searches required the DNA belong to someone previously convicted, or to a close relative who also was a felon and therefore in the database.      In the East Area Rapist case, investigators have said they uploaded a genetic profile into an open source DNA database used by amateur genealogists searching for relatives, providing a much wider pool of potential matches.      Poyser said Vallejo police plan to do the same if a Zodiac sample is obtained. \\"We are having (the evidence) retested, and then we will go the routes we can,\\" he said.      SHARE COPY LINK With the exception of identical twins, each person has a unique DNA profile. This makes DNA matching a powerful tool for finding and convicting the perpetrator of a crime.      The Zodiac Killer roamed Northern California from December 1968 through October 1969, but was never caught despite at least one close run-in with police. He is known to have attacked seven victims — in Benicia, Vallejo, Lake Berryessa and San Francisco — killing five and leaving two survivors. However, the Zodiac claimed responsibility for many more deaths in letters, often signed with a symbol of a cross over a circle.                  Betty Lou Jensen and David Faraday were the first victims, on Dec. 20, 1968. The two high school students were shot on Lake Herman Road in Benicia, close to Vallejo.      A little more than six months later, the Zodiac struck again just a few miles from the first attack. On July 4, 1969, he shot Darlene Ferrin and Michael Mageau in Blue Rock Springs Park in Vallejo. Ferrin died, but Mageau survived.      The Zodiac killed two more times. At Lake Berryessa in Napa County, he attacked a young couple in September 1969. In that incident, he killed Cecelia Shepard, but her companion, Bryan Hartnell, survived. Two weeks later, the Zodiac shot San Francisco cab driver Paul Stine in the Presidio Heights neighborhood.      Vallejo became the lead agency in the case because of the Lake Herman Road killings and the Ferrin killing. When the Zodiac sent letters to Bay Area newspapers, they were forwarded to Vallejo police, Poyser said.      \\"That was our case at the time,\\" he said. \\"(San Francisco) hadn't had the homicide of the cab driver yet.\\"      The department has three letters and two envelopes from the Zodiac, Poyser said. The envelopes each have a double stamp, which Poyser said was a trademark of the Zodiac. They originally were sent to the San Francisco Chronicle and the San Francisco Examiner, he said. The third letter was sent to the Vallejo Times-Herald, but does not have an envelope with it, he said.      San Francisco police, who have been working on the case collaboratively with Vallejo, also have cards and ciphers sent by the Zodiac, he said.      Poyser said he believes the Zodiac Killer is no longer alive. Arthur Leigh Allen, a former elementary school teacher and convicted child molester who lived in Vallejo, long was considered a top suspect. Allen died in 1992 at the age of 58, according to media reports.      \\"Our Vallejo suspect is probably still the best lead,\\" Poyser said of Allen. \\"There are probably 30 different circumstantial things that point to him. ... He was extremely intelligent but a deviant dude.\\"      Allen largely was cleared as a suspect in 2002, when investigators obtained a partial DNA sample from the envelopes that didn't match his. Poyser said that DNA profile only had a few markers on it, less than half of the genetic points needed to definitively clear or identify a suspect.      Poyser said that DNA sample was hampered because technology didn't exist at the time to separate the glue used on the stamps and envelopes from the genetic material. However, science now has advanced to allow a clean grab of the DNA.      Poyser also said Allen was known to have asked other people to lick stamps and envelopes for him, claiming he didn't like the taste of the glue. \\"One of his friends actually said he did it for him, and we've had a couple people who lived in the neighborhood at the time say they did it as children,\\" he said.      Poyser said if a clean DNA sample is obtained, police might ask those who licked materials for Allen to submit DNA swabs. If they matched the Zodiac profile, it would provide another link to Allen, he said.      Even if Allen doesn't prove to be the Zodiac, Poyser said he believes it was someone familiar with Vallejo, and perhaps with a law enforcement or military background.      He pointed out that the first four victims all were shot in rural areas likely only known to locals. He also said that Ferrin, the 22-year-old woman shot and killed in Blue Rock Springs Park, may have been known to the killer. She was a waitress in a Vallejo restaurant and, though married, was dating at least one police officer, a possible link to the Zodiac, Poyser said.      Poyser, who plans on retiring next year after 25 years of police work, said he thinks a resolution to the case is possible.      \\"People need to know that the agencies involved in this — Napa, Vallejo and San Francisco — have been cooperating with each other for quite some time, and everybody is committed to closing it out.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Investigators searching for the Zodiac Killer have submitted evidence to a private DNA lab in the hopes of obtaining a genetic profile of one of California's most elusive criminals.

Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains.

Step 2: Incorporate Fact 1 into the narrative. Explain why fate brings the characters to Chennai. This could be due to work, adventure, or any other reason you find interesting and coherent. Make sure that the reason aligns with the storyline. Step 3: Incorporate Fact 2 into the narrative. Describe the forces or events that make the characters come to India. These events could be professional or personal in nature. For example, the character could be attending a work conference or visiting family. Step 4: Incorporate Fact 3 into the narrative. Introduce Ramya - the character that the protagonist's parents want their child to marry. As their parents arrange the wedding, describe the emotions and thoughts of the characters involved, including their expectations and fears. Step 5: Incorporate Fact 4 into the narrative. Explain Ramya's decision to marry the protagonist. How or why does she believe this will help her love? This could involve a love triangle or a situation where Ramya believes the protagonist can provide something her love needs, like financial stability. Step 6: Incorporate Fact 5 into the narrative. Describe Ramya's mother's hospitalization and how it ends up affecting the characters' lives, including their decisions and relationships. Step 7: Conclude the story by tying up any loose ends and providing closure for the characters. Reflect on the impact of the five key facts on the characters and their journey. By following these steps and weaving the five key facts into a coherent and engaging narrative, the task of creating a story between 100 and 1000 words in length will be completed successfully."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They decided to give it a try and started sliding headfirst down a snowy hill. If you haven't heard of a sled before, it's something like a plank that helps us slide on the snow. And headfirst means sliding with your head in front, just like superman! When the little kid started sliding down the hill, they felt a rush of excitement. They knew this was something special. The wind was blowing into their face, and they went faster and faster. They had never felt so free before. A nearby grown-up saw the little kid sliding down the hill and took a picture of them. This picture turned out to be essential in the kid's life because it reminded them of how much they loved sliding down hills on sleds. It was like a tiny hint from the universe, saying, \\"Hey, little kid! This is your destiny!\\" Destiny is like a plan that the universe has made for us long before we were born. As the little kid grew older, they kept practicing on their sled and became really skillful. They learned new tricks, went to competitions, and even started winning awards.

Available options: *after approval from Trump only; *not enough information; *before approval from the states; *after approval from the states and Trump; Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members. Trump repeatedly has threatened to deploy the military to help secure the border, especially as a caravan of Central American migrants makes it way north through Mexico, with some headed for the U.S. Question: When can the National Guard be deployed to the border of US and Mexico? Answer: A:","output":"The National Guard can be deployed to the border of the US and Mexico after approval from both the states and President Trump."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Therefore, this phenomenon falls within the realm of food export, where substances intended for human consumption are shipped from one region or country to another. The explicit information in the premise entails the idea that food produced in Crete is being exported to various locations across the globe. This confirms the truth of the hypothesis. Furthermore, the premise also mentions that \\"the seasonal gluts that used to see farming families through the winter now end up on tables in lands far away.\\" A \\"seasonal glut\\" essentially refers to an excessive supply or production of certain crops during particular seasons. From the context, we can infer that these surplus products produced by farming families in Crete are being exported to foreign nations rather than being stored for their own consumption during winter as they were traditionally intended. This detail from the premise upholds the hypothesis and supports the fact that there is an active export of Cretan food. Notably, promoting the export of local foods can have several implications. It contributes to the global recognition and appreciation of the unique Cretan diet. It also stimulates the local economy by creating a demand in foreign markets, offering opportunities for farmers and the wider community to generate additional income. This phenomenon can also play a role in cultural exchange, where different cuisines are introduced and embraced by people in various parts of the world. This unique expansion and export of the Cretan diet can result in international consumers becoming more aware of the specific ingredients, flavors, and nutritional benefits inherent in the cuisine.  Therefore, the hypothesis \\"There are some Cretan foods that get exported\\" is not only proven through the information from the premise, but also seems to encourage a profound implications on cultural and economic fronts by generating global awareness and appreciation of the Cretan diet, as well as by supporting the local economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Многие люди сегодня считают, что такие попытки \\"обновить\\" социалистическую систему и заставить ее работать для людей, были с самого начала обречены на неудачу. Translate this to English?","output":"Many people today believe that attempts to \\"renew\\" the socialist system and make it work for the people were doomed to fail from the very beginning. In the late 20th century, numerous countries with socialist systems underwent various reform attempts with the intention of improving their economies and standard of living for their citizens. These efforts were undertaken to address the drawbacks and inefficiencies observed within the planned economic systems, which were seen as less dynamic and less competitive compared to the market-oriented economies in the Western world. Consequently, these reform initiatives predominantly aimed at promoting higher levels of productivity, innovation, and responsiveness to the needs and demands of the populace. Some argue that such attempts to \\"renew\\" the socialist system inherently faced several challenges that eventually contributed to their failure. One significant challenge was the inherent contradiction between the fundamental principles of socialism and the need to implement market-oriented reforms that would drive efficiencies within the economy. Adopting market strategies in a socialist economy requires significant changes to the system that would ultimately undermine the very foundations of socialism - a planned and state-controlled economy - and move it closer to a market-oriented, capitalistic approach. Another underlying issue was the resistance to change within the political and bureaucratic elite who held power. In many socialist states, the dominant political elites often controlled the state-owned enterprises and the key decision-making processes. Consequently, they held vested interests in maintaining the status quo to protect their power, privileges, and networks of patronage. This resistance to change hindered the implementation and progress of any significant reform policies aimed at promoting tangible improvements within the socialist system. Moreover, the lack of effective mechanisms to enforce accountability and transparency within the socialist countries further exacerbated these issues. Widespread corruption, nepotism, and lack of oversight all contributed to weak governance structures that undermined even the most well-intentioned attempts at reforming the socialist system. This lack of accountability often resulted in resources being misallocated or siphoned off by corrupt officials rather than being directed towards productive investments and other critical areas that would benefit the population. Lastly, the lack of open and participatory political systems in socialist countries often stifled dissent and debate, making it difficult for citizens to have an influence on the direction and nature of reforms. This lack of engagement from the public meant that even if some reformists within the political elite sincerely wanted to address the system's flaws, their efforts would be disconnected from the broader needs and aspirations of the people. In conclusion, numerous factors contributed to the failure of attempts to \\"renew\\" the socialist system and make it work for the people. These factors include the inherent contradictions between the fundamental principles of socialism and market-oriented reforms, the resistance to change from the political and bureaucratic elite, weak governance structures, and the lack of open and participatory political systems. These challenges ultimately resulted in the collapse of most socialist systems in the late 20th century and the rise of various forms of hybrid market-socialist or market-oriented systems in their place."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - A flower, sometimes known as a bloom or blossom, is the reproductive structure found in plants that are floral (plants of the division Magnoliophyta, also called angiosperms). The biological function of a flower is to effect reproduction, usually by providing a mechanism for the union of sperm with eggs. Flowers may facilitate outcrossing (fusion of sperm and eggs from different individuals in a population) or allow selfing (fusion of sperm and egg from the same flower). Some flowers produce diaspores without fertilization (parthenocarpy). Flowers contain sporangia and are the site where gametophytes develop. Many flowers have evolved to be attractive to animals, so as to cause them to be vectors for the transfer of pollen. After fertilization, the ovary of the flower develops into fruit containing seeds.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Amaranthus, collectively known as amaranth, is a cosmopolitan genus of annual or short-lived perennial plants. Some amaranth species are cultivated as leaf vegetables, pseudocereals, and ornamental plants. Most of the species from \\"Amaranthus\\" are summer annual weeds and are commonly referred to as pigweed. Catkin-like cymes of densely packed flowers grow in summer or autumn. Approximately 60 species are recognized, with inflorescences and foliage ranging from purple and red to green or gold. Members of this genus share many characteristics and uses with members of the closely related genus \\"Celosia\\".  - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Kochia is a synonym of the genus \\"Bassia\\", that belongs to the subfamily Camphorosmoideae of family Amaranthaceae.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands. The state has a population of around 518,500, just over forty percent of which resides in the Greater Hobart precinct, which forms the metropolitan area of the state capital and largest city, Hobart.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Bassia is a genus of flowering plants in the amaranth family, Amaranthaceae. They are distributed in the western Mediterranean to eastern Asia. Some occur outside their native ranges as introduced species.  - Charles Antoine Lemaire (1 November 1800 in Paris  June 1871 in Paris), was a French botanist and botanical author, noted for his publications on Cactaceae.  - The Chenopodiaceae are a family of flowering plants, also called the goosefoot family. Although widely recognized in most plant classifications (notably the Cronquist system), the more recent gene-based APG system (1998) and the APG II system (2003) have included these plants in the family Amaranthaceae; molecular phylogeny has shown it to be paraphyletic.  - Caryophyllales is an order of flowering plants that includes the cacti, carnations, amaranths, ice plants, beets, and many carnivorous plants. Many members are succulent, having fleshy stems or leaves.  - Maireana is a genus of around 57 species of perennial shrubs and herbs in the family Amaranthaceae which are endemic to Australia .

Like gymnosperms, angiosperms are seed-producing plants; they are distinguished from gymnosperms by characteristics including flowers, endosperm within the seeds, and the production of fruits that contain the seeds. Etymologically, angiosperm means a plant that produces seeds within an enclosure, in other words, a fruiting plant. The term \\"angiosperm\\" comes from the Greek composite word (\\"angeion\\", \\"case\\" or \\"casing\\", and \\"sperma\\", \\"seed\\") meaning \\"enclosed seeds\\", after the enclosed condition of the seeds.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

Since the number we're looking for is 9 digits long, we need to adapt the format. It will be abcdefedba: the 1st digit being the same as the 9th, the 2nd the same as the 8th, and so on.  If the number is supposed to be even, its last digit (also the first digit in a palindrome) has to be an even number. So possibilities for the first and last digit are 2, 4, 6, 8 (we can't choose 0 because it would not be a 9-digit number anymore, and not 1,3,5,7,9 because it would not be even). That gives us 4 options. The second and eighth digits can be anything from 0 to 9, giving 10 choices each. The same applies to the third and seventh, and fourth and sixth digits. The middle digit (the fifth digit) can also be any of 0 to 9, giving 10 possibilities.

Since preventing weight loss is easier than trying to gain weight during treatment, keep an eye on your weight. Get on the scale at least three times a week.","output":"If you notice that you are starting to lose weight, take proactive measures to increase your calorie and nutrient intake. To do so, you should focus on consuming high-calorie, nutrient-dense foods and beverages. Gradually incorporate healthy fats such as olive oil, avocado, and nuts into your meals to boost the calorie count. Protein-rich foods like eggs, lean meats, fish, beans, and dairy products are also important, as they provide your body with the necessary building blocks for cell repair and growth. During chemotherapy, it is vital to consume smaller, more frequent meals throughout the day rather than sticking to the traditional three meals per day pattern. Aim for at least five to six meals a day, which may help prevent nausea associated with chemotherapy and ensures a constant supply of energy and nutrients. Don't forget to include snacks that are rich in calories and nutrients, like nuts, dried fruits, cheese, yogurt, and granola bars. Hydration is essential during treatment, but drinks can be turned into another opportunity to gain weight. Consuming liquid calories is sometimes easier for those experiencing nausea or reduced appetite. Opt for calorie-rich beverages like smoothies, milkshakes, and nutritional supplement drinks, and avoid consuming large volumes of low-calorie drinks like water or unsweetened tea too close to meal times, as they may fill you up and hinder your food intake. Chemotherapy can sap energy levels, leading to less physical activity and reduced muscle mass, thereby causing weight loss. Therefore, it is important to engage in light exercise such as walking, yoga, or stretching on a regular basis to maintain your muscle mass and strength. Consult your healthcare team for appropriate exercises and guidelines for your specific situation. Another crucial factor during chemotherapy is managing symptoms and side effects that can potentially affect your appetite and ability to consume food. Maintaining open communication with your healthcare team will help in addressing these issues promptly, and they may adjust your treatment or prescribe medications to help alleviate these symptoms. Lastly, consider working with a registered dietitian or nutritionist who specializes in cancer care. They will evaluate your current calorie and nutrient intake, provide tailored recommendations to help you gain weight, and suggest strategies to manage chemotherapy-related side effects affecting your eating habits. In conclusion, gaining weight during chemotherapy can be challenging, but with a proactive approach, it is possible to minimize weight loss and improve your overall quality of life. Focus on consuming high-calorie, nutrient-dense foods, eating smaller meals more frequently, incorporating calorie-rich beverages, engaging in light exercise, managing side effects, and working with a dietitian or nutritionist to better understand your nutritional needs during treatment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - Charles Fernando ( 1941 - 1995 ) was a Zimbabwean abstract painter and jazz musician . His style was greatly influenced by the music he played , and showed similarities to musical symbols and notes as well . His work can be found in the National Gallery of Zimbabwe .  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo.  - Francis Jack \\"Frank\\" McEwen, OBE (19 April 1907  15 January 1994) was an English artist, teacher, and museum administrator. He is best remembered today for his efforts to bring attention to the work of Shona artists in Rhodesia, and for helping to found the National Gallery of Zimbabwe. He was awarded the OBE in 1963.  - South Africa, officially the Republic of South Africa (RSA), is the southernmost country in Africa. It is bounded on the south by of coastline of Southern Africa stretching along the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, on the north by the neighbouring countries of Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and on the east and northeast by Mozambique and Swaziland, and surrounding the kingdom of Lesotho. South Africa is the 25th-largest country in the world by land area, and with close to 56 million people, is the world's 24th-most populous nation. It is the southernmost country on the mainland of the Old World or the Eastern Hemisphere. It is the only country that borders both the Atlantic Ocean and the Indian Ocean. About 80 percent of South Africans are of Sub-Saharan African ancestry, divided among a variety of ethnic groups speaking different Bantu languages, nine of which have official status. The remaining population consists of Africa's largest communities of European (white), Asian (Indian), and multiracial (coloured) ancestry.  - Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - Zimbabwe, officially the Republic of Zimbabwe, is a landlocked country located in southern Africa, between the Zambezi and Limpopo Rivers. It is bordered by South Africa to the south, Botswana to the west and southwest, Zambia to the northwest, and Mozambique to the east and northeast. Although it does not border Namibia, less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River separates it from that country. The capital and largest city is Harare. A country of roughly 13 million people, Zimbabwe has 16 official languages, with English, Shona, and Ndebele the most commonly used.  - Ragtime  also spelled rag-time or rag time  is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Namibia, officially the Republic of Namibia (German: ), is a country in southern Africa whose western border is the Atlantic Ocean. It shares land borders with Zambia and Angola to the north, Botswana to the east and South Africa to the south and east. Although it does not border Zimbabwe, a part of less than 200 metres of the Zambezi River (essentially a small bulge in Botswana to achieve a Botswana/Zambia micro-border) separates the two countries. Namibia gained independence from South Africa on 21 March 1990, following the Namibian War of Independence. Its capital and largest city is Windhoek, and it is a member state of the United Nations (UN), the Southern African Development Community (SADC), the African Union (AU), and the Commonwealth of Nations.  - Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon (4 August 1900  30 March 2002) was the wife of King George VI and the mother of Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon. She was Queen consort of the United Kingdom and the Dominions from her husband's accession in 1936 until his death in 1952, after which she was known as Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, to avoid confusion with her daughter. She was the last Empress consort of India.  - Harare (officially called Salisbury until 1982) is the capital and most populous city of Zimbabwe. Situated in the north-east of the country in the heart of historic Mashonaland, the city has an estimated population of 1,606,000 (2009), with 2,800,000 in its metropolitan area (2006). Administratively, Harare is a metropolitan province, which also incorporates Chitungwiza town and Epworth. It is situated at an elevation of above sea level and its climate falls into the subtropical highland category.  - The National Gallery of Zimbabwe (NGZ) is a gallery in Harare, Zimbabwe, dedicated to the presentation and conservation of Zimbabwe's contemporary art and visual heritage. The original National Gallery of Rhodesia was designed and directed by Frank McEwen, a British citizen credited with bringing Shona Sculpture to the spotlight. The Gallery was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother on 16 July 1957 and Queen Elizabeth II attended the sixth Zimbabwe Heritage Exhibition there in October 1991.  - Botswana , officially the Republic of Botswana, is a landlocked country located in Southern Africa. The citizens refer to themselves as \\"Batswana\\" (singular: \\"Motswana\\"). Formerly the British protectorate of Bechuanaland, Botswana adopted its new name after becoming independent within the Commonwealth on 30 September 1966. Since then, it has maintained a strong tradition of stable representative democracy, with a consistent record of uninterrupted democratic elections.  - The Limpopo River rises in central southern Africa, and flows generally eastwards to the Indian Ocean. The term Limpopo is the modified version of the original Sepedi name \\"diphororo tša meetse\\", meaning gushing strong waterfalls\\". The river is approximately long, with a drainage basin in size. The mean discharge measured over a year is 170 m/s (6,200 cu ft/s) at its mouth. The Limpopo is the second largest river in Africa that drains to the Indian Ocean, after the Zambezi River.  - New Orleans (or ) is a major United States port and the largest city and metropolitan area in the state of Louisiana. The population of the city was 343,829 as of the 2010 U.S. Census. The New Orleans metropolitan area (New OrleansMetairieKenner Metropolitan Statistical Area) had a population of 1,167,764 in 2010 and was the 46th largest in the United States.

Article: Neurophysiologists study the chemical, pharmacological, and electrical properties of the brain: their primary tools are drugs and recording devices. Thousands of experimentally developed drugs affect the nervous system, some in highly specific ways. Recordings of brain activity can be made using electrodes, either glued to the scalp as in EEG studies, or implanted inside the brains of animals for extracellular recordings, which can detect action potentials generated by individual neurons. Because the brain does not contain pain receptors, it is possible using these techniques to record brain activity from animals that are awake and behaving without causing distress. The same techniques have occasionally been used to study brain activity in human patients suffering from intractable epilepsy, in cases where there was a medical necessity to implant electrodes to localize the brain area responsible for epileptic seizures. Functional imaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging are also used to study brain activity; these techniques have mainly been used with human subjects, because they require a conscious subject to remain motionless for long periods of time, but they have the great advantage of being noninvasive. Question: Electrodes are often glued to what like in EEG studies?","output":"In EEG (electroencephalogram) studies, electrodes are often glued to the scalp of the subject. These electrodes are non-invasive and are used to record the electrical activity of the brain by detecting the fluctuations in voltage caused by the synchronized activity of neurons.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens?  York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" A:","output":"The last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens is Etty."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Tungsten metal was initially not available in a form that allowed it to be drawn into fine wires. Filaments made from sintered tungsten powder were quite fragile. By 1910, a process was developed by William D. Coolidge at General Electric for production of a ductile form of tungsten. The process required pressing tungsten powder into bars, then several steps of sintering, swaging, and then wire drawing. It was found that very pure tungsten formed filaments that sagged in use, and that a very small \\"doping\\" treatment with potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides at the level of a few hundred parts per million greatly improved the life and durability of the tungsten filaments. What other materials were combined with tungsten?","output":"The passage states that besides tungsten, other materials used to improve the life and durability of the tungsten filaments were potassium, silicon, and aluminium oxides. These substances were used at a very small level, typically that of a few hundred parts per million, in a process commonly referred to as \\"doping.\\"  These doping agents helped to enhance the characteristics of the tungsten - primarily by preventing the sagging of the filaments when in use. This technique allowed for production of ductile tungsten, reinforcing the strength and hardness of the material. This addition, however minor, vastly improved the efficiency, resilience, and lifespan of the tungsten filaments, making it a critical development in its production process.  Through this fine-tuning of the tungsten's properties, the filaments were able to withstand higher temperatures and emit a brighter light, improving their function in applications such as light bulb production, electronics, and various other industries requiring durable and heat-resistant materials."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: India decided to introduce several exotic species into their environment, while Singapore was very protective of its native species. India encountered big problems with extinction during the following years.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which country had more species go extinct? The answer is:","output":"India had more species go extinct. India, as mentioned in the paragraph, decided to introduce several exotic species into their environment. Exotic species, also known as invasive species or non-native species, are organisms that humans have moved from their native habitat to a new location. Introducing these species can often lead to imbalances in the ecosystems, as they tend to outcompete native species for resources such as food, water, and space, thereby disrupting the local food chains. On the other hand, Singapore was very protective of its native species, meaning that they carefully managed their environment and natural resources to prevent the introduction of exotic species and preserve the native habitat and ecosystems. As a result, they were better able to maintain a balanced environment that allowed their native species to thrive. Due to India's decision to introduce exotic species, the country experienced significant problems with extinction in the following years. The rapid proliferation of invasive species can lead to a decline in the population of native species, either due to predation or competition for resources. If a species is unable to adapt or compete with the new pressure, it may eventually face extinction. In conclusion, the country that had more species go extinct is India, as a result of the issues created by the introduction of exotic species into their environment, while Singapore worked to protect its native species and maintain a balanced ecosystem. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the ecological consequences of introducing non-native species, as well as the need for proactive conservation efforts to protect and preserve biodiversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which farmer observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil?  Two farmers had neighboring parcels of land. Bob had a nice parcel of old growth forest, while the other farmer, named Bill , had a similar sized parcel covered in grasslands.  Hint: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be deduced that the farmer who observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil was Bill, who had a parcel covered in grasslands. The paragraph states that precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration, which causes the soil to develop in relative drought. This results in decreased leaching and migration of weathering products. Additionally, the large amounts of evaporation in grasslands lead to the buildup of calcium and other large cations, which flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. With impermeable clay limiting the downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, chemical weathering and podzolization are reduced. The paragraph also mentions that when leaching is decreased, calcium precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, creating a layer known as caliche. Since this process is more prevalent in grasslands, it would make sense that Bill, with his grassland parcel, would observe a greater buildup of calcium in the soil compared to Bob, who had a parcel of old growth forest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, there are more detailed considerations and advice that can be given regarding carrying cash with you. Cash is an essential commodity in our daily lives, although the use of digital payment methods like credit cards, mobile wallets, and online payment platforms has increased over the years. Despite this, it's still a good idea to carry some cash with you for various reasons: 1. Convenience: Many small businesses and local vendors still operate on a cash basis, especially in remote areas without reliable internet connections or card-processing facilities. It's more convenient to have cash on hand for such purchases. 2. Emergencies: In case of emergencies or unexpected situations, cash can be a lifesaver. Examples include sudden medical needs, natural disasters, or power outages that render electronic payment methods obsolete. 3. Tipping: Some service providers like wait staff, hotel bellhops, or taxi drivers might prefer or expect cash tips, which can contribute to their income. 4. Budgeting: Carrying a certain amount of cash can help you with budgeting, as it strictly limits your spending and prevents you from overspending on non-essential items. When carrying cash with you, particularly in your purse, there are some best practices to follow: 1. Limit the amount: You don't need to carry large amounts of cash; carry only what you reasonably expect to spend in a day or during the outing. This will reduce the risk of loss or theft. 2. Store it securely: Use a purse or wallet with compartments and zippers to securely store your cash, avoiding the risk of dropping it or having it easily accessed by pickpockets. Some purses even come with RFID-blocking technology to protect your sensitive card information from electronic theft. 3. Keep it separate: It's a good idea to avoid keeping all your cash in one place. Instead, split it into smaller portions and store them in different compartments of your purse or in a separate, secured pocket. This way, if someone takes your purse or if you lose a part of it, not all your cash will be gone. 4. Be discreet: When paying with cash, avoid showing large amounts or drawing attention to your purse. This can help deter potential thieves or assailants from targeting you. 5. Safety precautions: Be aware of your surroundings and use common sense when carrying cash. Avoid flashing your cash in public and follow safety advice from authorities, especially when traveling abroad. It's also important to keep your purse secured and close to your body at all times. In conclusion, carrying cash in your purse is a suitable way to follow the statement \\"Carry all that cash with you.\\" However, it's crucial to do so responsibly, considering the risks and safety concerns while also enjoying the benefits of having cash on hand."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Title: One of Their Best Review: Queen of Connemara and Mary Ellen Carter are just two of the wonderful tracks on this, the last joint album by Tommy Makem and Liam Clancy.

Clouston became fugitive when he failed to register as convicted sex offender. Viewer tip to TV's \\"America's Most Wanted\\" led agents to Clouston, official says.","output":"Title: Fugitive Paul Clouston Apprehended at Men's Group Home in California Introduction Paul Clouston, 73, a long-time fugitive, was taken into custody at a men's group home in California after a tip came in from a viewer of the television show \\"America's Most Wanted.\\" Clouston had previously been convicted of killing a police detective and served time for the crime. However, he became a fugitive after failing to register as a convicted sex offender, prompting a nationwide hunt for his whereabouts.  1. Paul Clouston's criminal history Paul Clouston, at the age of 73, has been a well-known criminal figure, with a notorious past that includes being convicted for the killing of a police detective. He faced justice for his actions and served a prison sentence, but his criminal activities did not end there.  2. Failure to register as a convicted sex offender After his release from prison, Clouston was required by law to register as a convicted sex offender. However, he failed to comply with this legal obligation, choosing instead to evade authorities and go on the run. This blatant disregard for the law transformed Clouston back into a fugitive and set off a nationwide search to bring him back into custody. 3. The role of \\"America's Most Wanted\\" in Clouston's capture The television show \\"America's Most Wanted\\" has been instrumental in aiding law enforcement agencies in bringing criminals like Clouston to justice. The show, which profiles notorious fugitives and unsolved crimes, proved to be invaluable when it received a viewer tip that ultimately led agents to Clouston's location – a men's group home in California. 4. Clouston's arrest and capture Acting on the viewer tip, agents were able to zero in on Clouston and take him into custody without incident. His arrest marks the end of a long-running search that spanned across multiple states, and it's a testament to the cooperation between law enforcement and the public that made this outcome possible. Conclusion The apprehension of fugitive Paul Clouston highlights the importance of collaborative efforts between law enforcement agencies and the public in bringing fugitives to justice. Thanks to \\"America's Most Wanted,\\" the diligent work of law enforcement, and the vigilant citizen who provided the tip, Clouston will now be held accountable for failing to register as a convicted sex offender. This case serves as a reminder that no one is above the law, and that justice will be eventually served."},{"instruction":"Question: Background: The refraction of waves across boundaries operates similarly to the method by which tanks are steered. Tanks do not have a steering wheel. Instead, they have an accelerator to produce forward motion and separate brakes on each tread. The operator uses brakes on both treads at the same time in order to stop, but brakes on only one tread to turn the tank. By braking one side, the operator causes that side to slow down or stop while the other side continues at the previous speed, causing the tank to turn towards the slower tread.  Paragraph: Benjamin is taking an Army training class and is learning to operate a tank. Today, he is in a tank with an instructor on a training course. Benjamin drives the tank forward and comes to a large dirt mound blocking his path. He needs to decide whether to break the left tread or right tread.

Being coextensive with Angle Township, this area is closely linked to the unincorporated community of Angle Inlet. As a census-designated place (CDP), Angle Inlet is an officially recognized populated area for the purpose of gathering statistics and analyzing demographic information. The Angle is not only special geographically, but also boasts a rich history. It became a part of the United States due to an oversight in the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which aimed to establish the boundary between the U.S. and British territories in North America. The treaty's wording was formulated based on a misunderstanding of the geography of the area, ultimately leading to the establishment of the Northwest Angle within the United States. Regarding the question of which country the Northwest Angle and the community of Angle Inlet belong to, the answer is the United States of America. Both the Angle and Angle Inlet are specifically located within the state of Minnesota, which is one of the 50 states of the United States.

Article: The sheet of cardboard can be larger than these dimensions, but not smaller. If it is larger, use a ruler and pencil to draw a 60 by 30 cm (24 by 12 in) rectangle on it. Along one of the long edges of this 60 x 30 rectangle, stick a pushpin at the halfway point (so it's 30 cm (12 in) from each end). You can also use a piece of rigid foam board instead of cardboard. Tie one end of a piece of string to the pushpin, and the other end to a pencil placed at the midpoint of the opposite long edge of the cardboard. Keep the string pulled tight and move the pencil back and forth over the cardboard sheet. The string will guide it to make a half-circle shape. Wind the string around the pencil until the distance between the pencil and pushpin is reduced to 2 cm (0.79 in). Trace a second, much smaller half-circle onto the board. This smaller circle will become the cut-out for your nose. Use sturdy scissors or a utility knife to cut along both the larger and smaller half-circles. It doesn't have to be perfect, but take your time to ensure a smooth curve to your rainbow-shaped board. If this is part of a child's science project, an adult should supervise this task or do it themselves. Scissors and especially utility knives can be very dangerous. Pick a spot roughly halfway between where the pushpin and pencil were when you started tracing. Use double-sided tape or glue to attach the bottom of a disposable plastic cup to what will be the underside of your board. You'll hold the cup with both hands to keep the board in position while taking the test. Stick the pushpin you used earlier back into the cardboard, this time just short of the spot where you originally placed the pencil to start tracing. This will serve as your focal point while you take the test. The pushpin might stick all the way through the cardboard, so be careful not to prick your finger on it while testing! Each strip should be 10 by 2 cm (3.94 by 0.79 in). Use rigid construction paper, or use markers to color strips of a rigid white paper (like index cards). You can use a different combination of easy-to-distinguish colors, but red, yellow, and green are the ideal combination. Take 3 of the strips (one of each color) and trim off two of the corners on one of the short sides of each. This will create a triangular shape at one end of each of them. When your friend uses one of these triangular strips during the test, make sure they hold it with the pointed end up. Use the handle (the attached cup) to hold the board just below eye level. The bridge of your nose should remain in contact with the small cardboard cutout. Keep the board steady and level in front of you during the test. Focus your eyes on the pushpin that's stuck in the cardboard, and don't look away from that spot. While you do this, have a friend hold up one of the colored strips at one of the far ends of the board—that is, at either “end of the rainbow.”  Your friend needs to remain as still as possible during the test. It may be easiest for them to sit or stand directly across from you, past the pushpin. But keep your focus on the pushpin, not them. The paper strip should be beyond your field of vision when at the starting point. If you can detect it being there, make sure you're staring straight ahead and that your partner is holding the paper strip in the corner of the board. Have your friend slowly slide the paper strip along the curved edge of the board. As soon as you're able to detect movement in your peripheral vision, let your friend know by saying “OK” or something similar. They should pause for a moment, then continue sliding the paper strip.  If you want to keep a record of your results, have your friend quickly mark this point on the underside of the board with a pencil before proceeding further. Because of how peripheral vision functions—relying more on the rods in your eyes that are sensitive to movement, rather than the color-sensitive cones—you should notice that something is moving before you can make out its shape or color. As your friend continues to move the paper strip into your field of vision, indicate when you can see more details. For instance, say “red” and then “triangle” when you see that they are using the red strip of paper with the triangular top. If desired, they can mark these spots with pencil on the underside of the board as well. You can do the test as many times as you like, but consider doing it 3 times on each side to test your left and right peripheral vision. For a more accurate test regarding your perception of color and shape, have your friend use one strip of each color on each side, in random order. For instance: red triangle to your right; yellow rectangle to your left; yellow triangle to your right; green triangle to your left; red rectangle to your right; green rectangle to your left. For example, you can reduce the light level in the room, give your eyes a few minutes to adjust, and repeat the test to see how your results compare. Or, you can write random letters or numbers on the strips and tell your friend as soon as you can read them. What is a summary?","output":"In this DIY peripheral vision test, a rainbow-shaped cardboard or foam board is used as the testing apparatus. A pushpin serves as a focal point, while disposable plastic cups act as handles. Strips of red, yellow, and green paper with different shapes are used to test color and shape perception in peripheral vision. The person being tested holds the board just below eye level and focuses on the pushpin while a friend moves the paper strips along the curved edge of the board.

The total eclipse could be seen starting in India on Wednesday morning and moving eastward across China and parts of the Pacific. Millions cast their eyes towards the heavens to catch an unusual view of the sun's colorful ring. Cloud in some areas prevented people from fully enjoying the sight. Still, many were frightened. The total eclipse occurs about twice a year as the moon passes between the earth and the sun on the same plane as earth's circle. The local astronomy society gave a flash on how an eclipse happens.

Here is a news article: What appears to be court stenographer’s note appears online after Mr Justice Peter Smith stands up for airline passengers everywhere      A document appearing to be the full transcript of a judge’s bench badgering of British Airways over his lost luggage has emerged.      Fleet Street last week cast the Chancery Court’s Mr Justice Peter Smith — whom The Times newspaper described as “one of the legal profession’s more colourful figures” — as the common air travellers hero after he castigated lawyers for the “world’s favourite airline”.      But the bench-slapping had nothing to do with their submissions in the £3 billion lawsuit Smith was hearing — a spat in which BA was accused of colluding to fix air cargo charges. Instead it related to an entirely unrelated incident which had seen Smith’s luggage go missing on a BA flight during a recent trip to Italy.      Legal Cheek cannot verify the authenticity of the document that is doing the rounds of legal London. However, it appears to be a comprehensive transcript of the court stenographer’s note.      Emerald Supplies Ltd v British Airways      Taking the brunt of Smith’s ire was Jon Turner, a silk of nine years’ standing from Monkton Chambers in Gray’s Inn. As BA’s lead counsel on the day, Turner came in for repeated questioning regarding the loss of Smith’s luggage during his recent trip Florence.      At one stage the judge threatened to haul BA’s pugnacious Irish chief executive, Willie Walsh, before the court to answer some pretty searching questions on the missing luggage front. Sadly that didn’t happen, as it would have been one hell of a bout.      Now, Smith is no stranger to courtroom antics. The judge once famously inserted his own coded message into a judgment he handed down on a copyright case concerning best-selling thriller novel “The Da Vince Code”.      In the most recent case, according to the transcript, Smith repeatedly cross-examined BA’s lawyers about the lost luggage, while, in turn, they desperately tried to bring the proceedings back to the matter of the trial.      In the end, frustrated lawyers, who included the airline’s law firm, Slaughter and May (whose partners presumably know a thing or two about international holiday travel), applied for Smith to recuse himself. The grounds were clear: anyone so arsed off with one of the litigants — no matter how legitimately in a customer service context — would not be able to hear case impartially.      Smith adamantly disagreed, but he stood down nonetheless. He didn’t go quietly, telling the court:      I do not believe for one minute that the reasonably minded observer … would think that merely because I have raised issues over the non-delivery of my luggage of itself should lead to the possibility of bias. I believe a reasonably minded observer would see a judge with a problem trying to resolve that issue and finding the parting question being obstructive and unwilling to address the issue and find a solution. A simple dispute as to the luggage cannot possible be grounds for recusal. However, BA and its solicitors have simply escalated the problem almost immediately.      Nonetheless, Smith saw the writing on the wall in terms of public perception:      I however cannot allow my presence in the case and its difficulties to distract the parties from this case. And therefore, regretfully, I feel that I have no choice, whatever my feelings about it, but to recuse myself from the case …      BA’s legal team will be relieved.

Read the judgment in full below:      Emerald Supplies Ltd v British Airways ||||| Mr Justice Peter Smith was furious at BA after his luggage went missing on a flight from Florence Tim Boyle/Getty Images      The judge who stepped down from a £3 billion dispute involving British Airways after complaining about his lost luggage is being investigated by judicial conduct authorities.      Mr Justice Peter Smith fired off angry emails to British Airways after his luggage failed to arrive at Gatwick after a trip to Florence — and then berated counsel when the dispute came before him in court.      He agreed to step down from the case after BA’s legal team, led by Jon Turner, QC, raised questions of bias in court last week, and applied for him to stand aside.      Another judge, Mrs Justice Rose, has now been appointed to succeed Mr Justice Peter Smith on the mammoth dispute which relates to a 2010 European Commission ruling that BA and… ||||| The behaviour of Mr Justice Peter Smith, who reluctantly agreed to step aside from the case last week after BA’s lawyers complained of “a real risk of bias”, has now been revealed in full after a transcript of the court exchanges was posted online.      The document, which The Independent has confirmed is accurate, shows how the judge subjected the airline’s legal counsel Jon Turner QC to a barrage of questions about the whereabouts of his luggage, which had been mislaid during a trip to Florence with his wife.      “Right, Mr Turner, here is a question for you. What happened to [the] luggage?” the judge asks a few minutes into the hearing. When the QC replies that his clients do not want to get involved in the issue, he shoots back: “In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today?”      Justice Peter Smith emailed the BA chairman personally to complain about his lost luggage. File photo (Getty)      After Mr Turner delicately suggests that doing so would be “an inappropriate mixture of a personal dispute” with the multi-billion pound case, the judge cuts him off. “What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question: namely, what happened to the luggage? It has been two weeks since that happened now,” he says.      A lengthy debate follows, culminating in Mr Justice Smith darkly suggesting that BA is fighting to have him recused because the airline is worried that the case is not going in its favour. “The next judge might not be on your solicitors’ acceptable judge list,” he says.      After a break in which Mr Turner contacts his instructing solicitor – before regretfully informing the judge that “she does not know what has happened to your luggage” – Mr Justice Smith says he has “no alternative” but to recuse himself.      A spokesman for the Judicial Conduct Investigations Office, which handles complaints about the judiciary, said that Sir Peter was being “investigated under the conduct regulations”. Mrs Justice Vivien Rose has been appointed to hear the case in his place.      The remarkable courtroom exchanges took place during one of the biggest competition battles to reach the UK courts. The case stems from a European Commission ruling that BA and a number of other airlines colluded to fix air cargo charges, with the firms now being sued by hundreds of companies for losses and damages.      Will Gant, a reporter for the specialist legal magazine PaRR, witnessed the judge’s outburst. “I’ve been a court journalist for several years, and must have seen thousands of hearings, but frankly I was absolutely blown away by the unprofessional attitude that Mr Justice Peter Smith displayed at this one,” he told The Independent.      “The room was packed with dozens of lawyers, and two or three reporters from specialist legal publications, and as this unfolded we all silently exchanged looks of complete amazement. I’ve never seen a judge allow their personal life to affect their work like this, and it was sad to watch. It was an embarrassment to British justice.”      Another source familiar with the case added: “Frankly, it’s the sort of thing you might expect in other areas of the world, but not here.”      In a parting shot, Mr Justice Smith then used a written judgment to chastise BA still further, suggesting that his luggage and that of his fellow passengers had been “deliberately bumped off for a more profitable cargo”. He had emailed BA’s chairman, Keith Williams, because he felt the incident “might be something that is strikingly similar to some of the allegations in this case”, he wrote.      He continued: “I do not believe for one minute that the reasonably minded observer…would think that merely because I have raised issues over the non delivery of my luggage of itself should lead to the possibility of bias.” He also warned BA that he would continue his investigation into what happened to the bags “in a private capacity” and “with the vigour for which I am known”.      Both British Airways and its legal advisers, Slaughter & May, declined to comment.      Court records: Out of order      According to a transcript, Mr Justice Peter Smith repeatedly harangued the British Airways barrister Jon Turner QC about what happened to his missing luggage. Here are some edited extracts:      Mr Justice Peter Smith: Right, Mr Turner, here is a question for you. What happened to [the] luggage?      Jon Turner: My Lord, the position remains that set out in the letter from Slaughter and May of 15 July, that we are not dealing with that as parties in these proceedings.      PS: I am asking you: what has happened to the luggage?      JT: My Lord, so far as the parties to these proceedings … are concerned, we have said, and we maintain, that we are not getting involved because we trust that that will be dealt with expeditiously, in the ordinary course of events.      PS: In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today?      JT: I do not wish your Lordship to do that; and I would say, if your Lordship will permit me to develop my submissions, that that would be an inappropriate mixture of a personal dispute ...      PS: What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question, namely, what happened to the luggage? It has been two weeks since that happened now....      JT: Our position, my Lord, is that where your Lordship initiates a personal dispute with British Airways…      PS: I didn’t initiate a personal dispute. BA’s associated company retained my luggage. It is not my fault that that happened. I am the victim. I read the whole of your correspondence. The more I read it, I got the impression that BA was trying to portray itself of the victim of this case and being oppressed by wicked Mr Justice Peter Smith. It is just ridiculous...      PS: As far as I am concerned, the key fact in this case is: what happened to the luggage; and your clients know what happened to the luggage and they are not telling me. And your solicitors and you are deliberately not asking...      PS: If there is a perfectly understandable operational reason as to why the whole of the flight’s luggage was left behind in Florence ... then I will accept that. That has been my stance ever since I contacted the chairman. I contacted the chairman because the BA helpline is misdescribed. Because when I contacted them, they said, “It is nothing to do with us, it is down to Vueling [BA’s Spanish partner airline]”, despite the fact that I booked my flight with BA and BA took my money. The Vueling helpline was even worse. They couldn’t even tell me where the luggage was till it, without warning, spontaneously arrived at my house last Thursday. In those circumstances, I went to the BA website and the BA website says the chairman is anxious to have comments from customers, and there is his email address, so I sent him an email. Apparently he likes reading customers’ emails. It doesn’t appear to be necessarily he does anything about it, but he obviously likes reading them over his breakfast...      PS: BA as a group, as a company in a group, clearly know what happened to the luggage, because ... they cannot have accidentally left the whole of the flight’s luggage off the plane, can they? I mean, I am intrigued. It might be for some reason they only had three gallons of fuel in the plane, it would run out unless they took everything off, which is a bit difficult because the plane was actually being refuelled when we got there. But equally, it is impossible to believe that the pilot, who has to sign the documentation as to what is the weight and composition of the weight in the plane, did not know that his hold was empty; and it is equally impossible for the ground staff not to know that the luggage was not there. These are things which, I accept, I am struggling to find a rational explanation for. ||||| A judge has agreed to step down from a case after complaining his luggage had gone missing during a BA flight while he was presiding over an unrelated dispute involving the same airline.      Mr Justice Peter Smith, one of the country’s most senior judges, withdrew from the £3 billion case amid accusations of bias, after he raised the matter of his missing luggage in his own court room.      A new judge will now be appointed to preside over the case, over a European Commission ruling that BA was guilty of colluding to fix air cargo charges.      The High Court judge was hearing a dispute involving BA, tens of thousands of firms and 30 other airlines, which dates back to 2006,      By coincide he had sent emails to BA’s chairman using his judicial title after his baggage went missing on a recent trip to Italy, in which he accused airline staff of deliberately leaving behind all the plane’s luggage and deceiving passengers.      The judge’s bags ‘spontaneously’ turned up at his home last week.      But Mr Justice Smith went on to raise the matter in court, threatening to order BA’s chief executive to appear in front of him to explain how a whole aeroplane’s luggage could go missing      He told BA’s legal team, led by Jon Turner QC: “Right, Mr Turner, here is a question for you: what happened to [the] luggage?”      But when the barrister replied that they were not dealing with that issue Mr Justice Smith persisted with his line of questioning, saying: “I am asking you – what has happened to the luggage?”      Mr Turner again declined to address his request, at which point Mr Justice Smith warned: “In that case, do you want me to order your chief executive to appear before me today?”      Despite being told it would not be appropriate to discuss a personal dispute, the judge persisted: “What is inappropriate is the continued failure of your clients to explain a simple question, namely, what happened to the luggage? It has been two weeks since that happened.”      He added: “I do not believe for a minute that the reasonably-minded observer would think that merely because I had raised issues about the non-delivery of my luggage, that it should raise the possibility of bias.”      But when BA’s legal team applied for the judge to stand aside Mr Justice Smith he agreed.      One of the legal circuit’s more colourful characters Mr Justice Smith once hid a message in a High Court judgment relating to the Da Vinci Code copyright trial.      In 2006, he ruled in favour of the novel’s author, Dan Brown, after rival authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh sued publisher Random House, claiming he had stolen their ideas.      Italicised letters in the first seven paragraphs of the judgment spelt out ‘Smithy Code’ in a reference to his own name.      Other apparently randomly italicised letters read: “Jackie Fisher, who are you? Dreadnought”. This appeared to relate to one of the judge’s own interests – Admiral Lord Fisher, who designed the battleship HMS Dreadnought.      It was thought to be the first time that a message had been hidden in a formal High Court judgment.      Mr Justice Smith refused to confirm that the letters were a code at the time, saying only: “They don't look like typos, do they? I can't discuss the judgment, but I don't see why a judgment should not be a matter of fun.”      In May this year Mr Justice Smith blamed a father for the horrific injuries that led to the death of the man's baby daughter, even though the man was cleared by a jury.      He lifted the normal anonymity rules that apply to family court judgments to name Martin Thomas, 30, as responsible for brutal attacks on four-month-old Evie Thomas from Wigan, Greater Manchester.      The judge said the law would be “a screen to hide the truth” if the father was allowed to remain unnamed.      In 2010 Mr Justice Smith was due to oversee a £100million trial over the controversial Chelsea Barracks development, but was replaced at the last moment after reportedly upsetting the Qatari royal family.      He had overseen the pre-trial hearings involving Qatari Diar, the property arm of the Qatari royal family, which was sued by Christian Candy, a London property tycoon, for breach of contract.      But the Qataris were said to be upset when a number of decisions went against them.      It was later ruled that the royal family's property company had breached its contract when it withdrew a planning application for the £3bn Chelsea barracks development after the intervention of Prince Charles. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A judge was hearing a big case about British Airways in court.

Answer the question...who play davy jones in pirates of the caribbean??","output":"The character of Davy Jones in Pirates of the Caribbean is portrayed by none other than the talented British actor Bill Nighy. Born on December 12th, 1949, in Caterham, Surrey, England, Bill Nighy has had a prolific acting career that spans decades and includes film, television, and stage performances. His distinctive voice and unique acting style have made him a favorite for many directors and audiences alike.  Nighy's portrayal of Davy Jones, the feared and tragic antagonist, first came to life in the second installment of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest\\" (2006). With his monstrous, tentacle-filled visage and haunting presence, Nighy brought depth and humanity to the character, transforming him into a memorable and complex figure. He reprised his role in the third film, \\"Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End\\" (2007), and made a cameo appearance in the fifth installment, “Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales” (2017). To create the character of Davy Jones, Nighy's performance was digitally infused with advanced motion capture technology, utilizing facial markers and a specially designed suit. This allowed the animators at Industrial Light & Magic, a leading visual effects company, to transform Nighy's movements and expressions into the realistic and fantastical appearance of Davy Jones. The technical process was highly detailed and time-consuming, but it beautifully blended Nighy's performance with the artistic vision of the film's creators. Beyond Pirates of the Caribbean, Bill Nighy has appeared in an array of notable films, including \\"Love Actually\\" (2003), \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" (2004), \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy\\" (2005), \\"The Constant Gardener\\" (2005), \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1\\" (2010), and \\"About Time\\" (2013). He has also made an impact in television series like \\"State of Play\\" (2003), \\"Page Eight\\" (2011), and \\"The Worricker Trilogy\\" (2011-2014). In addition to his screen appearances, Nighy has an extensive background in stage acting, having worked at the National Theatre and the Royal Shakespeare Company. He received great acclaim for his roles in plays such as Tom Stoppard's \\"Arcadia,\\" \\"The Seagull,\\" and \\"Betrayal\\" by Harold Pinter, among others. Bill Nighy's exceptional performance as Davy Jones in the Pirates of the Caribbean films remains one of his most iconic and memorable roles, captivating audiences with a character that is both menacing and sympathetic.

Recall the meaning and symbolism associated with the Indian national flag. 2. Identify the saffron color's significance in the context of the Indian flag. Step 1: The Indian national flag, also known as the Tiranga, consists of three horizontal bands of colors: saffron, white, and green. In the center of the white band is a navy-blue Ashoka Chakra with 24 spokes. Each color and symbol on the flag has a specific meaning associated with it, representing different aspects of the nation's ethos. Step 2: The saffron color in the Indian flag represents courage and sacrifice. This color signifies the bravery and selflessness of the Indian people, who have fought and continue to fight for their country's freedom, unity and progress. The saffron band symbolically acknowledges the importance of these qualities in the nation-building process, and inspires citizens to embody them in their everyday lives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend will know that wherever possible I use organic bodycare products, and that I simply adore the organic brand Botanicals. A British brand whose aim is to create products ‘which are as close to nature as possible’, their bodycare and skincare is simply second to none and they’re certified by The Soil Association. Over the past couple of years I’ve tried several of their products including my favourite Cleansing Melt and I haven’t found anything that I don’t like yet! This month I’ve been trying their Deep Peace Aromatic Body Oil which arrived with me just at the right time – my husband had man flu, I had a cold and I was looking after our 16 month old toddler alone. Deep Peace was just what my body was craving!  I was sent a small glass bottle of the oil to try, but the full size product is a larger 100ml pump bottle (it also comes in 200ml and 1 litre bottles too). The directions say you can use it in two ways, either massage it into shoulders, neck and arms before bed, or apply it all over the body after batheing. After a bath or shower is the best time I feel as the skin is damp and warm and the Deep Peace oil helps lock moisture into the skin and the warmth helps the scent to lift. This Aromatic Massage Oil is 99% organic and the ingredients include Lavender, Rose Geranium and Orange Peel oils. The fragrance is very subtle and perfect if you don’t like products that smell overpowering.

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. Question: What did they write?

(LSC), a quasi-governmental agency that provides legal aid for the poor, would receive 329 million in fiscal 2004 under President Bush's proposal - the same amount requested in 2003 and approved for 2002 and 2001. If approved, the hold-the-line request for LSC means its budget would erode with inflation for another year, but it could be worse for the organization: Many conservatives fought for years to do away with the LSC altogether, saying legal services attorneys were spending too much time fighting for liberal causes or pursuing politically charged cases against the government instead of representing the needy. Opposition to the organization has cooled since 1996, when Congress approved restrictions (PL 104-134) on the sorts of cases federally funded legal aid attorneys can take. (1996 Almanac, p. 5-36) Republicans cut the organization's budget deeply in 1996, but its funding has recovered slowly. Last month, in the omnibus spending bill for fiscal 2003, the Senate added a onetime increase of 19 million, which, if approved in the final version, would bring the LSC budget to 348 million. The money would go to help states, such as Michigan and Ohio, that lost money when the organization redistributed its funding based on census counts made in 2000 of poor households. If the extra money survives a conference with the House and makes it to the president's desk, LSC supporters may try to include it in the organization's fiscal 2004 funding. The federal government began funding some programs to provide legal assistance to the poor in the late 1960s; the Legal Services Corporation was created in 1974 (PL 93-355). LSC gives nearly all its money to state and local agencies, which provide civil legal assistance to those whose income is less than 125 percent of the federal poverty level - 11,075 a year for an individual and 22,625 for a family of four. Funding for legal services goes to defend needy clients in domestic violence cases, custody cases and other such matters, according to LSC. Since 1996, lawyers who receive money from Legal Services have been prohibited from such activities as lobbying legislatures, filing class-action suits, participating in political demonstrations or strikes, pursuing abortion-related litigation, representing illegal aliens or prisoners, or defending public housing tenants evicted because they were charged with selling drugs  Question: \\"Which political party cut the LSC's budget?\\" Response: \\"Republican\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Options:  A. room  B. store  C. warehouse  D. loft  E. rug The answer to this question is:","output":"B. store The best place to get furniture from is a store. There are several reasons why a store is the most sensible option among the given choices.  First, furniture stores typically carry a wide variety of products, including sofas, tables, chairs, beds, dressers, and more, offering a broad selection for customers to choose from. This means that customers can find precisely what they are looking for, regardless of their style, budget, or specific needs. Most stores also have knowledgeable staff who can provide useful information and assistance when it comes to selecting the right furniture pieces. Second, furniture stores usually have well-organized showrooms where customers can see, touch, and test out the pieces they are interested in. This hands-on experience is invaluable, as it allows customers to assess the quality, comfort, and overall feel of a piece of furniture before deciding to purchase it. This in-person experience can help ensure that customers are satisfied with their purchases and that the furniture they select will be a good fit for their home. Third, furniture stores often offer various services to help make the purchasing process even more convenient. For example, many stores provide financing options, allowing customers to pay for their purchases over time, and some even offer interior design consultations to help customers choose the right furniture and accessories for their homes. In addition, most furniture stores offer delivery and assembly services, making it easy for customers to get their new furniture delivered to their homes and set up properly. While warehouses (option C) and lofts (option D) may occasionally have furniture available for sale, these locations are not specifically designed to cater to customers looking to furnish their homes. Warehouses tend to focus more on bulk sales and may not have the same level of customer service, selection, or showroom experience that a dedicated furniture store would provide. Similarly, a loft may have some unique or vintage furniture pieces, but it is unlikely to offer the wide range of options and services that customers can find in a store.  As for the other options, a room (option A) is not a place where one would typically go to purchase furniture, as it is simply a space within a home or building. A rug (option E) is an item and not a location where furniture can be purchased. Therefore, neither of these options align with common sense when it comes to purchasing furniture. In conclusion, the most logical and beneficial place to purchase furniture is a store, as it offers a wide selection of products, a hands-on shopping experience, knowledgeable staff, and various additional services to make the purchasing process as convenient and enjoyable as possible for customers."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment (Pick from: + negative; + positive;).","output":"Title: Disastrous Diving I recently had the unfortunate experience of watching Disastrous Diving, a poorly executed underwater adventure that fell short of creating any kind of gripping entertainment. To say that this film was disappointing would be an understatement. Right from the beginning, a myriad of issues surfaced, ranging from lackluster acting to paper-thin characterizations to glaring plot holes. The film, directed by the ill-suited Harrison Mudd, revolves around a group of divers who, after discovering a plausibly valuable maritime artifact, embark on a dangerous journey deep into the ocean, only to find their lives at risk. These characters, played by an evidently struggling ensemble cast, lack the charm, depth or emotional range required to evoke sympathy from the audience. Each subsequent scene feels like a desperate attempt to breathe life into the story, missing the mark entirely. The script is riddled with clichés and predictable moments, with unconvincing dialogue that never accurately conveys the peril of a hazardous dive. It becomes quite clear that the film's screenwriters failed to invest any meaningful time into researching the technical aspects of diving and ocean exploration. This oversight is evident in the multitude of inaccuracies and inconsistencies littered throughout the film. The ocean, with its immeasurable beauty and mystery, deserves to be the star of Disastrous Diving, but the film’s abysmal special effects and subpar cinematography significantly detract from the viewer’s experience. Sadly, what could have been a visually stunning film becomes a series of jarringly artificial underwater scenes. The film's lack of a convincing color palette or believable CGI truly exacerbates the flaws in an already crumbling narrative. Another frustrating aspect of Disastrous Diving is its poorly conceived and forgettable soundtrack, failing in its function to heighten the emotions or tension of a scene. Composer Alan Grover seemingly relied on uninspired, generic tunes that are maddeningly reminiscent of elevator music. In conclusion, Disastrous Diving is an utter failure. What could have been an immersive, heart-pounding underwater adventure becomes a lackluster attempt at storytelling marred by a weak script, unconvincing acting, and inadequate visual and auditory elements. It's disappointing to see the vast potential of such a captivating premise squandered on all counts. Steer clear of this deep-sea debacle; it's better left undisturbed in the cinematic abyss."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The talks are aimed at resolving difficulties among the five parties in the devolved Stormont government. On Wednesday, the chancellor said corporation tax could be devolved if politicians resolved their differences over the budget and welfare reform. Northern Ireland Secretary Theresa Villiers said the negotiations over the next few days would be crucial. \\"I think the credibility of the institutions are at stake here,\\" she said. \\"There is a real will out there, people want to see their politicians make it work. \\"There is a recognition that we can't go on as we are, and also the reality that going into the next financial year with a deficit budget would lead to increasing chaos. \\"The whole credibility of the institutions is at stake with these cross-party talks. \\"It's vital that the parties are prepared to stretch themselves and prepared to make some awkward and difficult choices.\\" US envoy Gary Hart, who was due to attend the talks, stressed the need to reach agreement quickly. In a statement issued on Wednesday night, he said: \\"The long-term public interest, including the interests of future generations, must be prioritised ahead of individual and party interests. \\"This is a crucial moment and time is running out.  A comprehensive settlement of these issues must be reached at the earliest possible date.\\" On Wednesday, Sinn Féin said it would not agree to the transfer of corporation tax to Northern Ireland \\"on the basis of implementing Tory policies\\". First Minister Peter Robinson has blamed the delay in transferring powers on Sinn Féin and the SDLP's failure to agree a deal on welfare reform. In his Autumn Statement to parliament, Mr Osborne said: \\"We recognise the strongly held arguments for devolving corporation tax setting powers to Northern Ireland. \\"The Treasury believes it can be implemented, provided the Northern Ireland Executive can show that it is able to manage the financial implications. The current talks will see if that's the case. \\"And if it is, the government will introduce legislation in this parliament.\\" The Northern Ireland inter-party talks are aimed at reaching agreement on a range of unresolved issues, including disputes over flags, parades, the legacy of the Troubles and welfare reform. The five main parties have clashed over welfare reform in recent months, with Sinn Féin and the SDLP objecting to many of the cost-cutting measures that have already come into force in England and Wales. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland must take difficult decisions to balance its budget, but nationalist and republican MLAs have said that many of the reforms will disproportionately disadvantage some of the most vulnerable people in society.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Spirit, also known as MER-A (Mars Exploration Rover - A) or MER-2, is a robotic rover on Mars, active from 2004 to 2010. It was one of two rovers of NASA's ongoing Mars Exploration Rover Mission. It landed successfully on Mars at 04:35 Ground UTC on January 4, 2004, three weeks before its twin, Opportunity (MER-B), landed on the other side of the planet. Its name was chosen through a NASA-sponsored student essay competition. On January 21, 2004 (sol 17), Spirit abruptly ceased communicating with mission control. The next day the rover radioed a 7.8 bit/s beep, confirming that it had received a transmission from Earth but indicating that the craft believed it was in a fault mode. Commands would only be responded to intermittently. This was described as a very serious anomaly, but potentially recoverable if it were a software or memory corruption issue rather than a serious hardware failure. Spirit was commanded to transmit engineering data, and on January 23 sent several short low-bitrate messages before finally transmitting 73 megabits via X band to Mars Odyssey. The readings from the engineering data suggested that the rover was not staying in sleep mode. As such, it was wasting its battery energy and overheating - risk factors that could potentially destroy the rover if not fixed soon. On sol 20, the command team sent it the command SHUTDWN_DMT_TIL (\\"Shutdown Dammit Until\\") to try to cause it to suspend itself until a given time. It seemingly ignored the command.  The leading theory at the time was that the rover was stuck in a \\"reboot loop\\". The rover was programmed to reboot if there was a fault aboard. However, if there was a fault that occurred during reboot, it would continue to reboot forever. The fact that the problem persisted through reboot suggested that the error was not in RAM, but in either the flash memory, the EEPROM, or a hardware fault. The last case would likely doom the rover. Anticipating the potential for errors in the flash memory and EEPROM, the designers had made it so that the rover could be booted without ever touching the flash memory. The radio itself could decode a limited command set - enough to tell the rover to reboot without using flash. Without access to flash memory the reboot cycle was broken.  On sol 19 (January 24, 2004) the rover repair team announced that the problem was with Spirit's flash memory and the software that wrote to it. The flash hardware was believed to be working correctly but the file management module in the software was \\"not robust enough\\" for the operations the Spirit was engaged in when the problem occurred, indicating that the problem was caused by a software bug as opposed to faulty hardware. NASA engineers finally came to the conclusion that there were too many files on the file system, which was a relatively minor problem. Most of these files contained unneeded in-flight data. After realizing what the problem was, the engineers deleted some files, and eventually reformatted the entire flash memory system. On February 6 (sol 33), the rover was restored to its original working condition, and science activities resumed. What was the problem?","output":"Okay little buddy, so Spirit, the robot on Mars, had a problem with its memory, kind of like when your toy gets confused and doesn't work right. The smart people at NASA found out that there were too many files, like when you have too many toys in your toy box, and they had to clean it up. After they cleaned up the files, the robot started working properly again!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How to use the guidelines to find the answer: 1. Consider the claim: \\"Science can determine human values.\\" This means that scientific research and findings can be used to establish what humans value or consider important. 2. Examine the perspective: \\"Science can't produce faith.\\" This indicates that scientific knowledge and methods cannot create or strengthen religious beliefs. 3. Analyze whether the perspective supports or undermines the claim. In this case, the perspective suggests that there are certain human values, like faith, that science cannot address, determine, or impact. 4. Determine if the perspective is convincing enough for someone with a different view. Since the perspective points out a limitation of science in determining human values, it can be convincing for someone who believes only in the scientific approach.

He had been born in the wrong month, during the wrong phase of the moon, his parents told him, and had brought them nothing but bad luck. The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there.

Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Ross, c. 1822 - March 10, 1913) was an American abolitionist. Born into slavery, Tubman escaped and subsequently made some thirteen missions to rescue approximately seventy enslaved people, family and friends, using the network of antislavery activists and safe houses known as the Underground Railroad. She later helped abolitionist John Brown recruit men for his raid on Harpers Ferry. By 1840, Tubman's father, Ben, was manumitted from slavery at the age of 45, as stipulated in a former owner's will, though his actual age was closer to 55. He continued working as a timber estimator and foreman for the Thompson family, who had held him as a slave. Several years later, Tubman contacted a white attorney and paid him five dollars to investigate her mother's legal status. The lawyer discovered that a former owner had issued instructions that Rit, like her husband, would be manumitted at the age of 45. The record showed that a similar provision would apply to Rit's children, and that any children born after she reached 45 years of age were legally free, but the Pattison and Brodess families had ignored this stipulation when they inherited the slaves. Challenging it legally was an impossible task for Tubman.  Around 1844, she married a free black man named John Tubman. Although little is known about him or their time together, the union was complicated because of her slave status. Since the mother's status dictated that of children, any children born to Harriet and John would be enslaved. Such blended marriages - free people of color marrying enslaved people - were not uncommon on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, where by this time, half the black population was free. Most African-American families had both free and enslaved members. Larson suggests that they might have planned to buy Tubman's freedom.  Tubman changed her name from Araminta to Harriet soon after her marriage, though the exact timing is unclear. Larson suggests this happened right after the wedding, and Clinton suggests that it coincided with Tubman's plans to escape from slavery. She adopted her mother's name, possibly as part of a religious conversion, or to honor another relative.

Her pace magnifies her balance. Her command and distance hush the crowd.  On July 18, Comaneci made history at the 1976 Summer Olympics, when during the team compulsory portion of the competition, she was awarded the first perfect 10 in Olympic gymnastics for her routine on the uneven bars. However, Omega SA--the traditional Olympics scoreboard manufacturer-- was led to believe that it was impossible to receive a perfect ten, thus the scoreboard was not programmed to display that score. Comaneci's perfect 10 thus appeared as \\"1.00,\\" the only means by which the judges could indicate that she had indeed received a 10. The crowd was at first confused, but soon understood and gave her a rousing ovation.  During the remainder of the Montreal Games, Comaneci earned six additional tens. She won gold medals for the individual all-around, the balance beam and uneven bars. She also won a bronze for the floor exercise and a silver as part of the team all-around. Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim was her main rival during the Montreal Olympics; Kim became the second gymnast to receive a perfect ten for her performance on the vault. Comaneci also took over the spotlight from Olga Korbut, who had been the darling of the 1972 Munich Games.  Comaneci's achievements are pictured in the entrance area of Madison Square Garden in New York City, where she is shown presenting her perfect beam exercise.  Comaneci was the first Romanian gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title. She also holds the record for being the youngest Olympic gymnastics all-around champion ever. The sport has now revised its age-eligibility requirements. Gymnasts must now turn 16 in the same calendar year of the Olympics to compete during the Games. When Comaneci competed in 1976, gymnasts had to be 14 by the first day of the competition. Legally breaking this record is not currently possible. She was the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year for 1976 and the Associated Press's 1976 \\"Female Athlete of the Year\\". Back home in Romania, Comaneci's success led her to be awarded the Sickle and Hammer Gold Medal, and named a Hero of Socialist Labor; she was the youngest Romanian to receive such recognition during the administration of Nicolae Ceausescu. Question: Did she receive any metals or awards Answer:","output":"Yes, Nadia Comaneci received several medals and awards throughout her career. At the 1976 Montreal Olympics, she won gold medals for individual all-around, balance beam, and uneven bars, as well as a bronze for floor exercise and a silver for team all-around. Additionally, she was awarded the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year in 1976 and the Associated Press's 1976 \\"Female Athlete of the Year.\\" In Romania, she received the Sickle and Hammer Gold Medal and was named a Hero of Socialist Labor, becoming the youngest Romanian to receive such recognition during Nicolae Ceausescu's administration."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Earlier this week, @naval (CEO and co-founder of AngelList) asked a question on Twitter: \\"The challenge of the next decade is not Artificial Intelligence, but Human Intelligence. Can we retrain the workforce as knowledge workers?\\"\\" At the heart of his question is an interesting observation. As automation and artificial intelligence replaces manual jobs, how do we retrain people in the new knowledge economy where information handling and management is in high demand? I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source... According to the above context, answer the following question. Why were a lot of Midlanders out of work? OPTIONS: + people were going back to school to learn open source + OpenAdvantage was hiring all the workers + not enough information + industry was being automated and moved to Asia The answer is:","output":"industry was being automated and moved to Asia. A lot of Midlanders were out of work due to the automation of industries and the relocation of jobs to Asia where production costs were likely lower. This significant change in the job market led to an increasing number of people seeking new opportunities and looking to retrain themselves in emerging technologies such as open source software. OpenAdvantage was established as a response to this situation, providing free consultancy and upskilling services for both businesses and individuals hoping to benefit from the growing influence of open source technology in various fields. With the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence and automation, the need to retrain and transform the workforce into knowledge workers becomes crucial. The experience of OpenAdvantage and the situation in the West Midlands serve as valuable examples of how government, academic institutions, and organizations can collaborate to create opportunities for people who have lost their jobs due to technological development. Retraining the workforce as knowledge workers in the age of AI requires a multi-pronged approach. Here are some recommendations based on previous experiences and observations: 1. Assess industry trends and demands: Governments, academic institutions, and businesses should assess the demands of the knowledge economy, identify the skills required, and plan the appropriate training and educational programs accordingly. 2. Collaboration between stakeholders: Establish partnerships between government entities, educational institutions, and industry to develop comprehensive training programs that cater to the emerging knowledge workforce. 3. Accessible education and training: Make education and training easily accessible for individuals who wish to switch their careers and enter the knowledge economy. Consider offering free courses, online learning platforms, and financial support to facilitate the transition. 4. Develop transferable skills: Focus on developing transferable skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, communication, and adaptability, which are essential in the knowledge economy, as well as being applicable across various industries and fields. 5. Encourage lifelong learning: Promote a culture of lifelong learning where individuals continually upgrade their skills and knowledge in response to the evolving job market. This will help workers stay competitive and relevant in a constantly changing work environment. 6. Support network and mentorship: Build a community and support network for individuals undergoing career transitions. Connect seasoned professionals who have successfully retrained as knowledge workers with those seeking to follow a similar path. 7. Monitor and measure progress: Regularly assess the effectiveness of retraining programs and update them based on industry trends, technological advancements, and feedback from participants. This will ensure that workforce development initiatives remain relevant and effective in preparing people for the knowledge economy. In conclusion, retraining the workforce as knowledge workers in the age of AI is both a challenge and an opportunity. By focusing on collaboration, accessible education, transferable skills, lifelong learning, support networks, and systematic monitoring, stakeholders can effectively facilitate the transformation of the workforce and better prepare individuals for the demands of the knowledge economy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who did Joe Denton give a ride to?  Joe Denton, a corrupt ex-cop, is released from jail. Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink.  His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey.  At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior. Junior threatens to kill Denton, enraged that Vassey would see him while avoiding his own son. Answer:","output":"Joe Denton gave a ride to a young woman who later revealed herself to be Phil Coakley's daughter, the district attorney he had attacked six years earlier."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: Poland's successive kings granted privileges to the nobility at the time of their election to the throne (the privileges being specified in the king-elect's Pacta conventa) and at other times in exchange for ad hoc permission to raise an extraordinary tax or a pospolite ruszenie. When did kings grant privileges to the nobles?","output":"Kings in Poland granted privileges to the nobles primarily during two key instances, both of which played a significant part in the political, social, and economic fabric of the country. These privileges were essential in maintaining a delicate balance of power between the monarch and the nobility, and were instrumental in shaping the course of Polish history. 1. At the time of their election to the throne: In the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, a unique elective monarchy system was in place from around 1386 until 1791. During this period, when a new king was to be elected, the nobility had a significant say in the process. As a part of the election proceedings, the king-elect would enter into an agreement called the \\"Pacta Conventa,\\" in which he would commit to respect and uphold the rights, privileges, and liberties of the nobility. Some of the privileges granted to the nobles during this time could include tax exemptions, self-government, and control over local administration. These privileges were seen as essential by the king-elect in securing the support of the nobles, as their goodwill and loyalty were necessary to ensure a stable rule. 2. At other times, in exchange for ad hoc permission to raise an extraordinary tax or a pospolite ruszenie: Apart from the election time, Polish kings would often find themselves needing the cooperation of the nobility to address various challenges faced by the kingdom, such as wars, large-scale infrastructure projects, or other significant political issues. The monarch would then grant privileges to the nobles in exchange for their ad hoc permission to raise additional financial resources in the form of extraordinary taxes or a pospolite ruszenie, which was a form of feudal levy or conscription of armed forces from among the noble class. By doing so, the Polish kings sought to solicit the support and resources of their subjects in return for preserving and enhancing the noble class's rights and privileges. In summary, Polish kings granted privileges to the nobles both at the time of their election to the throne and at other times when they needed their support for specific purposes, such as collecting extra resources, taxes, or armies. These practices were critical in ensuring a stable and cooperative relationship between the monarch and the nobility, and played a substantial role in the political development of Poland."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Interstate 60 Context: The story begins in a bar, where two men are discussing a thesis statement for an upcoming paper. One of them asserts that out of all the different realms of the world, America has no mythological character that grants wishes. Their conversation is interrupted by a man (Wayne Robson) who claims that they are wrong, and that such a character does exist. The man goes on to explain that this character is a man named O.W. Grant, the son of a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian. The man explains that O.W. is more so apt to play tricks on people, but that every so often, he takes a shine to some of them. When the two men ask this stranger just what O.W. Grant looks like, the fellow replies that he wears a red bow tie, and smokes a pipe carved in the shape of a monkey-head. As the man leaves the two, he mentions that O.W. can be found along Interstate 60. The two men go to a nearby map, and after looking over the roadways, think the guy they were talking to must have been pulling there leg, as there is no Interstate 60.The scene then cuts to real-as-life O.W. Grant (Gary Oldman), wearing a red bow tie, and smoking a pipe carved in the shape of monkey-head (just as the guy described). Going down a street, a guy in a parked car to his right opens the driver's side door, not realizing O.W. is about to pass alongside. O.W. falls from his bike, breaking the jaw on his monkey-head pipe. As the man apologizes and attempts to help him up, a truck comes along, running over Grant's bike, and destroying the man's cellular phone. The destruction of the cellphone causes the man to break into a fury, cursing how he wishes the incident had never happened. Grant asks if the man means the wish, and when the angered fellow replies positively, Grant places his pipe in his mouth, and green smoke envelopes the two of them.The scene begins again, with Grant riding along the same path (though his monkey-head pipe is now broken). Just before Grant reaches the car, he stops. The man on the phone inside, gets out of the car... and steps right... The answer to this question is:","output":"The old man at the bar said that O.W. Grant's parents were a Leprechaun and a Cheyenne Indian."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Final preparations are underway for Friday’s historic third summit between the leaders of North and South Korea. In the morning, North Korea Leader Kim Jong Un will cross the military demarcation line that divides the two Koreas at the village of Panmunjom, the historic site where the Korean War armistice was signed in 1953. He will be met by South Korean President Moon Jae-in on the South Korean side of the heavily fortified demilitarized zone. This will be the third inter-Korean summit, but it will be the first time that a leader from the communist North will enter the democratic South. The summits in 2000 and 2007 were held in North Korea. Kim will travel with an official delegation that includes his sister, Kim Yo Jong, who led the North’s delegation to the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Kim Yong Nam, the North’s nominal head of state, and Kim Yong Chol. Kim Yong Chol was previously the head of the North’s military intelligence agency and has been named by South Korea as being responsible for ordering the deadly 2010 sinking of the Cheonan, a South Korean navy vessel. It is unclear if Kim Jong Un’s wife, Ri Sol-ju, will be part of the official delegation from the North. She recently traveled with Kim when he visited Chinese President Xi Jinping in Beijing. South Korea will hold a welcoming ceremony for the North Korean leader that will include a military honor guard review. During past summits, North Korea also organized the same level of ceremonial guard used to underscore friendly relations with an important visiting head of state. The two leaders will pose together for pictures, and plant a pine tree in the DMZ to symbolize Korean reconciliation. The leaders from the North and South may also walk together along a historic footbridge called the “Bridge of No Return” that was used for prisoner exchanges at the end of the Korean War.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

As a real estate developer, Lawrence made a name for himself and built a thriving career, eventually setting his sights on the world of politics. Lawrence's dedication and commitment to the Democratic Party led him to serve under President Bill Clinton. His strong ties and contributions to his party resulted in his appointment as the United States Ambassador to Switzerland. He assumed the position on February 9, 1994, succeeding Joseph Bernard Gildenhorn, another stalwart of the Democratic Party. During his time as Ambassador, Lawrence fostered diplomacy and continued to strengthen the relationship between the United States and Switzerland. In his personal life, Lawrence was married to Sheila Davis, and together, they built a life centered around their shared values, political ideologies, and commitment to public service. However, Lawrence's tenure as the United States Ambassador to Switzerland came to an abrupt end on January 9, 1996, when he tragically passed away in Bern, Switzerland, at the age of 69. He was succeeded by Madeleine M. Kunin, who continued to solidify the diplomatic ties between the two nations. In accordance with his wishes, M.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Saosin is an American post-hardcore band from Orange County, California, United States. The band was formed in 2003 and recorded its first EP, Translating the Name, that same year original vocalist Anthony Green left Saosin due to personal reasons. In 2004, Cove Reber replaced Green as vocalist after auditioning for the role. The group recorded its self titled debut album which was released on Capitol Records on September 26, 2006. The original lineup for Saosin, consisting of Burchell, Shekoski, Kennedy and Green, was formed in the summer of 2003. On June 17, the band released their first commercial production, the EP Translating the Name. It was an immediate success and was immensely popular on online forums and music sites. Saosin first became popular through promotion and exposure through the Internet. They became known for their distinct musical styles long before their first studio-length album was released, and were popularized on social networking and music sites such as MySpace. The E.P. has sold an estimated 62,000 copies.  Bassist Zach Kennedy left the band early on, as he wanted to pursue a career in art. He was later replaced by Chris Sorenson. A local Southern Califonian drummer by the name of Pat Magrath,  was hired only for the recording for the EP, according to Burchell. The band was impressed with his drumming skills however, and he later appeared as a guest performing Lost Symphonies live with the band. Alex Rodriguez was unable to record Translating the Name as he had promised his band at the time Open Hand he would finish recording with them.

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family.

The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics.

The right hand is traditionally considered a symbol of strength, dexterity, and proficiency, while the left hand is often seen as weaker and less precise. By associating these qualities with the heart, the proverb emphasizes a connection between wisdom or foolishness and one's actions and character. The statement urges individuals to strive for wisdom and make prudent choices based on knowledge and understanding. A wise person's heart embodies intelligence, caution, and sound judgment, which leads to success and happiness. In contrast, a fool's heart reflects ignorance, impulsiveness, and faulty decision-making, which often results in failure and misery. Given the significance of the heart as the core of one's being and the source of emotions and desires, it is crucial for an individual to cultivate wisdom and develop a strong moral compass. A heart at the right hand signifies a well-balanced, mature, and responsible individual who is equipped to face life's challenges and make sound decisions. In everyday applications, this statement may be applied to various situations in which an individual must act wisely and avoid foolishness. For example, a wise person will carefully evaluate the potential risks and benefits before making an important decision, while a fool will likely act without weighing the consequences or considering alternative options. Similarly, a wise individual will listen to and learn from others, while a fool will stubbornly persist in his or her own ignorance. Overall, the message of Ecclesiastes 10:2 is that wisdom should guide our thoughts, emotions, and actions. By nurturing a wise heart, an individual can develop the skills and insights necessary to navigate life's complex challenges and make meaningful contributions to society. Conversely, a foolish heart can lead one astray, resulting in the mistakes and poor choices that result in personal and collective suffering. In conclusion, the proverb \\"A wise man's heart is at his right hand, but a fool's heart is at his left\\" serves as a reminder of the importance of striving for wisdom and pursuing personal growth. By doing so, we can ensure that our hearts remain firmly anchored on the right side – guided by knowledge, understanding, and a deep sense of integrity."},{"instruction":"Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of integers.

The hypothesis suggests that a girl is making a decision. Step 2: Comparing the premise and hypothesis In both the premise and hypothesis, we have a female individual who is making a decision.  Step 3: Analyzing the context The context of the decision-making in the premise is specifically about choosing what to have for breakfast, while the hypothesis is more generic, stating that a girl is making a decision.

Conclusion:  Yes, if the premise is true, i.e., a sweet young lady is deciding on what to have for breakfast, it can be concluded that the hypothesis is true as well since the core idea of a girl making a decision is still present.

Devika Rani Chaudhuri, usually known as Devika Rani (30 March 1908 - 9 March 1994), was an actress in Indian films who was active during the 1930s and 1940s. Widely acknowledged as the first lady of Indian cinema, Devika Rani had a successful film career that spanned 10 years. Born into a wealthy, anglicized Indian family, Devika Rani was sent to boarding school in England at age nine and grew up in that country. In 1928, she met Himanshu Rai, an Indian film-producer, and married him the following year. Devika Rani Chaudhuri was born into a Bengali family in Waltair near Visakhapatnam in present-day Andhra Pradesh, into an extremely affluent and educated Bengali family. Her father, Colonel Manmatha Nath Chaudhuri, was the first Indian Surgeon-General of Madras Presidency and a nephew of Rabindranath Tagore.  Her mother, Leela Devi Choudhary, came from an educated family and was a grand-niece of Tagore. Devika's father's brothers were Ashutosh Chaudhuri, Chief Justice of Calcutta High Court, Jogesh Chandra Chaudhuri, a prominent Kolkata-based barrister and Pramatha Chaudhuri, the famous Bengali writer.  Devika Rani was related through both her parents to the poet and Nobel Laureate Rabindranath Tagore. Her father, Manmathnath Choudhary, was the son of Sukumari Devi Choudhary, sister of Rabindranath Tagore. Devika's mother, Leela Devi Chaudhuri, was the daughter of Indumati Devi Chattopadhyay, whose mother Saudamini Devi Gangopadhyay was another sister of the Nobel laureate. Devika's father and maternal grandmothers were first cousins to each other, being the children of two sisters of Rabindranath Tagore.  Further, two of her father's brothers had also married their cousins: Prativa Devi Choudhury, wife of Ashutosh Choudhary, was the daughter of Hemendranath Tagore, and Indira Devi Choudhary, wife of Promatho Choudhary, was the daughter of Satyendranath Tagore. Devika thus had strong ties to Jarasanko, seat of the Tagore family in Kolkata and a major crucible of the Bengali renaissance.  Devika Rani was sent to boarding school in England at the age of nine, and grew up there. After completing her schooling in the mid-1920s, she enrolled in the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA) and the Royal Academy of Music in London to study acting and music. She also enrolled for courses in architecture, textile and decor design, and even apprenticed under Elizabeth Arden. All of these courses, each of them a few months long, were completed by 1927, and Devika Rani then took up a job in textile design. Did Devika go to school?","output":"Yes, Devika Rani went to school. She was sent to a boarding school in England at the age of nine, where she completed her schooling.

Choices:  - discovery  - estimation  - consideration  - observation  A: Answer:","output":"The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The scientific method is a standard approach utilized by scientists in various disciplines to explore phenomena, answer questions, and develop new knowledge. This systematic, logical, and objective method involves a series of well-defined steps that enable researchers to gain a deep understanding of the cause and effect relationships in various phenomena. The key steps in the scientific method include: 1. Asking Questions: Any scientific inquiry starts with a question or observation about a specific phenomenon. This initial inquiry serves as the foundation for the entire research process. 2. Background Research: After identifying a research question, the next step involves conducting extensive background research. This includes reviewing existing theories, published literature, and established knowledge to better understand the context of the problem. 3. Developing a Hypothesis: Based on the background research, a hypothesis is formulated. A hypothesis is an informed and testable assumption that explains the possible relationship between variables or predicts the outcome of an experiment. 4. Designing and Conducting Experiments: To test the validity of the hypothesis, researchers design and conduct experiments, ensuring they are controlled, and variables are manipulated as needed. The experiments should be carefully planned and replicable, allowing for accurate measurements and data collection. 5. Careful Observation: This step emphasizes the importance of systematically observing, recording, and analyzing the data collected during the experiments. Accurate and detailed observations are crucial in ensuring that the findings are valid and reliable. 6. Analyzing Data and Drawing Conclusions: Once the data has been collected, it is analyzed to determine trends, relationships, and patterns. The results are then interpreted and evaluated to either support or disprove the hypothesis. 7. Reporting Findings: Scientists must communicate and share their findings with the scientific community by writing comprehensive research papers, attending conferences, and engaging in discussions. This helps advance knowledge, allows for external validation, and encourages further research. 8. Replication and Further Research: One of the key aspects of the scientific method is that experiments should be replicable to verify the validity of the results. Further research is also encouraged to refine and expand on the initial findings. In conclusion, the scientific method is a rigorous and structured method of research that involves carefully planned and controlled experiments, as well as meticulous observation of the data collected. By utilizing these established steps, scientists can gain a deeper understanding of the phenomena they are studying, make informed conclusions, and contribute valuable knowledge to their respective fields."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Initially, there are two terms with s, -70s and 650s.

To isolate the 580s term, we will subtract 2186 from both sides of the equation to eliminate the constant term from the right side. -1294 - 2186 = 580s + 2186 - 2186 Calculating the left side, we get: -3480 = 580s Step 3: Solve for s.

Beswick's mummified body was initially kept at Ancoats Hall, the home of another Beswick family member, but it was soon moved to a room in Dr White's home in Sale, Manchester, where it was stored in an old clock case. Beswick's apparently eccentric will made her a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey was one of those who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a Dr Ollier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as \\"one of the most remarkable objects in the museum\\". The \\"cold dark shadow of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century\\", according to writer Edith Sitwell.There are no pictures of Hannah Beswick. One of the few contemporary accounts of her is provided by Philip Wentworth, a local historian: The body was well preserved but the face was shrivelled and black. The legs and trunks were tightly bound in a strong cloth such as is used for bed ticks [a stiff kind of mattress cover material] and the body, which was that of a little old woman, was in a glass coffin-shaped case. Shortly after the museum's transfer to Manchester University in 1867 it was decided that as Beswick was \\"irrevocably and unmistakably dead\\", the time had come for her to be buried. But since 1837 UK law had required that a medical examiner issue a certificate of death before a burial could take place; as Beswick had died in 1758 an appeal had to be made to the Secretary of State, who issued an order for her burial. With the permission of the Bishop of Manchester, Hannah Beswick was interred in an unmarked grave in Harpurhey Cemetery on 22 July 1868, more than 110 years after her death.

You will likely ask the question: \\"Can I find a well-paid job or simply a job with a degree in this in the future?\\" This consideration also influences students when they come to choose between studying science or humanities   at college. People generally believe that the humanities, which include literature ,  history, cultural studies and philosophy,  do not prepare students for a specific vocation  . Science subjects, however, are considered vocational courses that produce scientists, engineers and economists  . \\"I've decided to take finance as my college major. My parents and I think this subject will help me get a good job or start a business,\\" said Huachen Yueru, 17, a science student at Wuxi No. 1 High School.

Here's an analysis of the text to support this conclusion: 1. Sir Oliver's first glance at the arrow and his reaction to the dark hue of it touching him with \\"some fear\\" suggests that he might have initially been afraid of the unknown element associated with the arrow or its purpose. 2. However, when he reads the word \\"Earthed\\" on the arrow, he responds confidently, \\"Ay, they know I am home, then. Earthed! Ay, but there is not a dog among them fit to dig me out.\\" This statement shows that Sir Oliver is aware that someone might be after him, but he feels secure and confident in his ability to face whatever threat they pose. 3. When Sir Oliver scrambles to his feet, there is no mention of any lingering fear or worry. Instead, he seems to be back in control of the situation and addresses Sir Daniel. In conclusion, while Sir Oliver might have experienced a brief moment of fear, it is unclear whether this fear was just a fleeting reaction or a deeper, ongoing emotion.

Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Health problems come: Options:  A. before one recognizes the symptoms  B. during fetal development  C. after aging  D. not enough information","output":"C. after aging"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However, I wish to tell you how upset I have been by the way your Claims Assessor, Mr. Michael Tan, handled this claim.      When Mr. Tan first called me, he specifically told me that he believed I had been overcharged, and he would expect to pay that price for work on a double garage, rather than a single garage like mine. Mr. Tan suggested that I neither use nor recommend this contractor again. He continued to tell me it was unlikely for me to receive full payment. Never during this conversation did he mention that the reason for not receiving full payment was because of the nature of my insurance policy.      Consequently, I wrote to Mr. Lance Ashe to complain about his pricing, stating that I was very upset thinking that he could have taken advantage by overcharging a 73-year-old woman. Mr. Ashe telephoned me immediately and explained his charges in detail. He later reported back to me that Mr. Tan explained that I would not receive full payment because of the type of policy I hold, which does not cover wear and tear. This was the first time this issue had been brought to my attention, so you can imagine my surprise.     When I received Mr. Tan's letter of 2 February, this situation was explained. If this had been explained in the first place I would have accepted it and would not have questioned Mr. Ashe's charges. Instead, by telling me initially that I had been overcharged for this work, he caused a great deal of upset, not only for me but also for Mr. Ashe.      I believed this claim was handled badly by Mr. Tan from the beginning. Therefore, a great deal of embarrassment has been caused over this issue.  I felt you should know how disappointed and upset I am. I trust you will look into this and ensure that such claims are handled more appropriately in the future.

Given the question \\"What will Ash want to do next?\\", is \\"Ignore Jordan\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"A: No, \\"Ignore Jordan\\" is not a valid answer in this context. As Ash and Jordan have been in a loving relationship for 2 years, it is unlikely that Ash would want to ignore Jordan without a substantial reason. In any relationship, communication and understanding are key to maintaining a healthy bond between two individuals. If Ash truly loves Jordan and values their relationship, it would be more plausible to assume that Ash would continue engaging with Jordan in various activities such as spending quality time together, sharing personal thoughts, and exploring new experiences. Ignoring a loved one is generally considered a negative action within a relationship and could lead to feelings of disconnect, confusion, or resentment. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that people may have different opinions, emotions, and reasons that influence their actions – thus, without further contextual information, it is impossible to predict with certainty what Ash would want to do next regarding their relationship. To provide a more valid answer, consider the following questions that can help better understand Ash's motivations and potential actions: 1. What is the current state of Ash and Jordan's relationship? Are they facing any challenges or major changes in their lives that may influence Ash's behavior? 2. What are Ash's own feelings, goals, and dreams? Are these aligned with their relationship with Jordan, or do they face personal struggles that may affect Ash's response within their relationship? 3. How is the balance within the relationship? Are Ash and Jordan supportive of each other, or is there a need for a conversation to address any issues or misunderstandings? 4. Are there any external factors that could influence Ash's actions, such as stress from work, family, or social circles? If so, it may be crucial to consider how these factors impact Ash's thoughts and behaviors. In conclusion, relationships are complex and dynamic, requiring ongoing effort from both individuals. The answer \\"Ignore Jordan\\" is not a valid response given the premise of a loving two-year relationship between Ash and Jordan.

Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell.  Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance.  George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\".  Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses.  On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga.  Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew.  Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way.  The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished.  At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort.  The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site.  The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began.  Their musket fire, as well as grapeshot fired from ships anchored nearby, intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence. A stalemate persisted, with regular exchanges of cannon fire, until September 21, when 100...

Step 3: Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement guarantees or necessarily implies the truth of another statement.

Despite its length, clocking in at nearly forty minutes and stretched over six parts, the track made the UK top 30, and previewed what was to come. In 1994, they released Lifeforms to critical acclaim. The album featured unconventional use of percussion interspersed with ambient segments. The eponymous single from the album featured Elizabeth Fraser of the Cocteau Twins on vocals. The album itself featured epic, ambient soundscapes, with tracks flowing from one to the next with no pauses in between. Throughout the record, familiar motifs and samples repeated themselves, sitting alongside tropical birdsong, rainfall, wind and an array of other exotic sounds, lending the album a natural, organic feel, backed up by the environmental landscapes that filled the artwork booklet. Brian Dougan's father was involved with the BBC Radiophonic Workshop which was a heavy influence in the almost musique concrete feel to Lifeforms. The album was also a top 10 hit on the UK album chart. Cobain has said that around this time that journalists would come to talk to them and one of the first things they would ask would be if they liked Brian Eno (whom they cite as an influence), to which they would laugh and say that they were about looking forward, not to the past. It was, to them, very much a new work rather than just another Eno-type ambient album.  We wanted to release a very immersive, mind-blowing piece of music that was long and would deeply drench you in it...Lifeforms was redefining 'classical ambient electronic experimental' - that was the phrase we used.  That year, they released the limited edition album ISDN, which featured live broadcasts they had made over ISDN lines to various radio stations worldwide to promote Lifeforms, including The Kitchen, an avant-garde performance space in New York and several appearances on the late John Peel's celebrated BBC radio Sessions shows. These shows marked the evolution of the Kiss FM shows of 1992 and 1993, moving away from DJ sets and into ambient soundscapes, with previously released material performed alongside unheard tracks. One live performance to BBC Radio 1 featured Robert Fripp performing alongside the band. The released album's tone was darker and more rhythmic than Lifeforms. Cobain stated that with ISDN they had wanted to achieve something epic and grand but no matter how much technological or personal support they had (and they had everything they could have possibly wanted) they never got to truly do what they envisioned; he admits to wanting too much at this time, even though the album was successful; the 90s, for Cobain in particular, were a time of frustration and feelings of not being able to do what they wanted to, because the technology at the time didn't fit the band's ideas. The following year, the album was re-released with expanded artwork and a slightly altered track list as an unlimited pressing.

Remove the wedge from the cheese wheel. Wrap the rest of the gouda in plastic wrap or aluminum foil and store in the fridge for up to 3 weeks. Some wheels of gouda come with a red or black wax coating that needs to removed before the cheese can be eaten. If your wheel of gouda has one, peel the wax on each wedge back with your fingers or a knife. Discard the wax pieces after you remove them. Divide each wedge up into 4 or 5 even horizontal slices. Take the end piece near the rind (the hardened outer part of the cheese) and cut it in half crosswise to make 2 pieces. The rind on the cheese is edible, so leave it on when you're cutting up the cheese. If you don't want to eat the rind, eat around it and discard it when you're finished. Place a grater over a plate or bowl. Hold the wedge of gouda in your hand and gently rub it down the sharp perforated side of the grater. Once you reach the bottom, lift the wedge of cheese off the grater, bring it back to the top, and rub it down the side of the grater again. Repeat until the whole wedge has been grated. Keep your fingers away from the grater while you're grating the cheese. Summary:","output":"This is about how to cut and grate a wheel of gouda cheese. First, take off the plastic or wax coating. Then, make a straight cut from the center to the edge and another cut at an angle to remove a wedge. Cut the wedge into slices and grate them using a grater. Be careful not to hurt your fingers. You can eat the rind or leave it if you don't like it. Keep the rest of the cheese in the fridge with a wrap."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

Among them there was a big basket of very red, long fruit. And it was the cheapest in the shop. \\"I'd like a kilogram of this kind of fruit, please,\\" he said to the shop keeper. After the keeper gave him the fruit, he began to eat some of it. \\"Oh, my God!\\" he shouted. His eyes watered, his mouth watered; his eyes were burning, his head was burning; and his face became red. As he coughed, he jumped up and down, saying, \\"Ah! Ah! Ah!\\" But he still kept eating the fruit! Some people looking at him and said, \\"You're crazy, man. Those are chilies ! You can't eat so many; they're not good for you! People use them as a _ , but only a little bit to put into food for taste. You can't just eat them like that; they're not fruit!\\" But the man said, \\"No, I can't stop! I paid money for them.

In this story, the man's motivation for continuing to eat the chilies despite the pain and discomfort is his desire not to waste the money he had spent on them. This demonstrates how people might continue to engage in a particular behavior or action, even if it is causing them harm or discomfort, simply because they have already invested resources such as money, time, effort, and love into it. This phenomenon is known as the \\"sunk cost fallacy,\\" where people make decisions based on the amount of resources they have already invested, rather than evaluating the current and future value of their actions. It is important to recognize when we are falling into the trap of the sunk cost fallacy and to make decisions based on the potential value and benefits of our actions, rather than clinging to the past investments we have made. In the case of the man in the story, it would have been more rational for him to stop eating the chilies after realizing they were not meant to be eaten in large quantities, despite the money he had spent on them.

Given the question: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

Given the following context:  While Raff was able to offer \\"practical suggestions [in orchestration] which were of great value to Liszt\\", there may have been \\"a basic misunderstanding\\" of the nature of their collaboration. Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff. Walker writes that Joachim later recalled to Raff's widow \\"that he had seen Raff 'produce full orchestral scores from piano sketches.'\\" Joachim also told Raff's biographer Andreas Moser that \\"the E-flat-major Piano Concerto was orchestrated from beginning to end by Raff.\\" Raff's and Joachim's statements effectively questioned the authorship of Liszt's orchestral music, especially the symphonic poems. This speculation was debased when composer and Liszt scholar Peter Raabe carefully compared all sketches then known of Liszt's orchestral works with the published versions of the same works. Raabe demonstrated that, regardless of the position with first drafts, or of how much assistance Liszt may have received from Raff or Conradi at that point, every note of the final versions represents Liszt's intentions.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person who told Bernhard Cossmann to \\"listen to the instrumentation\\" and claimed it was his own?

For English Dominican mystics, the mystical experience was not expressed just in one moment of the full knowledge of God, but in the journey of, or process of, faith. This then led to an understanding that was directed toward an experiential knowledge of divinity. It is important to understand, however, that for these mystics it was possible to pursue mystical life without the visions and voices that are usually associated with such a relationship with God.

Short movie review: the truly funny bits  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"The critic seems to be thinking positively about the movie, as they mention \\"the truly funny bits.\\" This suggests that there were some genuinely funny moments in the film that the critic appreciated or enjoyed. However, it is important to note that this is just a single phrase from the review, and there might be other aspects of the movie that the critic did not enjoy as much. In a more detailed analysis of the critic's opinion, we can assume the following: 1. The critic found parts of the movie to be genuinely funny, which indicates that the comedic aspects of the film were effective. This is a positive aspect of their opinion, as humor is often an essential element of many movies. 2. The use of the word \\"truly\\" in \\"truly funny bits\\" suggests that these moments stood out amongst other potentially humorous moments in the movie. It implies that these particular instances were of high quality and genuine, making them memorable and enjoyable to watch. 3. However, the phrasing could also suggest that only certain moments were funny, and the critic might not have found the entire movie to be consistently humorous. This could imply that there might be some inconsistency in the comedy throughout the film, with occasional genuinely funny moments surrounded by less effective attempts at humor. While it is difficult to determine the overall opinion of the critic based on this short sentence alone, it seems that they did, at least, find some humor in the movie. This positivity towards the film's comedy gives us reason to believe that the critic might lean towards a positive opinion of the movie overall.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? It's important to get away from all the typical routines in order to foster creativity. The idea of changing it up is a common one amongst successful and creative thinkers. This means that you either create a specific ritual around creativity, or that you simply find a way to take a break.   Take a shower. There is something weirdly conducive about showering, as anyone who's had that amazing idea while stuck in the shower (only to forget it when you finally locate a pen and paper). If you're stuck on an idea, hop in the shower, with a pen and some paper handy and see what comes up.  Go for a walk. Like showering, something about walking fosters creativity. Whether it's taking a walk as a prelude to getting started with your creative project, or as part of the project itself, taking a walk will help get those creative juices flowing. Steve Jobs used to hold walking meetings to brainstorm ideas. Tchaikovsky took several walks around his village before working on his latest creation. Create psychological distance between your normal routine and the time for creativity. Writer Toni Morrison always watched the sun come up in the morning before she would begin writing. She felt that this enabled her to access her creativity. . Throwing out tons of different ideas, especially ideas that might seem slightly off-the-wall can be a great idea to pick out a few really good ideas. Brainstorming helps to open up your thinking so that you aren't stuck in the same old thought patterns.  The brainstorming stage isn't about what is or isn't feasible. Avoid limiting yourself when you're brainstorming. This is the time when all ideas are welcome, no matter how silly or unworkable they sound. If you start limiting yourself during this stage of the thinking game, you aren't going to progress very far. Avoid saying things to yourself during this phase that will shut down creativity rather than encourage it. Catch yourself anytime you say: \\"That won't work,\\" \\"We haven't done it that way before,\\" \\"We can't solve this problem,\\" \\"We don't have enough time.\\"  For example: say you get stuck while writing your new story. Instead of obsessing over the next stage of the story, start thinking throwing out ideas for what might happen next, or how the story might progress if there were no boundaries on what you could write (even if you needed to change the ending to make the story possible). Part of finding creative solutions and ideas stems from looking at the problem or project in a new way. Looking at something in a new way allows you to look at new possible solutions that you might not otherwise have considered. Fortunately, there are some concrete aids to re-conceptualizing that you can drawn on.  Turn the problem upside down. This can be done literally or figuratively; turning a picture upside down can actually make it easier to draw, because your brain has to look at it in terms of it's makings rather than what it thinks should be there. This works for more conceptual problems. For example, if you're writing a book and you can't figure out how to get the protagonist to a certain spot in the story, ask yourself \\"does this character actually need to be the protagonist? how would the story work with a different character as protagonist? or more than one character?\\"). Work backwards. Sometimes what you need is to focus on the solution first, and build backwards from that solution. For example: say you work in the advertising position at a newspaper. The paper is losing money because it hasn't been getting enough ads. Start from the final, best outcome (having lots of the right kind of ads). Work backwards by contacting the types of businesses and groups that can provide the best, most cost-effective ads. Daydreaming helps you to make connections and form patterns and recall information. This is key when you're thinking outside the box, because daydreaming can help you make connections that you might not otherwise have considered. So often your best ideas seem to come out of nowhere while you're daydreaming.  Give yourself time to daydream. Turn off the computer, t.v., and your phone. If you're constantly plugged into distractions it will be much harder for your brain to rest and make connections. You can daydream while on that walk, or in the shower (this is one reason taking time to go for a walk or shower can be so conducive to creative thinking). Daydream in the morning before you have to get up, or at night before you fall asleep. Sometimes if you're having difficulty thinking outside the box, it's time to give yourself some basic parameters. This may seem like it would hinder creativity, but if you set the right parameters you'll find that it can actually open things up for you.  Starting too broad can put too much pressure on you. For example: instead of saying \\"how can I increase ad sales\\" ask questions like \\"how can I encourage ad growth from businesses in the community? what can I do to make ads in our paper seem like a good option?\\" or \\"how can I target the businesses most likely to place ads in our paper?\\" or \\"what compensations can I use to encourage businesses to advertise?\\" You're still asking open questions and still considering a wide variety of options, but you're anchoring your ideas to a specific question or task. This will help you come up with more specific ideas. As another example: instead of asking yourself \\"how can I make my young adult novel different than the others on the market?\\" you consider more specific parts of the story: \\"who is the main character? is this main character just like every other main character (white, heterosexual, pretty but doesn't know it?)?\\" or if it's a fantasy novel \\"what is the magic system like? is it the vague paganesque, witchy magic that is popping up all over the YA section?\\" Or you could tell yourself that you have to rewrite a scene in your story only now the character doesn't have access to their magic. How are they going to get out of the situation? Fear is what holds back creativity. Fear is what makes you stick the paths that you know the best. When you consider the worst case scenario not only can you plan for it, but you can also convince yourself that the worst case scenario isn't bad enough that you shouldn't try.  For the ad person example: you might consider what will happen if you try to implement a creative new scheme to offer incentives for long-time advertising partners (like better placement in the layout, a full color ad for a reduced price, etc.). Perhaps the worst that could happen is that no one takes the offer, or that you lose money because of it. Come up with plans for how you might deal with these potential setbacks. For the novel-writing example: your worst case scenario might be that no publisher or agent wants to market your novel because what they actually want is a clone of the latest YA bestseller.

Please answer the following question: It was another landmark week in the presidency of Donald Trump. He hosted key U.S. allies Emmanuel Macron of France and Angela Merkel of Germany; but, he also had to weather more turmoil in his Cabinet as well as the ongoing Russia investigation and intensifying scrutiny of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference.

A:","output":"The best answer choice to the question \\"What sort of molecules are used for absorbing light energy by plants?\\" is \\"complex.\\" To explain further, plants rely on a process called photosynthesis to convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy, which is stored in the form of carbohydrates. This process is essential for growth, development, and reproduction of the plant. Photosynthesis requires several key components to function, with one of the most important being pigments that can absorb light energy. Chlorophyll is the primary pigment found in photosynthetic organisms like plants, algae, and cyanobacteria. It is responsible for absorbing light energy from the sun and converting it into the chemical energy needed to fuel the plant's metabolic processes. Chlorophyll molecules can be found within specialized structures called chloroplasts, which are the site of photosynthesis in plant cells. Chlorophyll is a complex molecule, composed of a porphyrin ring structure with a magnesium atom in the center. This structure allows chlorophyll to absorb specific wavelengths of light, mainly in the blue and red regions of the spectrum. There are several types of chlorophyll molecules, with chlorophyll a and chlorophyll b being the most common in plants. They differ slightly in their molecular structure, but both play crucial roles in the photosynthetic process. Other pigments exist in plants as well, such as carotenoids and anthocyanins, which assist in light harvesting and provide photoprotection during periods of excessive light exposure. These pigments are also complex molecules that contribute to the overall process of light absorption by plants. Considering the complexity of chlorophyll and other pigments involved in light absorption, it can be concluded that among the provided answer choices, \\"complex\\" is the most appropriate description for the molecules used by plants to absorb light energy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

So it was that J.W. and Marty had come into the inner places of each other's lives.  Of all the developments of Institute week, naturally the one which filled J.W.'s thoughts with a sort of awed gladness was Marty's decision to offer himself for the ministry.  Joe Carbrook's right-about-face was much more dramatic, for J.W. saw, when the decision was made, that Marty could not have been meant for anything but a preacher.  It was as fit as you please.  As to Joe, previous opinion had been pretty equally divided; one side leaning to the idea that he might make a lawyer, and the other predicting that he was more likely to be a perpetual and profitable client for some other lawyer.  In the light of the Institute happenings, it was to be expected that the question of college would promptly become a practical matter to four Delafield people.  Marty was greatly troubled, for he knew if he was to be a preacher, he must go to college, and he couldn't see how.  J.W. felt no great urge, though it had always been understood that he would go.  Marcia Dayne had one year of normal school to her credit, and would take another next year, perhaps; but this year she must teach.

Seminary is a kind of school where they teach about religion and preparing for a job in a religious group.

Instead, the insect respiratory system uses a system of internal tubes and sacs through which gases either diffuse or are actively pumped, delivering oxygen directly to tissues that need it via their trachea (element 8 in numbered diagram). Since oxygen is delivered directly, the circulatory system is not used to carry oxygen, and is therefore greatly reduced. The insect circulatory system has no veins or arteries, and instead consists of little more than a single, perforated dorsal tube which pulses peristaltically. Toward the thorax, the dorsal tube (element 14) divides into chambers and acts like the insect's heart.

Can we infer the following? The Titanic didn't have proper safety protocols in place","output":"To address the inference that the Titanic didn't have proper safety protocols in place, it is important to take a closer look at the events leading up to the tragedy, the safety measures in place at the time, and the prevailing standards in maritime safety in the early 20th century. The RMS Titanic was considered the epitome of luxury and technological advancement in the early 1900s. It was outfitted with various safety features available at the time, such as watertight doors and compartments. At the time of its construction, many thought it to be virtually unsinkable. However, the sinking of the Titanic did highlight several deficiencies in safety protocols and practices, which subsequently led to significant changes in maritime safety regulations. Some issues identified include: 1. Insufficient lifeboats – The Titanic was equipped with 20 lifeboats, enough to accommodate just over 1,100 people, while there were more than 2,200 passengers and crew members aboard the ship. This deficit was partly due to outdated maritime laws that determined the number of lifeboats required on a ship based on its tonnage rather than its passenger capacity. Additionally, aesthetics and concerns about the deck appearing cluttered contributed to the lower number of lifeboats. 2. Inadequate crew training – The crew aboard the Titanic was not adequately trained in handling emergencies, such as the one faced that fateful night. Many crew members were unfamiliar with the lifeboat launching procedure, which led to delays and reduced capacity utilization of the available lifeboats. Moreover, many passengers were not informed of the proper safety procedures or the locations of life jackets and lifeboats. 3. Miscommunication and complacency – The Titanic received multiple ice warnings from other ships in the area before the collision but failed to take evasive action or reduce speed. Some messages were not forwarded to the bridge, while others did not result in an appropriate response. Complacency in the belief that the Titanic was \\"unsinkable\\" may also have played a role in the insufficient response to these warnings. 4. Compromised construction – While the Titanic's design included many advanced safety features for its time, such as watertight compartments designed to contain flooding, a few critical design flaws contributed to its vulnerability. For example, the watertight compartments were not entirely sealed at the top, which allowed water to spill over into adjacent compartments as the ship tilted. This flaw, combined with the significant damage to its hull from the iceberg impact, compromised the Titanic's ability to stay afloat. Taking these factors into consideration, we can infer that the Titanic did lack proper safety protocols by modern standards. However, it is crucial to understand that these shortcomings were not necessarily a result of negligence by the ship's designers or crew but rather a reflection of the prevailing safety standards and practices of the time. The disaster did serve as a catalyst for significant improvements in maritime safety. Following the sinking of the Titanic, the first International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) was adopted in 1914, which established standards for lifeboat capacity, crew training, and other ship safety protocols. These regulations have been continuously revisited and updated to this day, ensuring a commitment to learning from past tragedies and constantly improving maritime safety standards."},{"instruction":"Jesse lost every game and the others went home disappointed that they lost their bets.

All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed a series of 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field that distorts the entire electromagnetic spectrum, nullifying all communication between Japan and the outside world and making even satellite surveillance impossible.

It is also a colloquial term for the instrument used by players in all genres, including classical music. Fiddle playing, or fiddling, refers to various styles of music. Fiddle is also a common term among musicians who play folk music on the violin. The fiddle is part of many traditional (folk) styles of music which are aural traditions, taught 'by ear' rather than via written music. Fiddle is normally the term used for Irish Traditional Music.  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - \`\` Relentless '' is a song written by James LeBlanc and John Paul White and recorded by American country music artist Jason Aldean . It was released in May 2008 as the third and final single from his 2007 album of the same name .

It is also an American brand of resonator guitar, currently owned by the Gibson Guitar Corporation. The Dobro was originally made by the Dopyera brothers when they formed the Dobro Manufacturing Company. Their design, with a single inverted resonator, was introduced in competition to the patented Tricone and biscuit designs produced by the National String Instrument Corporation. The Dobro name appeared on other instruments, notably electric lap steel guitars and solid body electric guitars and on other resonator instruments such as Safari resonator mandolins.  - Broken Bow Records is an American independent record label based in Nashville, Tennessee. Founded in July 1999 by Benny Brown, the label specializes in country music. The label's general manager is Jon Loba.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Jason Aldine Williams (born February 28, 1977), known professionally as Jason Aldean, is an American singer. Since 2005, Jason Aldean has been signed to Broken Bow Records, a record label for which he has released seven albums and 24 singles.

There are many types of harmonica, including diatonic, chromatic, tremolo, octave, orchestral, and bass versions. A harmonica is played by using the mouth (lips and tongue) to direct air into or out of one or more holes along a mouthpiece. Behind each hole is a chamber containing at least one reed. A harmonica reed is a flat elongated spring typically made of brass, stainless steel, or bronze, which is secured at one end over a slot that serves as an airway.

Although she wrote \\"went off very well\\" in her diary, Ferrier was disappointed with her performance, and concluded that she needed further voice training. She approached the distinguished baritone Roy Henderson with whom, a week previously, she had sung in Mendelssohn's Elijah. Henderson agreed to teach her, and was her regular voice coach for the remainder of her life. He later explained that her \\"warm and spacious tone\\" was in part due to the size of the cavity at the back of her throat: \\"one could have shot a fair-sized apple right to the back of the throat without obstruction\\". However, this natural physical advantage was not in itself enough to ensure the quality of her voice; this was due, Henderson says, to \\"her hard work, artistry, sincerity, personality and above all her character\\". Ferrier's performances in the Glyndebourne run, which began on 12 July 1946, earned her favourable reviews, although the opera itself was less well received. On the provincial tour which followed the festival it failed to attract the public and incurred heavy financial losses. By contrast, when the opera reached Amsterdam it was greeted warmly by the Dutch audiences who showed particular enthusiasm for Ferrier's performance. This was Ferrier's first trip abroad, and she wrote an excited letter to her family: \\"The cleanest houses and windows you ever did see, and flowers in the fields all the way!\\" Following her success as Lucretia she agreed to return to Glyndebourne in 1947, to sing Orfeo in Gluck's opera Orfeo ed Euridice. She had often sung Orfeo's aria Che farò (\\"What is life\\") as a concert piece, and had recently recorded it with Decca. At Glyndebourne, Ferrier's limited acting abilities caused some difficulties in her relationship with the conductor, Fritz Stiedry; nevertheless her performance on the first night, 19 June 1947, attracted warm critical praise.Ferrier's association...

Q:William White sat across from me, fidgeting nervously with an empty packet of artificial sweetener while his coffee went cold, ignored on the table in front of him. He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In 1859, prefix = st1 /ItalyandFrancewere at war withAustria, and Henry Dunant, a young Swiss gentleman, came upon one of their battlefields. For the first time in his life, Dunant saw how heartless war would be. Around him were suffering men untended and left to die where they fell. Henry Dunant went to work at once. Helped by several peasant women, he formed an ambulance service and set up headquarters in a little church. He treated the wounds of Frenchmen, Italians and Austrians alike. When he was asked why he did so, his answer showed a spirit of humanity that was not common in those days. \\"We are all brothers. A wounded enemy is an enemy no longer.\\" With his band of assistants, Dunant helped to save many lives. The \\"gentleman in white\\" (as Dunant was called because he wore a white suit) was looked upon by hundreds of wounded men as an angel.     When Dunant returned toSwitzerland, he could not forget the needless suffering on the battlefield. He thought of a great organization that should be planned to include many nations. It would do its work with the approval of all countries. And it must operate under a sign that all would know: its symbol would be a red cross against a white background. He wrote a book to make the public see the need for this great organization. In the book he included a truthful account of what he had seen on the battlefield. The consequence was that readers were shocked by what he described. After Dunant's hard work, in Geneva on October 26, 1863, all the nations of Europe were invited to a meeting at which it was decided a relief society should be formed in each country. Then the Geneva Convention was made the following year. The nations that signed the Geneva Convention chose the red cross as the symbol for the international organization.     Until his death in 1910, Dunant was always ready to look for a noble cause. And when the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded for the first time in 1901, the honor went to Dunant. No man has deserved it more than the founder of the Red Cross.

Possible A: talk to each other, learn from each other, demand justice, cook food, share food  Why is \\"cook food\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Cook food\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons, which include the following: 1. Scope of the activity: When people have guests over at their homes, one of the primary activities usually conducted is socializing, and a significant portion of this involves sharing a meal. By cooking food, the host is able to provide their guests with a tangible way of connecting and bonding with each other.  2. Hospitality and sharing culture: It is part of human culture and tradition to show hospitality towards guests. This is often done by providing food and refreshments to the guests, which is seen as a universal sign of friendliness and care. Cooking food is an essential part of this, as it enables the host to cater to the guests' tastes and dietary requirements. 3. Social etiquette: Society has established norms and unwritten rules around hosting and attending social gatherings. One of the primary expectations during a social gathering is that guests should be treated with respect and be made comfortable. Cooking food is a common yet essential way of fulfilling these expectations, as it can signal to the guests that their presence is appreciated and valued. 4. Bonding and relationship-building: Cooking food and sharing a meal can forge stronger relationships, as this allows people to engage in conversations while enjoying a shared experience. Furthermore, cooking for someone else can be seen as an act of kindness and thoughtfulness, which can enhance the bond between the host and their guests. 5. Cultural and personal expression: Cooking food for guests can be a means for the host to express their cultural background or personal preferences through the dishes they prepare. This can lead to interesting discussions and learning experiences that enrich the overall gathering. 6. Nourishment and sustenance: Preparing food for guests fundamentally addresses the basic human need for sustenance and nourishment. Cooking food goes beyond the mere provision of calories; it allows for the guests and hosts to enjoy a pleasant, tasty, and comfortable experience. 7. Sensorial and holistic experience: A well-prepared and cooked meal can create a multisensory experience for guests, engaging their sense of taste, smell, sight, and touch. By creating a visually appealing and aromatic meal, hosts demonstrate their ability to create an enjoyable environment for their guests, elevating the overall experience of the social gathering. In conclusion, \\"cook food\\" is an answer that is aligned with human common sense primarily because it addresses several essential aspects of both human biology and sociocultural norms. By cooking food, hosts demonstrate their care and concern for guests, foster stronger relationships, and enrich social experiences through the sharing of stories, traditions, and personal histories—all while addressing guests' nourishment and well-being. Cooking food is a universally recognized and practical way of achieving these goals, making it an integral part of hosting and attending social gatherings."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: British film director Amma Asante says the organisers of the Oscars need to keep up the momentum on its actions to improve diversity. Article:","output":"Title: Oscar Organisers: Ensuring Momentum for Sustainable Diversity in the Film Industry In recent years, the Oscars have come under fire for their lack of representation and diversity amongst nominees and winners, leading to movements such as #Oscarssowhite. In response, the organisers of the Oscars have taken several measures to improve diversity within the Academy and in the film industry as a whole. British film director Amma Asante, the creative genius behind critically acclaimed films like \\"Belle\\" and \\"A United Kingdom,\\" has some important words for the Oscars' organisers: keep up the momentum. Asante herself has made history as an African British film director and woman of colour, ensuring her films are ardent reflections of the people and stories often underrepresented in mainstream movies. In recent years, we have started seeing an improvement in the Oscars' diversity as more people of colour have been nominated and awarded the prestigious Gold. However, Asante believes that these are only the starting points for significant, lasting changes in the film industry. She argues that the Oscars should maintain and capitalise on the momentum they have gained, ensuring diversity is not just a temporary trend, but a permanent fixture in the world of cinema. Asante suggests that the organisers of the prestigious awards focus on three main areas to ensure sustained and meaningful diversity in the film industry. 1. Encourage and support emerging diverse talent Firstly, the Oscars need to engage with and support new and emerging creators from diverse ethnicities, genders, and backgrounds. By giving these individuals access to specialised training and financial resources, the Academy can better equip them to break into the highly competitive film industry. This will create an inclusive and diverse creative environment that will ultimately broaden the stories told on the silver screen. 2. Amplify underrepresented voices One of the most powerful ways of achieving more diversity in the film industry is by giving a platform to tell diverse stories. By supporting underrepresented voices, the Oscars can demonstrate their commitment to telling stories that resonate across different cultures and communities and foster an industry that accurately reflects society's diversity. 3. Tackle systemic bias in the industry Lastly, Asante argues that the Oscars need to tackle systemic bias within the industry. This may include addressing unfair casting practices and gender pay gaps, revealing hidden biases in film funding, or providing more opportunities for marginalised filmmakers to succeed. The Academy has already taken steps toward achieving greater diversity at the Oscars, such as changing membership rules to invite more diverse voters and introducing guidelines to promote more diverse representation in nominated films. However, it is vital to ensure that these changes do not lose steam over time. Only by continually pushing for change can the Oscars organisers create a film industry that tells stories for everyone, showcasing the full range of human experiences, cultures, and artistic talents. In conclusion, British film director Amma Asante is urging the Oscars organisers to keep up the momentum on their actions to improve diversity in the film industry. By focusing on encouraging emerging talents, amplifying underrepresented voices, and tackling systemic bias, the Oscars can help pave the way for lasting positive change and create a more inclusive, vibrant, and reflective film industry for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Earl Hines began his musical journey at an early age, learning to play the piano, trumpet, and other instruments from his father, who was also a musician. However, it was his exceptional talent for the piano that helped him stand out. In his late teens, Hines relocated to Pittsburgh to join Lois Deppe's orchestra at the Liederhaus. Deppe, recognizing the potential in Hines, provided him with further opportunities that allowed his talent to flourish. In 1923, Hines moved to Chicago, where he became a fixture in the local jazz scene. In Chicago, Hines joined various groups and orchestras, including bands led by Erskine Tate, Carroll Dickerson, and Louis Armstrong, the latter being a significant influence on Hines' career. As a pianist, Hines rejected the then-dominant stride piano technique, which was popular among musicians like James P. Johnson and Fats Waller. Instead, he revolutionized piano playing by introducing a rhythmic and melodic approach that became a key characteristic of his unique style. Hines' playing, notable for its virtuosic speed, rhythmic improvisation, and technical dexterity, mirrored the melodic phrasings of horn lines, closely resembling a member of a horn section \\"comping\\" behind a soloist. As a result, soloists anchored their improvisations on Hines' rhythm and harmony, forging a robust partnership between Hines and the soloists. In 1928, Hines formed his big band, Earl Hines and His Orchestra, which went on to become part of the emerging swing movement and featured some legendary musicians, such as Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Sarah Vaughan. His orchestra recorded numerous hit songs, including \\"Deep Forest,\\" \\"Piano Man,\\" \\"Rosetta,\\" and \\"Boogie Woogie on St. Louis Blues,\\" showcasing Hines' captivating piano work and advanced harmonic skills. Earl Hines' style greatly influenced future generations of pianists, including Oscar Peterson, Art Tatum, Thelonious Monk, and even Horace Silver. Throughout his career, which spanned over five decades, Hines never stopped refining and experimenting with his piano style, resulting in a rich legacy that solidified his status as a jazz piano virtuoso. In conclusion, Earl \\"Fatha\\" Hines, a pioneering jazz musician, is primarily associated with the piano. His innovative and distinctive playing style revolutionized the way pianists approached their instrument, laying the foundation for modern jazz piano and influencing numerous artists of his time as well as future generations of jazz musicians."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Information:  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - A tank is an armored fighting vehicle designed for front-line combat, with heavy firepower, strong armour, and tracks providing good battlefield manoeuvrability. The first tanks were designed to overcome the deadlock of trench warfare; now they are a mainstay of modern ground forces and a key part of combined arms combat.  - The Panzer II is the common name used for a family of German tanks used in World War II. The official German designation was Panzerkampfwagen II ( abbreviated PzKpfw II ) . Although the vehicle had originally been designed as a stopgap while larger , more advanced tanks were developed , it nonetheless went on to play an important role in the early years of World War II , during the Polish and French campaigns . The Panzer II was the most numerous tank in the German Panzer divisions beginning with the invasion of France . It was used in both North Africa against the British and on the Eastern Front against the Soviet Union . The Panzer II was supplanted by the Panzer III and IV by 1940/1941 . Thereafter , it was used to great effect as a reconnaissance tank . By the end of 1942 , it had been largely removed from front line service and it was used for training and on secondary fronts . The turrets of the then obsolete PzKpfw Is and PzKpfw IIs were reused as gun turrets on specially built defensive bunkers , particularly on the Atlantic Wall . Production of the tank itself ceased by 1943 , but its chassis remained in use as the basis of several other armored vehicles , chiefly self - propelled artillery and tank destroyers such as the Wespe and Marder II.  - Firepower is the military capability to direct force at an enemy. (It is not to be confused with the concept of \\"rate of fire\\", which describes cycling of the firing mechanism in a weapon system.) Firepower involves the whole range of potential weapons. The concept is generally taught as one of the three key principles of modern warfare wherein the enemy forces are destroyed or have their will to fight negated by sufficient and preferably overwhelming use of force as a result of combat operations.  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - A battle is a combat in warfare between two or more armed forces, or combatants. A war sometimes consists of many battles. Battles generally are well defined in duration, area, and force commitment.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - The Panzer I was a light tank produced in Germany in the 1930s. The name is short for the German (\\"armored fighting vehicle mark I\\"), abbreviated \\"\\". The tank's official German ordnance inventory designation was SdKfz 101 (\\"special purpose vehicle 101\\").  - Combined arms is an approach to warfare which seeks to integrate different combat arms of a military to achieve mutually complementary effects (for example, using infantry and armor in an urban environment, where one supports the other, or both support each other). According to strategist William S. Lind, combined arms can be distinguished from the concept of \\"supporting arms\\" as follows: Combined arms hits the enemy with two or more arms simultaneously in such a manner that the actions he must take to defend himself from one make him more vulnerable to another. In contrast, supporting arms is hitting the enemy with two or more arms in sequence, or if simultaneously, then in such combination that the actions the enemy must take to defend himself from one also defends himself from the other(s).  - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.

Include the outlay for construction, permits, and hiring employees as well. This gives you your total cost for the project. Have at least 1 year of expenses on hand before opening the hostel to support the business before you start profiting. If you don’t have enough savings to self-finance opening and operating the hostel, then you’ll need funding from other sources. Consider going to a bank for a business loan. Another option is finding affluent people interested in providing private investment for the hostel. Whichever option you choose, have financing in place before you start building your hostel.  There are advantages and disadvantages to looking for loans from banks or individuals. Banks may be more conservative and refuse to loan you more than a fixed amount. Private investors may be more willing to offer higher sums, but they want a return on their investment. They might want to own a part of the business and share in the profits. Consider the costs carefully before choosing a financing option. Produce a good business plan, especially if you’re looking for private financing. Investors will want a return on their investment, and if you don’t prove that your business will be profitable, they won’t provide financing.","output":"In order to establish a successful hostel, it is important to first research and understand the local laws and zoning regulations. Some cities have specific areas designated for hostels, and operating outside of these zones could result in fines or legal consequences. One can find this information on local government websites or by contacting the local zoning agency. It is crucial to obtain all necessary permits and licenses before opening, as non-compliance can have serious repercussions. Make sure to account for processing time and fees associated with these permits when planning the hostel's opening timeline. In order to accurately calculate the costs of opening and running a hostel, it is important to consider every expense, including rent, utilities, construction, permits, employee salaries, taxes, and any other potential costs. It is advised to have at least one year's worth of expenses on hand before opening to ensure the business can survive until it begins generating profit. If personal savings are insufficient to finance the opening and operation of the hostel, alternative funding solutions, such as bank loans or private investments, can be considered. Banks tend to offer more conservative loans, while private investors may offer higher amounts but may request a share in the profits or partial ownership of the business. It is important to weigh the pros and cons of each financing method before making a decision. Finally, developing a comprehensive business plan is essential for securing funding, particularly from private investors who want to ensure they will receive a return on their investment. A strong business plan should outline the profitability and growth projections of the hostel, demonstrating its potential for success and solidifying the confidence of potential investors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The morning settled my nerves a bit more and before long the train pulled into the station. Boston had a slower feel, much slower than New York. The air was cool and peppered with moisture. I knew I was close to the ocean. Vision blurry, I wobbled out of the train depot and thought about the fact that I had never really done anything crazy in my life. The colors meant something here. Green was the color of plants but it was also the color of money. Plants were good but money was bad. I didn't know what green meant. Blue and red were clear though. Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city.

First, start with the original equation,  43*a + 192 + 124 + 716 = 0 Then combine the constant terms (192, 124, 716) on the left side of the equation. So we have:  43*a + 1032 = 0. Next, to solve for 'a', we have to isolate 'a' on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract the constant term (1032) from both sides of the equation: 43*a = -1032. Finally, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient 43 to find the value of 'a': a = -1032 / 43. When you carry out the division, you find that a = -24.

Q:I have a new situation: Two sisters Mary and Beth were into sciences. Beth studied physics, while Mary studied chemistry and especially alkanes. They were very devoted to studying.  But I can use this background: Saturated hydrocarbons are given the general name of alkanes . The name of specific alkanes always ends in – ane . The first part of the name indicates how many carbon atoms each molecule of the alkane has. The smallest alkane is methane. It has just one carbon atom. The next largest is ethane with two carbon atoms. The chemical formulas and properties of methane, ethane, and other small alkanes are listed in the Table below . The boiling and melting points of alkanes are determined mainly by the number of carbon atoms they have. Alkanes with more carbon atoms generally boil and melt at higher temperatures.  What is an answer for this question: Which sister studied more about the chemical formulas and properties of small alkanes? A:","output":"The sister who studied more about the chemical formulas and properties of small alkanes is Mary.  This conclusion is based on the given backgrounds. Mary was specifically mentioned as studying chemistry and especially alkanes, which are a type of chemical compound. The background information explains that alkanes are saturated hydrocarbons and the properties, including the chemical formulas, of these compounds are determined by the number of carbon atoms they have.  Meanwhile, Beth, who was studying physics, might deal indirectly with chemical matters, but her subjects are more likely focused on matter and energy in general, including mechanics, heat, light and other radiation, sound, electricity, magnetism, and the structure of atoms, instead of the specific study of alkanes. Therefore, based on the information provided, Mary is the sister who studied more about the chemical formulas and properties of small alkanes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: If you'd like to spend the perfect day with your lover, consider marking the occasion by putting on a little perfume, cologne, or aftershave — especially if you don't normally do so. A small sprinkling of an enticing scent can make a subtle (but noticeable) difference that your partner will most likely appreciate. Be sure to brace yourself — studies have shown that scent plays an important role in sexual attraction!  To wear perfume or cologne, spray a tiny amount on your wrists, and perhaps dab a touch behind your ears. Other places, especially those where the blood vessels are thickest, like behind your knees and elbows, can also benefit from a gentle spray. Just be careful that it's you who's wearing the fragrance (and not the fragrance who's wearing you). Note that many deodorants, especially those for men, already have a strong scent or perfume in them. In this case, avoid adding an additional perfume on top of the first. Wearing multiple scents can cause \\"clashing\\", overpowering results that aren't usually very flattering. Try making a jaunt over to your local cafe or ice cream shop for a sweet time! You don't even have to have a meal beforehand — in the words of Ally Craig in Remember Me: \\"I just don't see the point in waiting. I mean, what if I die while eating my entrée?\\". Indulging in treats you wouldn't normally enjoy together is a great way to mark this special occasion. It's also quite fitting — today, your whole day is a \\"dessert\\" for you and your partner to enjoy. Enjoy the day's freedom by going somewhere you've never been before. This can be someplace as simple as a trail in your local park or someplace as exciting as the wide-open wilderness — with the right attitude, both can offer great opportunities for exploration. The sounds of birds, the sight of the light filtering through the trees, and the fresh smell of nature will improve your mood right away and give you an opportunity to have a relaxing, heartfelt conversation. Plus, walking is proven form of stimulating, mood-lifting exercise you both get to share together! If you live in the city or somewhere without any wilderness nearby, you can still explore — just take a walk around your neighborhood. Greet the people you meet with a smile, or just keep yourselves — it's up to you. Going to an orchard (or just out into the wilderness) to pick fruit is highly underrated — it's cheaper, fresher and much more fun than buying berries from the store (not to mention the fact that you get to snack as you go).  Best of all, this makes a highly enjoyable couples activity — for instance, you can compete to see who can collect more fruit or pool your resources together to make a pie!  Depending on where you live and what time of the year it is, different fruits will be available for picking. Try consulting with a botanical resource to figure out what's ripe — apples, for instance, can be bought at the supermarket all year, but only get ripe in the fall.  A word of caution — some plants you may find in the wilderness may be poisonous, so if you're ever less than 100% sure about something you've found, don't eat it. For example, nightshade berries, which are small, black, and shiny, may look appetizing, but they can actually be deadly in sufficient quantities. If you haven't done so before, try exploring your artistic side with your partner! Drawing, painting, writing a song, and even making your own short film can be mind-expanding ways to spend your afternoon. You may even discover things about your partner that you weren't aware of as part of the artistic process — your girlfriend, for instance, may have an eye for expressive camera angles to rival Stanley Kubrick's. Even if the finished product isn't exactly what you had in mind, you'll have an imperfect work of art you can laugh about in the future, so get your creative juices flowing! If you haven't ever gone to a spa with your partner before, consider visiting one as part of your \\"lovely day,\\" even if it's not something you'd normally do. Getting a relaxing massage or spending some time in the sauna can leave you feeling completely refreshed and rejuvenated, especially if you've recently been stressed out. Even the manliest of men are allowed at spas, so don't be afraid if you've never been before! You don't have to make an appointment at an expensive spa to have a good time. If you're short on cash, try making your own personal spa date at home. Run a deep, warm bath for two and wash yourself with the best soap you have handy before moisturizing your whole body with a good body lotion. Light a few candles is to make things even more romantic! . Diving into the bargain bins at a local thrift shop with your partner can be an entertaining experience. You won't always find something great (and sometimes you'll find something horrendous), but occasionally, you'll come across some truly stylish vintage clothing. Treasure hunting in vintage shops can be a lot of fun if you're open to it — you won't know what's out there in your size until you go hunt for it! The benefits of shopping for vintage clothes are many: for example, you don't ever have to worry about whether or not your friends have bought the same piece of clothing as you — odds are, you have the only copy of your shirt in town! The shopping process itself is also a lot more fun and engaging than going to the mall and simply buying expensive new clothes. If you have time, try to be somewhere that you'll have a clear view of the setting sun in the evening with your partner. Sometimes, it's a lovely experience to just sit quietly in each others' arms and watch the sun go down. This can be an exceptionally intimate experience if you've had a hustling, bustling day full of activities. It's often unusual to get the chance to be completely silent for a few minutes, so make the most of it!  You can usually find the exact time that the sun will go down in your area online with a simple search engine query. Usually, the absolute most you'll need to do is input your location and the date for which you'd like to know the sunset time. End your day by going out and enjoying each others' company on the dance floor! The type of music you dance to is up to you and your partner — it doesn't matter whether it's ballroom waltzes or heavy metal as long as you love it! It may be easiest to do your dancing in the company of other people in a club or dancehall, but if you're really bold, you can do it in a park, on the street corner, or in your backyard. You can even do it by candlelight in your own house if you want to set a romantic mood.  You never need to worry about how you look while dancing with your partner! Just close your eyes, feel the music, and move. Remember, you're doing this for  each others' attention — not the attention of the people around you. If you're shy about dancing, don't worry! Many dance halls have \\"beginner's nights\\" or dance classes to teach you the basics so that you can enjoy yourself when it counts! You can even take dance classes at many gyms and Universities, so take a look online for opportunities near you!","output":"This article is about having a perfect day with your loved one and suggests some fun activities to do together.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary.  His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing.  The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church.

Maria's goals were much steadier than Monica's because","output":"Maria's goals were much steadier than Monica's because they were built on a foundation of consistency, discipline, and long-term vision. These qualities allowed Maria to steadily progress toward her goals, whereas Monica's goals seemed to shift and change as easily as the wind. Firstly, Maria's consistency in setting achievable targets was one of the primary factors for her steady goals. Maria was very meticulous in her planning methodology, as she clearly defined her objectives from the beginning. This enabled her to allocate time and effort towards her plan efficiently, making it easier for her to track her progress and identify any potential adjustments. In contrast, Monica struggled to maintain a clear vision of what she wanted, with her goals changing every few weeks or sometimes even shorter. With a lack of consistency, she had to constantly revise and revamp her plans which in turn, compromised her ability to achieve her goals in a timely manner. Secondly, Maria's disciplined nature played a significant part in her progress. This character trait allowed her to establish an organized daily routine focused on working towards her long-term objectives. Even when life got busy or various distractions sought to knock her off course, Maria's discipline and focus to stick to her routine consistently guided her towards her goals. Monica, on the other hand, could not maintain this discipline or organization. Her inconsistency in following routines led to inefficiency, floundering, and eventually, abandonment of her plans altogether. Besides consistency and discipline, Maria also had a clear long-term vision for herself. She was aware of where she wanted to be in her personal and professional life in the years to come. This foresight allowed her to map out her path and diligently work towards it. She not only planned but routinely analyzed her progress, taking note of any change in her circumstances. This close attention to detail helped her make the necessary adjustments to her objectives and the respective approaches. Conversely, Monica's short-term thinking and impulsive nature thwarted her from establishing a steady, forward-looking plan. Her lack of long-term vision impaired her decision-making and led her to make hasty decisions that brought her short-lived satisfaction rather than long-term success. Maria's consistent, disciplined, and forward-thinking approach served as strong pillars in achieving her goals, while also helping her adapt to any changes in her environment. Her constant reflection on her progress and commitment to her plans enabled her to stay on course and avoid getting entangled in unrealistic ambitions or impulsive actions. In contrast, Monica's fluctuating goals and priorities, as well as her struggle with discipline and long-term vision, limited her ability to make steady progress towards a fulfilling and rewarding future. Overall, the difference between Maria and Monica's approach to goal setting and achieving can serve as valuable insight for anyone striving to make significant progress in their own lives. Cultivating consistency, discipline, and long-term vision, as demonstrated by Maria, can certainly improve one's chances of achieving success, ultimately leading to a more enriching and purposeful life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Background: Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment.  Paragraph: Tree city and Leaf city were the two biggest cities in Boulderland. Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city exposed fewer people to asthma? A:","output":"Given the background information and the paragraph provided, Leaf City exposed fewer people to asthma. This is because Leaf City was more protective towards its environment, implying that they focused more on controlling air pollution. As the background information suggests, air pollution increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma. Therefore, with Leaf City's focus on environmental protection, it's likely that its air quality was better, leading to a reduced exposure to asthma for its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In relationships, sometimes the call of duty includes trying new things, such as ethnic foods. Although some might not consider Hawaiian foods as being \\"ethnic\\" this picky eater certainly does.   With all foreign foods my only requirement is to have what I like to call, \\"distinguishable meats\\". This means, if I ask if the chicken is all white meat and they say \\"yes\\", I expect as well as look forward to distinguishable white meat chicken.   Perhaps in foreign lands, and on deserted islands \\"white meat\\" could potentially have various meanings?

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What was conducted by Henry Wood when it was played at a London Promenade Concert?, using the article: Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The piece conducted by Henry Wood when it was played at a London Promenade Concert was the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches composed by Edward Elgar between 1901 and 1930. When the first march was performed in 1901, the audience was thrilled, and the orchestral item was accorded a double encore, which was unprecedented in the history of the Promenade concerts."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. For men, tuck a collared dress shirt into a pair of straight-leg or slim-fit slacks. Add a tie that complements the colors of your shirt and pants if the occasion calls for it. For women, dresses and skirts are more formal. Wear a shift dress or a pencil skirt that hits mid-thigh or lower.  Avoid showing too much skin if you’re attending a nicer event like a theater performance or fancy dinner. If you're a woman who wants to wear pants, choose dress slacks that are flattering and hemmed to the right length. A properly fitting dress shirt should have a collar that fits snugly around your neck, sleeves that hit just above your hands, and shoulder seams that line up with the ends of your shoulders. Materials like silk, satin, or velvet are all more formal. Avoid clothing that looks cheap or flimsy, or that has sloppy stitching or frays.  A cashmere sweater paired with wool pants is a good option for men and women. Women might wear a velvet skirt with a blouse or a silk midi dress. Men could wear khakis and a tailored shirt paired with a satin tie. Embellishments like gems, pearls, or ruffles also add visual interest to your outfit. What you wear on top of your outfit is just as important as the outfit itself. After all, it’s what people see first. If it’s cold outside or if you simply want to add a layer, slip on a fitted blazer or sport coat. It looks professional when worn over a flirty dress for women and smartens up a dress shirt for men. Get your blazer or sport coat tailored before wearing it so it fits properly. A blazer that’s too baggy or has sleeves that are too long just looks sloppy. Choose a pair that’s around 3 inches (7.6 cm) high or lower to avoid looking trashy and to protect your feet. There are plenty of styles to pick from like stilettos, platforms, pumps, and kitten heels.  Make sure you can walk in the shoes you choose to wear. Nothing kills an outfit faster than a woman limping around in 6 in (15 cm) stilettos. Your heel height should be based on what you’re wearing, too. A long dress may require a certain heel height so it doesn’t drag on the ground. If you’re wearing a mini dress, choose a lower height. Shiny lace-up derbies pair well with suits for more formal events. Suede bucks or neutral leather Oxfords are still classy but can be worn with trousers or wool pants.  Match your shoes to the color scheme of your outfit. Avoid clashing hues like black with navy or black with brown, for example. If you’re wearing dress shoes, shine them first. Polish your shoes yourself or take them to a shoe repair store or kiosk in the mall to have it done. If you’re going to wear jewelry, stay away from gaudy costume pieces. Instead, opt for elegant accessories like a diamond-studded watch for men or a dainty gold chain with an emerald drop for women. A little goes a long way with quality jewelry so stick to 1 to 2 statement pieces.  Charm bracelets, diamond stud earrings, pretty choker necklaces, and delicate jeweled rings are all chic options. Choose jewelry based on your neckline. For example, a high-collared top calls for bigger earrings and no necklaces whereas a low v-neck looks good with a long pendant. Pick a small handheld purse that matches your shoes or your jewelry. For example, if you’re wearing silver jewelry, take a silver or cool-toned clutch or wristlet. Choose one in a fancier fabric like silk or one that’s beaded and embellished. Stock your clutch with anything you might need like lipstick, extra bobby pins, and your wallet.","output":"Dress nicely with fitted clothes, appropriate shoes, and elegant accessories for a formal look, and make sure to adjust your outfit based on the occasion and your comfort."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Life: Acid rain can negatively affect various forms of life, including aquatic animals, plants, and terrestrial organisms. The chemical composition of acid rain can lead to an imbalance in ecosystems and disrupt the natural food chain. 2. Humans: Acid rain has negative consequences for human health, primarily by contributing to respiratory problems and irritating the skin and eyes. Additionally, acid rain degrades structures and monuments, causing economic damage and preserving humanity's cultural heritage. 3. Biome: The term \\"biome\\" refers to a large ecosystem with similar climate, flora, and fauna. Acid rain can alter the characteristics of a biome by affecting the nutrient balance in soil, damaging plants and trees, inducing biological stress in animals, and harming overall biodiversity. 4. Rivers: Acid rain can contaminate bodies of water such as rivers, increasing their acidity levels. This change in pH can negatively affect aquatic life, killing or harming fish, invertebrates, and other organisms vital to the ecosystem. Acidification of rivers may also harm wetland ecosystems, which play a critical role in filtration and water purification. 5. Plants: Acid rain directly impacts plants and trees by leaching vital nutrients from the soil and weakening them. In addition, acid rain dissolves and washes away the nutrients that plants need to thrive. As a result, affected plants are more vulnerable to disease, pests, and environmental stressors. Overall, while some answer choices are irrelevant (like Impact craters, Negative Charge, and Battery acid), acid rain has a negative impact on life, humans, biomes, rivers, and plants."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ian has never read a blog, and Kyle reads them every day, so","output":"the two friends often have contrasting opinions on various topics. While Ian tends to gather his information from traditional media sources such as newspapers, magazines, and television, Kyle relies heavily on his favorite blogs for in-depth analysis, personal perspectives, and cutting-edge insights on the latest trends and issues. Their conversations are a fascinating blend of the old and the new, revealing how the digital age has reshaped the way people collect, process, and share information. Ian, a purist at heart, appreciates the time-honored credibility and professionalism of the more traditional media outlets. He enjoys the tactile experience of holding a newspaper or a magazine, appreciating the smell of the ink and the feel of the paper between his fingers. To Ian, being well-informed means diving deep into thoroughly researched and fact-checked articles, editorials, and opinion pieces that have undergone rigorous editorial reviews. Even when watching television or listening to radio, Ian ensures that he follows reputable news sources and adheres to a balanced array of channels providing unbiased narratives. Unlike Ian, Kyle prefers the immediacy and interactive nature of blogs. He embraces a variety of topics, including culture, technology, politics, and even fashion, and appreciates the uniquely personal voices that bloggers bring to the table. Kyle believes that these voices often offer an unfiltered glimpse into issues that may otherwise be overlooked by mainstream media. Furthermore, he enjoys the convenience that blogs offer, allowing him to explore new perspectives, engage with like-minded individuals in the comments section, and tailor his online newsfeed according to his interests. Despite their differing preferences in obtaining information, both Ian and Kyle derive valuable insights from their respective sources. Ian's more traditional approach to media consumption provides him with a comprehensive foundation of knowledge, ensuring that his opinions are rooted in well-researched facts. Meanwhile, Kyle's affinity for blogs enables him to stay informed on the cutting-edge developments and niche topics that might not be extensively covered by mainstream sources. Over time, Ian and Kyle have influenced each other in subtle yet meaningful ways. Ian, having observed Kyle's enthusiasm for blogs, has become more open to exploring alternative information sources online, seeing the value of incorporating diverse voices and fresh perspectives into his knowledge base. He even began to occasionally read articles on online news sites, realizing that online media can also offer high-quality journalism that supplements traditional news sources. Conversely, Kyle has started to appreciate the merit of more traditional media forms, recognizing the importance of fact-checked information and careful editorial oversight. He now incorporates insightful long-form articles from respected newspapers and magazines into his daily reading routine. He still prefers blogs for the most part but respects Ian's perspective and sees the value of having a balanced blend of information sources. Ultimately, Ian and Kyle's friendship demonstrates that although traditional media and blogs each possess their distinct advantages, it is through embracing both forms of media that one can form a well-rounded understanding of the world. By learning from each other and being open to alternative perspectives, Ian and Kyle are better able to engage in informed discussions and navigate the complex landscapes of today's information age together."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He took two objects, object A and object B, to his physics professor. Object A had higher temperature, but object B had lower temperature. His physics professor explained him why one object's temperature was higher while other object's temperature was lower.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would particles move slower or faster in object A than in object B? Answer:","output":"Particles would move faster in object A than in object B. The difference in particle movement is due to the difference in the temperature of the two objects. To better understand the concept of temperature and its relationship to particle movement, let us explore the science behind it. Temperature is fundamentally a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in a substance. Kinetic energy, in turn, is the energy possessed by an object due to its motion. In the context of temperature, this motion refers to the vibration, rotation, and translation of individual particles (such as atoms and molecules) within the substance. When an object is heated, its particles gain energy, causing them to move faster and more vigorously. Consequently, the temperature of the object increases. In contrast, cooling an object involves the removal of heat, which results in a decrease in the kinetic energy of its particles. As the particles lose energy, their motion becomes slower and less intense, and the object's temperature decreases. From the information given in the paragraph, we know that object A has a higher temperature than object B. This higher temperature indicates that the particles in object A possess greater average kinetic energy when compared to those in object B. Therefore, the particles in object A move faster and with more energy than their counterparts in object B. It is important to note that temperature can be influenced by factors such as external heat sources, the material of the object, and the ambient environment, among others. The exchange of heat between objects can also lead to changes in temperature, for example through processes such as conduction, convection, and radiation. In conclusion, particles in object A, with its higher temperature, would move faster than particles in object B, which has a lower temperature. This difference in particle velocity is a result of the differing kinetic energies conferred by the varying temperatures of the two objects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Mit der Unterzeichnung der Römischen Verträge im März 1957 wurde die Europäische Wirtschaftsgemeinschaft gegründet (EWG): der gemeinsame Markt umfasst die 6 Länder Belgien, die Niederlande, Luxemburg, Frankreich, Deutschland und Italien. Translate to English","output":"With the signing of the Treaty of Rome in March 1957, the European Economic Community (EEC) was founded: the common market comprises the 6 countries Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy. The Treaty of Rome, signed by representatives of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy, essentially marked the birth of the European Economic Community (EEC), which later evolved into the European Union (EU) that exists today. The treaty aimed to create a unified economic community that would promote the economic development of its member states, enhance trade relations, and eventually reduce barriers to the free movement of goods, services, capital and labor. The six founding countries, often referred to as the \\"Inner Six,\\" had already begun working together to develop a multilateral cooperation in the aftermath of World War II as a means to rebuild their economies and strengthen relations among them. The European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC), established in 1951, was an early example of this cooperation, laying the foundation for the creation of the EEC. The EEC's main focus was to establish a single market that would promote economic growth and development by facilitating the free movement of goods and services, allowing the member countries to benefit from economies of scale, increased competition and improved innovation. To accomplish this, the treaty outlined a series of measures that would gradually eliminate customs duties, harmonize trade policies and regulations, and establish common institutions to address economic and social concerns. One key aspect of the EEC was the establishment of common policies in areas such as agriculture, transport and trade. The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), for example, aimed to ensure a steady supply of food at stable prices while also providing a decent standard of living for farmers. The transport policy was established to connect the member countries and ensure the free flow of goods, while the common trade policy facilitated access to external markets through uniform negotiation. Moreover, the treaty also laid the groundwork for the freedom of movement of persons, services, and capital within the EEC. The aim was to encourage worker mobility and create a dynamic labor market where the member states' workforce could move easily to regions with better economic opportunities. In addition to these core principles, the treaty also emphasized the importance of maintaining a high level of social and economic cohesion within the community. This included provisions for a Social Fund to support the development of economically disadvantaged regions and a European Investment Bank (EIB) to finance large-scale infrastructure projects that would bring long-term benefits to the community. Over time, the EEC expanded its membership and evolved into the European Union, building on the foundations set by the Treaty of Rome. Today, the EU has 27 member countries (following the United Kingdom's exit in 2020) and continues to promote economic cooperation, peaceful relations, and the harmonization of laws and standards among its members. In summary, the signing of the Treaty of Rome in March 1957 marked the establishment of the European Economic Community, initially composed of Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, France, Germany, and Italy. The EEC was created as a vehicle to promote economic growth, enhance trade relations, reduce barriers, and strengthen the foundations for the future European Union."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we conclude that \\"Billy is so short.\\" if the statement \\"John couldn't see the stage with Billy in front of him because he is so short.\\" is true?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"Billy is so short\\" from the given statement. The reasons are as follows: 1. Understanding the Statement: The statement says \\"John couldn't see the stage with Billy in front of him because he is so short.\\" This means that John's view to the stage was obstructed by Billy, and the reason was due to someone being short. 2. Identifying Ambiguity: The statement doesn't specify who \\"he\\" is in \\"he is so short.\\" It could refer to Billy or John. English grammar typically would associate \\"he\\" with the most recently mentioned male, which would be Billy. However, the practical consequence of the situation, (John can't see past Billy) is because John is short, not Billy. 3. Final Analysis: Therefore, from the statement, we can only infer either John is so short that he couldn't see the stage with Billy in front of him, or Billy is so tall that John couldn't see the stage past him. We do not have enough information to conclusively state that Billy is short.

Summarize this article: A committee will look at the government's welfare changes and unemployment policies to see if they \\"disproportionately affect\\" the rights of disadvantaged and vulnerable people. The review, part of a regular cycle of examinations, will be the first undertaken since 2009. The findings will be published next June. As part of the examination of government policies, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (CESCR) has requested further information on more than 30 issues. The committee will examine whether measures have targeted certain groups such as disabled people, ethnic minorities or those on low incomes. A UN spokeswoman said the CESCR would review the UK and six other countries. \\"It is not an investigation or inquiry launched in response to a particular situation or at the request of a third party,\\" she added. The review is being carried out because the UK signed up to the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. Areas under examination will include: Earlier this month members of the Just Fair coalition, which campaigns for \\"social justice in the UK\\", met CESCR representatives. Just Fair members said they were concerned government policies had \\"led to violations of the right to food, housing, adequate healthcare for migrants and people with mental health problems and the economic and social rights of disabled people\\". Just Fair chairman Jamie Burton said the UN review was \\"timely and welcome\\". \\"We and many others are concerned about the adverse impact austerity policies have had on the least well off and already marginalised in society, including those in work,\\" he said. \\"In the one of the richest countries in the world people do not have enough food to eat or decent housing to live in. \\"Worst of all, the measures have hit children, single mothers and people with disabilities the hardest. As the tax credits scandal shows, the public is turning against these policies precisely because they are so unfair.\\" The government is aiming to cut annual welfare spending by Â£12bn, in line with a Conservative manifesto pledge. A government spokesman said: \\"This is not an investigation but a routine request for information that occurs every few years as part of the periodic reporting process to the UN. \\"We are committed to protecting the most vulnerable in society. The UK government continues to support millions of people on benefits with an Â£80bn working-age welfare safety net in place.\\" The UN review is separate from an ongoing investigation by the UN's Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which is looking at whether the government's disability benefit reforms breached the rights of disabled people.","output":"So imagine there is a very important group of people, like school teachers, who want to make sure that everyone is treated right.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to conclude that \\"A brown dog playing in mud.\\" if \\"A white dog emerges clean from her bath.\\"?","output":"Based on the given information, it is not possible to directly conclude that \\"A brown dog is playing in mud\\" when we only know that \\"A white dog emerges clean from her bath.\\" These two statements appear unrelated at first glance, and to draw a conclusion that connects the two would require additional information and context. Nevertheless, we can consider different scenarios that might connect these sentences. If we were to hypothesize upon these two scenarios, we could do so from different angles, such as the following: 1. Spatial and temporal relationship: If both the white dog and the brown dog are in the same place, such as a park, and observed simultaneously, the two dogs could be engaged in different activities. In this case, we could infer that while the white dog is enjoying her clean bath, the brown dog is playing in the mud. 2. Contrasting behaviors: The two dogs may belong to the same owner or might be part of a story where the author wants to emphasize the contrasting behaviors of the dogs. Thus, while the white dog is careful and clean during her bath, the brown dog shows playful tendencies and gets dirty in the mud. 3. Consequence or cause: One statement could be a cause or consequence of the other. For example, perhaps the owner of the white dog had just finished cleaning her because she was also playing in the mud like the brown dog. This could lead to a comparison between the two dogs, which might demonstrate the need for a bath after rolling around in the mud or be used to describe how different dogs interact with their environment. Even though the above scenarios consider potential connections between the two statements, none of the explanations conclusively prove that \\"A brown dog is playing in mud\\" if \\"A white dog emerges clean from her bath\\" without more context or additional information.

Krajisnik lived in a world where people from different places lived together. Some of these people were called Serbs. One day, some Serbs got into trouble and were taken away by some other people. They were kept in a place where they couldn't go back to their homes and families. Krajisnik felt really sad for the Serbs and decided to do something about it. He thought that keeping people away from their families was not a good thing. So, Krajisnik decided to tell everyone how he felt and ask them to let the Serbs go back to their homes. Krajisnik gathered people from different places and told them about the Serbs who were taken away. He said, \\"These people belong to families just like us. They should be allowed to go back home.\\" He demanded that the Serbs be released so they could go back to their loved ones. While some people agreed with Krajisnik, others were not sure. But Krajisnik kept on talking, hoping that everyone would understand his message and help the Serbs find their way back home.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Generate a 2-star review (1 being lowest and 5 being highest) about an app with package net.androgames.level. The answer is:","output":"I've been using an application with the package net.androgames.level for several weeks now and must say it has not quite lived up to my expectations, leading me to give it a rating of two stars out of five. At first glance, the app's concept seemed to be very compelling and exactly what I had in mind when I downloaded it. The user interface was neat, crisp, and professional - which looked promising and reassured me about my decision to try this app. The application seemed simple to use and had some nice graphics, making it visually appealing right from the start. However, once I immersed myself in the application and its functions, the first issues started to arise. The main problem was its poor performance. I frequently experienced crashes, and on some occasions, the app would freeze. This had a significant impact on the overall user experience. Furthermore, despite my device's high performance, the app demonstrated a worrying level of slowness that rendered many of its functions almost unusable. Loading times were lengthy which, in my experience, is not a common occurrence on my device. This indicates to me that the issue lies with the app itself rather than my device. In terms of functionality, it was not on par with the description and the reviews I had read beforehand. I encountered numerous bugs, such as inaccurate positioning, misinterpretation of the angle, and incorrect measurements. This could lead to problems if people were to use it for accurate measurements that they would be using for work or home improvement projects. Moreover, despite the professional look of the app, the user interface was not as intuitive as I hoped. Navigation was convoluted, and menus were not readily accessible. I found myself spending an inordinate amount of time trying to figure out how certain functionalities work. Furthermore, ads were invasive, popping up too often, disrupting the user experience, and sometimes even causing the app to crash. A clear compromise on user experience to serve ads is not optimal and comes off as a desperate revenue-raising model. The customer service was also somewhat lackluster. I reached out for support regarding the issues I was facing, but their responses were delayed and not very helpful. All in all, for an app of this kind, I was highly disappointed. The issues I've faced, when weighed against the good points, significantly overshadow its potential. In its current state, the app just presents too many obstacles to provide the seamless, user-friendly experience one would expect. It needs many improvements, and until they are addressed, I can't rate it higher than two stars. The design, while arguably presentable, cannot redeem the functional flaws embodied in the application. My hope is for the developers to address these issues promptly and make the necessary improvements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The rectangular narthex constitutes the middle part of the building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as the lobby of the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked by a couple of high circular turrets. Mavrodinov likens the narthex of the Round Church to similar structures in the churches of Mount Athos, because of its depth.Together with the north and south wall, the entrance of the narthex effectively isolates two smaller parts of the atrium, similar in plan and accessible through doors. The north part includes a small necropolis, while the south part was probably a baptistery, as it features a square installation with a clay pipe that resembles a baptismal font. However, Nikolova considers its shape much too unusual and its depth unsuitable for baptism, and believes it may instead have been designed as a vessel for dispensing holy water.Measuring 5 m × 9.50 m (16.4 ft × 31.2 ft), the narthex is the part of the Round Church which has survived in best shape, as some of its walls reach 3 m (9.8 ft). Its two turrets have a diameter of 3.20 m (10.5 ft); each has an entrance facing the interior of the narthex and three windows. The higher reaches of the towers were reached via spiral stairways, archaeological remains of which have been unearthed in the north turret. There are two pairs of columns inside the narthex, supporting its second floor, which is accessible from the north tower. The columns divide the narthex into three naves and mark the way from the narthex entrance to the gates of the rotunda.

Travis are a Scottish rock band formed in Glasgow in 1990, composed of Fran Healy (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Dougie Payne (bass guitar, backing vocals), Andy Dunlop (lead guitar, banjo, backing vocals) and Neil Primrose (drums, percussion). The band's name comes from the Harry Dean Stanton character Travis Henderson from the film Paris, Texas. The band is widely claimed by the media as having paved the way for other bands such as Keane and Coldplay to go onto achieve worldwide success throughout the 2000s, particularly through the band's The Man Who (1999) album. The band released their debut album, Good Feeling (1997) to moderate success where it debuted at number nine on the UK Albums Chart and went onto achieve a silver certification from the BPI in January 2000. In 2002, however, things came to a halt for Travis, with the band almost calling it quits, after drummer Neil Primrose went head-first into a shallow swimming pool while on tour in France, just after a concert at Eurockeennes festival. Breaking his neck, he almost died due to spinal damage. If not for his road crew, he also would have drowned. Despite the severity of the accident, Primrose has since made a full recovery.  With Primrose having recovered, Travis regrouped and re-evaluated. Moving into a cottage in Crear, Argyll and Bute, they set up a small studio, and over two weeks, came up with nine new songs that would form the basis of their fourth studio album, 2003's 12 Memories. Produced by Travis themselves, Tchad Blake, and Steve Orchard, the album marked a move into more organic, moody and political territory for the band. Although this seems to have alienated some fans, the album generally received very positive reviews (for example, \\"Then, of course, there's Travis and their album 12 Memories [Epic]. You just have to sit there and listen to it all the way through, and it will take you on a real journey. It's like an old album. It's like the Beatles' Revolver [1966]. Fran Healy's voice and lyrics are mesmerizing and beautiful\\"--Elton John), singles such as \\"Re-Offender\\" did very well on the UK chart, and the album itself reached No. 3. Yet it also saw them lose ground in the U.S., where Coldplay had usurped Travis during their 2002 absence. Much later, Fran Healy spoke about the album as a whole being about him working through his own clinical depression, and the 12 memories being 12 reasons for him reaching his depressed state. At the time this wasn't mentioned, but the revelation that Healy was depressed ties in with the band's decision to take longer writing and releasing their next work.  In 2004, Travis embarked on a highly successful tour of Canada, the US, and Europe (supported by Keane in the UK), and on November 2004, the band released a successful compilation of their singles, Singles, as well as the new tracks, \\"Walking in the Sun\\" and \\"The Distance\\" (written by Dougie Payne). This was followed by a series of small, intimate gigs at UK venues such as Liverpool's Cavern Club, London's Mean Fiddler, and Glasgow's Barrowlands. While on tour, the band also made a series of impromptu acoustic \\"busks\\", raising money for the charity The Big Issue. In addition to other performances, they also headlined the 2005 Isle of Wight Festival and T in the Park.  On 2 July 2005, Travis performed at Live 8's London concert, and four days later, at the Edinburgh 50,000 - The Final Push concert. Travis also participated in Band Aid 20's re-recording of \\"Do They Know It's Christmas?\\"--Healy and friend Nigel Godrich playing leading roles in its organisation. Healy is a part of the Make Poverty History movement, having recently made two trips to Sudan with the Save the Children organisation. On 13 July 2006, the members of Travis stuck a giant post-it sticker on the front door of the Downing Street home of British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. It read: \\"Tony Blair--Some steps forward, much to do at the G8, make poverty history.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What caused Primrose's accident?","output":"Primrose's accident was caused by him going head-first into a shallow swimming pool while on tour in France, just after a concert at Eurockeennes festival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes?\\" is \\"pollen\\", given that  mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes? A:","output":"No, I don't think that \\"pollen\\" is the right answer to the question \\"what is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes?\\" given that mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. To answer this question more accurately, we should explore the differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes, and discuss some key features that make eukaryotes more complex. Eukaryotes and prokaryotes are two distinct categories of organisms, with the main difference between them being the presence or absence of a distinct nucleus in their cells. Eukaryotic cells, found in animals, plants, fungi, and protists, have a nucleus enclosed by a nuclear membrane that houses the DNA. On the other hand, prokaryotic cells, found in bacteria and archaea, lack a distinct nucleus, and their DNA is contained within a nucleoid region. In light of the distinction mentioned above, several aspects of eukaryotes make them more complex than prokaryotes: 1. Mitosis: As you rightly pointed out, mitosis is more complex in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. Eukaryotic cells divide through a controlled process involving multiple phases such as prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis. Prokaryotes divide by binary fission, which is a simpler process where the DNA replication and segregation of the cellular contents occur simultaneously. 2. Compartmentalization: Eukaryotic cells have various membrane-bound organelles, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts (in plants), and lysosomes that compartmentalize the cell and participate in specific cellular functions. Prokaryotic cells, however, do not possess these membrane-bound organelles, and their metabolic processes occur within the cytoplasm or on the plasma membrane. 3. Genetic material: Eukaryotes possess linear DNA molecules with histone proteins to form chromatin, which can be further organized into chromosomes within the nucleus. They also have more genes than prokaryotes due to introns, which are non-coding sequences that allow for alternative splicing and gene expression regulation. In contrast, prokaryotes have circular DNA molecules and lack introns, encompassing a more compact genome. 4. Cytoplasmic organization: The eukaryotic cytoplasm exhibits a complex organization, including a cytoskeleton composed of actin filaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments that help maintain the cell's shape and facilitate intracellular transport. The prokaryotic cytoplasm lacks this level of organization and contains only a few homologous proteins to those found in eukaryotes. 5. Gene expression and regulation: Eukaryotic cells have more sophisticated mechanisms for gene expression regulation, such as transcription factors, chromatin remodeling, RNA splicing, and epigenetic modifications. Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, primarily regulate gene expression at the level of transcription initiation through the use of operons, which are simpler in comparison. In summary, several aspects make eukaryotes more complex than prokaryotes, such as mitosis, compartmentalization, genetic material organization, cytoplasmic organization, and gene expression regulation. Pollen, which is a structure found in seed plants, does not appropriately address the complexity differences between eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Instead, the mentioned aspects better explain the complexity found in eukaryotic cells compared to prokaryotic cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine. In fact, I’d have them draw one on the first day of school and one toward the end of the year and to see the change over time was always so interesting. At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about. The visuals also help English Language Learners (if you’re teaching in an English speaking classroom.) and build vocabulary for all students. After this story is over the author probably:  A. Will continue to do self portraits in the classes they teach.  B. Will teach more English Language Learners  C. Will stop showing student how to and just let them figure it out.  D. not enough information The answer to this question is:","output":"A. Will continue to do self portraits in the classes they teach. The author of this passage demonstrates a clear understanding of the educational value of self-portraits and has experience incorporating them into their lessons for students of various ages. They provide a detailed lesson plan for teaching young children how to create self-portraits and emphasize the importance of modeling the process and providing visual cues for students, particularly those who are English Language Learners. Based on this information, it can be inferred that the author will continue to incorporate self-portraits into their teaching practices, as they see it as a valuable tool for developing students' self-awareness, spatial awareness, and vocabulary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: ZURICH has leapfrogged ahead of Tokyo in the league table of the world’s most expensive cities after the Swiss franc’s sharp rise and its allure as a safe-haven currency for investors sent the cost of living soaring.      The Swiss city, which is now almost 50 per cent more expensive than London, has jumped from fifth place, while Geneva rose six places into joint third alongside Japanese city Osaka, according to the Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit.      The survey of 130 cities worldwide showed that despite Eurozone troubles, German and French cities have stayed relatively expensive with Paris and Frankfurt holding firm in the league table in sixth and tenth place.      Even though inflation levels passed five per cent last year, a weaker pound meant London actually fell slightly in the ranking from 15th to 17th place.      The Norwegian capital, Oslo, which was ranked the world’s most expensive city only a few years ago, dropped two places to fifth place.      Strong currency shifts have also propelled five Australian cities into the top 20, led by Sydney and Melbourne in seventh and eighth places.      “Exchange rates have been the greatest influence for the Australian cost of living, with the Australian dollar seeing its value to the US dollar double in a decade,” survey editor Jon Copestake said in the statement.      Meanwhile Asian cities moved up the ranking, with Singapore gaining one place to ninth spot and Seoul climbing nine places to 27th, highlighting a shift away from the traditionally more expensive Western Europe hubs.      Cities from the Asia Pacific region have continued to boom and now make up half of the top ten, but Western Europe still accounts for 24 of the most expensive cities in the top 50, with 14 hailing from Asia.      Asia was also home to some of the cheapest cities. Three of the four cheapest were in the Indian subcontinent. These included New Delhi and Mumbai in India, and Karachi in Pakistan, which was the cheapest of cities surveyed.      The bi-annual survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit compares more than 400 individual prices across 160 products and services such as food, transport, housing, utilities and private schools.      For example, the price of a loaf of bread has more than doubled in London in ten years, with the cost of a bottle of wine rising by 50 per cent. Taxes have also played a part, with petrol pump prices up by over 75 per cent and cigarette prices by almost 60 per cent.      “Over time we have seen the price of commodity driven groceries like bread and petrol rise substantially. However, less essential items have actually been falling in price recently, after rising during better economic times,” Copestake said.      Canada’s Vancouver has overtaken all US cities to become the most expensive in North America, ranked 37th.      Los Angeles was the most expensive US city -- equal 42nd with Shanghai -- while New York was 47th. ||||| The cost of living across the globe      ZURICH has become the world's most expensive city to live in, according to the latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey from the Economist Intelligence Unit, our sister company. The strengthening of the Swiss franc in the past year helped lift the city four places up the table to displace Tokyo at the top. The index measures the cost of an expatriate lifestyle in over 130 cities using a weighted average of the prices of 160 products and services. New York's figure is set to 100 to provide a base for comparisons. The relative strengths of currencies and economies are reflected in changes to the rankings. Thus Sydney has moved from 71st to 7th since 2001, while New York has fallen from 7th to joint 47th. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"The latest Worldwide Cost of Living Survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit has ranked Zurich as the world's most expensive city.

Despite the Eurozone crisis, Paris and Frankfurt maintained their positions at sixth and tenth respectively. Strong currency shifts in Australia pushed five of its cities into the top 20, led by Sydney and Melbourne at seventh and eighth spots.

Question: Question: \\"The central market is a type of?\\"  Context: \\"Louis-Philippe was overthrown by a popular uprising in the streets of Paris in 1848. His successor, Napoleon III, and the newly appointed prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, launched a gigantic public works project to build wide new boulevards, a new opera house, a central market, new aqueducts, sewers, and parks, including the Bois de Boulogne and Bois de Vincennes. In 1860, Napoleon III also annexed the surrounding towns and created eight new arrondissements, expanding Paris to its current limits.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context provided, the central market refers to a large, public marketplace or trading center that is established within a city for the purpose of buying, selling, and exchanging various goods and services. These markets often serve as a hub for local commerce where vendors and merchants gather to offer a wide range of products, including fresh produce, meats, fish, spices, textiles, and other merchandise to the public. In the case of Paris during the time of Napoleon III and Georges-Eugène Haussmann, the central market that was constructed was known as \\"Les Halles.\\" Les Halles was designed as a massive iron and glass structure, which housed a sprawling market aimed at modernizing Paris and providing a more organized and efficient space for commercial activities. It was a significant part of Haussmann's urban planning vision for Paris, which aimed at transforming the city's narrow streets and outdated infrastructure into a more modern and functional urban environment. Les Halles was eventually demolished in 1971 to make way for the construction of the modern shopping center known as \\"Forum des Halles,\\" which still serves as a commercial hub for the city today. However, the legacy of the central market concept remains an important aspect of urban planning and commerce in many cities around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If you fall into one of these categories, there’s no getting around pre-lightening with bleach before going lighter. If you have virgin hair, you can usually go a few shades lighter with a high-lift boxed dye. Going from dark brown hair to blonde with hair dye alone is probably unrealistic, but you can definitely lighten up virgin hair without bleach.  For example, if you have light brown hair that’s never been dyed, you can dye it blonde without using bleach. If you have dark brown virgin hair, you can dye it light brown or red without using bleach. Buy the dye that depicts the hair color you want to achieve on the box; you don't need to amend anything to account for darker hair as long as it's virgin. If you have red, light brown, or medium brown hair, use vol 20 developer. If you have black or dark brown hair, use vol 30 developer. If you aren’t sure, err on the side of caution and get the lower vol 20 developer. You can always bleach again if you need to! Avoid vol 40 developer, which is the strongest developer available. It’s too harsh to use all over your head and is typically used by professional stylists or for highlighting small sections of hair. Bleach can irritate and even burn your scalp, but the natural oils that build up when you don’t wash it can add a layer of protection. At minimum, avoid washing for 48 hours before bleaching. You may also want to do several conditioning masks in the 2 weeks prior to bleaching to minimize damage and breakage. Go with intensely hydrating masks and conditioners with nourishing ingredients like shea butter and Argan oil. Part your hair down the center, vertically, from the crown to the nape of your neck. Then divide those sections in half, horizontally, from ear to ear. Clip each section in place on top of your head with a plastic hair clip.  Don't use metal clips when you're bleaching your hair. Dividing your hair into 4 manageable quadrants makes the bleaching process easier and helps to ensure the color is stripped evenly. Your bleach kit will contain both powder and developer, as well as an applicator and pair of plastic gloves. Put on the gloves and an old-t-shirt before you start mixing. Then, measure and pour both ingredients into a bowl. Mix them together until they’re thoroughly incorporated.  Make sure you follow the mixing directions on the packaging. You may need to combine them in a ratio of 1:1 or 1:2. Use the bleach immediately after mixing it. At this point, drape a towel around your shoulders to protect your skin during the process. You can also add a swipe of petroleum jelly along your hairline to protect the skin around your forehead and face. Start with the bottom sections before moving on to the top ones. As you work, separate each section into several smaller sections. Remove the clip to release the first section of hair, section it, and use the applicator brush that came with your kit to apply the bleach mixture onto each section from root to tip. Get as close to the roots as possible without touching your scalp.  Once the section is saturated with the mixture, clip it back up and out of the way. Work as quickly as you can, since the bleach mixture loses strength the longer it sits out. The bleach will still work if you let it sit out for a few hours, but it will take longer to process your hair and generally be less effective. Dividing your hair into smaller sections will help you evenly apply the bleach. If your hair is thick, it's especially important that you make many small sections. Unclip the next section and apply the bleach mixture from root to tip. Clip it back up and continue the same process until all 4 sections are thoroughly saturated. Try to apply the bleach in thin layers to small areas at a time so that all of your hair gets coated evenly. Check the bleach kit packaging for instructions about timing. In general, the darker your hair is, the longer the bleach mixture should sit on your hair. 30 to 45 minutes is pretty typical.  You can put a clear, plastic cap over your hair while it processes. This helps control the bleach so it's less messy. Also, the cap traps in your head's natural heat. Be sure to check your progress every 5 to 10 minutes to avoid over-processing your hair. Never leave bleach on your hair for longer than 1 hour. The cold water stops the bleach from processing your hair, so try to rinse quickly and thoroughly for even results. Follow the rinse up by shampooing your hair twice in a row, rinsing thoroughly with cold water in between, to make sure you remove all of the bleach.

Muffin, who was just six-weeks-old when Loren Slama rescued him, was taken to Downey Animal Shelter after being found wandering the streets of Los Angeles last week. After taking Muffin home from the shelter for routine medical microchip implantation, Slama made the horrifying realization that something went very wrong. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Suffering: Muffin is just six-weeks-old and left paralyzed after a botched routine surgery last week. Hope: Thanks to funding from generous donors, Muffin has enough money to undergo a life-threatening surgery today to remove the chip that left her paralyzed and dragging her tiny body across the floor. The chip: The microchip, an implant used to help identify pets, was meant to go just below the surface of the skin but ended up being lodged in her spine. Microchips are  are radio-frequency identification (RFID) implants that provide permanent ID for a pet, reports Petfinder.com. They are meant to be implanted just below the surface of the skin and are not normally painful or invasive. They give each pet a personal identification number and even medical histry in the case that the pet is lost. Chip implantation is often a required surgery for rescue pets and usually have little to no complications. Slama said that as soon as she took Muffin home, his adorable little face started to dangle then crash towards the floor all together. She decided to get to the bottom of what was ailing her new pet after leaving the vet. An X-ray showed that a microchip that doctors implanted as part of the routine process had gotten lodged into the kitten's spine., reportsCBS. Now the six-week-old Muffin has to drag its entire left side when it moves. Loved: Loren Slama rescued six-week-old Muffin from the harsh streets of Los Angeles last week and wants her to be healthy and happy in her caring home. Immobilized: Muffin can barely move and when she does, she must drag the left side of her body on the floor. Horrified: Owner Loren Slama says that thanks to generous donors, Muffin might have a chance at recovery after a life-threatening surgery today to remove the chip. X-ray: X-rays show that the chip went right through Muffin's spinal cord causing debilitating paralysis. 'I noticed after 30 minutes his head started to dangle and it started to kind of crash. On the X-ray it was clearly demonstrated that the microchip was inserted all the way into the spine. That’s why he was paralyzed,' Slama said. 'I was in a total state of shock,' Slama added. Muffin has a surgery scheduled for Today at the Angels Veterinary Specialty Center where a neurologist will attempt to remove the chip. The surgery is very risky and Muffin might die during  or shortly after but Slama has no choice if she wants Muffin to have a chance at surviving free of pain. Slama asked Downey Animal Control to pay for the surgery since it was their doctor who implanted a microchip but they declined. 'It’s a highly risky procedure. He might die during the surgery and even a few days after the surgery. However, we need to do the surgery because the longer the microchip stays into the spine the more damage it can cause,' Slama said. Catastrophe: Muffin was left paralyzed but if he survives today's surgery he may have a change at a normal life. The proof: Animal Control is investigating what may have went wrong during the surgery that left a poor kitten paralyzed with a microchip implanted in his spine. Hopeful: Today's surgery to remove the chip could help Muffin lead a more normal life after becoming paralyzed. The Los Angeles Department of Animal Control and Care released a statement about their reasoning for not funding the surgery. 'This was an anomaly. We acted in accordance with the manufacturer’s guidelines in terms of whether the kitten should be micro chipped for its age and size. 'We have never had an incident like this before. However, we are conducting an investigation and determining whether or not any corrections need to be made,' they said. Despite Los Angeles Animal Control's lack of funding, Slama was able to raise money through caring donors on Youcaring.com. They reached over their 5,000 goal. 'Dear Supporters and Animal Lovers,. WE HAVE REACHED OUR GOAL!!!!! We have left the fund raiser open, since once it is closed, we will be unable to update all of Muffin's friends. NO NEED TO DONATE MORE! We are overwhelmed by your generosity. Because of you, Muffin will get the finest care with the best surgical team. Please keep Muffin in your thoughts and prayers that he survives the surgery, and lives a long, healthy kitty life. THANK YOU from the bottom of every rescuer's heart,' says the site. Loren Slama promises to keep supporters updated on Muffin's recovery. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A six-week-old rescue kitten named Muffin was left paralyzed after undergoing a routine microchip implantation surgery in Los Angeles. The microchip got lodged in the kitten's spine, causing paralysis and requiring Muffin to drag its entire left side when moving.

Choices: (I) description; (II) entity; (III) abbreviation; (IV) human; (V) numeric; (VI) location;","output":"The answer to the question, \\"What are hookworms?\\" is an entity and can also be described as a description (I and II in the given choices). Hookworms are parasitic worms that belong to the phylum Nematoda, also known as roundworms, and specifically to the family Ancylostomatidae. These worms are predominantly found in the small intestine of humans and animals, usually in warmer and more tropical regions. Hookworms are characterized by their mouthparts, which resemble hooks, enabling them to attach to the intestinal walls of their host. They feed on the host's blood, causing hookworm disease or ancylostomiasis. In humans, there are two primary species of hookworms responsible for causing infections: Necator americanus and Ancylostoma duodenale. Infections typically occur when an individual comes into contact with contaminated soil or feces harboring hookworm larvae. The larvae penetrate the skin and make their way into the circulatory system, eventually reaching the lungs. They then travel up the trachea and are swallowed, thus reaching the small intestine, where they mature into adults and begin to lay eggs. The eggs are excreted through the host's feces, making their way back into the environment and restarting the life cycle. Some common ways for human hookworm infection include walking barefoot on contaminated soil or consuming food contaminated with the larvae. Hookworm infection in humans can lead to a wide range of symptoms, such as anemia, lethargy, and stomach pain, and can also cause developmental and cognitive issues in children. In summary, hookworms are parasitic worms that cause infections in both humans and animals, primarily in warmer and tropical regions. The answer to this question is both an entity as they refer to a specific type of parasitic worms, and a description since the term \\"hookworm\\" provides information about the characteristics and nature of these parasites."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Passage:Al-Maqrīzī was born in Fatimid Cairo and spent most of his life in Egypt, When he presents himself in his books he usually stops at the 10th forefather although he confessed to some of his close friends that he can trace his ancestry to Al-Mu‘izz li-Dīn Allāh -first Fatimid caliph in Egypt and the founder of al-Qahirah- and even to Ali ibn Abi Talib. He was trained in the Hanafite school of law. Later, he switched to the Shafi'ite school and finally to the Zahirite school. Maqrizi studied theology under one of the primary masterminds behind the Zahiri Revolt, and his vocal support and sympathy with that revolt against the Mamluks likely cost him higher administrative and clerical positions with the Mamluk regime. The name Maqrizi was an attribution to a quarter of the city of Baalbek, from where his paternal grandparents hailed. Maqrizi confessed to his contemporaries that he believed that he was related to the Fatimids through the son of al-Muizz. Ibn Hajar preserves the most memorable account: his father, as they entered the al-Hakim Mosque one day, told him \\"My son, you are entering the mosque of your ancestor.\\" However, his father also instructed al-Maqrizi not to reveal this information to anyone he could not trust; Walker concludes:  Links: a. Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani b. Al-Hakim Mosque c. Zahiri Revolt d. Zahiri Revolt Student:","output":"To solve this task, we need to find the year of the revolt that was masterminded by someone Maqrizi studied theology under.

Now, let me search for further information about the Zahiri Revolt to find the year it took place. After searching for more information on the Zahiri Revolt, I found that it occurred in 1309.

Write highlights for this article: By. Sarah Griffiths. A toddler born with a rare joint condition is able to walk for the first time after wearing 'concrete trousers'. Harrison Hobson had to wear an unusual double leg cast to fix a condition that caused one of his hips to be permanently dislocated. For the first six months of his life, the baby’s legs had to be kept in an awkward shape in a harness, before being encased in the ‘concrete trousers’. Harrison Hobson, had to wear the unusual double leg cast (pictured left) to cure his dysplasia - a condition that caused his hip to be permanently dislocated. After two operations and a long recovery, he can now run around (pictured right) like any other toddler. Doctors noticed a problem with Harrison’s hips just before his mother Charlotte Hobson, 33, was due to take him home from hospital after his birth. Medics diagnosed the newborn with dysplasia, after his hip joint failed to form properly around the top of his leg, causing his right hip to constantly dislocate. At just four days old, Harrison was placed in a full body harness that locked his hip into a fixed position. For nine out of ten dysplasis cases this is enough to solve the problem, but when Harrison’s hip failed to heal, doctors decided to operate placing his legs in a plaster cast at five weeks old. The procedure was found to have failed a week after it was performed and Harrison had a second more invasive operation and a new cast fitted. For three and a half months, Mrs Hobson had to deal with the challenge of trying to change, dress and bathe a baby stuck in the unusual cast. Doctors noticed the problem with Harrison’s hips shortly after his birth. At just four days old, he was placed in a full body harness that kept his hip locked into position, before being fitted with the cast (pictured left) He has now made a full recovery (right) Mrs Hobson (pictured with husband Jason) was at first apprehensive as to whether she and her husband Jason would be able to hold their baby with his new cast, but they were given advise from dysplasia charity Steps about how to care for their son while he was in his plaster cast. The new mother was at first apprehensive, worrying whether she and her husband Jason would be able to hold their baby with his new cast. They were advised by dysplasia charity Steps, that they should not pick him up from under his arm pits because the cast was too heavy and instead were taught a new method of carrying their son around. After Harrison’s cast came off, Mrs Hobson was worried he would take longer than other children to reach the milestones of standing and walking. But at 14 months old, Harrison took his first steps and now aged two, he is running around like any other boisterous toddler. Mrs Hobson, from Bristol, said: ‘It was such an unusual cast and it doesn’t look comfortable at all so it was heart-breaking to know that my son had to be stuck like that for so long. ‘It’s not a natural position and as a mum you just don’t want your baby to be in pain. ‘The harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle. Mrs Hobson said: 'The harness he was in for his first three months fixed him a pose like he was sitting on a saddle. Then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers (pictured). They were so big and bulky and I was worried people would laugh at him' ‘And then the cast was like a pair of concrete trousers. They were so big and bulky and I was worried people would laugh at him.’ She said her son's diagnosis came as a shock after reading ‘every single parenting book’ when she was pregnant, finding no warning about hip dysplasia. At first, doctors thought both her son's hips had fallen victim to the condition, before concluding it was just Harrison's right hip was affected. ‘Just before we were due to go home from the hospital, a doctor wiggled his hips around and told me that they were both dislocated,' she said. At 14 months old, Harrison took his first steps and now aged two, he is running around like any other boisterous toddler. ‘My husband Jason is a professional rugby. player and has seen a fair few injuries in his time so I thought it. would be just a case of clicking them back in. ‘But then they explained to me about hip dysplasia - it was a horrible sinking feeling. You could feel his hip click in and out.’ Mrs Hobson said that it was hard to imagine the cast before it was on her baby. ‘I just had all these questions about whether he was going to be in pain, whether I’d be able to keep him clean and tidy. Would I even be able to find him clothes big enough to fit over the cast? ‘But with all the help from Steps we managed to deal with the “concrete trousers” situation and people were only sympathetic when we explained what was wrong. ‘Once he finally got out of his cast it was such a feeling of relief. Now you’d never know that he’d ever had a problem.’ Tim McLachlan, CEO of Steps said: ‘Steps receives calls from parents across the UK who are upset at being asked by strangers “how did you manage to break both their legs?” referring to their toddler who is in a hip spica cast from waist to ankles. ‘Hip dysplasia is a common condition, but not common knowledge and we need to change this. ‘Developmental dysplasia of the hip affects one to three per cent of all births in the UK regardless of background - that’s up to 24,000 children per year or an entire class in an every average secondary school. ‘It’s more than the number of new diagnoses of leukaemia and skin cancer combined.’ Highlights:","output":"- Harrison Hobson, a toddler with a rare joint condition called dysplasia, was able to walk for the first time after wearing an unusual double leg cast, also known as \\"concrete trousers\\".  - Dysplasia caused Harrison's hip to be permanently dislocated due to his hip joint failing to form properly around the top of his leg.  - At four days old, Harrison was placed in a full-body harness that locked his hip into a fixed position; however, this did not resolve the issue.  - At five weeks old, Harrison underwent an operation and had his legs encased in the double leg cast.

The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

Summarize: Before you begin putting your brochure together, you'll need to know a little bit about the subject you've chosen or been assigned. Review your textbook, notes, and homework assignments to learn as much as you can. The more familiar you are with the material, the better your brochure will turn out.  Other resources, such as the encyclopedia and various educational websites, can help you dive deeper into your topic. Only use sources that have been approved by your teacher, and be sure to cite your external sources on the last page of your brochure. Think about the best way to present your topic. You might offer a general overview of a complex subject, or zoom in on one or two specific points. The best brochures display information in a simple, focused way.  If you're making a brochure on the Declaration of Independence, for example, you'd want to briefly summarize what the document says and name all of the people who signed it. Put your title front and center on the outermost panel, the one that will be visible while the brochure is folded. That way, it will be the first thing your reader sees. Beneath your title, display your full name to make it clear who created the brochure.  Try to come up with a title that's short, punchy, and easy to remember. The title of your brochure should let your reader know what to expect right away. For a brochure about climate change, you could go with a straightforward title like “Climate Change,” or think of something more attention-grabbing, such as “Climate Change: The Silent Killer.” In 3-5 sentences, give your reader a general introduction to the subject you'll be exploring in your brochure. Your introduction will set the stage for the rest of the brochure and help the reader better understand the information they're about to be given. An introduction to a geography brochure on the Maldives might say something like this: “The Maldives is a country in Asia located south of India and Sri Lanka. It is made up of a chain of 26 small islands.

Devote each panel to a single subject to prevent information on one subtopic from spilling over into the next page. Writing in short sentences or even bullet points can also make it easier for your reader to follow along.  Think about whether you want a basic single-fold brochure or a traditional tri-fold brochure. Single-fold styles tend to work best for shorter, more straightforward topics, whereas tri-fold brochures make it easier to organize lots of information in a manageable way. For a brochure about dietary nutrients, you might use a portion of each of the three interior panels to explain the role of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates.

Article:","output":"Title: Suspended Liberal Democrat Candidate Resigns, Accuses Party of Treating Him as \\"Guilty Until Proven Innocent\\" Introduction A former Liberal Democrat candidate from Newport, who was suspended by the party, has claimed that the party treated him unfairly. He alleges they treated him as \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" during an investigation into his conduct. In light of these accusations, the disgruntled candidate has officially resigned from the party, creating a significant disturbance within the local political community. Resignation and allegations The Liberal Democrat candidate in question had been suspended by the party following allegations against him. However, they did not reveal the specific nature of the charges. Despite the suspension, the candidate expressed his sadness about leaving the party and accused the Liberal Democrats of denying him a fair chance to defend himself. Step-by-step analysis of the process Upon receiving the allegations, the Liberal Democrat administration had decided to suspend the candidate temporarily, pending further investigation. The candidate claims the party disregarded the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty,' which is crucial in maintaining a fair and just system. During this investigation period, the accused candidate had hoped for an impartial review. However, he believes this never happened as the party treated him as guilty from the outset. The candidate's statement on the matter In a public statement, the resigned Liberal Democrat candidate mentioned that it is essential for political parties to provide their members with a transparent and fair investigation process. He explained how his treatment by the party had left him deeply disappointed and decided that he could no longer be a part of a party that appeared to be projecting irresponsible behavior. Impact on the local political scene The candidate's resignation and accusations against the Liberal Democrats have created a stir in Newport's political scene, raising concerns among fellow politicians and locals. His departure has also led critics to question the party's methods, demanding answers on their investigation process and policies. Some Liberal Democrat party members have expressed their solidarity with the resigned candidate, stating that they too have concerns over the party’s internal processes. Conclusion The situation in Newport signifies that political parties must ensure that fair and just processes are in place for allegations and investigations against their own members. Upholding the principle of 'innocent until proven guilty' is vital for building trust and maintaining credibility among party members and the public. To restore faith in their system, the Liberal Democrats must take this opportunity to review and potentially reform their investigative processes to ensure fairness and transparency in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While travelling by train, Schaffner decides to evade authorities. He drugs and switches identities with fellow train passenger Paul Scarff, who looks like him and has a Mexican passport. He throws Paul Scarff off the train, injuring Scarff. Carl later discovers that Scarff is wanted in Mexico as a political assassin. Carl then tracks down Scarff, who is resting from his injuries, to get back his original passport. Carl arrives in Mexico and is captured by the local police, who mistake him for Scarff. Carl then fights to show his true identity to the local police.  The plan seems foolproof until he is forced to care for the dog of Scarff's dog. The local police chief and Scotland Yard inspector Hadden conspire to keep him trapped in the Mexican border town of Katrina in an effort to get him to cross the bridge back into the U.S. and face justice. The misanthropic Schaffner has grown attached to Scarff's pet spaniel and is tricked into going across the dividing line of the bridge to get the dog.

During spring, increased rain availability provides more water for the plants, and the warmer temperatures allow roots to function more efficiently. Additionally, the longer daylight duration in spring leads to increased photosynthesis, which in turn, influences the plant's water consumption, as more water is required for maintaining proper photosynthetic rates. These factors can lead to an increased rate of water absorption by the roots, as the plant consumes more water to support its growth during the spring. Consequently, the process of water being transported through vessels in the stem to the leaves may be indirectly impacted by the spring conditions, through changes in the plant's overall water requirements and availability."},{"instruction":"I heard that Carson was away at college.

We have: 122 * r - 291 * r - 8773 = -11 * r + 125 * r First, let's add the \\"r\\" terms on each side of the equation. On the left side, combine the r terms (122*r - 291*r) together: (122 - 291) * r - 8773 = -11 * r + 125 * r Now, 122 - 291 is equal to -169. So, our equation now looks like this: -169 * r - 8773 = -11 * r + 125 * r Next, let's do the same with the right side of the equation, and combine the r terms (-11*r + 125*r): -169 * r - 8773 = (125 - 11) * r Now, 125 - 11 is equal to 114. So, our equation looks like this: -169 * r - 8773 = 114 * r Now, we want to get all the r terms on one side and the number (in this case, -8773) on the other side. So, let's add 169*r to both sides of the equation: -169 * r + 169 * r - 8773 = 114 * r + 169*r This simplifies to: -8773 = 114 * r + 169 * r Now, let's combine the r terms on the right side (114*r + 169*r): -8773 = (114 + 169) * r Now, 114 + 169 is equal to 283. So, our equation looks like this: -8773 = 283 * r Now, in order to find the value of r, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 283: -8773 / 283 = 283 * r / 283 This simplifies to: -31 = r So, the value of r is -31."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.  Question: \\"What rules exist throughout the country because of a California ban?\\" Answer: \\"Anti tanning laws\\" Is this answer correct? Select from the following. [1]. no; [2]. yes;...I think the answer is","output":"[1]. No. The answer provided above does not accurately reflect the information in the news piece. The news piece mentions that California has been a pioneer in initiating various public health policies which are later adopted by other states. Some of these significant initiatives include requiring smog check for clean air, passing anti-tobacco initiatives, bike helmets laws, and banning smoking in workplaces, bars, and restaurants. However, the statement regarding anti-tanning laws requires more context. The passage does note that teenager’s use of tanning booths has been banned in California, but it does not indicate that these rules have been adopted throughout the entirety of the country. Therefore, while \\"anti-tanning laws\\" might exist in other states following California's initiative, it's not accurate to claim that all states adhere to this rule as an absolute fact. The California ban that has been explicitly stated in the passage to have led to similar rules throughout the country is the ban on smoking in workplaces, bars, and restaurants. While others might have been acted upon, it is not explicitly stated in this passage. Therefore, a more accurate answer to the question, \\"What rules exist throughout the country because of a California ban?\\" based on the provided text would be the rules concerning smoking in workplaces, bars, and restaurants.   It is necessary when interpreting such a broad question to consider the concrete details provided within the text, and not to make assumptions beyond these details. Even while the passage does detail California's innovative nature in terms of public health initiatives, it is not to say that all of these initiatives are adopted universally across all states in the country.

Movie title: The Lookout Context: Driving with his headlights off down a country highway, to show his girlfriend, Kelly, and another couple the swarms of fireflies illuminated in the summer night, Chris Pratt crashes his convertible into a combine stalled on the road. Chris and Kelly survive, but the other two do not. Chris's injuries include brain damage that affects his short-term memory in the form similar to anterograde amnesia, along with some anger management issues.Four years later, he's in classes to learn new skills, including the simple sequencing of daily tasks to compensate for his inability to remember, and keeps notes to himself in a small notebook. Challenged by a tough case manager to build a life despite his injuries, he is emotionally supported by his roommate, a blind man named Lewis, but receives only financial support from his wealthy family. He works nights, cleaning a small-town bank, with regular visitations from Ted, a sheriff's deputy. Chris aspires to train as a teller, but the bank manager, Mr. Tuttle, can barely hide his contempt for Chris's ambitions. It is there Chris comes under the scrutiny of a gang planning to rob the bank. Their leader, Gary, who knows him from high school and resented his wealth and popularity as a hockey star before his accident, befriends him and uses a young woman, Luvlee, to seduce him. Taunted by the gang about the limitations of his life since the accident, he initially goes along with the scheme. His frustrations trickle down into confrontations with his friends, Lewis and Ted.When the gang arrives the night of the robbery, Chris tells them he has changed his mind. But they tell him it's too late and force him to empty the vault at gunpoint. His friend Ted, the deputy, stumbles into the robbery while delivering doughnuts to Chris, and triggers a shootout. The deputy and two of the gang members, Marty and Cork, are killed. Meanwhile Chris escapes in the getaway car, and when he realizes he's got the money they stole, he returns compulsively to the site of his accident, where he...

He was a right-handed batsman and a right-arm slow bowler known for his contributions in the sport during the early 1900s. Sewell's cricket career included playing for Bedfordshire, Dorset, and Cambridge University. He had the honor of playing in five first-class matches and demonstrated a fair level of skill with both bat and ball. As a batsman, he scored a total of 69 runs, while as a bowler, he took 6 wickets in the 372 deliveries that he bowled. Although Sewell did not achieve a five-wicket haul (5 wickets in a single innings) or a ten-wicket haul (10 wickets in a single match), he was certainly a valuable player for his teams. In addition to his bowling and batting abilities, Sewell was a proficient fielder, having made four catches throughout his first-class matches. However, there are no records of him making any stumpings. Despite not having extraordinary statistics, Sewell's involvement in cricket showcases the spirit of sportsmanship and love for the game in the early years of the sport. Later in his life, Frederick Sewell passed away on June 5, 1964, in Parkstone, Dorset, England.

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which of the following people was not purified: Mary, Jesus or Luke? Context: Mary's complete sinlessness and concomitant exemption from any taint from the first moment of her existence was a doctrine familiar to Greek theologians of Byzantium. Beginning with St. Gregory Nazianzen, his explanation of the \\"purification\\" of Jesus and Mary at the circumcision (Luke 2:22) prompted him to consider the primary meaning of \\"purification\\" in Christology (and by extension in Mariology) to refer to a perfectly sinless nature that manifested itself in glory in a moment of grace (e.g., Jesus at his Baptism). St. Gregory Nazianzen designated Mary as \\"prokathartheisa (prepurified).\\" Gregory likely attempted to solve the riddle of the Purification of Jesus and Mary in the Temple through considering the human natures of Jesus and Mary as equally holy and therefore both purified in this manner of grace and glory. Gregory's doctrines surrounding Mary's purification were likely related to the burgeoning commemoration of the Mother of God in and around Constantinople very close to the date of Christmas. Nazianzen's title of Mary at the Annunciation as \\"prepurified\\" was subsequently adopted by all theologians interested in his Mariology to justify the Byzantine equivalent of the Immaculate Conception. This is especially apparent in the Fathers St. Sophronios of Jerusalem and St. John Damascene, who will be treated below in this article at the section on Church Fathers. About the time of Damascene, the public celebration of the \\"Conception of St. Ann [i.e., of the Theotokos in her womb]\\" was becoming popular. After this period, the \\"purification\\" of the perfect natures of Jesus and Mary would not only mean moments of grace and glory at the Incarnation and Baptism and other public Byzantine liturgical feasts, but purification was eventually associated with the feast of Mary's very conception (along with her Presentation in the Temple as a toddler) by Orthodox authors of the 2nd millennium (e.g., St. Nicholas Cabasilas and Joseph Bryennius).

At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one.

Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Trujillo is the third most populous city in Peru, located on the northern coast, nearby the Pacific Ocean. It was founded by Spanish conquistador Diego de Almagro in 1534, and later named after Francisco Pizarro's birthplace in Spain.

The works of art have been collected by the people of France over many centuries. It is the biggest art museum in the world. The Louvre has not always been a museum. The first building was a fort. In 1190, it was the king's castle with high walls and a round tower, which had a river around it to keep out the enemies. Over the years, the number of buildings around the castle grew. By 1350, the castle no longer needed a fort. The Louvre became a palace home for French kings and queens. During times of peace, new treasures were brought in. During the days of war, many treasures were stolen, and the buildings were damaged. When Francis I became king of France in 1515, he brought in many artists from other countries. One of the artists was Lenardo da Vinci from Italy. Da Vinci's \\"Mona Lisa\\" is the best known painting in the museum today. In 1793, the Louvre became a public museum.

Anna tells Crowe that everything is second to his work, and that she believes he is truly gifted. Just then, a young man appears in their bathroom, and accuses Crowe of failing him. Crowe recognizes him as Vincent Grey, a former patient whom he treated as a child for hallucinations. Vincent shoots his former doctor before killing himself. The next fall, Crowe begins working with another patient, 9-year-old Cole Sear, whose case is similar to Vincent's. Crowe becomes dedicated to the boy, though he is haunted by doubts over his ability to help him after his failure with Vincent. Meanwhile, he and his wife seldom, if ever, speak or do anything together. Crowe feels he must help Cole in order to rectify his failure to help Vincent and reconcile with his wife. Cole's mother, Lynn, who truly loves him, worries about his social stamina, especially after seeing signs of physical abuse. Cole eventually confides his secret to Crowe: he sees ghosts, who walk around like the living unaware they are dead. At first, Crowe thinks Cole is delusional and considers dropping his case. Remembering Vincent, the psychologist listens to an audiotape from a session with Vincent when he was a child. On the tape, when Crowe leaves the room, and then returns, Vincent was crying. Turning up the volume, Crowe hears a weeping man begging for help in Spanish, and now believes that Cole is telling the truth and that Vincent may have had the same ability.

Hero sues Army over sex discrimination The disclosure that Major Siddique is seeking £650,000 compensation for the alleged loss of her career has angered many colleagues. One officer said: \\"It would be an absolute disgrace if she is awarded many hundreds of thousands of pounds when soldiers who lose arms and legs or suffer brain damage can only receive a maximum of £285,000. \\"The size of the claim, in this climate when many injured guys are getting just a fraction of the amount she is demanding, has caused a lot of upset in the Army. There is a very real sense of betrayal.\\" L/Bdr Ben Parkinson, who lost both legs in Afghanistan in 2006 when his vehicle struck a mine, will require 24-hour care for the rest of his life. So far he has received £285,000 in compensation, the maximum that can be awarded to injured troops. The SAS hostage crisis took place on September 19, 2005 following an undercover operation to identify a senior Iraqi policeman who was believed to be responsible for the murders and torture of dozens of civilians. The soldiers, who were disguised as Arabs, had their cover blown when they were spotted by plain clothes Iraqi policemen. A short gun battle broke out before the pair were captured and taken to the notorious Jamiat police station. Once the British headquarters learned that the two SAS men were being held, a team was quickly assembled to try to negotiate their release. The team was commanded by Lt Col James Woodham, who conducted the negotiations, while Major Siddique was sent along to explain the legal situation to the police chief. The team also consisted of two members of the SAS who provided \\"close protection\\". Senior officers have said that it was a dangerous mission and that there was a very real risk that the negotiating team might be taken prisoners themselves. Ultimately the negotiations failed and the SAS detainees were eventually rescued in a daring operation after they were moved from the jail into a nearby house. Warrior armoured vehicles smashed through the wall of the police station, while a force composed largely of SAS troopers stormed the house and rescued the captive soldiers. Following the rescue, riots broke out in the streets in Basra and a British serviceman was severely burned when his armoured vehicle was set on fire by protesters. The Iraqi justice minister ordered the British Army to hand over the soldiers and demanded unsuccessfully that they be put on trial for attempted murder. Lt Col Woodham won the Military Cross for the part he played in the rescue while Major Siddique received the Queen's Commendation for Valuable Service. Her citation reads: \\"Major Rabia Siddique is commended for her support to units and their soldiers in ensuring they fully understood their legal powers.\\" A spokesman for the Ministry of Defence said: \\"This case is going to employment tribunal. It is not our policy to comment on individual cases.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"A female major in the army, named Major Siddique, is asking for £650,000 because she feels she was treated unfairly in her job because she's a woman.

The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  Question: \\"Why was it easier to attack the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, than to find and seize the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda?\\" Response: \\"The CIA didn't want to put in time to track it\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?

Step 1: Combine like terms. Since both 11*c and -183*c are like terms (both have the same variable c), we can easily combine them by subtracting their coefficients. 11*c - 183*c = -172*c Now the equation looks like this: -172*c + 3332 = 8836 Step 2: Move the constant to the right-hand side. To isolate the term with the variable c, we need to move the constant 3332 to the right-hand side of the equation. To do this, subtract 3332 from both sides of the equation. -172*c + 3332 - 3332 = 8836 - 3332 -172*c = 5504 Step 3: Solve for c. Now we need to solve for c by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of c, which is -172. -172*c / -172 = 5504 / -172 c = -32 So the value of c that satisfies the given equation is c = -32."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Squidward is the reluctant neighbour and workmate of which children's cartoon character????","output":"Squidward Tentacles is the reluctant neighbor and workmate of SpongeBob SquarePants in the popular children's cartoon series of the same name. The show, which first aired in 1999 on the Nickelodeon network, was created by animator and marine science educator Stephen Hillenburg. It takes place in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom, located at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean. SpongeBob SquarePants follows the everyday life and adventures of the titular character, SpongeBob, an optimistically naive and enthusiastic sea sponge who lives in a pineapple-shaped house with his pet snail, Gary. SpongeBob works as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, a popular fast-food restaurant famous for its signature Krabby Patty burgers, under the management of his penny-pinching boss, Mr. Krabs.  Squidward, a perpetually grumpy and sarcastic cephalopod, is SpongeBob's coworker at the Krusty Krab, where he serves as the restaurant's cashier. His bitterness and annoyance with SpongeBob’s happy-go-lucky attitude frequently fuels the tension between them. Squidward is also SpongeBob's next-door neighbor, living in a giant Easter Island-like head made of stone called a Moai, just to the left of SpongeBob’s pineapple abode. As a result, Squidward constantly finds himself dragged into SpongeBob's various escapades, much to his dismay. The show often highlights Squidward's love for the arts, such as playing the clarinet, painting, dancing, and sculpting, although he consistently demonstrates little talent in these endeavors. Despite his pessimistic behavior, Squidward sometimes shows his softer side and inadvertently enjoys moments with SpongeBob and his other neighbor, Patrick Star, a dimwitted but good-natured starfish who is SpongeBob's best friend. Over the years, the SpongeBob SquarePants cartoon has gained substantial acclaim and has become a significant part of pop culture. The show has enjoyed a wide-ranging fan base, from young children to adults, and many find humor in its charming characters, zany storylines, and clever mix of slapstick comedy and wit. Squidward's strained relationship with SpongeBob and his fundamental desire for a life of tranquility and sophistication bring a unique dynamic to the show's overall narrative, making him an essential part of the beloved series."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At the time,the government was looking for a way to reduce traffic problems in the city of London. The poor areas of the city were so crowded with people that it was almost impossible for horse carriages to get through. The city officials were interested in trying to make it possible for workers to live outside of London and travel easily to work each day. If people had a cheap and convenient way that they could depend on to go to and from work, they would relocate their homes outside of the city. This  would  help ease  the pressure of too many people living in the poor parts of London. From these problems,the idea of the London Underground,the first subway system,was born. The plans for building the Underground met with several problems and delays,but the fast track was finally opened in January 1863. A steam train pulled the cars along the fast underground track which was 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) long. About 30,000 people got on the subway the first day. Riders were treated to comfortable seats (standing up while the train was moving was not allowed), and pleasant decorations inside each of the cars. However, the smoke from the engine soon filled the air in the tunnels with ash and soot , as well as chemical gases. Fans had to be put in the tunnels later to keep the air clean enough for people to breathe. Even with its problems,riding in the Underground did . It carried 9 million riders in its first year.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the answer: During the American Civil War, what city was the capital of the Confederacy?","output":"During the American Civil War, the capital city of the Confederacy was Richmond, Virginia. The American Civil War, which lasted from 1861 to 1865, was a conflict primarily fought between the Northern states, also known as the Union, and the Southern states, known as the Confederate States of America. The primary cause of the war was the disagreement over the issues of states' rights, westward expansion, and most importantly, the institution of slavery. Richmond, Virginia, was chosen as the capital of the Confederate States of America due to several strategic and political reasons. First and foremost, Virginia itself was a crucial state for the Confederacy, as it was one of the most populous and economically vital states in the South. Additionally, many important political and military figures of the Confederacy, such as Robert E. Lee, were Virginians. The state's geographic location served as a buffer between the Northern states and the deeper Confederate territory, making its protection an essential aspect of the Confederate military strategy. Richmond's specific characteristics made it an ideal choice for the Confederate capital. The city was located about 100 miles south of Washington, D.C., making it strategically close to the Union capital and symbolically asserting the Confederate presence on the eastern seaboard. Richmond was also a transportation hub, with several railways and vital waterways, such as the James River, converging in the city. This transportation network was essential for efficiently moving troops, supplies, and information throughout the Confederacy. Additionally, Richmond was an important industrial center for the Confederacy. The city possessed significant iron and steel production facilities, such as the Tredegar Iron Works, which supplied much of the Confederate military's weaponry and artillery. Richmond's industrial capacity was vital for supporting and sustaining the Confederate war effort. However, Richmond's proximity to the Union capital and its strategic significance made it a primary target for the Union forces. Throughout the Civil War, several major battles and military campaigns, such as the Peninsula Campaign and the Seven Days Battles in 1862, the Virginia campaigns led by Union General Ulysses S. Grant in 1864, and finally, the 1864-1865 Siege of Petersburg, were fought with the ultimate aim of capturing Richmond. The final days of the Confederate capital were marked by doom and desperation. As the Union armies closed in on the city and Confederate morale and resources dwindled, Richmond's residents faced food shortages, inflation, and deprivations. In April 1865, as General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia retreated in the face of advancing Union forces, Confederate President Jefferson Davis and his government evacuated Richmond. The Union forces, led by General Grant, subsequently captured the city on April 3, 1865. Fires that accompanied the evacuation by the Confederates left much of the city in ruins. Richmond's fall marked the beginning of the end for the Confederacy. Mere days later, on April 9, 1865, General Lee surrendered to General Grant at Appomattox Court House, Virginia, signaling the imminent collapse of the Confederate government and bringing the American Civil War to a close."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person for whom the great Elizabethan mansion held enormous importance throughout the rest of her life? from the following article ?  Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\".","output":"Based on the article, the last name of the person for whom the great Elizabethan mansion (Knole) held enormous importance throughout her life is Sackville-West. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how to arrive at the answer: 1. Identify the question: We are looking for the last name of the person for whom the great Elizabethan mansion (Knole) held enormous importance throughout her life. 2. Skim the article for relevant information: The article mentions \\"Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole...\\" and later states that \\"The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life.\\" 3. Analyze the information: Based on what we've found in the article about the Elizabethan mansion and Vita Sackville-West, we can deduce that it is her last name we are looking for, which is Sackville-West. So, the answer is Sackville-West."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: There are many unusual hotels around the world .In Greenland ,there is a hotel made out of ice ,open between December and April every year .In Turkey ,there is a cave hotel with a television ,furniture ,and a bathroom in each room .And in Bolivia ,there is the Salt Palace Hotel .

Demolition charges are planted on an electrical transmission tower and the backup electrical systems are covertly rewired in each casino. At exactly midnight, while everyone in every Vegas casino is singing \\"Auld Lang Syne\\" the tower is blown up and Vegas goes dark. The backup electrical systems open the cashier cages instead of powering the emergency lights. The inside men sneak into the cashier cages and collect the money.

The region, as part of Lorraine, was part of the Holy Roman Empire, and then was gradually annexed by France in the 17th century, and formalized as one of the provinces of France. The Calvinist manufacturing republic of Mulhouse, known as Stadtrepublik Mülhausen, became a part of Alsace after a vote by its citizens on 4 January 1798. Alsace is frequently mentioned with and as part of Lorraine and the former duchy of Lorraine, since it was a vital part of the duchy, and later because German possession as the imperial province (Alsace-Lorraine, 1871–1918) was contested in the 19th and 20th centuries; France and Germany exchanged control of parts of Lorraine (including Alsace) four times in 75 years.  With the decline of the Roman Empire, Alsace became the territory of the Germanic Alemanni. The Alemanni were agricultural people, and their Germanic language formed the basis of modern-day dialects spoken along the Upper Rhine (Alsatian, Alemannian, Swabian, Swiss). Clovis and the Franks defeated the Alemanni during the 5th century AD, culminating with the Battle of Tolbiac, and Alsace became part of the Kingdom of Austrasia. Under Clovis' Merovingian successors the inhabitants were Christianized. Alsace remained under Frankish control until the Frankish realm, following the Oaths of Strasbourg of 842, was formally dissolved in 843 at the Treaty of Verdun; the grandsons of Charlemagne divided the realm into three parts. Alsace formed part of the Middle Francia, which was ruled by the youngest grandson Lothar I. Lothar died early in 855 and his realm was divided into three parts. The part known as Lotharingia, or Lorraine, was given to Lothar's son. The rest was shared between Lothar's brothers Charles the Bald (ruler of the West Frankish realm) and Louis the German (ruler of the East Frankish realm). The Kingdom of Lotharingia was short-lived, however, becoming the stem duchy of Lorraine in Eastern Francia after the Treaty of Ribemont in 880.

The park, which is managed by the National Park Service, covers an area of and reaches across the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. About 4 million people visit Yosemite each year: most spend the majority of their time in the seven square miles (18 km) of Yosemite Valley. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is internationally recognized for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves, lakes, mountains, glaciers, and biological diversity. Almost 95% of the park is designated wilderness. Yosemite was central to the development of the national park idea. First, Galen Clark and others lobbied to protect Yosemite Valley from development, ultimately leading to President Abraham Lincoln's signing the Yosemite Grant in 1864. Later, John Muir led a successful movement to establish a larger national park encompassing not just the valley, but surrounding mountains and forests as wellpaving the way for the United States national park system.  - Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809  April 15, 1865) was an American politician and lawyer who served as the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his assassination in April 1865.

Let's break down each of the factors that need clarity in order to determine the truth of the original premise: 1. Identity of \\"People\\": The term \\"people\\" is quite vague. It could mean one couple, multiple couples, or a group of individuals. It doesn’t specify whether or not these people are the same couple mentioned in the other scenario. If they aren’t, the two statements would naturally be unrelated. 2. Destined Bar: While the second scenario does state that people are heading to a bar, it doesn't specify that the bar is Tavern on The Green. In any given location, there could be numerous bars where people might be headed. Thus, we cannot infer based only on the information provided that the bar they are heading to in a taxi is indeed Tavern on The Green. 3. Mode of Transport: The scenarios describe different modes of transport. In the first scenario, it isn’t specified how the couple is reaching Tavern on The Green. They could be walking, taking a bus, driving, cycling or using any other means of transportation. Meanwhile, in the second scenario, people are definitely taking a taxi. This doesn't necessarily mean that the taxi would end up at Tavern on The Green. Given these uncertainties, we can’t definitively establish a direct correlation between the two scenarios. To establish the truth of the proposition that a couple is heading into Tavern on The Green based on people taking a taxi to a bar, more information is needed. Specifically, we’d need to know that these \\"people\\" are indeed a couple and that the \\"bar\\" they're heading to is none other than Tavern on The Green."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \\"I'm the master of my own body.\\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling heroin.

Question: When the police arrive who do they believet was responsible for the destruction? Movie title: Inspector Gadget Movie plot: John Brown is a security guard working at the Bradford robotics laboratory in Riverton, Ohio, run by Artemus Bradford and his daughter Brenda, whom Brown is attracted to. Brown wishes to become a police officer, with support from his niece Penny. Brenda and Artemus create a lifelike robotic foot as part of the Gadget Program, to create cybernetically augmented police officers. Tycoon Sanford Scolex attacks the lab, steals the foot, and has Artemus murdered before escaping in his limo. Brown chases him down in his car, which leads to it being destroyed by Scolex's explosive cigar, leaving Brown for dead, but a bowling ball coming from the fiery blast of Brown's destroyed car crushes Scolex's hand, forcing him to replace it with a mechanical claw. Brown survives the explosion, but is seriously injured. He becomes the first test subject for the Gadget Program, as a cyborg with countless gadgets he can activate by saying \\"Go, Go, Gadget\\". Under Brenda's guidance, Brown becomes Inspector Gadget. Scolex creates the alias \\"Claw\\" and uses the stolen technology to create his own robot for global domination, aided by his minions Kramer and Sykes, but the attempts fail. Much to the irritation of Chief Quimby, Gadget joins the police department, aided by his talking advanced car, the Gadgetmobile. However, Quimby refuses to give Gadget the Bradford case and instead assigns him to mediocre jobs, prompting Gadget to secretly investigate the case himself. Examining the evidence, he finds a connection to Scolexâs company, which Brenda has now gone to work for. Breaking into Scolex's lab, he locates the foot but is taken captive by Scolex, who discovers Gadget is powered by a processor chip, which Scolex removes, and has Sykes dump Gadget in a junkyard.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? This is often referred to as the \\"competency based performance management system.\\" Using this approach, skills and traits with levels of proficiency expected are assigned to every job. Based on this, you know exactly what to shoot for. You, the employee, can then absorb the precise skills required to keep you competent enough to take charge of your tasks, responsibilities, learning and growth. Not only this, it encourages you to aim for the highest level of competence in the most efficient and effective manner. When you know what is expected of you, you can rise to the top. . Mentors play a vital role in developing employees, aiding in their learning and growth. They can give you advice on establishing objectives, the strategies to be adopted to achieve the objectives, and keep your morale up, too. What's more, a mentor likely has access to resources and a vast network of people who can help as well.  A mentoring relationship should focus on building and developing skills, competencies and personality. The personality aspect involves helping the mentee review his strengths and shortcomings, appropriate behavior and actions to be implemented, and work on improving communication skills, problem solving skills, and teamwork habits. Having a mentor could help you move in alignment with the expectations of the organization. This can to a great extent serve the purpose of reducing gaps between where you stand and what is expected of you &dash; both in the short and long term. There is a growing need for employees to keep pace with the changing trends and technologies at the workplace. They need to keep their skills updated at all times – it's not just you! Because of this, a lot of workplaces offer training. One of the best ways to keep pace and eliminate or minimize employee gap is through the training program at your work. If your work offers one, take advantage of it! Not all training programs suit every employee. The training program should be one offered by your work, chosen carefully by your boss. It may be a waste of time and resources (money, facilities, trainers) if the training program is not applicable to the employee or the field, offered by some third-party organization who doesn't have your goals in mind. Your willingness, competence, and if you are able to tap into your potential are all key factors in the success of any training program. If you are ready, willing, and able, you could be trained in such a way that could make you multi-skilled and ready to take on diverse roles and responsibilities desired of you. However, if you don't take the training to heart, it's likely you'll end up right back at square one. Through training, the gap and shortcomings that have been hindering you from fulfilling your objectives may fade away. This allows you to explore your work world to your full potential. Again, only if you take advantage of it! Training enhances adaptability of the employees by preparing them for any changes in the workplace or in technology. With this training, you may become readily able to accommodate the team, the organization as a whole, and even yourself.  Training enables employees to perform better, often resulting in work being more tolerable. This can impact their motivation and job satisfaction because they feel \\"not left out\\" or \\"not left behind.\\" You may also feel taken care of by your organization because they've provided you with a platform to keep yourself updated, prepared for the future, and made valuable. Training is a concrete attempt to retain you and make you a part of the team. When you feel this, you may feel more connected to your work, improving your morale. A workshop is something different than a formal training program, seminar or meeting. It can be used in tandem with training and development programs. It's usually more informal and an ideal platform to introduce the employees to ways to reduce the employee gap. Sometimes, the employees are asked to determine ways they think would help them. In other words, it's more hands-on than training usually is.  Workshops are great for soft skills, too, which are just as important. They can even help with relations between clients, customers, peers, and managers. On the other hand, they can also address oral and written communication skills, negotiation skills, and correspondence issues. If your aim is to improve your soft skills, workshops are the way to go. In workshops, the employees get a chance to take ownership of their learning, skills, growth in the organization and acceptance in the organization. Afterward, you emerge feeling like you have a hold on the company's ideas and are part of their vision. Often workshops are used to introduce technologies and trends that the organization would like to adopt. Once you know what technology is to be incorporated, learn it! This can greatly lessen the gap by keeping you up with where the company sees itself going. If you don't know how to learn the technology, odds are you have a wealth of options you haven't even thought about. Would your coworkers be able to help? Could you take a class? What about the Internet? A mentor? If your company doesn't offer training, seek out ways to solve the problem yourself.","output":"The article discusses the importance of a competency-based performance management system, emphasizing the role of mentors, workplace training, and workshops in helping employees acquire necessary skills, stay updated with changing trends, and align themselves with organizational expectations to minimize performance gaps and achieve professional growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, that was far from the truth. Eriksen has proved his doubters wrong with his string of spectacular performances in the Premier League and Cup competitions alike. His technical ability on the field, his vision and his ability to create chances for his teammates have been a much-needed force for the team, driving them towards greater achievements.  Ever since he moved to White Hart Lane, Eriksen has grown in stature, playing a crucial role behind successful campaigns and winning the hearts of the fans. With each passing season, he has shown immense potential as a top-level player, getting closer to emulating the club legends like Gascoigne and Hoddle. His contributions have been remarkable and have helped lift the team to challenge for top spots consistently. His never-say-die attitude and commitment to his craft have made him an indispensable part of the squad, and an inimitable presence on the pitch. Tottenham Hotspur fans have always appreciated cultural icons, and Eriksen, with his unique style of play and skill set, can very well carve his name into the list of all-time Spurs greats. It's important, however, for the club to offer their unwavering support and faith to ensure that Eriksen continues to blossom and reach the pinnacle of his career at Tottenham. With the right guidance and a proactive approach from the management and coaching staff, there's no doubt that Eriksen will play an even more significant role in future accomplishments for the club. In conclusion, Jan Vertonghen's belief in the endless potential of his fellow teammate proves that Eriksen has all the makings of a legend, not only within the ranks of Tottenham Hotspur but also in the pages of football history. Given his current trajectory and upward trend, there's every reason to believe that Christian Eriksen is on the path to becoming a true Spurs icon."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The last, and longest, glimpse features a boy who wakes up in a hospital next to several corpses, reading Mikhail Lermontov's A Hero of Our Time (\\"VÃ¥r Tids HjÃ¤lte\\" in the film), and caressing a blurry, transient image that shifts between Elisabet and/or Alma's faces. A young nurse, Alma (portrayed by Bibi Andersson), is summoned by the head doctor and charged with the care of stage actress Elisabet Vogler (portrayed by Liv Ullmann), who has, despite the lack of any diagnosed impairment, become mute. The hospital administrator (portrayed by Margaretha Krook) offers her own seaside cottage as a place for Alma to nurse Elisabet back to health. Though Elisabet is nearly catatonic when the film begins, she does react with extreme panic upon seeing a Vietnamese Buddhist monk's self-immolation on television, and laughs mockingly at Alma's radio soap opera.

Answer:","output":"Tobor is a highly advanced robot designed as a solution to overcome the limitations of the human factor in space exploration in the context of the fictitious Civil Interplanetary Flight Commission (CIFC) in the movie titled \\"Tobor the Great.\\" In the movie, as technology progresses, nuclear power plants become small enough to be housed in submarines, while rockets grow larger and more powerful, eventually becoming nuclear-powered. This advancement leads to the formation of the CIFC, an agency responsible for developing more efficient rocket motors and alloys. Dr. Ralph Harrison (Charles Drake), a scientist working on an experimental centrifuge, resigns from his position at the CIFC, due to his disagreement with the extreme nature of the tests being conducted on potential astronauts. He is soon approached by Professor Nordstrom (Taylor Holmes), who has also had disagreements with the CIFC and believes he has a solution to the human factor issue. He recruits Harrison to join him on his project. As they are discussing their project at the airport, a nosy news reporter interrupts their conversation, revealing that Nordstrom's resignation is public knowledge. This sparks concerns about enemy nations learning secrets through news speculation. Upon arriving at a secluded compound with various security measures, Nordstrom introduces Harrison to his daughter Janice (Karin Booth) and grandson Brian \\"Gadge\\" Roberts (Billy Chapin). Karl (Franz Roehn), the professor's assistant, informs them about Brian's father's tragic death during the development of a new alloy. The solution Nordstrom and Harrison are working on is \\"Tobor,\\" an advanced robot that can be controlled remotely or through ESP (Extra-Sensory Perception). The idea is to have Tobor replace human astronauts during space missions, removing the risks and limitations posed by sending humans to space. Tobor has several features that make it the perfect candidate for this purpose. It is built with a sturdy and robust material to withstand the harsh conditions of space, it does not require life-support systems, and it can endure extreme acceleration forces and radiation exposure without any harm. As the movie progresses, espionage and sabotage attempts occur, targeting Tobor and its creators. However, Tobor proves to be an exceptional creation capable of overcoming many challenges posed by the saboteurs and enemy agents. In conclusion, Tobor is an advanced robot designed in response to the limitations of human astronauts, and its purpose is to withstand the challenges of space exploration. The movie \\"Tobor the Great\\" tells the story of the scientists' journey in creating this exceptional invention, navigating through the challenges of espionage and sabotage attempts to make space travel safer and more efficient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The American Revolution began with rejection of Parliamentary authority and moves towards self-government. In response Britain sent troops to reimpose direct rule, leading to the outbreak of war in 1775. The following year, in 1776, the United States declared independence. The entry of France to the war in 1778 tipped the military balance in the Americans' favour and after a decisive defeat at Yorktown in 1781, Britain began negotiating peace terms.

Movie title: Journey to the Center of the Earth Movie plot: Scotland, 1880: Oliver Lindenbrook (James Mason), a distinguished professor at the University of Edinburgh, has just been granted knighthood for service to the Crown in the field of geology. When he arrives at his lecture hall on the day of the announcement, he is surprised by a gathering of staff and students. They present him with an elaborate decorative inkwell and the Dean declares a holiday in celebration of the occasion. As the others leave, one student, Alec McKuen (Pat Boone), remains behind. He offers Lindenbrook an extra token, a rock he acquired in a curiosity shop in Glasgow: a lump of lava, strangely heavy, although lava is usually very light. Pleased with the offering, Lindenbrook invites him to dinner at his home that evening. As Alec leaves, Lindenbrook turns his attention back to the unusual rock.Alec arrives at Lindenbrook's house that evening to find that the professor never came home, and his niece, Jenny (Diane Baker), is both angry and worried. Alec and Jenny go to his laboratory at the University, and find him and his assistant, Paisley (Ben Wright), feverishly experimenting on that same piece of lava. Lindenbrook shows Alec that he has chipped away a fragment of the lava and uncovered a manmade object inside, marked with three grooves or notches. He is about to melt off the rest of the lava to discover what it might be. Tired and distracted, Paisley pours in too much fuel at that moment, and the stove explodes. In the aftermath, Lindenbrook finds that the lava has been blasted free of the object, and it is revealed to be a surveyor's plumb bob with a few Nordic words painfully scratched on it. Lindenbrook and Alec recognize the signature with wonder: Arne Saknussem, a brilliant but eccentric Icelandic scientist, who had disappeared many years earlier while exploring the volcanoes of his homeland.Two weeks later, the Dean and the Rector of the University (Alan Napier and Alan Caillou) call at Lindenbrook's home to ask why he's neglecting his teaching duties.

The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.  - Dan Patterson is a British television producer and writer, responsible for the production of both the British and American incarnations of the improvisation show \\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\\" and the British satirical panel show \\"Mock the Week\\" with writing partner Mark Leveson.

Stephen Fry was host of the show from its initial pilot, before departing after the final episode of the M series in 2015, with frequent \\"QI\\" panelist Sandi Toksvig replacing him prior to the beginning of the N series in 2016. The format of the show focuses on Alan and three other guest panelists answering questions that are extremely obscure, making it unlikely that the correct answer will be given. To compensate, the panelists are awarded points not only for the right answer, but also for interesting ones, regardless of whether they are right or even relate to the original question, while points are deducted for \\"answers which are not only wrong, but pathetically obvious\\"  typically answers that are generally believed to be true but in fact are misconceptions  which are known as forfeits that are usually indicated by a loud siren, flashing lights, and the incorrect answer being displayed on screen. Bonus points are sometimes awarded or deducted for challenges or incorrect references, varying from show to show. \\"QI\\" has a philosophy that \\"everything is interesting if looked at in the right way\\"; many factual errors in the show have been corrected in later episodes or on the show's blog.  - Buzzcocks are an English punk rock band, formed in Bolton, England in 1976 by singer-songwriter-guitarist Pete Shelley and singer-songwriter Howard Devoto.

Participants may compete with each other, such as on \\"The News Quiz\\"; facilitate play by non-celebrity contestants, such as on \\"Match Game\\"/\\"Blankety Blank\\"; or do both, such as on \\"Wait Wait Don't Tell Me\\". The genre can be traced to 1938, when \\"Information Please\\" debuted on U.S. radio. The earliest known television panel show is \\"Play the Game\\", a charades show in 1946. The modern trend of comedy panel shows can find early roots with \\"Stop Me If You've Heard This One\\" in 1939 and \\"Can You Top This?\\" in 1940. While panel shows were more popular in the past in the U.S., they are still very common in the United Kingdom.  - Mock the Week is a British topical, satirical celebrity panel show, that was created by Dan Patterson and Mark Leveson, the same people responsible for the comedy game show \\"Whose Line Is It Anyway?\\". Performers deliver answers on unexpected subjects on the spur of the momentalthough accusations of scripting have been made by other comedians. It is made by independent production company Angst Productions, and made its debut on BBC Two on 5 June 2005, with the show's theme song being \\"News of the World\\" by The Jam. The show has featured a variety of different stand-up performers, some being part of the show for several series as a permanent fixture, with host Dara Ó Briain and comedian Hugh Dennis having appeared in every episode since its debut.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Robert Brydon Jones, MBE (born 3 May 1965), known professionally as Rob Brydon, is a Welsh actor, comedian, radio and television presenter, singer and impressionist. He played Dr Paul Hamilton in the Australian/British comedy series \\"Supernova\\", Bryn West in the sitcom\\" Gavin & Stacey\\" and Keith Barret in the BBC comedy series \\"Marion and Geoff\\" and its spin-off \\"The Keith Barret Show\\".  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Have I Got News for You is a British television panel show produced by Hat Trick Productions for the BBC. It is loosely based on the BBC Radio 4 show \\"The News Quiz\\", and has been regularly broadcast since 1990.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose death at the height of her fame and was a shock to the musical world? is inside the article: Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles. As her reputation grew, Ferrier formed close working relationships with major musical figures, including Britten, Sir John Barbirolli, Bruno Walter and the accompanist Gerald Moore. She became known internationally through her three tours to the United..., can you guess it ?

Illinois made it a crime to use an \`\`eavesdropping device'' to overhear or record a phone call or conversation without the consent of all parties to the conversation. The law was ruled unconstitutional in 2014 by the Illinois Supreme Court.

The Four Cs of 21st century learning, also known as the Four Cs or 4 Cs, are four skills that have been identified by the United States-based Partnership for 21st Century Skills (P21) as the most important skills required for 21st century education: critical thinking, communication, collaboration, and creativity. Can we infer the following? The 4Cs in education is viewed as being more important that reading, writing and math skills. Select from: [1]. Yes; [2]. It's impossible to say; [3]. No; The answer is:","output":"[2]. It's impossible to say; The Four Cs of 21st-century learning are essential skills that complement traditional skills such as reading, writing, and math, rather than compete with them in importance. They are designed to help students adapt to the ever-changing world and prepare them for future careers that may not yet exist. It is not accurate to say that the 4Cs are more important than reading, writing, and math skills. Instead, it is crucial to view them as a part of a holistic approach to education that values and emphasizes both academic knowledge and soft skills necessary for success in today's world. Critical thinking involves the ability to analyze, evaluate, and synthesize information to make informed decisions, solve problems, and form logical conclusions. It helps students develop the skills to recognize biases, question assumptions, and distinguish between reliable and unreliable sources of information. Communication is the ability to convey information effectively and efficiently to diverse audiences using various methods and media. Good communication skills help students express their ideas, opinions, and feelings clearly and concisely. Students should also develop the ability to listen actively and respond empathetically to others, as well as utilize communication technologies. Collaboration entails working together with others to achieve common goals effectively. Students must learn how to contribute to group projects, share responsibilities, manage conflicts, and build consensus. They should also develop interpersonal skills such as teamwork, leadership, and adaptability that are necessary for working in diverse environments. Creativity is the capacity to generate new ideas, concepts, and solutions to problems, as well as the ability to adapt and apply existing knowledge to novel situations. Fostering creativity in education helps students think outside the box, adapt to new situations, and develop unique approaches to solving problems. While the Four Cs are vital to 21st-century education, it is essential to remember that these skills should not replace traditional reading, writing, and math skills but rather complement them. A well-rounded education should encompass both academic knowledge and the 4Cs to prepare students for success in an increasingly complex and interconnected global society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the set of songs that Alan Gibbs believes is at least equal to Vaughan William's Five English Folk songs of 1913?  During and after the composition of The Planets, Holst wrote or arranged numerous vocal and choral works, many of them for the wartime Thaxted Whitsun Festivals, 1916–18. They include the Six Choral Folksongs of 1916, based on West Country tunes, of which \\"Swansea Town\\", with its \\"sophisticated tone\\", is deemed by Dickinson to be the most memorable. Holst downplayed such music as \\"a limited form of art\\" in which \\"mannerisms are almost inevitable\\"; the composer Alan Gibbs, however, believes Holst's set at least equal to Vaughan Williams's Five English Folk Songs of 1913.Holst's first major work after The Planets was the Hymn of Jesus, completed in 1917. The words are from a Gnostic text, the apocryphal Acts of St John, using a translation from the Greek which Holst prepared with assistance from Clifford Bax and Jane Joseph. Head comments on the innovative character of the Hymn: \\"At a stroke Holst had cast aside the Victorian and Edwardian sentimental oratorio, and created the precursor of the kind of works that John Tavener, for example, was to write in the 1970s\\". Matthews has written that the Hymn's \\"ecstatic\\" quality is matched in English music \\"perhaps only by Tippett's The Vision of Saint Augustine\\"; the musical elements include plainsong, two choirs distanced from each other to emphasise dialogue, dance episodes and \\"explosive chordal dislocations\\".In the Ode to Death (1918–19), the quiet, resigned mood is seen by Matthews as an \\"abrupt volte-face\\" after the life-enhancing spirituality of the Hymn. Warrack refers to its aloof tranquillity; Imogen Holst believed the Ode expressed Holst's private attitude to death. The piece has rarely been performed since its premiere in 1922, although the composer Ernest Walker thought it was Holst's finest work to that date.The influential critic Ernest Newman considered The Perfect Fool \\"the best of modern British operas\\", but its unusually short length (about an hour) and parodic, whimsical nature—described by The Times as \\"a brilliant puzzle\\"—put it outside the...

His life takes a dramatic turn when he is faced with a high-stakes military trial that will test his principles and challenge his perception of honor. Plot: Daniel Kaffee (played by an actor like Chris Evans) is a talented but disillusioned lawyer who is tired of living in the shadow of his legendary father. Alongside his best friend and fellow lawyer, Jules (played by an actress like Zoe Kravitz), they are assigned to a high-profile military trial that captures the nation's attention. The case: a decorated war hero named Captain Miller (played by an actor like Tom Hanks) has been accused of war crimes during a top-secret military mission. The situation is complicated when it's revealed that Miller had removed the arm patch representing honor from his uniform right before the alleged incident, stating that he no longer believed in the empty symbolism of the patch. As Kaffee and Jules investigate the case, they uncover a web of conspiracy and corruption within the military's highest ranks. Captain Miller had discovered the illicit activities and made himself a target by trying to expose the truth. As the trial progresses, the phrase \\"Who says that they don't need a patch on their arm to have honor?\\" becomes Kaffee's powerful mantra. It serves as a reminder that true honor comes from one's actions and convictions, rather than mere symbols. The climax of the movie sees Kaffee deliver a passionate, stirring closing argument, winning the jury's favor and securing Captain Miller's acquittal. In the end, Kaffee learns the true meaning of honor and integrity, simultaneously earning the respect of his peers and breaking free from the shadow of his father.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which age group is smaller: under the age of 18 or 18 to 24?","output":"Title: Comparing Age Demographics: Under 18 vs. 18 to 24 Introduction A common question arising in discussions of population demographics concerns the size of various age groups in society. In this article, we will tackle one such query: which age group is smaller - those under the age of 18 or those in the 18 to 24 age bracket? To address this question, we will examine global demographic data, assess factors contributing to these population figures, and discuss the potential implications of the smaller age group in society. Analysis of Global Demographic Data To start, let us look into global demographic information. According to the World Population Review, there are approximately 7.9 billion people on Earth as of 2021. The United Nations' Department of Economic and Social Affairs reports that there are roughly 2.3 billion children aged 0-18, accounting for nearly 29.11% of the global population. Comparatively, young adults aged 18 to 24 years total around 1.19 billion – approximately 15.06% of the global population. Comparing these figures, we can determine that people under the age of 18 represent a considerably larger proportion of the population compared to those aged 18 to 24. Therefore, the age group consisting of individuals aged 18 to 24 years is the smaller demographic in question. Factors Influencing Age Group Sizes Now that we have answered the question at hand, it is important to consider the factors that contribute to these differing population sizes for individuals under 18 compared to those aged 18 to 24. The following factors play a major role in determining the size of these age groups: 1. Birth rates: A higher birth rate results in a more significant number of children under the age of 18. Over the past decades, birth rates in many countries have been on the decline, leading to smaller populations of children relative to young adults. 2. Mortality rates: Higher mortality rates among children due to diseases, malnutrition, or other causes can impact the population size in the under-18 age group. Efforts to alleviate these issues have been made on a global level, which led to an overall improvement in child survival rates. 3. Socioeconomic factors: Changes in social norms, such as increasing the age at which individuals tend to start families, can influence the size of the under-18 age group. Additionally, socioeconomic development often correlates with lower birth rates over time. Implications of the Smaller Age Group Understanding the differences in sizes between the under-18 and 18-24 age groups is essential as it helps inform policy, education, and social frameworks tailored to address the diverse needs of these populations. Some implications of the smaller 18 to 24 age group include: 1. Education and workforce: A smaller population of young adults entering the workforce and higher education systems may impact the availability of relevant opportunities for career and educational growth. 2. Social structures: Different age group sizes can alter the balance of social systems and support networks, as well as influence changes in cultural norms and values. 3. Economic implications: A smaller 18-24 age group can have a significant impact on the housing market, consumer behavior, and overall economic growth, given that these young adults are often starting their careers and transitioning to independent living. Conclusion Through analyzing global demographic data, it is evident that the age group of individuals aged 18 to 24 is smaller than that of people under 18. Factors such as birth rates, mortality rates, and socioeconomic changes contribute to the sizes of these two age groups. Recognizing these distinct population demographics is essential in ensuring that appropriate policies and support structures are implemented to address the unique needs of both groups."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer. It was a relatively humble selection by Trump, a former Paris runway model who is frequently clad for public appearances in haute couture dresses and coats. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After the end of the story, what does Melania Trump wear to visit children's charities?

They should be allowed to get bored to that they can develop their ability to be creative. Children are expected by their parents to be reading a textbook all the time. However, research shows that it may _ the development of their imagination, while boredom can give them opportunities to develop creativity. Boredom is often linked with loneliness, but a writer named Meera Syal said boredom had helped here in developing her mind. She told researchers about her childhood. Having few things todo, Syal often talked with her neighbors. She also tried to do things like learning to bake cakes. \\"But importantly, I Thought and wrote a lot, because I was bored,\\" Syal said. She kept a diary, filling here time with short stories and poems she made up. Grayson Perry, an artist, grew up in a family with little money. He enjoyed himself by making up stories, drawing pictures for his stories and reading many books in the library. Bored but free, he spent hours looking out of the window, watching the changing clouds and seasons. Perry filled up his free time with what he liked. He became creative, because he could think freely. Dr. Belton is an expert on the effects of emotions on learning. \\"Boredom could be an uncomfortable feeling,\\" she said. \\"But some young people cannot deal with that boredom creatively. So sometimes they may break a classroom window, or drive a car out for a mad race.\\" Usually, when children have nothing to do, they would turn on the TV, the computer, or the phone. Their time on these things has increased, yet they need to have time to think about their experiences through play or just watching the world around them. It is this kind of thinking that can inspire the imagination. On the other hand, the TV or phone may cut short the thinking process.

A rare, salamander-like amphibian has been spotted in its only known natural habitat, after researchers feared the creature had disappeared from the wild.      Mexican biologists have seen, but not caught, two axolotls during a second attempt to find them in the Xochimilco network of lakes and canals of Mexico City.      The researchers took to the muddy waters of lake Xochimilco in small boats last year, and searched for weeks for the amphibian, but to no avail.      But biologist Armando Tovar Garza, of Mexico's National Autonomous University, said that members of the team carrying out the search had seen two axolotls during the first three weeks of a second survey expected to conclude in April.      “We weren't able to capture them...because the behaviour of the axolotl makes them very difficult to capture,” he said.      “But we have had two sightings. That's important, because it tells us we still have a chance.”      Local residents and scientists of the Biology Institute of the National Autonomous University of Mexico look for insects, which are food for the axolotls.      The axolotl has a slimy tail, plumage-like gills and mouth that curls into an odd smile, and is known as the “water monster” or the “Mexican walking fish”      Growing up to a foot long, axolotls use four stubby legs to drag themselves along the bottom or thick tails to swim in Xochimilco's murky channels while feeding on aquatic insects, small fish and crustaceans.      It is regarded as important in scientific research because of its ability to regenerate severed limbs.      Some axolotls still survive in aquariums, water tanks and research labs, but experts said those conditions are not the best, because of interbreeding and other risks.      Releasing captive-bred axolotls into the wild is not an option as it could spread a fatal fungus and reduce their genetic diversity.      The “floating gardens” of earth piled on reed mats that the Aztecs built to grow crops where axolotols live in the wild, are now suffering from pollution, urban sprawl and invasive species.      Mr Tovar Garza said some small mutations, possibly the result of interbreeding, have already been seen.      Alarmed by the creature's falling numbers in recent years, researchers built axolotl “shelters” in Xochimilco to help them breed in the cleanest part of their remaining habitat.

This long and detailed explanation seeks to translate and provide additional context to the given statement in French: The statement pertains to a recommendation made by a Committee (possibly a human rights or medical ethics committee) to a State party (a country that is a member or signatory to an agreement or convention) to review and potentially amend certain legal provisions. These provisions, as per the statement, are found in the federal law or law of specific states within the country. They allow for non-therapeutic experiments to be carried out on minors (those under the legal age of adulthood) or individuals suffering from mental disorders. Non-therapeutic experiments refer to those that do not have any direct medical benefit or treatment purpose for the subjects participating in them. Such experiments may be research-based or aimed at understanding a condition, but they do not necessarily alleviate the subject's health issues. The statement highlights concerns regarding the consent process for such experiments. As it stands, these legal provisions permit experiments to be conducted with only the consent of the guardianship authority. The guardianship authority could be the legal guardian or custodian of the minor or mentally ill individual. The Committee's recommendation must have stemmed from the belief that this consent process is insufficient or not robust enough to protect the rights and well-being of vulnerable individuals involved in non-therapeutic experiments. In conclusion, the statement underscores the need for the State party to review and possibly revise its legal provisions to ensure the rights of minors and mentally ill individuals are better protected in the context of non-therapeutic experiments. This revision should take into account the consent requirements for including vulnerable populations in experiments, making certain that their best interests are kept at the forefront."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Are You Experienced was an immediate commercial success, selling more than one million copies within seven months of its release. Reviewing the album in 1967, Melody Maker praised its artistic integrity and the Experience's varied use of tempo. NME's Keith Altham said it is \\"a brave effort by Hendrix to produce a musical form which is original and exciting\\". However, not all contemporary writers gave the LP a favorable review; in November 1967, Rolling Stone's Jon Landau wrote that although he considered Hendrix a \\"great guitarist and a brilliant arranger\\", he disapproved of his singing and songwriting. He criticized the quality of the material and described the lyrics as inane: \\"Above all this record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that.\\"Many music critics have since named Are You Experienced as one of the greatest rock and roll debut albums. Journalist Ritchie Unterberger described it as \\"one of the definitive albums of the psychedelic era.\\" Author Chris Smith said the release was \\"a landmark in a summer of landmark albums\\". Noe Goldwasser, the founding editor of Guitar World magazine, called it \\"a veritable textbook of what a musician can do with his instrument\\" and \\"the measure by which everything ... in rock and roll has been compared since.\\" According to music journalist Charles Shaar Murray, the album \\"completely changed notions of what a guitar could sound like, or indeed, what music could sound like\\", while The Miami Herald credited Are You Experienced with introducing acid rock, classic rock, and the guitar aesthetic of heavy metal. Critic Robert Christgau called it a \\"bombshell debut\\" in his review for Blender and said its songs were innovative for how they utilized three-minute pop structures as a medium for Hendrix's unprecedentedly heavy and turbulent guitar and loud, powerful hooks, which greatly appealed to young listeners.Rolling Stone includes the album and several songs on various \\"best of\\" lists, such as: 500 Greatest Albums of All Time – No. 15, calling...

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical mythology? , can you please find it?   The painting shows the moment from Summer in which Musidora, having removed the last of her clothes, steps into \\"the lucid coolness of the flood\\" to \\"bathe her fervent limbs in the refreshing stream\\". Damon is not shown; instead, Etty illustrates the scene from Damon's viewpoint. By placing the audience in Damon's position, Etty aimed to induce the same reactions in the viewer as Damon's dilemma as described by Thomson; that of whether to enjoy the spectacle despite knowing it to be inappropriate, or to follow the accepted morality of the time and look away, in what art historian Sarah Burnage has described as \\"a titillating moral test for spectators to both enjoy and overcome\\".The pose of Musidora is based on that of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is possible that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection. The setting for the painting is a pool in the grounds of The Plantation, a house in the village of Acomb, near York. The Plantation was the home of his close friend and patron the Reverend Isaac Spencer, vicar of Acomb, and its grounds were a scene Etty had previously painted. In 1846 Etty bought a house in York for his retirement; Burnage speculates that Etty chose Acomb on the grounds that a view of York was quintessentially English.Although Etty had traditionally worked in the Venetian style of painting, with rich colours and detail, for Musidora he adopted a much softer and earthier palette, although his use of reflected light on flesh is derived from Venetian styles. He moved away from Rubens, who up to this time had been his greatest influence, and closer to the style of Titian. This is likely owing to the nature of the subject matter. Until then his history paintings had primarily been of themes of classical... The answer is:","output":"Etty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

How would you consider the linguistic integrity of the preceding sentence?","output":"To consider the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"I want for nobody to hate me,\\" step-by-step, I will analyze its syntax, semantics, and pragmatics. 1. Syntax: The sentence is grammatically correct, as it follows the basic structure of a subject (I) followed by a verb (want) and a complement (for nobody to hate me). However, the preposition \\"for\\" might be considered redundant or informal—most native speakers would likely say \\"I want nobody to hate me.\\" 2. Semantics: The sentence conveys a clear meaning—the speaker wishes that no one feels hatred toward them. The words used in the sentence (want, nobody, hate, me) all have well-defined meanings that contribute to the sentence's overall coherence. 3. Pragmatics: Understanding the speaker's intentions and the context in which this sentence might be used could provide further insight into its linguistic integrity. It seems that the speaker desires universal acceptance and wishes to avoid any negative feelings others may have towards them. In conclusion, the linguistic integrity of the sentence \\"I want for nobody to hate me\\" is generally good. The syntax is understandable, the semantics are clear, and the pragmatics are easily inferred from the sentence itself. The use of \\"for\\" may be seen as redundant or informal, but it does not significantly impact the sentence's integrity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This class could be part of a broader curriculum in a higher education institution, such as a university or college, that offers courses in history, political science, or sociology. The discussion of organizations resisting colonial rule, the involvement of educated elite class, and the desire for political representation at the national level suggest that the class delves into the complexities of colonial-era power dynamics and their long-term impacts on societies and cultures. Additionally, the emphasis on Taiwanese-Chinese cultural heritage points toward a regional focus, which further indicates that the class may explore the histories and political developments of specific regions or countries in the context of colonialism, such as East Asia in this case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And that led it to be adopted by a much larger tribe--the business tribe. You cannot wear a tie if you work with machinery. So wearing a tie became a sign that you were a man who used your brain to make a living, rather than your hands. It showed you were serious. It showed you were a professional. It meant that everyone who wanted a job in business had to wear one. It was just impossible to take seriously a man who didn't wear a piece of color1ed silk around his neck. This is how millions of people came to be wearing ties across the world. They are part of the uniform of business. \\"Ties offer a point of indifference,\\" says John Milne, head of the British Guide of Tie Makers. \\"They give a chance to say something about their own personality.\\" So if you happen to meet a man with a very brightly color1ed tie, there is a good chance that he is the office joker. There is also a good chance that he will be wearing brightly color1ed socks. Is there a future for ties? The signs are not promising. Tie wearing seems to be rare among the new bread of entrepreneurs  in the Internet and new technology industries. Many political leaders,including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, now go without ties. This shows they are men of the people--but not the people wearing ties. Up until around 1960, it was common for men across the Western world to wear hats as part of their business uniform. That changed with the election of John F. Kennedy to the presidency of the United States. Kennedy never wore a hat  in fact his nickname was\\"hatless Jack\\". Seeing that the most powerful man in the world did not have to wear a hat, millions of other men decided that they did not have to, either. Hats simply vanished across the Western world.

Answer the following question: Fact 1: Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is not working properly.  Fact 2: People with healthy immune systems usually get well on their own.  Given the two facts above, what does immunodeficiency do? Answer:","output":"Immunodeficiency is a condition where the immune system does not function adequately, leading to a compromised or weakened ability to fight off infections and diseases. Given the two facts mentioned: 1. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is not working properly. This means that people with immunodeficiency have a reduced ability to resist and combat infections, pathogens, or other foreign substances that enter the body. Their immune system may not respond effectively, or it may fail to initiate an immune response at all. This can be caused by genetic factors, acquired conditions, or environmental factors that impact the immune system's development and function. 2. People with healthy immune systems usually get well on their own. In contrast, people with a healthy immune system have the capability to ward off infections, diseases, and other threats to their well-being. Their immune system is strong enough to detect and eliminate pathogens, initiate the healing process, and build immunity to future threats. Given these two facts, immunodeficiency affects people's ability to recover from infections and diseases on their own. In individuals with immunodeficiency, the weakened immune system struggles to protect and defend the body against harmful invaders effectively. As a result, people with immunodeficiency are more susceptible to recurrent or severe infections, have a higher risk of complications, and may take longer to recover from illnesses compared to individuals with a healthy immune system. In some cases, they may require additional medical intervention, treatments, or therapies to manage their condition and reduce the impact of infections on their overall health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.
