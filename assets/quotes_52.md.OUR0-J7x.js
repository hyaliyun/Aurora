The average American kid consumes more than 20 teaspoons of sugar per day, and adults eat 50% more sugar today than they did in the 1970s. We all know that too much sugar isn't good for you. But did we know it could be dangerous? A team of researchers at the University of Utah used mice to conduct a study on the negative effects of sugar. They found it could have serious effects on people's health. Sugar is found not only in sweets and candies, but also in many household items like pasta and crackers. During the 58-week-long study, mice were fed a diet containing 25% more sugar. This percentage equals a healthy human diet along with three cans of soda daily. The team found that these mice were twice as likely to die as mice fed a similar diet without the sugar. Though the mice did not show signs of obesity or high blood pressure, male mice were 26% less territorial and produced 25% fewer offspring than the other mice. Scientists often use mice for research because they have a similar genetic  structure to humans. \\"Since most substances that are dangerous in mice are also dangerous in people, it's likely that those physical problems that cause those mice to have increased deaths also work in people,\\" says study author James Ruff of the University of Utah. Findings from this study reveal negative effects that are not as noticeable as weight gain or heart problems. Sugar can contribute to long-term changes in the body that can change development and even shorten lives. Cutting sugar out of the American diet altogether may be difficult. But making the effort to control our nation's sugar desire will provide for a truly sweeter future. Question: From the passage we can infer  _ Options: A: sugar plays a very important role in Americans' diet B: kids consume more sugar than adults in America C: the study on human beings lasted 58 weeks D: the genetic structure of mice is totally different from that of people A:","output":"sugar plays a very important role in Americans' diet"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In nature, uranium(VI) forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH. This leads to an increase in mobility and availability of uranium to groundwater and soil from nuclear wastes which leads to health hazards. However, it is difficult to precipitate uranium as phosphate in the presence of excess carbonate at alkaline pH. A Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 has been found to express a high activity alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) that has been applied for bioprecipitation of uranium as uranyl phosphate species from alkaline solutions. The precipitation ability was enhanced by overexpressing PhoK protein in E. coli. What type of complexes does uranium(VI) form in nature?","output":"In nature, uranium(VI) predominantly forms highly soluble carbonate complexes at alkaline pH. These carbonate complexes occur when uranium(VI) ions react with carbonate ions (CO3^2-) present in the environment, leading to the formation of stable soluble uranium-carbonate species in alkaline solutions. The high solubility and stability of these complexes contribute to the increased mobility and availability of uranium in groundwater and soil, potentially resulting in contamination and various health hazards. The presence of these carbonate complexes at alkaline pH also presents challenges in precipitating uranium as phosphate, making it difficult to effectively remove or immobilize uranium in the environment. However, the Sphingomonas sp. strain BSAR-1 and its overexpressed alkaline phosphatase (PhoK) protein offer a promising bioprecipitation approach for the remediation of uranium-contaminated sites by converting the soluble uranium species to less soluble uranyl phosphate species."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Unfortunately, I had absolutely no idea what I wanted my future occupation to be. The only thing I did know was that I did not want to spend the next 45 years teaching, being a nurse or sitting in an office. But that was before the postman delivered a catalogue   of courses that were being offered at the local college. As I looked through it, I was attracted by a page that talked about the difficulties faced by deaf people in their everyday lives and how students could help by learning sign language. It went on to say that graduates of the course usually find work in different organizations, such as law companies, the Stock Exchange, insurance companies and banks. Then I saw something that really caught my eye: \\"Singer\\" are also needed for sporting events, concerts, theatrical performances and, believe it or not, circuses! By the time I got to the bottom of the page, I knew I had found the perfect occupation. I enrolled   on the course, which to my parents' great delight was free of charge. The course was brilliant. My favourite part was the final lesson, when our teacher asked us to sign our favourite song. It was really difficult because not only did we have to sign the words, but we also had to find a way of showing whether the song was happy or sad and whether the beat was slow or fast.

In the given premise, Hoiles is described as a \\"big slab of a man\\" who is 33 years old and a veteran but not a star. This depiction creates an image of a strong, experienced individual whose physical stature and age indicate a wealth of knowledge and time spent in his chosen field. However, it is explicitly stated that he is not a star, meaning that he hasn't achieved a high level of fame or recognition. On the other hand, the hypothesis suggests that Hoiles is a star despite being a small guy. This statement contradicts the premise in two significant ways. First, the premise describes Hoiles as a big man, whereas the hypothesis assumes that he is small. Secondly, the hypothesis claims that Hoiles is a star, which is opposed to the premise that states he is not. Thus, the premise does not entail the hypothesis as they present conflicting portrayals of Hoiles, in terms of both physical size and level of success or fame. The two statements are incompatible, leading to the conclusion that the premise does not support or lead to the hypothesis.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

According to an official Honda statement, \\"The master window switch in the driver's door can malfunction when exposed to large amounts of liquid ingress, for example if the window is left open frequently or for long periods during heavy rain. \\"Water and other fluids can cause the circuit board of the window switch to malfunction and prevent opening or closing of the window. In rare cases, the circuit board can overheat causing melting, smoke or, potentially, fire.\\" Although there have been no reported fires in the UK, such an incident is alleged to have led to the death of a two-year-old girl in South Africa last year. As a precaution, all cars recalled in the UK will be fitted with a waterproof skirt to prevent further water entry. Worldwide, Honda is recalling almost 650,000 Jazz models. Previously, Toyota had announced a global recall that will cost the company an estimated £1.25bn this financial quarter. It has identified 180,865 UK cars that are potentially affected by a sticking accelerator pedal and is contacting owners through the Driver Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), asking them to book cars in for a 30-minute repair. The problem affects eight UK models – the iQ, Aygo, Yaris, Auris, Corolla, Avensis and Verso – but more than eight million cars could be affected worldwide. Last year five million Toyotas were recalled in America, because unsecured floor mats had caused throttles to jam. It is alleged that the fault caused up to 18 deaths, although the company denies this. The matter came to head earlier this week when US transport secretary Ray LaHood warned Toyota owners not to drive their cars, but he has since withdrawn that statement. Should an accelerator pedal stick, drivers are advised to put their car into neutral and pull off the road as soon as it is safe to do so.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Jean-Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert (16 November 1717  29 October 1783) was a French mathematician, mechanician, physicist, philosopher, and music theorist. Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the \\"Encyclopédie\\". D'Alembert's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him. The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert's equation.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Jean - Baptiste le Rond d'Alembert ( / dælmbr / ; French : (  batist l  dalb ) ; 17 November 1717 -- 29 October 1783 ) was a French mathematician , mechanician , physicist , philosopher , and music theorist . Until 1759 he was also co-editor with Denis Diderot of the Encyclopédie . D'Alembert 's formula for obtaining solutions to the wave equation is named after him . The wave equation is sometimes referred to as d'Alembert 's equation .  - Pythagoras of Samos ( or simply ;  in Ionian Greek) was an Ionian Greek philosopher, mathematician, and the putative founder of the movement called Pythagoreanism. Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.  - A philosopher is someone who practices philosophy, which involves rational inquiry into areas that are outside of either theology or science. The term \\"philosopher\\" comes from the Ancient Greek (\\"philosophos\\") meaning \\"lover of wisdom\\". The coining of the term has been attributed to the Greek thinker Pythagoras (6th century BC).  - Encyclopédie, ou dictionnaire raisonné des sciences, des arts et des métiers (\\"Encyclopaedia, or a Systematic Dictionary of the Sciences, Arts, and Crafts\\") was a general encyclopedia published in France between 1751 and 1772, with later supplements, revised editions, and translations. It had many writers, known as the \\"Encyclopédistes\\". It was edited by Denis Diderot and, until 1759, co-edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert.  - Light is electromagnetic radiation within a certain portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The word usually refers to visible light, which is visible to the human eye and is responsible for the sense of sight. Visible light is usually defined as having wavelengths in the range of 400700 nanometres (nm), or 4.00 × 10 to 7.00 × 10 m, between the infrared (with longer wavelengths) and the ultraviolet (with shorter wavelengths). This wavelength means a frequency range of roughly 430750 terahertz (THz).  - The Encyclopédistes were members of the Société des gens de lettres, a French writer's society, who contributed to the development of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" from June 1751 to December 1765 under editors Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d'Alembert. The composition of the 17 volumes of text and 11 volumes of plates of the \\"Encyclopédie\\" was the work of over 150 authors belonging, in large part, to the intellectual group known as the philosophes. They promoted the advancement of science and secular thought and supported tolerance, rationality, and open-mindedness of the Enlightenment.  - The wave equation is an important second-order linear partial differential equation for the description of wavesas they occur in physicssuch as sound waves, light waves and water waves. It arises in fields like acoustics, electromagnetics, and fluid dynamics.  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Denis Diderot (5 October 171331 July 1784) was a French philosopher, art critic, and writer. He was a prominent figure during the Enlightenment and is best known for serving as co-founder, chief editor, and contributor to the \\"Encyclopédie\\" along with Jean le Rond d'Alembert.  - In physics, sound is a vibration that propagates as a typically audible mechanical wave of pressure and displacement, through a transmission medium such as air or water. In physiology and psychology, sound is the \\"reception\\" of such waves and their \\"perception\\" by the brain. Humans can hear sound waves with frequencies between about 20 Hz and 20 kHz. Sound above 20 kHz is ultrasound and below 20 Hz is infrasound. Other animals have different hearing ranges.  - The 6th century BC started the first day of 600 BC and ended the last day of 501 BC.

Furthermore, the word \\"very\\" in \\"very good\\" serves to intensify the positive sentiment expressed by the critic, as it indicates a high degree of approval. The term \\"alternative\\" might suggest that the movie might not be the viewer's first choice or might belong to a different genre than what they typically watch, yet the critic still affirms that it is worth considering. It is essential to understand the broader context in which this short review is written. Movie critics typically analyze various aspects of a film, including the plot, character development, cinematography, direction, and overall viewing experience. When the critic says the movie is a \\"very good viewing alternative,\\" they may potentially imply that despite a few flaws or limitations, the film is still a successful and valuable contribution to the movie industry. Positive reviews are crucial for a movie's success, as they can help build interest and excitement among potential viewers. By expressing their positive assessment, the critic is effectively encouraging others to give the movie a chance and form their own opinions. In conclusion, the critic is thinking positively of the movie and recommending it as a worthy viewing option for others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He labeled this part of the study as case B.  Which place would have more contamianted groundwater, case A or case B?  Hint: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.

It is not obvious from viewing this film (so I recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it) but this presentation on the realities of Islam, and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non-Muslims is lacking objectiveness, and also completely fails to factor in the human condition. It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a devout Muslim is required to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist is able to realize that not every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of Islam, will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system. There is reason to call much about the presenters into question, such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism; don't swallow it all, hook, line, and sinker, without some thinking of your own. One specific, for instance, is researching the person Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in Bethlehem. There are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions. I am not nor have I ever been a Muslim. I have never read the Koran.

Question: Article: \\"Congratulations, Mr. Jones, it's a girl.\\" Fatherhood is going to have a different meaning and bring forth a different answer from every man who hears these words. Some feel proud when they receive the news, while others worry, wondering whether they will be good fathers. Although there are some men who like children and may have had considerable experience with them, others do not particularly care for children and spend little time with them. Many fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children for some time. For other couples, pregnancy  was an accident that both husband and wife have accepted willingly or unwillingly. Whatever the reaction to the birth of a child, it is obvious that the change from the role of husband to that of father is a difficult task. Yet, unfortunately, few attempts have been made to educate fathers in this re-socialization process. Although many good books have been written about American mothers, only recently have some books discussed the role of a father. It is argued by some writers that the transition to the father's role, although difficult, is not nearly as great as the transition the wife must make to the mother's role. The mother's role seems to require a complete transformation of daily routine and adaptation to a new life, on the other hand, the father's role is less demanding and immediate. However, even though we have mentioned the fact that growing numbers of women are working outside the home, the father is still thought by many as the breadwinner in the household. Question: Some writers argue that with respect to the change of roles, fathers, compared with mothers,   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"have an easier job to do\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"have an easier job to do\\". The article provides the viewpoint of some writers who argue that the transition to the role of a father, compared to the role of a mother, is not as demanding or transformative. Immediately after childbirth, mothers are typically assumed to have a complete life adjustment that involves a transformative change in daily routine, adapting to a new life with their babies which involves feeding, changing, tending to needs round the clock, and many more day-to-day responsibilities.  On the other hand, the father's role may be perceived as less demanding and immediate, as the responsibility of the father traditionally implies providing for the family, which is not necessarily a drastic change from their pre-fatherhood routine. This doesn't necessarily mean that the role of a father is easy or simple; it has its own challenges and difficulties. Fathers also have to adjust to new responsibilities and psychological changes with the arrival of the new family member, contribute to the active parenting needs, and provide emotional support to the mother who has undergone a significant physical and emotional event. It is important to note that these are stereotypical roles and modern societies increasingly recognize and encourage equal parenting.  However, taking the argument presented by the writers in context, it can be said that from a traditional standpoint and in terms of immediate change to day-to-day routine, the fathers, as compared to mothers, might \\"have an easier job to do\\". It's also important to note that this viewpoint might not hold true for every individual father or couple, as experiences and feelings towards parenthood can vary significantly on a case-by-case basis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since Tom is retired, he often has plenty of time to go fishing, and he even has a small cabin by the lake. The two men are planning to spend several days at the cabin cooking, fishing, chopping firewood to make fires and just general outdoor activities.  Is Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin higher or lower than Mark's?  Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, the question must be analyzed by taking into consideration various factors such as age, immune system efficiency, and general health condition of both Mark and Tom.  Tom, being a retiree, is likely to be in his late 60s or beyond, and as mentioned, the old age typically begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. During this stage, a person's stamina, strength, reflex time, senses, and the number of brain cells generally decrease. Moreover, the immune system, which plays a crucial role in protecting the body against illnesses and infections, becomes less efficient in older individuals. This reduced effectiveness of the immune system increases the risk of serious diseases such as cancer, pneumonia, and other age-related illnesses, like Alzheimer's. On the other hand, Mark has just graduated high school, which means he is most likely around the age of 18, placing him within the category of young adults. At this age, the immune system is generally more efficient compared to an older individual. Also, young adults usually possess better strength, stamina, and reflexes. Additionally, young people generally have fewer chronic illnesses and health complications compared to the elderly. Given the information, it is important to note that the risk of getting sick can be influenced by several factors other than age, including lifestyle habits, fitness level, or an individual's health condition. However, considering the general decline in immune system efficiency and the age-related factors that affect Tom, the likelihood of him getting sick while at the cabin is higher compared to Mark.  In conclusion, based on the factors discussed, Tom's chance of getting sick while at the cabin is likely to be higher than Mark's due to the age-related impacts on the immune system and the overall decline of physical and physiological functions in old age. However, this evaluation does not take into account their individual health conditions, habits, or fitness levels, which could also play a role in their susceptibility to illness.

Tämä tapahtuma tarjoaa mahdollisuuden urheilijoille eri puolilta maailmaa kisata toisiaan vastaan ja edustaa samalla omia maitaan.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"Depression affecting intelligence: Depression can have a significant impact on cognitive functioning, which may manifest as a perceived reduction in intelligence. While depression does not directly alter one's raw intellectual capacity, it can lead to cognitive impairments that make it difficult to think clearly, remember information, concentrate, and solve problems. This is known as 'cognitive fog,' which is a common experience for people suffering from depression. Several factors may contribute to this relationship between depression and cognitive functioning. These include biochemical changes in the brain, chronic stress, and sleep disturbances that are often associated with depression. Neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine play a significant role in both mood regulation and cognitive functioning, and imbalances in these chemicals may lead to the symptoms of depression as well as cognitive impairments. Depression can also indirectly impact intelligence by affecting one's motivation, energy levels, and the ability to engage in mentally demanding tasks. People with depression may find it more challenging to apply themselves to projects and tasks that require high levels of cognitive functioning. As a result, their performance may suffer, which could lead to a perceived decrease in intelligence. Moreover, studies have shown a bidirectional relationship between depression and cognitive decline, meaning that not only can depression contribute to cognitive impairments, but also cognitive decline may increase the risk of developing depression. Opium and the Emperor during the Qing Dynasty: During the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), opium was viewed as a severe social and political issue. The emperor and the imperial government were quite aware of the dangers that opium posed to society, and various measures were taken to curb the trafficking and consumption of this drug. At the beginning of the Qing Dynasty, opium was primarily used for medicinal purposes. It was not until the 18th and 19th centuries that the consumption of opium for recreational purposes became more widespread in China. The British East India Company played a significant role in the rise of opium consumption, as it sought to sell opium grown in British-controlled India to China to balance the trade between the two countries. Recognizing the detrimental effects of opium on the Chinese population, the emperor and the Qing government implemented several policies to ban and suppress its use. In 1729, Emperor Yongzheng officially banned the sale and smoking of opium for recreational purposes. However, the opium trade continued to thrive due to weak enforcement and increasing demand. In the 19th century, during the reign of Emperor Daoguang, efforts to counteract opium trade culminated in a series of events known as the First Opium War (1839-1842) and the Second Opium War (1856-1860). These conflicts resulted from China's attempts to ban the importation of opium, leading to military confrontations with foreign powers, mainly Britain. Despite the Qing Dynasty's efforts to eradicate the opium trade, these wars ultimately forced China to accept the legal importation of opium and led to a series of humiliating treaties that undermined China's sovereignty. Similarity between the two questions: The two questions address completely different topics and are not the same. The first question pertains to the relationship between depression and intelligence, focusing on psychological and neurobiological factors. The second question discusses the emperor's stance on opium during the Qing Dynasty, delving into historical accounts and the impacts of opium on society and politics. These two questions explore different dimensions and areas of knowledge, demonstrating no direct similarity between them."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Noise can be caused by many kinds of machines, such as motorcycles, planes, farm tractors and TVs. And, to some people, rock bands are also noise. What happens to people who live near noisy machines or use them over a period of time? Doctors find that noise pollution can influence both our health and behavior. It can cause high stress levels, hearing loss, sleep problems, and other harmful effects. Scientists use a unit  of measure  called a decibel to measure the loudness of a sound. The sound of a quiet room, for example, measures 35 decibels. Talk measures between 40 to 65 decibels. Sounds from traffic and from some rock bands can measure over 120 decibels.

Floodplains In very flat regions, flood water may spread out on the surface of the land. It then slows down and drops its sediment. If a river floods often, a floodplain develops. A floodplain is an area where a thick layer of rich soil is left behind as the floodwater recedes. Thats why floodplains are usually good places for growing plants. They are very flat areas and they have very rich soils. The Nile River valley is a great example of a floodplain. Each year, the Nile River rises over its banks. This floodwater carries a lot of sediment. This sediment has been eroded off areas of land from upstream. This sediment is dropped as the water slows down after spreading across the land. What is left behind is a very rich soil. Thats why crops can be raised in the middle of a sandy desert. Natural Levees A flooding river often forms natural levees along its banks.

Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The metallic bonding model explains the physical properties of metals. Metals conduct electricity and heat very well because of their free-flowing electrons. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end. When light is shone on to the surface of a metal, its electrons absorb small amounts of energy and become excited into one of its many empty orbitals. The electrons immediately fall back down to lower energy levels and emit light. This process is responsible for the high luster of metals.   Q: Why does metal conduct heat and electricity so well?   A: Answer:","output":"Metal conducts heat and electricity so well due to the presence of free-flowing electrons in its metallic bonding structure. These electrons, also known as conduction electrons, move freely throughout the metal lattice, allowing for easy transfer of energy in the form of heat or electric current. As electrons enter one end of a piece of metal, an equal number of electrons flow outward from the other end, ensuring efficient transfer of energy across the material. This free movement of electrons plays a crucial role in the high conductivity of metals for both heat and electricity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby.

Punjab is situated in the northern part of India and shares its borders with Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, and Rajasthan, as well as the Pakistani province of Punjab. The state has a rich cultural, historical, and agricultural significance in India. Punjab is known as the \\"land of five rivers\\" as it is irrigated by five major rivers: the Beas, Chenab, Ravi, Sutlej, and Jhelum. With a total area of 50,362 square kilometers, it is the 20th largest Indian state by area and has an estimated population of around 30 million people. The Malwa region occupies the central and southern parts of the state and is the largest region among the three areas. Malwa is known for its fertile soil and abundant agricultural production. The region is home to cities such as Ludhiana, Bathinda, Patiala, and Sangrur. Ludhiana is one of the industrial hubs of Punjab and famous for its hosiery and textile industries. Patiala is well-known for its rich Punjabi culture and tradition, including the Patiala Salwar and Patiala Peg. The Majha region is located in the central part of Punjab, between the rivers Beas and Ravi. This region has significant historical importance due to its proximity to the Harappa and Mohenjo-daro civilizations. The region includes cities like Amritsar, Gurdaspur, and Tarn Taran. Amritsar is home to the Golden Temple, the holiest shrine for Sikhs, and Jallianwala Bagh, a historic site commemorating the massacre of peaceful protesters by British forces in 1919. The Doaba region lies between the rivers Beas and Sutlej, and derives its name from the Punjabi words \\"Do,\\" meaning two, and \\"Ab,\\" meaning water or river, referring to the region between these two rivers.

Set the temperature to 425 ° f (220 ° c), and allow it to fully heat. OPT: I. The oven should be preheated when you plan to bake the gratin. If the oven has not been preheated yet, just turn it on and let it preheat.; II. If you've programmed your oven, it should come with an oven thermometer. Make sure it's set to 420 ° f (220 ° c) before you start cooking the gratin.; III. Make sure that there are no vents, as the temperature rises in your oven. Smear the butter and the flour over the surface of the gratin.; IV. Rub the garlic clove over a shallow baking dish. For the gratin, you'll need a fairly shallow baking dish.; Answer:","output":"IV. Rub the garlic clove over a shallow baking dish. For the gratin, you'll need a fairly shallow baking dish. Explanation: The correct option is IV because we already made sure that the oven is preheated. So, next we need to prepare the baking dish for the gratin. I is not correct because we already preheated the oven in the previous step. II is not correct because we already set the temperature to 425 ° f (220 ° c) in the preheating step.

They have known for a long time that the color of a room or the color of the light in it can affect our feelings and emotions. Many prisons and hospitals have at least one room that is painted pink. Officials have found that light and color can produce physical changes in our bodies. Professor Falfan worked with a group of 9 disabled children at school in Albert. Two of the children were blind. The other seven had normal sight. The scientists changed the color of the school room, then looked for changes in blood pressure, heart beat and breathing rate. The effects of color changes were the same for the blind children as for those with normal sight. Their blood pressure dropped from about 120 to 100. Similar changes were reported in heart-beat and the breathing. The children also were calmer and less excited. Then the colors of the room were returned to orange and white. Blood pressure, heart-beat and breathing rate went up and the children became excited again. Professor Falfan said different colors produce different levels of light energy. He said the differences seem to affect chemicals in the brain that carry messages from nerve to nerve and from nerve to muscle. After reading the passage we can conclude that   _  . A) blind people can be affected by colors, too B) one's heart will beat fast in a colorful room than in a white room C) the chemicals in the brain change with feelings and emotions D) if one's blood pressure drops, his breathing will get slower and slower The answer is:","output":"A) blind people can be affected by colors, too"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article:  France: The torch relay leg in Paris, held on April 7, began on the first level of the Eiffel Tower and finished at the Stade Charléty. The relay was initially supposed to cover 28 km, but it was shortened at the demand of Chinese officials following widespread protests by pro-Tibet and human rights activists, who repeatedly attempted to disrupt, hinder or halt the procession. A scheduled ceremony at the town hall was cancelled at the request of the Chinese authorities, and, also at the request of Chinese authorities, the torch finished the relay by bus instead of being carried by athletes. Paris City officials had announced plans to greet the Olympic flame with peaceful protest when the torch was to reach the French capital. The city government attached a banner reading \\"Paris defends human rights throughout the world\\" to the City Hall, in an attempt to promote values \\"of all humanity and of human rights.\\" Members from Reporters Without Borders turned out in large numbers to protest. An estimated 3,000 French police protected the Olympic torch relay as it departed from the Eiffel Tower and criss-crossed Paris amid threat of protests. Widespread pro-Tibet protests, including an attempt by more than one demonstrator to extinguish the flame with water or fire extinguishers, prompted relay authorities to put out the flame five times (according to the police authorities in Paris) and load the torch onto a bus, at the demand of Chinese officials. This was later denied by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, despite video footage broadcast by French television network France 2 which showed Chinese flame attendants extinguishing the torch. Backup flames are with the relay at all times to relight the torch. French judoka and torchbearer David Douillet expressed his annoyance at the Chinese flame attendants who extinguished the torch which he was about to hand over to Teddy Riner: \\"I understand they're afraid of everything, but this is just annoying. They extinguished the flame despite the fact that there was no risk, and they could see it and they knew it. I don't know why they did it.\\" What city in France did the torch relay start at?","output":"The torch relay leg in France started in Paris."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I was lucky enough to get three acne skincare packs from Aphelia Cosmetology for guest reviewers with acne to trial for me. I think that this is important because the treatment of acne is such a personalised journey that it is good to hear about the results of the skincare from a variety of people. In the third review of this series, Nalini from The Made Up Maiden has reviewed this acne set for me. Nalini is 30 and has troublesome skin. She has tried many products to fix it without a lot of luck. Here is Nalini's review: I've always thought the journey to clear skin can be quite a complicated one. There are just so many things that affect the condition of your skin; genetics, skincare, diet, hormones, weather, stress...the list is endless. In my case, both parents had acne when they were younger, and I had hopes that my acne would fade once I left my teens. My skin isn't completely horrendous, but I do have some minimal scarring on my cheeks (which goes away after a little while), and the odd large pimple on my chin during those hormonal times, which goes away after a while but is still really frustrating when it happens! I'm 30 years old, so it looks like these problems are here to stay. I have contemplated taking hormonal pills or medication aimed at reducing acne, but decided that the possible side effects haven't really been worth the benefit. As a result, I was really keen to explore the Aphelia Cosmetology range and see if it lives up to the promise of helping with acne troubled skin. I would classify my skin as combination, the t-zone gets a little oily towards midday, while the rest of my skin is pretty much classified as 'normal'. I received the following items. Question: Why did Nalini think that her acne would fade once she left her teens? Answer:","output":"Nalini thought that her acne would fade once she left her teens because it is a common belief that acne is predominantly a teenage issue, often linked to hormonal changes during adolescence. Additionally, both her parents had acne when they were younger, which might have led her to believe that her acne would follow a similar pattern and improve as she grew older."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Reusability: Both clothespins and paperclips can be reused multiple times on different bags or for other purposes. 4. Time and effort: Using clothespins or paperclips is a quick and easy process that requires minimal time and effort. Option 2 - Use a needle and thread: 1. Availability: Needle and thread may not be readily available in all households, and using it for closing a chip bag can be seen as a less practical option. 2. Ease of use: Using a needle and thread involves threading the needle, puncturing the bag, and sewing it closed. This may leave tiny holes in the bag and has a higher chance of spilling the chips. 3.

Who attacks a classmate with a wrench?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  On August 22, 2010 in rural Ohio, serial killer Edward Scarka is shot to death during a police raid of his farmhouse. At the time of Edward's death, married couple Sarah and John give birth to their son, Miles, in Pennsylvania. Miles shows extreme wisdom and intelligence from quite a young age, and begins speaking fluently before he is even a toddler. When Miles turns eight in 2018, Sarah and John begin noticing behavioral changes in him. One night he plays a prank on his babysitter Zoe, seriously injuring her, but claims no memory of the incident. Days later at school, he attacks a classmate with a wrench he obtains from the janitor's closet. Sarah brings Miles to psychologist Elaine Strasser, and also turns over a tape recording of Miles talking apparent gibberish in his sleep. Elaine gives the tape to a colleague, Arthur Jacobson, an expert on rebirth and reincarnation. Arthur reveals that the gibberish Miles spoke on the tape is in fact Hungarian, and that the words translate to \\"I'll cut your eyes out and watch you die, whore.\\" Unwilling to believe Arthur's assertion that an unsettled spirit is vying for control of Miles's body, Sarah dismisses him. Later at home, the family's dog goes missing, and John becomes infuriated when he finds that Miles has been recording the couple's bedroom with a baby monitor. John leaves to stay with his brother, leaving Sarah alone with Miles in the house. Miles awakens her in the middle of the night, and she finds a swarm of flies in the house.

[+] Spread orange peels inside soil..","output":"The correct approach would be to spread orange peels on top of the soil. Here are the steps and justifications for them: Step 1: Collect orange peels  You need to have enough orange peels to be efficient. The reason why we use orange peels is that snails don't like citrus fruits that much. Also, orange peel contains a substance named Limonene which repels insects and snails. This is why it's a good natural repellent. Step 2: Spread orange peels on top of the soil You spread them on top of the soil rather than incorporate them into the soil for multiple reasons. First, it's much easier to spread them on top. Also, it ensures that the peels and their scent act as a barrier, deterring the snails from coming to the plants. If the peels were inside the soil, their repellent effect wouldn't be as effective since snails crawl on top of the soil. By following these steps, you create a situation where snails are less likely to invade and damage your garden, and it's a safe and environment-friendly way to protect your plants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By gripping the pen with their fingers, a person can effectively engage in the act of writing on paper or other suitable surfaces. The fine motor skills and coordinated movements of the hand enable an individual to create precise strokes with the pen, resulting in well-formed letters, numbers, and other characters. In contrast, the other given options do not relate to writing with a steel pen in a practical or common-sense manner: - Warehouse: A warehouse is a large storage facility, typically for goods and merchandise. It is not directly related to writing with a steel pen and, thus, is not an appropriate choice. - Arm: Although the arm is involved in the physical act of writing, it alone is not sufficient for holding and manipulating a steel pen effectively. The hand, as mentioned above, is the body part designed for grasping and controlling writing utensils. - Desk drawer: A desk drawer is a storage compartment in a desk or similar furniture. While it might store writing instruments like a steel pen, it does not have the capability to grip or use the pen for writing. - Veterinary office: A veterinary office is a place where professional veterinarians provide medical care to animals. While people working in a veterinary office might use a steel pen to write prescriptions, records, or other documents, the location itself does not represent the act of writing with a steel pen and is irrelevant to the provided question. In summary, out of all the options provided, using a \\"hand\\" to write with a steel pen is by far the most logical and common-sense choice. It encompasses the human body's primary function for holding and operating writing tools, such as a steel pen, and allows for the creation of written content in a precise and controlled manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Gases cause pressure beneath the earth - The gases come to a head and push molten magma to the surface - The magma cools - With enough time the pressure builds up greatly - The resulting volcano may explode.  Question: suppose there is a great deal of underground activity happens, how will it affect LESS or SMALLER eruptions.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less A significant amount of underground activity can influence the frequency and size of volcanic eruptions, particularly smaller eruptions. To better understand this relationship, we must examine the processes and factors involved in volcanic eruptions and how underground activity could affect them. Volcanic eruptions occur due to the movement of molten rock, known as magma, beneath the Earth's surface. Magma forms when high temperatures and pressure cause the melting of rocks in the deep Earth. As magma rises towards the Earth's surface, the pressure within the magma decreases, allowing dissolved gases to expand and generate pressure. When this pressure becomes too much for the Earth's surface to handle, it can cause a volcanic eruption. Now, when there is an increase in underground activity, such as tectonic plate movements or fluctuations in the magma chamber, it can impact the frequency and size of eruptions. This is partly because the underground activity could cause changes in the pressure and available pathways for magma to rise to the surface. Here's how increased underground activity can lead to fewer or smaller eruptions: 1. Redistribution of magma: The increased underground activity may cause the magma to redistribute within the magma chamber or even between multiple chambers beneath the Earth's surface. This can lower the pressure at any single point, leading to fewer or smaller eruptions. 2. Release of pressure: The increased underground activity can create pathways for gases or magma to escape, which reduces the pressure beneath the Earth's surface. This can lead to smaller eruptions or even prevent eruptions from occurring entirely, as the decrease in pressure reduces the likelihood of an explosive event. 3. Changes in the composition of magma: Increased underground activity can lead to changes in the composition of the magma, which affects its viscosity and the ease with which it can rise to the surface. If the resulting magma becomes more viscous, it might have a more difficult time reaching the surface, leading to smaller eruptions or even no eruption. 4. Seismic activity: An increase in underground activity, such as earthquakes or shifting tectonic plates, could temporarily seal off pathways through which magma rises to the surface. This may delay eruptions and reduce their intensity or prevent them altogether. In summary, an increase in underground activity can lead to less or smaller volcanic eruptions due to changes in the pressure, pathways, and composition of the magma, as well as the seismic activity that could affect the Earth's crust. It's essential to note that the exact relationship between underground activity and volcanic eruptions is complex, and the outcomes can vary depending on numerous factors, such as the type of volcano, the duration and intensity of underground activity, and the geological history of the area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question. \\"What Greek genius said \\"\\"Eureka\\"\\" in the bathtub and is said to have invented a death ray?\\"","output":"To answer this question, I will look into famous Greek scientists, specifically those who are known to have made important discoveries or inventions and are associated with the term \\"Eureka.\\" Step 1: Identify the Greek genius associated with the \\"Eureka\\" moment in a bathtub. Based on my knowledge of historical figures and their discoveries, Archimedes is the Greek genius who is known to have shouted \\"Eureka\\" in the bathtub. He made this exclamation upon discovering the principle of buoyancy, also known as the Archimedes' Principle, which states that an object submerged in a fluid experiences an upward force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. This discovery allowed him to solve a problem related to the purity of gold in the crown of King Hiero II of Syracuse. Step 2: Determine if Archimedes is also known to have invented a death ray. Archimedes is known for his many inventions and innovations in mathematics, physics, and engineering. Among the many inventions attributed to him is the myth of the \\"Archimedes' death ray\\" or \\"heat ray.\\" According to legends, during the Siege of Syracuse, Archimedes used large mirrors (or bronze shields) to focus sunlight on enemy Roman ships, causing them to catch fire and burn. While the reality of this invention is debated and its existence remains unproven, Archimedes is often associated with the concept. Based on these two steps, I can answer the question: The Greek genius who said \\"Eureka\\" in the bathtub and is said to have invented a death ray is Archimedes."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write the answer: What is one of the fictional languages spoken by the Elves in the fantasy works of J R R Tolkien?","output":"One of the fictional languages spoken by the Elves in the fantasy works of J. R. R. Tolkien is Sindarin. Sindarin is a complex and beautiful elvish language that Tolkien created as part of his legendarium, the fictional universe that encompasses the literary works of \\"The Hobbit,\\" \\"The Lord of the Rings,\\" and \\"The Silmarillion.\\" As an accomplished philologist, J. R. R. Tolkien had a deep love for languages and their creation, and Sindarin is widely considered one of his most artistically constructed languages. Sindarin is a member of the Elvish language family, which includes several other fictional languages like Quenya, Telerin, and Nandorin. Sindarin is primarily spoken by the Grey Elves (or Sindar) who remained in the western lands of Middle-earth rather than traveling across the sea to the Undying Lands. The language itself is inspired by Welsh, a Celtic language, and shares similar phonological and grammatical features. Phonologically, Sindarin is characterized by its unique consonant mutations, which are similar to those found in the Celtic languages. Consonant mutation involves the alteration of a consonant at the beginning of a word depending on the grammatical context. There are three primary types of mutations in Sindarin: soft mutation, nasal mutation, and stop mutation. Vowels in Sindarin are also influenced by a system called vowel affection, which can cause a change in the quality or length of a vowel, often based on historical sound changes. Sindarin grammar is quite complex, featuring a rich system of noun declensions and verb conjugations. Nouns in Sindarin have ten distinct cases: nominative, genitive, possessive, dative, locative, instrumental, allative, ablative, respectant, and a special vocative case, which is used when addressing someone directly. There are also four numbers (singular, plural, dual, and partitive plural) and three genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). Verbs in Sindarin are organized into five main classes, each with its own set of conjugations. The five classes are basic verbs (A-stem), derived verbs (I-stem), N-stem or nasal infix verbs, causative verbs, and verbs with a final -ya (called Ya-stem verbs). Sindarin verbs also express tense and aspect, using prefixes, infixes, and suffixes to indicate the past, future, perfect, and progressive forms. The vocabulary of Sindarin is vast, with many compound words and derivations created using an intricate system of roots, prefixes, and suffixes. This allows for the construction of meaningful and poetic expressions that fit well within the context of Tolkien's literary works. For example, the Sindarin word for \\"elf\\" is \\"edhel,\\" which is derived from the primitive root \\"ȝED,\\" meaning \\"first.\\" Similarly, the word for \\"star\\" is \\"elen,\\" which comes from the root \\"EL\\" meaning \\"lofty\\" or \\"noble.\\" Overall, Sindarin is a rich and fascinating language that showcases J. R. R. Tolkien's extraordinary skill as a linguist and world-builder. While Sindarin may be a fictional language, it has been admired by fans of Tolkien's work and students of linguistics alike, resulting in numerous language courses, resources, and even translations. The development of Sindarin and other elvish languages is a testament to the depth and intricacy of the world Tolkien created, adding a sense of realism and immersive quality to his timeless fantasy works."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Title: Unwatchable Review: I'm sorry.

Answer a question about this article: Academic higher education in Estonia is divided into three levels: bachelor's, master's, and doctoral studies. In some specialties (basic medical studies, veterinary, pharmacy, dentistry, architect-engineer, and a classroom teacher programme) the bachelor's and master's levels are integrated into one unit. Estonian public universities have significantly more autonomy than applied higher education institutions. In addition to organising the academic life of the university, universities can create new curricula, establish admission terms and conditions, approve the budget, approve the development plan, elect the rector, and make restricted decisions in matters concerning assets. Estonia has a moderate number of public and private universities. The largest public universities are the University of Tartu, Tallinn University of Technology, Tallinn University, Estonian University of Life Sciences, Estonian Academy of Arts; the largest private university is Estonian Business School.

We have this equation: 0 = -493*q + 483*q + 30 First, we need to combine the numbers that have \\"q\\" with them. So, we will add 493*q to both sides of the equation to cancel out the -493*q: 493*q + 0 = 483*q + 30 493*q = 483*q + 30 Now we will subtract 483*q from both sides to get all the \\"q\\" terms together: 493*q - 483*q = 30 When we take away 483*q from 493*q, we get 10*q: 10*q = 30 Now, to find the value of q, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 10: 10*q / 10 = 30 / 10 q = 3 So the answer is q = 3!

Article: The FA Cup winners qualify for the following season's UEFA Europa League (formerly named the UEFA Cup; until 1998 they entered the Cup Winners' Cup instead). This European place applies even if the team is relegated or is not in the English top flight. In the past, if the FA Cup winning team also qualified for the following season's Champions League or Europa League through their league position, then the losing FA Cup finalist was given the Europa League place instead. FA Cup winners enter the Europa League at the group stage. Losing finalists, if they entered the Europa League, began earlier, at the play-off or third qualifying round stage. From the 2015–16 UEFA Europa League season, however, UEFA will not allow the runners-up to qualify for the Europa League through the competition. Now answer this question: what about the FA Cup winner?","output":"The FA Cup winner qualifies directly for the following season's UEFA Europa League, a premier European football competition. The UEFA Europa League was formerly known as the UEFA Cup; up until 1998, the winning team entered the Cup Winners' Cup instead. Interestingly, the English team that wins the FA Cup is awarded a place in the Europa League regardless of their league standing or even if they are relegated from the English top flight. Historically, if the team who won the FA Cup had already qualified for the Champions League or the Europa League via their league position in the same season, the opportunity to participate in the Europa League was bequeathed to the losing team in the FA Cup final. This allowed the losing finalist a chance at European competition. Moreover, the FA Cup winners don't just get a position in the Europa League, they are parachuted directly into the group stages of the tournament. Losing finalists, if they were given the opportunity to participate in the Europa League, would typically start their campaign slightly earlier at the play-off or third qualifying round stage. However, it's important to note that this practice changed from the 2015–2016 UEFA Europa League season. The governing body, UEFA, made a decision that the runners-up would no longer qualify for the Europa League through the competition. This practice aimed to ensure that the place in the Europa League is primarily reserved for the FA Cup champions, emphasizing the significance and prestige of winning England's oldest and most famous cup competition. Consequently, the reward of European participation underlines the importance of the FA Cup in the football calendar and provides an additional incentive for teams competing in the tournament."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Background: Oleg Aleksandrovich Prudius (Russian: Oleg Aleksandrovich Prudius; Ukrainian: Oleg Oleksandrovich Prudius, Oleh Oleksandrovych Prudius; born April 27, 1979) better known by his ring name Vladimir Kozlov, is a Ukrainian-American producer and retired professional wrestler. He is best known for his time in WWE, where he won the WWE Tag Team Championship once with Santino Marella. He is trained in freestyle wrestling, rugby, football, sambo, kickboxing, judo, jujutsu, Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts. Prudius has also worked as a stage and screen actor, notably having a small role in Spike Lee's 25th Hour., and a walk-on role in the second season of the HBO series The Wire. Context: On April 13, 2009, Kozlov was drafted to the ECW brand as part of the 2009 WWE draft, as ECW's only pick of the night. Shortly after the draft, his character was tweaked to further highlight the training he received within the Russian military. He won his first match on the brand when he easily defeated a local competitor. On the June 30 episode of ECW on Syfy, he teamed with William Regal to defeat Christian and Tommy Dreamer. His first defeat in singles competition on ECW came on the July 9 episode of ECW, where he lost a #1 contenders match to Christian for Tommy Dreamer's ECW Championship at Night of Champions.  On July 21, Kozlov began an angle with Ezekiel Jackson in which, week after week, after one of them had easily defeated a local competitor, the other would come out and execute their finishing move on the fallen opponent in a game of one-upmanship. On the August 18 episode of ECW, Jackson was set to team with ECW Champion Christian against the team of Kozlov and number-one contender William Regal. Jackson turned on Christian, forming an alliance with Regal and Kozlov. Kozlov and Jackson aided Regal in his feud with Christian over the ECW Championship, but Regal was unable to capture the title.  On the December 15 episode of ECW, Kozlov came out with Regal to face Jackson in an ECW Homecoming battle royal qualifying match. During the match, Regal turned on Kozlov by pulling his feet while at ringside, which ultimately cost him the match. After the match, Kozlov attempted to attack Regal, but Jackson jumped him from behind and both proceeded to attack Kozlov. This split Kozlov from the Ruthless Roundtable, making him a face character. Question: Did he have any other winning matches? Answer:","output":"Yes, Vladimir Kozlov had other winning matches throughout his career. As a professional wrestler, Kozlov competed in numerous matches and achieved victories both in singles and tag team competition. Although specific matches and results are not mentioned in the provided context, it is evident from his career history and the fact that he won the WWE Tag Team Championship with Santino Marella, that Kozlov had multiple winning matches."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Intense fighting between the military and Islamist militants in northern Nigeria is reported to have killed at least 185 people, however the army has disputed this figure.","output":"Title: Intense Clashes in Northern Nigeria Raise Concerns: Disputed Death Toll Surpasses 185 Lives Introduction Intense fighting between the military and Islamist militants in northern Nigeria has led to the tragic loss of at least 185 people, marking one of the most violent incidents in the region in recent memory. Though the Nigerian army disputes this death toll, the scale of the devastation is alarming and warrants further investigation. In this article, we delve into the events that led to the conflict and explore the region's history with respect to insurgency and the military's response, touching upon the possible implications for national security and stability. Background: Northern Nigeria and the Struggle with Insurgency Northern Nigeria has long been plagued by instability and violence, with various militant groups finding steady recruitment grounds among the region's disenfranchised population. Indeed, poverty levels and unemployment rates are significantly higher in the region compared to the rest of Nigeria. Consequently, religious extremist groups such as Boko Haram and the Islamic State of West Africa Province (ISWAP) have been able to gain a stronghold in the area, stoking conflict in the push for an Islamic state. Nigeria's military has been fighting a long, difficult battle against these insurgents, with numerous reports of casualties on both sides. Despite ongoing efforts from the army and international aid, the situation has persisted and, in some cases, intensified. Recent Intense Fighting: Encounter with Islamist Militants The recent bout of intense fighting between the military and Islamist militants in northern Nigeria has left a disputed number of casualties in its wake. Although official reports from the Nigerian army are yet to be confirmed, local sources and security experts estimate that at least 185 people have been killed. The conflict, which erupted over a series of days, pitted Nigerian forces against extremist militants in a rural locality. The militants' use of sophisticated weaponry and guerilla tactics has prompted concerns that they might be growing in strength and reach. Meanwhile, the Nigerian army's response has been criticized for inadequacy in terms of strategy, intelligence, and equipment. The stakes for Nigeria's military are high as it fends off multiple insurgency threats while grappling with limited resources. In this context, the large-scale casualties and losses inflicted by the recent skirmishes come as a huge blow to forces already stretched thin. Potential Consequences The ongoing violence in northern Nigeria poses grave risks for the nation's stability and security. The recent skirmishes are yet another indication that Nigeria is facing a daunting challenge as it tries to contain extremist elements and secure a more peaceful future for its inhabitants. The mounting death toll, regardless of the exact figure, underscores the importance of developing robust solutions to the problem. Moreover, it is critical to understand how this volatile situation extends beyond Nigerian borders. As Islamist militants continue to forge connections with similar groups in the region and across Africa, their influence and threat potential multiply. Accordingly, the international community must consider the risk of spillover effects and regional destabilization. Conclusion The recent violence between the Nigerian military and Islamist militants in the northern region is disastrous not only for the loss of at least 185 lives but also for the potential implications of this ongoing conflict. Failure to effectively combat and dismantle these extremist groups could have far-reaching consequences, not only for Nigeria but also for the entire region. Therefore, the Nigerian government and the international community must work in unison to devise comprehensive, long-term strategies to address the root causes of this crisis and enhance security for millions of affected people across the region."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

's far too sentimental","output":"To determine whether the phrase is positive or negative, let's analyze it step by step: Step 1: Read the phrase and identify the main keywords - The main keywords here are \\"far too sentimental.\\" Step 2: Analyze the keywords for sentiments - \\"Sentimental\\" can carry a positive connotation when it describes feeling emotional in a touching or nostalgic way. However, in this phrase, \\"sentimental\\" is modified by the term \\"far too,\\" suggesting excessiveness or going beyond what may be considered appropriate or desirable. Step 3: Determine the overall sentiment - Considering the context and the modifier \\"far too,\\" the phrase \\"'s far too sentimental\\" leans towards a negative connotation. The statement implies that something is overly emotional or excessively sentimental, which might not be perceived positively by the speaker. In conclusion, the phrase \\"'s far too sentimental\\" would likely be considered negative by most people due to the excessiveness suggested by the term \\"far too.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The album  was recorded in Los Angeles, California with Reign in Blood producer Rick Rubin. PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\".  Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without. I guess at that time, Kerry was hitting a dry spell.\\" King has also been critical of the album in general, describing it as one of his least favorite Slayer albums. He feels  vocalist Tom Araya moved too far away from his regular vocal style, and \\"added too much singing\\".

In 1991, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and Cuban Americans made up 80% of the Latino population in the United States.

They are the least well educated major ethnic group and suffered a 3% drop in high school completion rate while African Americans experienced a 12% increase between 1975-1990.

At times when it is favorable to lawmakers, Latinos were considered \\"white\\" by the Jim Crow laws during the Reconstruction. In other cases, according to Paul Brest, Latinos have been classified as an inferior race and a threat to white purity. Latinos have encountered considerable discrimination in areas such as employment, housing, and education.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Speakers of different languages not only describe the world differently but think about it differently too, according to a new study. Researchers used a cartoon cat Sylvester to study how language was reflected   in the gestures people made. Dr. Sotaro Kita of the University of Bristol's Department of Experimental Psychology  , showed the cartoon to a group of native English, Japanese and Turkish speakers and then watched their gestures as they described the actions they had seen. He found speakers of the three different languages used different gestures to describe the same event, which appeared to reflect the way the structure of their languages expressed that event. For example, when describing a scene where the cat swings on a rope, the English speakers used gestures showing an arc trajectory    and the Japanese and Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not the arc. Dr. Kita suggests this is because Japanese and Turkish have no proper verb to express the English meaning \\"to swing\\". While English speakers use the arc gesture as their language can readily express the change of location and the arc-shaped trajectory, Japanese and Turkish speakers cannot as easily express the idea of movement with an arc trajectory so they use the straight gesture. Dr. Kita said, \\"My research suggests that speakers of different languages cause different spatial   images of the same event in a way that matches the expressive possibilities of their own languages. In other words, language influences   spatial thinking at the moment of speaking.\\" Question: 70.What is mainly discussed in the text? Options: A: Differences between languages.

Her college friends Sudha Mathur (Sabeeha) and Sunil (Javed Jaffrey) try to help her sort through her visions but to little avail. Devi is relieved after she talks to her sister and finds that she is alive. However, just some time later, Rama is murdered in the same way as Devi had pictured. The murderer hides Rama's body in a mansion's wall. Rama is reported missing. Devi firmly believes Rama is dead. Five years later, Devi moves to her uncle (Ajit Vachani)'s home where she eventually meets and is courted by millionaire businessman Ram Kumar (Jackie Shroff). Sunil, who was secretly in love with Devi, is deeply disappointed. Devi and Ram marry and enter his family mansion, which he has re-earned after a legal battle. Little known to anybody, this is the same mansion where Rama was buried. When Devi starts having the visions again, Rama's skeleton is not the only thing that will come tumbling out. Devi sees a wall in the mansion being torn down. Devi tears down the wall, only to find a skeleton tumbling out of it. Devi knows whose skeleton it is: it's Rama's, since she had a necklace similar to Devi's. Also, the dead woman's skeleton is roughly same height as that of Rama. The Inspector (Shivaji Satam) quickly points out that since the mansion was closed when Rama disappeared, anyone could have hidden a dead body in there and nobody would know the truth. However, he doubts that the dead woman is Rama: Several such necklaces are available. Devi now gets another vision of another woman getting murdered.

Negative Sentiment Title: Dissonance \\"Dissonance\\" is a film that certainly had potential, but unfortunately, it fails to live up to the hype. From its disjointed story structure to its underdeveloped characters, this movie leaves the audience feeling unsatisfied with a lot more to desire. The film starts off with an interesting premise that quickly disintegrates into a meandering and confusing plot. The fast pacing of the movie doesn't give the viewer enough time to invest emotionally in the characters or grasp the intricacies of the storyline. It becomes evident that \\"Dissonance\\" bites off more than it can chew, presenting a complex web of subplots that don't seem to connect or complement each other in any coherent manner. The cinematography, while at times visually captivating, falls short by relying on gimmicky and overused techniques that distract from the story. The film's saving grace, its stellar cast, is utterly wasted on poorly written characters with little depth, development, or motivation. The actors' talents are not given the opportunity to shine, with the script failing to provide nuanced or emotional dialogue that could have given life to these otherwise uninspired characters. Moreover, \\"Dissonance\\" contains tonal inconsistencies that only add to the movie's flaws. Some scenes dive abruptly into heavy-handed political commentary, while others attempt a lighthearted, comedic touch - a jarring inconsistency which leaves the viewer bewildered. This lack of tonal cohesion also highlights the film's inability to seamlessly blend various narrative elements together. Ultimately, \\"Dissonance\\" ends on a disappointingly predictable note, offering no fresh insights or unique ideas to warrant attention or praise. Despite a talented cast and an intriguing initial concept, the film stumbles over its flimsy storytelling, poorly developed characters, and inconsistent tone. It's a frustratingly missed opportunity that cannot overcome the sum of its many flaws, leaving a sour taste in the mouth of the viewer."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....","output":"The last name of the person who is believed to have spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries is Lochner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - bloody marks - open sores - different - schizophrenia - anxiety  The rationale to choose \\"open sores\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"Picking at one's skin often results in open sores. This is due to the physical damage that the individual inflicts on their skin, usually repeatedly, during the picking process. There are several reasons why the other options are not the best answer: 1. Bloody marks: While it is possible that picking at the skin can result in bloody marks, this is not always the case. Moreover, the primary outcome of picking at the skin would be open sores, which may or may not be bloody. Therefore, choosing \\"bloody marks\\" as an answer would only cover a part of the potential outcomes and would not be as accurate as \\"open sores.\\" 2. Different: This choice is vague and does not directly relate to the consequences of picking at one's skin. It would be an inaccurate and unclear choice for the best answer. 3. Schizophrenia: Schizophrenia is a mental disorder characterized by hallucinations, delusions, and disorganized thinking. While it is possible for individuals with schizophrenia to engage in skin-picking behavior, the act of picking at one's skin does not directly result in the development of schizophrenia. Moreover, not all skin pickers suffer from this mental disorder. Therefore, choosing \\"schizophrenia\\" as the answer would be misleading and incorrect. 4. Anxiety: Although anxiety can be a contributing factor to skin-picking behavior, it is essential to differentiate between the cause and the consequence of skin picking. Anxiety may lead to skin picking, but it is not the direct outcome of the behavior itself. The act of repeatedly picking at one's skin will most likely result in open sores, which is why it should be chosen as the best answer. In conclusion, the most accurate answer when considering the direct outcome of picking at one's skin would be \\"open sores.\\" This choice encompasses the primary physical consequence that individuals experience after engaging in skin-picking behavior. While other options may be indirectly related to the act of picking at the skin, they are not the main result and thus are not as accurate as the answer \\"open sores.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

His opportunity comes when a detachment of Mexican soldiers escorting a shipment of gold passes through the town.

Context: Cooking food is something we have done since the first caveman threw a mammoth steak on the fire. While it is true that cooking does cause chemical changes in food and a loss of some nutrients, it is a clear case of being alert and not alarmed. Every time we cook food, there is some degree of nutrient loss. Exposing food to heat, oxygen or light alters the nutrients found in food. It is not all bad news though because cooking food also has its advantages. Cooking food can increase its digestibility, meaning you will get more nutrients out of it. And even though there may be less of some nutrients from cooking, it is swings and roundabouts as the availability of certain phytonutrients increases. And of course, let’s not forget that heating food kills some of the nasty microbes that can cause food poisoning. The principle behind a raw food diet is that cooking food destroys the natural enzymes and nutrients that would otherwise give us optimal health and control body weight. A raw food diet is almost entirely plant-based and includes fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, grains, vegetable oils and juices in their natural uncooked state. Now on the pro side for a raw food diet, it means if you are currently eating a lot of processed food, then switching to raw food will be a clear nutritional win. So that gets a big tick. Unquestionably, there are many benefits to eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. These foods are high in nutrients and fibre and low in kilojoules. But is raw superior to cooked? A review of 28 research studies found eaters of both cooked and raw vegetables had a lower risk of cancer compared to people who did not eat many vegetables in the first place. Where the science gets murky is the claim that raw food is better because cooking destroys the enzymes found in plants. It is 100 percent correct that cooking will do this. But so too does digestion. Few enzymes survive their trip through the hydrochloric acid spa bath in the stomach. And those plant enzymes are essential only to the plants. The...

And the Reward and Employee Benefits Association (Reba), which represents HR workers for some of the UK's largest firms, said the move would affect lower paid earners the most. \\"It will be the 'just about managing' employees which will be most affected by no longer having access to so many health and wellbeing benefits and mobile phones,\\" said Debi O'Donovan, director at Reba. \\"While the Reward & Employee Benefits Association agrees that the government did need to clamp down on the increasing misuse of salary sacrifice for more 'luxury' perks, we are disappointed that so many essential employee benefits have been caught up in this change.\\" However, the Treasury estimates that of the £200m per year that it expects to save, more than half will come from higher rate earners.

In its consultation document, it gives the example of a 24-month mobile phone contract worth £1,000.

All its life it had been asleep, but now it hardly got a chance for a nod, so swiftly did big events and crashing surprises come along in one another's wake: Friday morning, first glimpse of Real Nobility, also grand reception at Aunt Patsy Cooper's, also great robber raid; Friday evening, dramatic kicking of the heir of the chief citizen in presence of four hundred people; Saturday morning, emergence as practicing lawyer of the long-submerged Pudd'nhead Wilson; Saturday night, duel between chief citizen and titled stranger.

Wave motion: Imagine when you drop a stone in a pond, and you see ripples moving away from where the stone splashed. Those ripples are an example of wave motion. A wave is a movement that carries energy from one place to another, like how the water in the pond moves after the stone is dropped.

If one car appears to be moving backward, we call it \\"retrograde motion.\\" This term is often used to describe how planets sometimes appear to move backward in the sky when we look at them from Earth. They don't actually go backward, but because Earth and other planets move at different speeds and in different orbits, they can look like they are for a short time. To measure retrograde motion, we observe how the planets move over time and compare their positions at different points.

Wave motion is about how energy travels, while retrograde motion is about how planets sometimes appear to move backward in the sky."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: In 1971 , a main campus was completed in 33 MacDonnell Road for the new school . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","output":"No, the two sentences do not convey exactly the same information, although they share a number of similarities. Both sentences refer to the year 1971 and the completion of a campus at the same address 33 MacDonnell Road. However, they have different implications regarding the type and purpose of the school for which the campus was built. The first sentence states that the new campus was completed for a primary school. The term \\"primary school\\" refers specifically to a school that caters to children in the early stages of formal education, typically between the ages of 5 to 11, or grades 1 through 6. Thus, this sentence tells us that in 1971, a campus was constructed at 33 MacDonnell Road aimed to house a primary school. On the other hand, the second sentence mentions that a main campus was completed at the same address for a 'new school'. Unlike the first sentence, it does not specify the level of the school (e.g., primary, secondary, etc.), and only labels it as 'new'. The term 'main campus' also suggests that the school could possibly have additional buildings or campuses elsewhere, with the one on 33 MacDonnell Road serving as the main or central facility. This is something we do not get from the first sentence. Also, the first sentence mentions explicitly it's for a \\"primary school\\", suggesting that the campus might be designed to cater to the needs of younger children. The second sentence simply says it is a \\"new school\\" without specifying the type or level of the institution. This could potentially refer to any type of educational institution, not necessarily a primary school. In summary, although both sentences provide similar information about the completion of a campus in 1971 on 33 MacDonnell Road, the specific details regarding the purpose and the type of school for which the campus was intended differs in each sentence, making the information they convey not entirely identical."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences convey that the game creates a password after the successful completion of a level. 2. Both sentences imply the password is unique but the context is slightly different:     - Sentence 1 clarifies that the password is unique for the player name     - Sentence 2 only says that the password is unique, without referring to the player name 3. Both sentences mention 32-digit and alphanumeric password, but the order in which they appear is different:     - Sentence 1 says the password is \\"32-digit alphanumeric\\"     - Sentence 2 says it's \\"32-digit\\" but also it is \\"alphanumeric to the player name\\" - the meaning of \\"alphanumeric to the player name\\" is unclear and could be misinterpreted 4.

Q: Organisms that live in freshwater environments often possess a contractile vacuole that prevents cells from taking in too much water through what process?    Choices:  - electrolysis  - glycolysis  - hemostasis  - osmosis  A: A:","output":"Organisms that live in freshwater environments often possess a contractile vacuole that prevents cells from taking in too much water through the process of osmosis. Osmosis is a selective physical process that occurs in living cells and involves the spontaneous movement of solvent particles (typically water) across a semipermeable membrane from a region of lower solute concentration to a region of higher solute concentration. This movement equalizes the concentration of solutes (such as salts, sugars, and other molecules) on both sides of the membrane and helps maintain appropriate cellular conditions. Freshwater organisms, such as protozoa, algae, and some invertebrates, live in environments with significantly lower solute concentrations than their internal cellular environment. As a result, they face a continuous influx of water into their cells through the process of osmosis. The excess water uptake, if left unchecked, could cause cells to swell and eventually burst, leading to the death of the organism. To counteract this, freshwater organisms have evolved specialized organelles called contractile vacuoles. A contractile vacuole is a membrane-bound organelle that collects excess water from the cell and periodically expels it out of the cell, thus maintaining osmotic homeostasis and preventing the cell from taking in too much water. This process works as follows: 1. Excess water enters the contractile vacuole through channels created by special proteins embedded in the cell membrane, specifically aquaporins, which facilitate the transport of water molecules across the membrane. 2. The contractile vacuole gradually fills with water, along with waste materials that the cell wants to excrete. 3. When the vacuole is full, its surrounding membrane fuses with the cell membrane and contracts, expelling the water and waste products out of the cell and into the surrounding environment. 4. The vacuole then reforms, and the cycle begins anew. It is important to note that this process of osmoregulation is energy-driven, as the cells require energy in the form of ATP to power the contractile vacuole's activity and maintain cellular osmotic balance. To summarize, freshwater organisms possess contractile vacuoles to prevent their cells from taking in too much water through the process of osmosis. This specialized organelle plays a crucial role in osmoregulation, which allows these organisms to survive and thrive in their particular environments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Alexisonfire (pronounced \\"Alexis on fire\\") is a five-piece Canadian post-hardcore band that formed in St. Catharines, Ontario in 2001. The band consists of George Pettit (unclean vocals), Dallas Green (clean vocals, rhythm guitar, piano), Wade MacNeil (lead guitar, vocals), Chris Steele (bass guitar), and Jordan Hastings (drums, percussion). They describe their music as \\"the sound of two Catholic high-school girls in mid-knife-fight\\" (a reference to their song \\"A Dagger Through the Heart of St. Angeles\\", also the inspiration for their debut album cover art). Dallas Green informed the rest of the band of his intention to leave Alexisonfire in 2010. Green agreed not to announce his departure until the rest of the band decided on their future plans. On February 14, 2011, on their official Twitter page, Alexisonfire announced they had been writing new music for their fifth studio album, describing it as \\"so heavy it's going to make Dog's Blood look like a ska record\\". However, on August 5, 2011, Alexisonfire announced their intent to break up. In the statement, George Pettit cited Dallas Green's departure from the band to focus solely on City and Colour, Wade MacNeil's departure to join another band, later revealed to be as the new vocalist for Gallows, and other personal issues among the remaining members as reasons for breaking up. Pettit also described the break up as not being \\"amicable\\". Alexisonfire had planned on celebrating their tenth anniversary with one last headlining Canadian tour and \\"a series of releases\\", although Green had initially expressed reluctance to take part in any further shows with the band at the time.  For Record Store Day 2012, Alexisonfire and Dine Alone re-issued Math Sheet Demos, which featured demo recordings of songs prepared in the pre-production of their self-titled debut album.  In July 2012, Green stated he had been in contact with other ex-Alexisonfire members, and that he and MacNeil had been \\"starting to talk about doing some final [Alexisonfire] shows, because when we did play our last show nobody knew it was our last show.\\" In December 2012-15 months after the band's breakup announcement--Alexisonfire embarked on their international, farewell tour with stops in Canada, UK, Australia and Brazil, originally announced to be a nine-date tour.

I can use this background: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above.

Story is here to find the Author, a specific writer whose book will better humanity's future. After questioning residents Farber, Bell, Dury, and five nameless smokers, Heep discovers the author, Vick Ran, who is writing The Cookbook, containing views and ideas so significant they will inspire a future President, a great Midwestern orator, to greatly change the world for the better. Vick meeting Story eliminates his fear and sharpens his inner voice, but he learns he will be assassinated because of the controversial nature of his ideas. The Tartutic, an invincible simian trio that serve as the Blue World's peacekeepers, have forbidden Story from being attacked while returning home. The Scrunt nonetheless does just that because Story is destined to be a great leader as well. To recover from her wounds and return safely, she will now need the help of a Symbolist, a Guardian, a Guild, and a Healer.

The country observed a day of mourning on Sunday after its worst air disaster. Russian Air Transport Agency head Aleksandr Neradko has said the airliner disintegrated at high altitude. But Victor Sorochenko, the head of Russia's Interstate Aviation Committee, said it was too early to conclude what caused the Airbus A321 to crash. He told reporters debris had been found across a 20sq km-wide area of Sinai. So far 163 bodies have been found. The plane came down early on Saturday, shortly after leaving the resort of Sharm el-Sheikh for the Russian city of St Petersburg. Jihadists allied to so-called Islamic State (IS) in Sinai, where such groups are active, made a claim on social media that they had brought down flight KGL9268. But Egyptian Prime Minister Sharif Ismail said experts had confirmed that a plane could not be downed at 9,450m (31,000ft), the altitude the Airbus 321 was flying at, by weapons the militants are known to possess. Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has also urged caution, saying the investigation into the cause was a \\"complicated matter\\" that could take months. Russian Transport Minister Maksim Sokolov said no evidence had been seen that indicated the plane was targeted, and IS has not produced pictures or video footage to substantiate its claim. Analysis by BBC Monitoring found that a video purporting to show the downing of a plane did not appear to be an official IS clip, and was not shared on official IS channels. A number of major airlines - Emirates, Air France-KLM, Lufthansa, and Qatar Airways - have decided not to fly over the Sinai Peninsula until more information is available. Two smaller carriers, flydubai and Air Arabia, also said they would re-route flights, while Etihad Airways said it would avoid only \\"certain areas of airspace\\" over Sinai. Germany's transport ministry has told German airlines not to follow the same route taken by the Russian plane. British Airways said it regularly assessed the safety of its routes. BA said it would not confirm flight routes, but that it \\"would never fly a route unless it was safe to do so\\". Russian and French investigators have joined the Egyptian-led investigation, along with experts from Airbus, which is headquartered in France. Egyptian officials said some bodies had been recovered within a radius of 5km on Saturday, but that of a three-year-old girl was found 8km from the scene. The plane's flight recorders have been found and sent for analysis. Russia's transport regulator said on Sunday it would check all the airline's A321 planes, but Kogalymavia said this would not affect their operations. Egypt's civil aviation minister Hossam Kamal said there had been no sign of any problems on board the flight, contradicting earlier reports that the pilot had asked to make an emergency landing. An Egyptian ground service official who carried out a pre-flight inspection of the plane said the aircraft appeared to be in good shape \\"We are all shocked. It was a good plane. Everything checked out in 35 minutes,\\" the official told AP. However, the widow of the plane's co-pilot told Russian TV her husband had complained about the aircraft's technical condition. The plane was carrying 217 passengers, including 25 children, Russian transport authorities said. There were seven crew members on board. Most of the passengers were Russian, but at least three were Ukrainian and one Belarusian. The Russian government has said it will pay compensation to the victims' families and help organise funeral procedures. 05:58 Egyptian time (03:58 GMT): Flight leaves Sharm el-Sheikh, the Egyptian cabinet says in a statement 06:14 Egyptian time (04:14 GMT): Plane fails to make scheduled contact with air traffic control based in Larnaca, Cyprus, according to Sergei Izdolsky, an official with Russia's air transport agency 06:17 Egyptian time, approx (04:17 GMT): Plane comes down over the Sinai peninsula, according to Airbus 11:12 Egyptian time (09:12 GMT): Flight had been due to land in St Petersburg's Pulkovo airport Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses the crash of a Russian Airbus A321 plane in the Sinai Peninsula, which resulted in the death of all 224 people on board.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Almost four decades after meeting in high school, these two formerly single friends have tied the knot after promising each other they would if they weren’t married to other people when they were 50.      Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer met as students at Saint Agnes School in Minnesota almost 37 years ago. The friendship between Dean, the then-freshman, and Palmer, a senior, soon blossomed into a relationship. Yet, the two eventually went their separate ways once the school year came to a close.      “We dated most of my senior year, and we broke up but remained friends,” Palmer, 54, tells PEOPLE. “I wanted to go sow my oats, so to speak, and I was honest with her. I decided to go have my fun, and I thought girls were a dime a dozen. But I never developed as good as a relationship with anyone else as I had with her.”      A few years after they graduated, they married other people — Palmer’s marriage lasted seven years, and Kimberly’s marriage blessed her with two children, Kayla and Konner, before she got a divorce in 1998. But the two former lovebirds kept in contact throughout the years.      Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer Kimberley Dean      RELATED: Community Helps Couple Get Their Dream Wedding After Cancer Journey: ‘She Stuck by Me,’ Says Groom      “We’re very comfortable around each other,” Dean, 51, says. “We do the complete the sentences and laugh at each other’s stupid jokes kind of thing. We’re kind of like a yin and a yang.”      Palmer says Dean was always someone he could turn to, even while he was dating other women when they were just friends.      “I’d either get a letter or a phone call every once in awhile. When I was dating other girls and having issues, I would call her and she would help me through those times,” Palmer remembers. “It was a super good friendship, and it went back and forth like that for a long time.”      The two say they never went more than six months without talking to each other, and during one of their many conversations when they were in their 30s, the two made a pact: if they weren’t married again by the time they were both over the age of 50, they would marry each other.      The two figured it was just a light-hearted joke that would never come true, that is, until 2016, when Dean brought it up again, 37 years after they first dated.      “It was like a lightbulb went off,” Dean recalls. “And I told him, ‘Do you remember this stupid pact we made?’ ”      Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer Kimberley Dean      RELATED: Bride with Stage 4 Cancer Lives to See Wedding Day After Doctors Urged Her to Move Up Ceremony      Palmer did remember, and the pact they made so long ago was about to make a real impact on both of their lives.      “She asked if we should try it again,” Palmer says. “I told her, you know, we’re risking a real incredible friendship, because if it doesn’t work this time, I don’t know how we could still remain friends.”      Though he was apprehensive, it didn’t take long for him to come around.      “I did hesitate when she asked me, but I could see we still had feelings for each other,” Palmer says. “And it’s been fantastic ever since.”      On New Year’s Eve 2017, Palmer proposed, and the couple married on June 1, completing the promise they made to each other so long ago.      “It started out as just a complete random joke and never in a million years did we both think we would have ended up in the same place at the right time,” Dean says. “Because I mean, we’ve been in different relationships, and now here we are!”      The newlyweds want others to remember that when they break up with someone, they don’t have to become enemies — stay friends when you can, because you never know what awaits in the future.

We’re still friends, but we’re married. So don’t give up.”      When asked if anything felt different now that they are married, Dean says things are similar, except with one special difference.      “It’s pretty much the same,” she says. “Only happier!” ||||| MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) — We have seen this story before in the movies: Two friends agree if they are still single someday, they will tie the knot.      “It’s more of a comedy [laughs]!” said Kimberley Dean of St. Paul.      For Dean and Ron Palmer, this is not a movie — it is real life.      “It honestly started as a joke,” Dean said.      Their story actually begins 37 years ago, when Dean and Palmer met at Saint Agnes School. They soon started dating.      “She loves everybody and everything,” Palmer said. “There’s not a jealous bone in her body, there’s not a prejudice bone in her body.”      But like many young loves, it fizzled out. They both went on to marry other people, but they stayed friends throughout the years — through marriages, children and divorce.      Eventually, they made a pact.      “I said, ‘OK, you know what? If you’re not married and I’m not married, we’ll just get married,’” Dean said.      The deadline was at age 50, and they are both just over 50 now, but they are staying true to their word. Palmer proposed on New Year’s Eve, and they’re getting married on Friday.      “We love each other,” Dean said. “We’ve always known that, I think, we were meant to be together,” Dean said.      They say you should marry your best friend. Dean and Palmer have close to four decades under their belt, and a lifetime to go. ||||| Video (02:54) : Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer are making it official this Friday. The duo said what started as a joke has turned into a match many had long seen coming.      If Kimberley Dean and Ron Palmer’s 37-year romance sounds like a TV show, that’s because it was one. “How I Met Your Mother,” to be exact, in which two characters agreed to marry if both were single at 40.      Their Friday wedding fulfills a similar pact they made a few years back, according to Kimberley: “Ron was talking about all his benefits through work and not having anyone to give them to. Just jokingly, I said, ‘The last one who turns 50, which would be me, if I’m not married and you’re not married, we’re just going to marry each other.’ He said, ‘Done!’ — never imagining any of this would happen.”      Well, it’s happening.      Kimberley, 51, and Ron, 54, will marry in Como Park’s Japanese Garden — not Ron’s first choice of location, which he jokes would be the zoo, where Casey, the famed gorilla, could witness.      It could be argued that Casey (who now resides at the Louisville Zoo) would be an appropriate guest because maybe he could address the 400-pound gorilla in the room: Can a marriage that began with a jokey pact work?      “Oh, absolutely,” says Kimberley. “I have no second, third or fourth doubts in my head. Now that we’re getting so close, details like needing to call the florist lady, I am stressed about those things. But marrying him? I’m not stressed at all. I’ve been divorced since 1998, so I go in with my eyes completely wide open.”      Kim Dean and Ron Palmer, at a spot on the second floor of St. Agnes School where Kim used to wait to catch a glimpse of Ron coming down the stairs from the high school classrooms upstairs. (Plus an old photo of the couple.)      The key element to Kimberley and Ron’s relationship is that they’ve been friends for 37 years. They met at St. Agnes School, where she was an eighth-grader and he was a junior.      “I would watch him come down the stairs when the high school kids were changing classes and we would wave at each other,” says Kimberley, who works in the Roseville Community School District’s youth enrichment program. “We ended up taking a picture together and, by fall of the following school year, when I was a freshman and he was a senior, we were dating.”      Like many a high school romance, this one didn’t last.      “I wanted to go sow my oats, so to speak. So we went our separate ways,” says Ron, a safety coordinator for Xcel Energy. “By the time I felt like maybe we should give it a try again, she had met somebody else and got married and then I went off and got married.”      Three decades of not-quite-right timing ensued.      Ron’s marriage only lasted seven years. Kimberley’s was longer — and gave her daughter and maid of honor Kayla and son Konner, who will give her away — but she, too, divorced. A second stab at dating didn’t feel right, but they continued to keep in touch.      “I don’t think six months ever went by in all this time that we weren’t in contact,” says Ron. “She helped me a lot. After my marriage and with me having numerous girlfriends over the years, I would always call Kim when I had something to complain about: ‘Why do women do this?’ She was my go-to person.”      “He would still call my mom after all those years, wishing her a happy Mother’s Day,” says Kimberley. “He would call if he had girl trouble. I would call him to take a dead hamster out of my son’s cage because I didn’t want to touch it.”      According to Kimberley, the “pair of goofballs” had an unbreakable bond, one which is expressed in “their” song, REO Speedwagon’s “Keep on Loving You.”      “Over the years, I would get a call that said, ‘Turn on KS95’ and there it would be or I would hear the song come on and text her and, if she didn’t answer, I’d leave the radio playing it on her phone,” says Ron.      REO could practically have been talking about them in the lyrics to that hair band classic: “When I said that I loved you, I meant that I loved you forever.”      “I think we both knew, even in high school, that we were supposed to be together,” says Kimberley.      Ron agrees: “I truly did love her back when we were kids. I’ve always loved her. She’s such an awesome friend.”      ‘It can happen’      Friendship started to look like something else when they went to Roseville’s Taste of Rosefest the summer of 2016. Afterward, their conversations became more frequent. Soon, Ron invited Kimberley to his hunting cabin in Finlayson, Minn.      That’s where Kimberley popped the question. Well, a question.      Ron Palmer held a note that’d he’d written to Kim Dean - and that she kept - when they were teenagers at St. Agnes School.      “I don’t remember exactly what I said but it was along the lines of: ‘What do you think if we try this again?’ ” Kimberley recalls. “There was a lot of hesitation on his part. He told me later he worried that, if a relationship didn’t work, we would lose one of the very best friends we ever had.”      “That was a big risk,” agrees Ron. “But we decided to try.”      This time, it took.      Ron iced the deal last New Year’s Eve Up North, when he suggested they investigate frozen Gooseberry Falls. Worried about falling or freezing to death in the below-zero temperatures, Kimberley took one look at the ice and headed for the warmth of their car. But, when she turned back, Ron was on one (very frigid) knee, holding a tiny blue Tiffany’s box.      Long story short: She said “yes.” To the surprise of no one.      “It felt like it was supposed to happen, like it was meant to be,” says Kayla Dean. “I would say there’s no better match in the world for either of them.”      Put Kayla firmly in the knew-it-all-along camp.      “Out of everyone my mom has ever been with — even thinking about my dad, who we don’t have a relationship with — I would say Ronnie has filled that father role for Konner and me,” says Kayla, who thinks there’s a lesson in her mom’s romance. “People who are meant to be together will always find each other. It may take 37 years, but it can happen.”      Kim Dean and Ron Palmer, at a spot on the second floor of St. Agnes School where Kim used to wait to catch a glimpse of Ron coming down the stairs from the high school classrooms upstairs.      The benefit of time      Ron and Kimberley agree they may have needed all of those years to become a marriage-ready couple.      “When she got married, I thought, ‘Ah, she’s gone,’ but, as a young man in my 20s, I thought women were all over the place and I could get along with any of them. I thought that was the norm,” says Ron. “As it turns out, and as I have learned, it is not. I never got along with anyone else as well as I got along with her.”      “The only thing that sucks is that we’re in our 50s. How much time do we have left?” asks Kimberley, who adds that “we had to go through all those relationships — the good, the bad, the ugly, the complete heartbreak — to get to where we are right now. We’ve even talked about, if we had gotten married all those years ago when we were younger, would we still be together?”      Maybe not.      Marriage expert William Doherty says statistics on young marriages are not promising.      “Knowing each other better, as they do now, is generally better, but [this situation] is so unusual. They do know more of what they’re getting than lots of people who get married do,” says Doherty, professor of family social science at the University of Minnesota.      “I’m not predicting bad things but many people who have lived together get married and say that not much is going to change, that it’s just a piece of paper. But that’s not how it works. When people get married, things really change.”      Kimberley and Ron have gotten a taste of that change since he moved into her Como Park home about a month ago. There’s been a learning curve — she’s maybe a little neater than he is — but both say it’s going great.      In fact, living together has helped remind Ron what it was like to fall in love with Kimberley all those years ago.      “When we were kids, we would walk down the Midway at the State Fair and the fireworks would go off,” says Ron. “If we were together, we would always stop and watch.”      Anyone who has seen an old movie knows what it means when they cut from kisses to fireworks: passion. So it’s appropriate that those State Fair fireworks still lit up the sky during the decades when Kimberley or Ron weren’t together. And that this summer, 37 years after they met, the two will watch them as husband and wife for the very first time. ||||| Get Stuff We Love Subscribe to our newsletter.      A deal is a deal.

The two even got into a practical discussion about their work-related benefits.

But they quickly forgot about the deal as time passed. They remained in each other's lives, never going more than six months without talking to each other.

Palmer proposed a year later on New Year’s Eve.      On June 1, the couple got married in a garden ceremony in front of a waterfall. Dean's son walked her down the aisle and her daughter served as the maid of honor.

You are expected to return whether the given profession's gender is identifiable or unidentifiable. Problem:Sentence: The clerk hindered the chief at every turn and even gossiped about him.  Profession: clerk Solution:","output":"unidentifiable Explanation: To determine the gender of the \\"clerk\\" in the sentence, we need to look for any gendered pronouns or other indicators that would reveal the gender of the clerk. In the sentence, we can see the pronoun \\"him\\" is used, but it refers to the \\"chief\\" as indicated by the phrase \\"about him.\\" There is no gendered pronoun or clue to identify the gender of the \\"clerk,\\" so the answer is \\"unidentifiable.\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Towards the end of the Republic, religious and political offices became more closely intertwined; the office of pontifex maximus became a de facto consular prerogative. Augustus was personally vested with an extraordinary breadth of political, military and priestly powers; at first temporarily, then for his lifetime. He acquired or was granted an unprecedented number of Rome's major priesthoods, including that of pontifex maximus; as he invented none, he could claim them as traditional honours. His reforms were represented as adaptive, restorative and regulatory, rather than innovative; most notably his elevation (and membership) of the ancient Arvales, his timely promotion of the plebeian Compitalia shortly before his election and his patronage of the Vestals as a visible restoration of Roman morality. Augustus obtained the pax deorum, maintained it for the rest of his reign and adopted a successor to ensure its continuation. This remained a primary religious and social duty of emperors. How were Augustus's reforms viewed?","output":"Augustus's reforms were viewed as adaptive, restorative, and regulatory, which means people saw them as changes that helped adjust, fix, and manage things in their society, rather than bringing completely new ideas. People felt that he was working on improving and helping to maintain the traditions and customs they already had."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I loved the little guy from the day she brought him home. She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame. Question: Who does the narrator think Steve is closer to? Options:  A. not enough information  B. Neither  C. Miss Tennessee  D. Himself The answer is:","output":"C.

After the funeral of a seven-year-old boy, Lucius Hunt (Joaquin Phoenix) asks the village elders for permission to pass through the woods to get medical supplies from neighboring towns; however, his request is denied. Later, his mother Alice (Sigourney Weaver) admonishes him for wanting to visit the neighboring towns, which the villagers describe as wicked. The Elders also appear to have secrets of their own and keep physical mementos hidden in black boxes, the contents of which are reminders of the evil and tragedy they left behind when they left the towns. After Lucius makes a short venture into the woods, the creatures leave warnings in the form of splashes of red paint on all the villagers' doors. Meanwhile, Ivy Elizabeth Walker (Bryce Dallas Howard)âthe blind daughter of the chief Elder, Edward Walker (William Hurt)âinforms Lucius that she has strong feelings for him, and he returns her affections. They arrange to be married, but Noah Percy (Adrien Brody), a young man with an apparent developmental and learning disability, stabs Lucius with a knife because he is in love with Ivy himself. Noah is locked in a room until a decision is made about his fate. Edward goes against the wishes of the other Elders, agreeing to let Ivy pass through the forest and seek medicine for Lucius. Before she leaves, Edward explains that the creatures inhabiting the woods are actually members of their own community wearing costumes and have continued the legend of monsters in an effort to frighten and detract others from attempting to leave Covington. He also explains that the costumes are based upon tales of real creatures who once lived in the woods.

Question: Process: - An isotope has too many protons - The isotope is unstable - The isotope emits radiation - The isotope decays - The isotope loses some atomic particles - The isotope turns into a different element - The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation.  Question: suppose the isotope becomes more stable happens, how will it affect the isotope woud emit more radiation.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"When an isotope has too many protons, it becomes unstable and undergoes radioactive decay in an attempt to achieve a more stable state. This process can involve the isotope emitting radiation and losing atomic particles, eventually transforming it into a different element. The isotope will continue decaying and emitting radiation until it reaches a stable state. Now, if we suppose that the isotope becomes more stable, this means that the isotope has already undergone some decay and lost some atomic particles. As a result, the further decay and radiation emission will be influenced. If the isotope becomes more stable, it would typically emit less radiation. This is because stability corresponds to a decrease in the amount of excess energy that must be released for the isotope to achieve its desired stable state. In most cases, an increase in stability results in a decrease in the overall energy required to complete the decay process, which directly corresponds to a decrease in the emitted radiation. However, it is important to recognize that isotopes can decay through different processes that may have varying effects on emission rates. For instance, some decay processes may lead to a less pronounced reduction in radiation emission despite an increased stability. In others, the isotope might still emit a notable amount of radiation even after reaching a relatively stable state. To summarize, when an isotope becomes more stable, it will generally emit less radiation because the energy required for it to achieve a stable state has decreased. However, the specific effect on radiation emission can vary depending on the decay process and the particular isotope involved. In most cases though, increased stability results in a reduced radiation emission, allowing the isotope to move closer to a stable state without emitting more radiation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Database In recent years there was a high demand for massively distributed databases with high partition tolerance but according to the CAP theorem it is impossible for a distributed system to simultaneously provide consistency, availability and partition tolerance guarantees. A distributed system can satisfy any two of these guarantees at the same time, but not all three. For that reason many NoSQL databases are using what is called eventual consistency to provide both availability and partition tolerance guarantees with a reduced level of data consistency. Q: What explains the difficulty in a system containing availability, consistency, and partition tolerance guarantees?","output":"Imagine you have a big box of toy blocks. You need to share these blocks with your friends at different tables. In this case, the box of blocks is like a database and your friends are like different computers. Now, let's say you can make sure of three things: 1. Availability: All your friends can play with the blocks at any time. 2. Consistency: All your friends always have the same blocks. 3. Partition Tolerance: Even if some tables are split apart, your friends can still play with the blocks. But there is a rule: you can only choose 2 of these 3 things at the same time. Why is this hard? Let's see: - If we choose Availability and Consistency, it means all your friends can play all the time and they all have the same blocks. But, if some tables separate, your friends may not get all the blocks they need. - If we choose Availability and Partition Tolerance, it means all your friends can play even if the tables are separated, but they might not always have the same blocks. - If we choose Consistency and Partition Tolerance, it means everyone has the same blocks even when tables are separated, but sometimes your friends cannot play with the blocks. This is why it's difficult to have all three things – availability, consistency, and partition tolerance – at the same time in a system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Instructions: In this task the focus is on physical knowledge about the world. Given the provided goal task in the input, describe a process that would lead to the asked outcome. This process often involves physical motions with objects, such as moving them, arranging them in a certain way, mixing them, shaking them, etc.  Input: To bake a pie, you can Output:","output":"begin by following this process: 1. Gather all ingredients and necessary tools: First, consult your pie recipe and gather all the necessary ingredients, such as flour, sugar, butter, lard, salt, and the required filling ingredients (e.g., fruits, vegetables, eggs, milk). You'll also need tools like a mixing bowl, a rolling pin, a pie dish, and a knife or fork for cutting or pricking the dough. 2. Prepare the dough: Combine the flour, salt, and butter or lard in a large mixing bowl. Use your hands or a pastry cutter to combine the ingredients until they form a crumbly texture. Slowly add cold water to the mixture and continue to combine until the dough forms a ball. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 3. Roll out the dough: Lightly flour your work surface and rolling pin. Roll out half of the dough to form the bottom crust, ensuring it is large enough to fit your pie dish with some overhang. 4. Prepare the filling: While the dough is chilling, prepare your pie filling. If using fruits, wash, peel (if necessary), and chop them into bite-sized pieces. If making a savory pie, cook any vegetables, meat, or other fillings to the recipe's specifications. 5. Assemble the pie: Place the rolled-out dough into your pie dish and carefully press it against the bottom and sides. Trim any excess dough that hangs over the edge. Add the filling to the pie crust, being careful not to overfill it. 6. Roll out the top crust: Roll out the remaining dough to form the top crust. Place it over the pie filling, gently pressing the edges of the top and bottom crusts together to seal the pie. Trim any excess dough, and crimp the edge of the crust with a fork or your fingers. 7. Cut vents: With a knife or fork, cut a few slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape, ensuring even baking and preventing the pie from becoming soggy. 8. Bake the pie: Follow the recipe's instructions for baking time and temperature. Generally, pies are baked at a temperature of 375°F (190°C) for approximately 45-60 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling. 9. Allow the pie to cool: Allow your pie to cool on a wire rack for at least 1-2 hours before serving, allowing the filling to set and flavors to meld together properly. By following this process, I used the general knowledge of baking a pie, which involves physically handling ingredients and tools, to guide someone through the steps of making a pie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt Answer:","output":"The final step of the process after the metamorphic rocks melt is that they turn back into magma. This magma can eventually rise towards the Earth's surface due to tectonic activity, where it may contribute to the formation of new volcanic eruptions. The entire process is part of the rock cycle, which is a continuous series of events that transform rocks from one type to another over geological time scales. Once the magma is expelled through a volcano or an underwater vent, it can begin the process of cooling, crystallization, and rock formation all over again, maintaining the continuous nature of the rock cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Anna BradleyChair of Healthwatch England We know that patients are reluctant to make a fuss when standards slip on hospital wards. Many simply don't know how to make a complaint, others are actually scared of the consequences. Yet we often hear complaints referred to as 'gold dust' by hospital bosses in terms of improving services. You would think then that health and care organisations would be eager to hear from anyone who wanted to report a concern or complaint. However, our research suggests that tens of thousands of incidents are slipping under the radar because those who witness poor care and try to report it are being told, in one particular case, to \\"mind their own business\\". 'Civic-minded individuals' Responding to a Freedom of Information request, a third of hospitals across England told us that they don't record complaints from \\"third parties\\", ie those that witness rather than personally experiencing poor care. Many of the hospital trusts that replied incorrectly stated that such complaints cannot be investigated without the permission of the patient. Others said they record such incidents as informal feedback only, with no follow-up provided to the courageous and civic minded individuals complaining on behalf of vulnerable patients. In the worst cases some hospitals just flat out said they don't record these complaints. Even where these reports are recorded, they are often not included in formal stats allowing hospitals so their complaints data doesn't tell the true story. For me this is symptomatic of a much bigger problem around complaints handling in the NHS and social care services. The fact that doctors and nurses would rather tell one of these \\"citizen whistleblowers\\" they can't complain because they don't tick the right box or have the permission to make a complaint is just wrong. If a passer-by reports an abandoned bag in an airport, the staff don't say: \\"I'm sorry sir, but do you have the permission of the bag owner.\\" Rather they are thanked for their vigilance. If the policy makers and politicians are serious about driving culture change in the NHS then more needs to be done to wipe out this 'compute says no' attitude and encourage staff to welcome feedback - positive and negative. 'Long hard look' With the secretary of state for health's update on progress against the recommendations of the Francis inquiry expected in the next few weeks, I implore him to take a long hard look at the complaints question. In our report, 'Suffering in Silence', we set out a vision for streamlining and refocusing the complaints system around what people want. Firstly, the system needs to make it easier for people to complain, including institutions understanding that everyone, including third parties, has the right to raise concerns. Secondly, every case should be dealt with compassionately, with a speedy, personalised response that actually addresses the poor experience and includes an outline of what happens next. Lastly, those who fail to up their game must be held to account by being put into \\"special measures\\" by the regulators, issued with financial penalties and ultimately being shut down and replaced. In short, it's time for the health and social care sector to get serious about complaints, and stop finding loopholes to avoid having to face up to their mistakes.","output":"Part #1: Generate an appropriate title for the given text.

Cynthia asked Lindsey to instruct them how to use sign language, because","output":"Cynthia asked Lindsey to instruct them how to use sign language, because she believed that learning this valuable method of communication would not only enable them to engage with the Deaf community, but also provide them with a deeper understanding of language and communication as a whole, fostering empathy, awareness, and inclusivity among their friends, family, and colleagues. Sign language, as an alternate means of communication, has tremendous importance for people who are deaf or hard of hearing, especially when it comes to interacting with others and ensuring their needs are met. By taking the time to learn sign language, Cynthia, as well as others who would be instructed by Lindsey, hoped to bridge the gap that often exists between these two communities and create a more inclusive and comfortable environment for everyone involved. In addition to providing valuable communication skills, learning sign language benefits those who take up the challenge in several other ways. For one, it appeals to kinesthetic and visual learners who might find learning through the spoken word to be challenging, offering them the chance to hone their skills in a different way. Additionally, it deepens their appreciation of non-verbal communication, allowing them to understand and express themselves in ways that words cannot always capture. Moreover, the process of learning to sign helps individuals become better listeners and observers, as it requires a high degree of patience, focus, and attention to detail. It also has practical applications outside of the deaf community. For example, sign language can be utilized in noisy, crowded, or otherwise challenging environments where verbal communication might be difficult or impossible. In this way, sign language offers practical benefits beyond its initial purpose. Furthermore, learning sign language fosters a sense of empathy and understanding. By investing the time and effort to learn this method of communication, individuals show respect and support for the deaf and hard of hearing communities. This open-mindedness can lead to stronger friendships, better professional relationships, and a broader worldview – all of which contribute to the greater social good. With these goals in mind, Cynthia's request to learn sign language from Lindsey served as a responsible and commendable decision. It demonstrated their willingness to expand their horizons, engage with others in a meaningful manner, and foster a more inclusive and well-rounded community in which everyone – regardless of their hearing ability – has the chance to be heard and understood. In the end, this investment into sign language instruction would have a lasting impact on Cynthia and those taught by Lindsey, as they collectively achieved a greater level of empathy, communication, and connectedness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Privilege can be a dangerous thing. It releases you from the task of thinking about things that others must. I am an African-American male and I am privileged. Not on race; but on gender, education, religion, income and many other areas. As a man, my authority and intellect are not second-guessed. As a Christian, my moral code is not questioned, nor am I subject to post-September 11 profiling. I have privilege in these areas, and I realize that this privilege creates blind spots. An advantage to any group creates a corresponding disadvantage to all others. Recently Attorney General Eric Holder made some statements concerning America's need to confront its racial history, and the need for Americans to engage in cross-racial dialogue. Holder's comments offended some and motivated others, not uncommon when dealing with the touchy issue of race. On confronting our history he said:. \\"To get to the heart of this country, one must examine its racial soul. ... in things racial we have always been and continue to be, in too many ways, essentially a nation of cowards. \\" Concerning cross-racial dialogue he opined: \\"If we are to make progress in this area, we must ... have frank conversations about the racial matters that continue to divide us.\\" In a recent interview, President Obama responded by saying, America has made \\"enormous progress, and we shouldn't lose sight of that ... I think it's fair to say that if I had been advising my attorney general, we would have used different language.\\" The president went on to say, \\"I think what solves racial tensions is fixing the economy, putting people to work, making sure people have health care, ensuring that every kid is learning out here.\\" They were both right; but they were addressing two different things. Obama was talking about fixing the economy to ease racial tensions. Holder was talking about overcoming our fears to dialogue and confronting racial privilege so that we can eliminate inequities that cause the racial tensions. Additionally, Holder was not saying that progress had not been made. He was saying that there is much yet to be done in order to fully engage and leverage the abilities of all of the nation's human capital. Elaborating on history, we must acknowledge that whites have been the benefactors of centuries of history that included half-truths that socially affirmed them to the detriment of all others. Addressing this privilege will take extreme courage, for there will be many loud dissenting voices. For example, there has never been a discussion in America about whether we should or should not celebrate a White History Month. That would be an irrelevant waste of time, because white history has been the basis of practically all that we have been taught. Being able to sit in a classroom and open history books that positively portray a plethora of people that resemble you has been, and continues to be, the exclusive historical privilege of whites. This privilege psychologically and economically benefits every member at every level of the advantaged category so profoundly that its members never have to question their place in society. And that place is on top: the expected and accepted norm. If you are white, consider how different life might be for you now if you had grown up from meager beginnings, while simultaneously being denigrated by a society that had denied equal access to you, your parents and every member of your race during every prior generation. This is the history of black America that Holder is saying we must understand to truly know the heart of America. History is history, and these are the facts. When we choose to exclude vital portions of history, we are no longer teaching history; we're teaching ideology. And if you're a person of color, you're excluded. The classroom experience for those who are not white tends to fit the following quote by poet Adrienne Rich: \\"When someone with the authority of a teacher, say, describes the world -- and you are not in it -- there is a moment of psychic disequilibrium, as if you looked into a mirror and saw nothing.\\" It's impossible to grasp the true significance of any groups' contributions when they are taken out of context, and told as a separate story during some isolated month. It's like reading a great novel and leaving out chapters. What's missing is what the late Paul Harvey would have called \\"the rest of the story.\\" George Washington Carver, a black man, had many breakthrough inventions utilizing the peanut. His contributions could sound insignificant until put into context. The south, as a region, made its money through agriculture, primarily cotton. Poor crop management practices eventually damaged the soil throughout the south until it was almost impossible to successfully grow cotton anywhere in the region. The south needed a new cash crop -- then came the peanut. George Washington Carver revitalized the agricultural south; thus the financial south. He saved the south. But because we tell his story out of context, no one understands the significance of his contributions. Thomas Edison invented the light bulb, which was a tremendous invention. However its paper filament was only operable for short periods of time, until a black man named Lewis Latimer contributed his invention, the carbon filament, to the project, making possible the widespread use of electric light. Had there been no Latimer, there would not have been a successful Edison. But most history books have no mention of Latimer. Textbooks currently teach that our great nation became a democracy in 1776. Great nation, strong republic, yes! Democracy, no. The very foundation upon which democracy was built demanded that the political leadership be selected for the people, by a vote of the people. To deny this right to millions of our citizenry for no legitimate reason was to abort democracy before it was born. The uncomfortable and blunt truth is, the United States did not legitimately become a democracy until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 made it law that no citizen could be denied the right to vote based on their race. Until we as Americans change course, grow a spine, teach true history that is inclusive of all races and replace these fallacies and half-truths with reputably documented facts, our citizenry will continue to be relegated to racially segmented ideology instead of history. We are a great democracy, and thus ready for honest dialogue. The time is now, and this discussion must go beyond black and white. It must be inclusive of Arabs, Asians, Latinos and others. It must also go both ways. People of color cannot only talk. We must also listen. All parties must be willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism. As Holder said, this will be uncomfortable, but \\"this way we can hasten the day when we would truly become one America.\\" It's unusual when someone who is out of the norm makes his or her way into the seat of privilege, because those with whom you now share this privilege do not expect you to speak for those who do not. Welcome to your seat Mr. Holder, it fits you well. And thank you for not taking the coward's route. By the way, mission accomplished. We're talking. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Al Vivian. Write highlights for this article.","output":"- Privilege can create dangerous blind spots and prevent people from understanding the experiences of others from different backgrounds. - Attorney General Eric Holder and President Obama highlighted the importance of addressing racial privilege to eliminate inequities and ease racial tensions. - Acknowledging and understanding the history of black America is essential in order to truly know the heart of America and confront the racial issues. - Teaching a diverse and inclusive history allows everyone to understand the contributions of various groups in context, and promotes a more accurate understanding of history. - Honest dialogue must go beyond black and white and be inclusive of all races and ethnicities, with all parties willing to be critiqued as well as offer criticism. - Holder's statements on America's need to confront its racial history and engage in cross-racial dialogue have already sparked important conversations, showing progress."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: Are You Experienced was an immediate commercial success, selling more than one million copies within seven months of its release. Reviewing the album in 1967, Melody Maker praised its artistic integrity and the Experience's varied use of tempo. NME's Keith Altham said it is \\"a brave effort by Hendrix to produce a musical form which is original and exciting\\". However, not all contemporary writers gave the LP a favorable review; in November 1967, Rolling Stone's Jon Landau wrote that although he considered Hendrix a \\"great guitarist and a brilliant arranger\\", he disapproved of his singing and songwriting. He criticized the quality of the material and described the lyrics as inane: \\"Above all this record is unrelentingly violent, and lyrically, inartistically violent at that.\\"Many music critics have since named Are You Experienced as one of the greatest rock and roll debut albums. Journalist Ritchie Unterberger described it as \\"one of the definitive albums of the psychedelic era.\\" Author Chris Smith said the release was \\"a landmark in a summer of landmark albums\\".

PUBLISHED:. 05:58 EST, 7 November 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:31 EST, 7 November 2012. The new breast-checking glove is said to be as effective as traditional breast cancer screening in detecting lumps. Women are being warned not to rely on a £25 glove claimed to be as effective as a mammogram at detecting signs of breast cancer. The manufacturers of the BE gLOVE say it makes detecting lumps much easier during self-examination because it increases finger sensitivity. But breast cancer charities are telling women not to put their faith in the product, saying evidence of its effectiveness is limited. The warning comes only weeks after an advertising watchdog criticised an £86 ‘breast torch’ that manufacturers said could act as an ‘early breast-screening device’. The glove is being publicised in the UK after clinical tests in Italy showed it allowed women to detect the same number of lumps as a mammogram. Its manufacturer, IC Pharma, says the ultra-thin polyurethane glove magnifies finger sensitivity 15 times, making it easier for women to feel hard areas in their breasts. But Mia Rosenblatt, of Breast  Cancer Campaign, said: ‘Evidence that devices of this nature can improve detection of breast tumours is very limited, so we urge women not to use tools such as the BE gLOVE as a substitute for mammograms or for being breast-aware. ‘We encourage all women to check their breasts regularly, know what is normal for them and discuss any concerns with their GP.’ Sally Greenbrook, of Breakthrough Breast Cancer, said: ‘It is important that women are not misled when it comes to checking their breasts. We do not advocate the use of these gloves and we would like to reassure women that there is no need to spend money on products like these. The best way for women to be breast- aware is to know their own breasts.’ The BE gLOVE is said to work by reducing friction on the skin, stopping lumps being pushed away by the fingers. A clinical study by Professor  Stafano Varardi, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon at the University of Rome, compared women doing self-examinations with their bare hands with those using the glove. The company behind the glove says it could help the millions of UK women who have no idea how to perform breast self-examination. Those given the glove detected the. same number of lumps as were identified by mammography, according to IC. Pharma. Women using their bare hands found only 50 per cent of the lumps. revealed by breast screening. Official guidelines advise women to. carry out breast self-examinations each month, but a survey by IC Pharma. showed most check themselves only two to three times a year, and 55 per. cent did not know the right way to look for lumps. Company spokesman Karen Winterhalter said: ‘At the age when women should include breast self-examinations as an essential part of their routine in taking care of their health, it is staggering to see that 55 per cent do not know what they are doing. ‘Whilst we know that nine out of ten lumps found in the breast are not cancerous, it is extremely important for women to check their breasts regularly, so it becomes part of their routine.’ Last month the Advertising Standards Authority ruled that marketing of the Breastlight torch device was ‘misleading’ and ‘irresponsible’. Cancer charities said they feared women were using the torches as a substitute for breast screening and getting ‘false reassurance’. Everyone’s breasts are different,. altering with age and at different times of the month. Look for. changes that are unusual for you, such as:. •    Lumps or thickening of breast tissue•    Continuous pain•    One breast becoming larger or lower•    Puckering or dimpling of the skin•    Nipples becoming inverted (turned in), changing shape or position•    Developing a rash, crusting or producing discharge from the nipples•    Swelling under the armpit or around the collarbone•    Continuous pain in the armpits.

Suck them up into a particular type of air sprayer.; (ii). Suck them up into a particular type of vacuum.;","output":"To accomplish the goal of moving (removing) bees without killing them, your best option would be to: (ii). Suck them up into a particular type of vacuum. However, it is crucial to specify that the vacuum in question should be a specially designed bee vacuum that ensures the bees are not harmed during the process. Bee vacuums are designed to safely collect bees from unwanted locations and transport them to a more suitable environment. Here's a detailed breakdown of accomplishing this goal: 1. Appropriate Equipment: Start by obtaining a specially designed bee vacuum. Bee vacuums are created to have a gentler suction power compared to regular vacuums, ensuring that the bees stay alive during the process. These vacuums come with a vacuum head, a hose, and a collection chamber. 2. Protective Gear: Wear protective clothing to prevent bee stings. This includes a bee suit, gloves, boots, and a veil that covers the face and neck. 3. Plan and Prepare: Locate the bees' hive or nest and determine the best course of action to safely remove the bees. Ensure you are aware of any potential dangers or difficulties, such as working at a height, and prepare accordingly. 4. Set up the Bee Vacuum: Assemble the bee vacuum as per the manufacturer's instructions and ensure the collection chamber is clean. Adjust the vacuum suction pressure so it is strong enough to lift bees but not kill them during the process. It is important to experiment with a few bees to determine the right suction power before attempting to vacuum the entire colony. 5. Smoke the Bees: Use a bee smoker to calm the bees before starting the vacuuming process. Puff some smoke around the hive, especially the entrance, to subdue the bees and make them less likely to sting during the removal process. 6. Vacuum the Bees: Carefully use the bee vacuum's hose to suck up the bees from the hive or nest. Ensure the suction pressure is set to the appropriate level, so as not to harm the bees. Proceed slowly and methodically to minimize any harm or disturbance to the colony. Be meticulous about collecting the bees on every comb and in the hive itself in order to successfully relocate the entire colony. 7. Collect the Honeycomb: Once all the bees have been vacuumed, collect the honeycomb and any remaining bee larvae from the hive or nest. The honeycomb will serve as a food source and the foundation for the bees to rebuild their hive once they are transported to their new location. 8. Transport the Bees: With the bees safely contained within the vacuum collection chamber, securely transport the vacuum, honeycomb, and remaining larvae to their new location. 9. Release and Re-home the Bees: Set up the new hive or nesting area for the bees at the new location. Gently release the bees from the vacuum's collection chamber and ensure their honeycomb and larvae are placed inside. The bees will immediately start working on rebuilding their colony and producing honey. 10. Monitor the New Site: Keep an eye on the bees' new location for a few days to ensure that they have successfully adapted to their environment and are building a healthy colony. By using a specially designed bee vacuum and following these steps, you can safely remove bees from their current location and relocate them to a more suitable environment without killing them. This method promotes bee population sustainability and helps protect these vital pollinators."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the persont that painted Charles IV of Spain and His Family?  In 1692, the Neapolitan painter Luca Giordano  became one of the few allowed to view paintings held in Philip IV's private apartments, and was greatly impressed by Las Meninas. Giordano described the work as the \\"theology of painting\\", and was inspired to paint A Homage to Velázquez (National Gallery, London). By the early 18th century his oeuvre was gaining international recognition, and later in the century British collectors ventured to Spain in search of acquisitions. Since the popularity of Italian art was then at its height among British connoisseurs, they concentrated on paintings that showed obvious Italian influence, largely ignoring others such as Las Meninas.An almost immediate influence can be seen in the two portraits by Mazo of subjects depicted in Las Meninas, which in some ways reverse the motif of that painting. Ten years later, in 1666, Mazo painted Infanta Margaret Theresa, who was then 15 and just about to leave Madrid to marry the Holy Roman Emperor. In the background are figures in two further receding doorways, one of which was the new King Charles (Margaret Theresa's brother), and another the dwarf Maribarbola. A Mazo portrait of the widowed Queen Mariana again shows, through a doorway in the Alcázar, the young king with dwarfs, possibly including Maribarbola, and attendants who offer him a drink.  Mazo's painting of The Family of the Artist also shows a composition similar to that of Las Meninas. Francisco Goya etched a print of Las Meninas in 1778, and later used Velázquez's painting as the model for his Charles IV of Spain and His Family. As in Las Meninas, the royal family in Goya's work is apparently visiting the artist's studio. In both paintings the artist is shown working on a canvas, of which only the rear is visible. Goya, however, replaces the atmospheric and warm perspective of Las Meninas with what Pierre Gassier calls a sense of \\"imminent suffocation\\". Goya's royal family is presented on a \\"stage facing the public, while in the shadow of the wings the painter, with a grim...

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"Orientalist scholars of the 18th century like Sir William Jones marked a wave of enthusiasm for Indian culture and for Sanskrit. According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \\"Indomania\\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \\"British Indophobia\\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a \\"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\\".\\",  answer the following question.

Movie title: Run Lola Run Context: Introduction[edit] Lola (Franka Potente) receives a frantic phone call from her boyfriend, Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu). Manni is a small-time criminal who has just collected 100,000 marks cash in his most recent crime. Lola had agreed to meet Manni at the crime scene and to drive him to deliver the money to his boss, Ronnie. Lola tried to do so, but her moped was stolen en route to meet Manni. When Lola failed to arrive on time, Manni, carrying the cash in a bag, took a subway train. Manni panicked when he saw ticket inspectors in his car. He fled and thoughtlessly left the bag of money on the subway because he does not have a subway ticket. As he does, Manni spotted a homeless man examining Manni's money bag in the subway car. Manni, realizing what he had done, pursued the train as it departed, only to find the man and the money gone. Manni calls Lola from a phone booth. He complains that Lola let him down. He tells Lola that unless he raises 100,000 marks to give Ronnie within 20 minutes, Ronnie will kill him. Manni also tells Lola of his plan to rob a nearby supermarketâwhich for several obvious reasons is unwise. Lola implores Manni to wait and promises to find the money. She decides to ask her father (Herbert Knaup), who is a bank manager, for help.

Information:  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America.  Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia . It contains two species , which both are critically endangered : Huso dauricus ( Georgi , 1775 ) ( kaluga ) Huso huso ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( beluga ) Recent data indicate a polyphyletic origin of the genus Huso , and it is suggested that the two Huso species should be included in the genus Acipenser .

Well, the least I could say was that everything was injured in her body and she lost all of her memories. It was a fatal accident. Over the next two months, I lived more at the hospital than I did at my house. I watched as Andrea worked so hard to gain back everyday motor skills. She never once complained or pitied herself; her determined spirit was shining through. After two weeks in the ICU and two months of the regular hospital treatment, Andrea was able to come home. She missed several months of school, so it was hard for her to catch up. Andrea had tasks to accomplish, and no matter how hard it was, she stuck with them until the job was done. Though busy with dealing with pain and therapy, she always found time to love and play with me. I'll never forget the impact that this incident made on my life.

Movie title: The Garden of Eden Context: Toni le Braun is a Opera Singer hopeful who gets a letter from Budapest saying she has a job singing. Unfortunately, she soon learns that the local in which she is singing is not an opera house but a cabaret. When she refuses the advances of one of the rich patrons of the cabaret, and the wardrobe mistress helps her escape, they are both fired. What Toni does not know is that the wardrobe mistress is a baroness, whose husband was killed in the great war. Rather than loose her old life, she works all year and when she gets her husbands yearly cheque (like pension i think) she lives in Monte Carlo the way she did before the war, until her money runs out, and then she returns to Budapest. Toni is now the Baroness' ward, and two men (uncle and nephew) fall in love with her. Toni becomes engaged to the young Richard. Everything is wonderful, but as the movie says \\"in all the fairy tales where people live happily ever after, the men did not have relatives\\". At the wedding Richard's other uncle arrives, who is the benefactor of the cabaret who had tried advancing on Toni. She is ashamed for now she knows everyone will know she is not really the Baroness' daughter and breaks of the engagement and leaves. But the uncle who lives in Hungary assured Richard that Toni was a wonderful girl and that he should not let the old humbug relatives use money as an excuse to not marry her. They wed and all live happily ever after. Answer:","output":"An opera singer is a professional vocalist who specializes in the performance of classical music known as opera. Opera singers are trained to use their voices in a powerful, resonant, and emotive manner to produce a unique sound that can project and be heard clearly over a large orchestra in an opera house without the need for amplification. They often possess exceptional vocal range, control, and technique, enabling them to perform complex and demanding pieces composed by the great opera composers such as Mozart, Verdi, Puccini, and Wagner. In the context of the movie \\"The Garden of Eden,\\" the main character, Toni le Braun, is an aspiring opera singer who dreams of making it big in the world of classical music. She receives a letter from Budapest, offering her a job as a singer. Upon her arrival, however, she discovers that the venue for her performance is not an opera house, but a cabaret. This twist in the plot highlights the stark difference between the prestigious world of opera that Toni aspires to and the potentially seedy, morally ambiguous environment of a cabaret. Throughout her journey, Toni encounters various challenges and colorful characters, including a baroness who becomes her guardian, and two men, an uncle and his nephew, who fall in love with her. Toni eventually gets engaged to the young Richard, but complications arise during their wedding when Richard's other uncle, the benefactor of the cabaret, arrives. Toni is ashamed and believes that her true identity as a singer, rather than a baroness' daughter, will be exposed. Consequently, she breaks off the engagement and leaves. However, the story resolves itself when the uncle who lives in Hungary convinces Richard that Toni is a wonderful girl and deserves his love regardless of her background or the opinions of his relatives. In the end, the couple weds and they all enjoy a happy life together. From this summary, we can understand that while Toni's dreams of becoming an opera singer do not necessarily come true in the expected manner, her journey takes her through various experiences that ultimately lead her to a fulfilling life and love. The story serves as a testament to the power of resilience, self-discovery, and the importance of following one's own path, even when it diverges from the conventional route to success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage  \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.

One was blank and one was cards from Kevin on which he had translated all his _ feeling into words for me. As I read one of Kevin's notes, tears came to my eyes.

Apologies again that it’s been a while since I last posted. You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website? Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Q:Given the following context:  With Morton, the New York Dolls recorded Too Much Too Soon in 1974 at A&R Studios in New York City. The album was later mastered at Sterling Sound and Masterdisk. During the sessions, Morton had Johansen record his vocals several times and incorporated sound effects such as gongs, gunshots, and feminine choruses. In a report on the album's progress for Melody Maker, journalist Lenny Kaye wrote that they were taking more time than they had on their first record, \\"bringing in occasional strings and horns, following Shadow's advice not 'to settle'.\\" Morton and the band shared an affinity for each other, as he found the group's energy in the studio refreshing, while Johansen was fond of Morton and the \\"looser\\" feel he provided for their music. \\"That man is completely unpretentious\\", Johansen said of the producer. \\"He doesn't think he ever did a marvellous thing in his life.\\" The New York Dolls and Morton produced little original material together. To complete the album, they had to record cover songs and re-record some of the band's earlier demos; \\"Babylon\\", \\"Who Are the Mystery Girls?\\", \\"It's Too Late\\" and \\"Human Being\\" had been recorded by the band in March 1973 as demos for Mercury before the label signed them. They had also recorded demos of two songs written by guitarist Sylvain Sylvain, \\"Teenage News\\" and \\"Too Much Too Soon\\", before working with Morton, but neither was considered for the album. Sylvain said he confronted Morton about this decision, recalling he had been in a rush: \\"He was too quick with me and said that he'd been told only to listen to David Johansen and Johnny Thunders. He didn't want to tell me who had told him that but obviously it was the managers. I just walked out, it was all driving me nuts.\\"According to journalist Tony Fletcher, Morton would have been more productive on Too Much Too Soon had it not been for his alcoholism and the lifestyles of the band members—bassist Arthur Kane was also an alcoholic, while Thunders and drummer Jerry Nolan had heroin addictions. Robert Christgau...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the band member who was an alcoholic in the band that recorded Too Much Too Soon?

Write the answer: If travelling at 30m.p.h. in a car what is the overall stopping distance in feet?","output":"To calculate the overall stopping distance in feet, we need to consider both the thinking distance and the braking distance. Here, we will be using the given speed of 30 miles per hour (m.p.h.) and converting it into feet per second (fps) for easier calculations.  Step 1: Convert speed from m.p.h. to fps 1 mile = 5280 feet 1 hour = 3600 seconds 30 miles per hour = (30 * 5280) / 3600 =  44 feet per second (fps) Step 2: Calculate thinking distance The thinking distance is the distance the car travels while the driver reacts to an obstacle before applying the brakes. On average, the reaction time is assumed to be 1.5 seconds. Thinking distance = speed × reaction time Thinking distance = 44fps × 1.5s = 66 feet Step 3: Calculate braking distance The braking distance is the distance the car travels while it decelerates to a complete stop after the brakes are applied. The estimated braking distances can be calculated using a general rule: Braking distance = (speed in fps)^2 / 64. For our case: Braking distance = (44 fps)^2 / 64 = 1936 / 64 = 30.25 feet Step 4: Calculate overall stopping distance The overall stopping distance is the sum of the thinking distance and the braking distance. Overall stopping distance = Thinking distance + Braking distance Overall stopping distance = 66 feet + 30.25 feet ≈ 96.25 feet  So, when traveling at 30 m.p.h. in a car, the overall stopping distance is approximately 96.25 feet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide a more detailed understanding, the complete process in its entirety, including the missing first step, is as follows: 1. The initiation of natural processes involving the movement and interaction of various particles (such as water, wind, ice, and/or living organisms) with the surface of the rocks: In order to begin any type of erosion or wearing away of the rocks, natural forces need to be involved. These forces, comprising of natural elements, are responsible for the initial contact and interaction with rock surfaces. The particles can be sediment, soil, sand, or other small fragments carried by the aforementioned forces. 2. The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks: As these particles make contact with the rock surface, their abrasive nature and force result in the dislodging of tiny rock fragments. Over time, this constant attrition leads to a change in the rock's structure. 3. The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks: This continuous action is crucial for the process to progress. The constant battering and scraping of the rock surface cause the rock to weaken and become more susceptible to further abrasion. 4. The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact: The culmination of the constant impact of particles and natural forces causes the rock to break apart into smaller pieces. This can happen in various forms, such as physical weathering (freezing and thawing), chemical weathering (mineral dissolution), or biological weathering (plant or animal activity impacting the rock). 5. The pieces of the rock are now small rocks: The initial large rock structure has now been reduced to smaller rock pieces or fragments through the ongoing erosion process. These smaller rocks can then be transported to different locations by water, wind, ice, or other natural forces. 6. The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces: As the smaller rocks or fragments are subjected to the same forces that caused the initial erosion, they are further broken down into even smaller particles, such as sand, silt, or clay. This process continues until the rock material has been completely transformed and integrated into the natural environment. In summary, the missing first step involves the initiation of natural processes that bring various particles in contact with the rock surface, ultimately causing erosion and the subsequent transformation of the rock into smaller fragments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have always been a “handyman” involved in various building projects around the house. One particular time I was refinishing a section of ceiling. I had laid in the wiring and insulation by myself and all that remained was nailing a number of heavy 4ftx8ft gypsum wallboard panels onto the rafters of the 8 ft ceiling. I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses. He seemed surprised when I told him I was finished. He looked up at the ceiling and said \\"how in the world did you get those up there by yourself?\\" I said, \\"Oh, believe me, You helped more than you will ever know!\\" I learned a lot from that. Anger has its place in your life. You have to control it and use it directly to solve a problem. To this day I do not know how I accomplished what I did the way I did it.

Instead of focusing on the end-goal, break the process down into manageable, daily goals.  For example, instead of saying \\"My goal today is to get a raise at work,\\" approach the goal from a more manageable perspective. Start with smaller goals, such as getting to work early every day, or going out of your way to have a conversation with your boss. The point of the baby steps is to build up to your end-goal through obtainable, tangible steps. There are countless distractions in today's world, and it can be easy to get side-tracked. Keep your Must-Do list handy and refer to it whenever you feel yourself drifting off course.  Don't allow yourself to get sucked into time wasting activities when you have goals to obtain. Set aside designated leisure time for the day. Resist the temptation to \\"work on it tomorrow.\\" Remind yourself that you need to accomplish your list today. Take the time to practice skills that you haven't mastered yet. More skills means more opportunities for you.  Hone your skills that you need to achieve your goal. For example, if you are looking for a raise, work on the skills you need for the job on your free time in order to increase your effectiveness at work. Broaden your skillset. Work on skills that may not relate to your current goals, but that interest you. Not only will this keep you productive, it will make you a more well-rounded and capable person. You will hit obstacles and setbacks. Keep your mind focused on your goals and your heart positive. Celebrate each small victory to give yourself a boost in spirit. Approach each defeat as a lesson to be learned; dust yourself off and try another way. Confidence is essential to obtaining goals and changing your life. It will affect all of your interactions with others, and will drastically increase your motivation. Take pride in your actions and thoughts, and own your mistakes.  Be able to laugh at yourself, but avoid self-deprecation. There is a difference between being confident and being cocky. Avoid over-inflating your ego by tempering your confidence with some realism. Cockiness is often viewed as a sign on inner insecurity.

Cemeteries provide fragmentary information, e.g., during February and March 1740, 47 children were buried in St. Catherine's parish. The normal death rate tripled in January and February 1740, and burials averaged out about 50% higher during the twenty-one-month crisis than for the years 1737-1739, according to Dickson. Summing up all his sources, Dickson suggests two estimates:1) that 38% of the Irish population died during the crisis, and2) that between 13-20% excess mortality occurred for 1740-1741. Based on contemporary accounts and burial parish records, famine-related deaths may have totaled 300,000-480,000 in Ireland, with rates highest in the south and east of the country. This was a proportionately greater toll than during the most severe years of the Great Famine .  That famine, however, was unique in \\"cause, scale and timing,\\" persisting over several years. The majority of the deaths occurred amongst the lower classes, with the poorest third of the population gaining all their nutrition from potatoes alone, the crop which the blight affected. Therefore, when the potatoes blight occurred these people were left with practically no means of sustenance. Which crisis proportionately was worse the Great Frost or the Great Famine?","output":"While both the Great Frost of 1740-1741 and the Great Famine of 1845-1849 were devastating events in Irish history, the proportionate impact of each crisis must be evaluated considering their respective contexts, durations, and outcomes. The Great Frost (1740-1741) was a climate anomaly that led to widespread crop failure, death of livestock, and food shortages across Ireland. Due to limited documentation during that era, precise death figures are challenging to determine. However, based on the information available, it is estimated that between 300,000 and 480,000 people, constituting approximately 13-20% of the Irish population, died during this crisis. This was exacerbated by the fact that it occurred over a much shorter period, lasting only 21 months. On the other hand, the Great Famine (1845-1849) was caused by the failure of the potato crop due to a fungal disease known as late blight. This crisis lasted over four years, during which successive crop failures resulted in widespread food scarcity. The famine claimed the lives of approximately one million people, which was close to 25% of the Irish population at the time. Additionally, approximately one million more people emigrated from the country due to the severe conditions, leading to a population decline of nearly 50%. Taking these factors into account, although the Great Frost had a higher mortality rate in a much shorter time frame, the Great Famine had a more profound and long-lasting impact on Ireland's population and socio-economic landscape. The Great Famine's enduring legacy, in terms of emigration, societal changes, cultural impacts, and the formation of Irish national identity, makes it a more significant crisis proportionately when compared to the Great Frost. In conclusion, while both crises had devastating consequences for Ireland and its population, the Great Famine's extended duration, more significant death toll, and long-lasting effects make it proportionately worse for the country than the Great Frost."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is some advice for you to _ the generation gap  .Don't argue with your parents. Don't get to your parents when you are angry.Your parents probably won't consider your ideas if you are shouting at them. And you can't express yourself well if you are angry. Go to someplace to cool off  . Make sure you understand why you are unhappy. Then think about what you want to say to your parents. If you don't think you can speak to them at the moment, try writing a letter. Try to reach a compromise  . Perhaps you and your parents disagree on something. You can keep your disagreement and try your best to accept each other. Michael's mother didn't agree with him about buying a motorcycle. They argued over it. But they finally came to a compromise. Michael bought the motorcycle, but only drove it on certain days. Of course, your parents might refuse to compromise on something . In these situations, it is especially important to show love and respect to them. Showing respect will keep your relationship strong. Talk about your values. The values of your parents are probably different from those of your own. Tell your parents what you care about, and why. Understanding your values mighthelp them see your purposes in life.

Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body.

Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Teenage brothers 18-year-old Nick and 14-year-old Tyler come across a UFO that crashed near their town. Soon after evading the government, mainly agent Armstrong, as well as keeping the UFO in seclusion, Tyler goes through dramatic physical changes and gains superhuman powers due to his dramatic trip into space via the UFO, including enhanced strength and telepathy, and he almost as tall as Nick. The situation becomes even more difficult to cover up considering that Tyler is being constantly blown off by Nick, due to Nick's efforts at chasing Julie Gunn, as well as Nick having to make a science project to graduate high school and reptile-like aliens that have begun to appear and pursue Tyler. After having literally no one left to turn to, Tyler decides to tell agent Armstrong about the UFO. After agent Armstrong explains to Tyler about the effects that his trip into space had on his body, he shoots the ship with a laser gun, thereby critically damaging it, before he reveals himself to Tyler as a reptile-like alien in disguise and captures him. Nick, feeling guilty for constantly doubting and ignoring Tyler, goes to the UFO hideout to try to apologize. Upon finding that Tyler is missing and the UFO damaged, he begins an attempt to repair the UFO. After trying all night, he is successful and the UFO takes him to the hidden underground fortress in which the aliens are residing and realizes that it is actually an impact crater from the aliens' crash-landing on Earth. Nick locates Tyler and frees him from his holding cell. The brothers uncover that the aliens are planning to take over Earth by polluting the atmosphere. Tyler then uses an alien explosive from the UFO to destroy the aliens and their pollution equipment and escape in the UFO. However, they do not succeed in destroying all of them and are chased by a surviving alien in a more powerful version of their UFO. After destroying the alien fighter and its pilot in a fast-paced dogfight, the UFO crashes at Nick's high school graduation. Nick then uses fixing...

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  Now, I have a new situation: Keith is an environmental scientist. He was studying the loss of ozone layer and its effect on different species. His data showed that in the beginning or twentieth century there were hardly any loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time period as time A. Further inquiry revealed that things didn't go well at the end of twentieth century - when there were severe loss of ozone layer. He categorized that time as time B.  Answer this question please: At what period would lower level of UV radiation reach earth, time A or time B?

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology.\\"? The answer is:","output":"Question: What are the key characteristics of the mutualistic relationship between flowering plants and insects in the pollination process, and how can these characteristics be observed through pollination syndromes and the ways pollinators are attracted to flowers? Answer: The mutualistic relationship between flowering plants and insects in the pollination process is characterized by the transfer of pollen for the purpose of fertilization and sexual reproduction, with insects being the primary transporters of pollen. This relationship benefits both parties, as plants achieve successful pollination, while insects obtain energy-rich nectar. The various flower traits, such as colors and combinations, and the production of attractant pheromones differentiate specific types of pollinators and exemplify pollination syndromes, which originated through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators are attracted to flowers by their bright colorations, including ultraviolet light, and the release of pheromones.

MIAMI — Giants defensive end Jason Pierre-Paul’s right index finger reportedly was amputated Wednesday following the fireworks injury he suffered on July 4.      ESPN obtained medical charts Wednesday night, which were posted on Twitter, that revealed Pierre-Paul’s finger was amputated earlier in the day at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami and he needed skin grafts for his right arm, which likely means he suffered from third-degree burns, which are the most severe.      The network earlier had reported JPP suffered burns on his palms and three fingers, and nerve damage in one finger. A source who has been in contact with those close to JPP said he had the option of saving the finger, but there were no assurances it would heal or be fully functional.      Here’s a tweet of the medical report:      Also, according to Bleacher Report, Pierre-Paul suffered a fracture to his right thumb and may have fractures in other fingers on his right hand.      Kevin Roenbeck, New Jersey hand surgeon, cautioned against expecting too much too soon. Based on the medical chart, which the doctor said was an operating room schedule, Roenbeck noted the entire bone was amputated, all the way into his palm, including his entire knuckle. The strength in JPP’s right hand may never be the same.      “That cannot be dismissed,” Roenbeck said. “There’s no guarantee he can be the same defensive end he was. It changes your hand forever and narrows the palm.”      Some people lose up to 35 percent of their strength when losing an index finger, others as little as 5 to 10 percent, Roenbeck said.      Then there is the issue of the burns Pierre-Paul suffered. Roenbeck said they could either be severe second-degree burns or third-degree, based on the chart. In either case, they often take a while to heal. There also is the chance of infection, and further surgery. Roenbeck estimated Pierre-Paul could be out up to three months, but that was merely a guess based on the information available.      The news came as a shock to the Giants, and on the heels of the situation taking a strange turn with Pierre-Paul shunning the team.      He refused to meet with team personnel who made the trip to Miami, sources confirmed to The Post, and JPP reportedly refused the team’s offer to set him up with hand specialists in Manhattan. A source said his agent, Eugene Parker, was responsible for keeping the Giants away, didn’t want word of the amputation leaked — the posted chart could result in medical privacy and/or HIPAA violations — and has taken command of the situation.      The Giants’ contingent, including Ronnie Barnes, the team’s senior vice president of medical services, and former linebacker Jessie Armstead, flew to Miami hoping to meet with Pierre-Paul, however they were rebuffed. FOX Sports reported Pierre-Paul doesn’t want to meet with anyone at the moment, and several close friends and teammates have been unable to get in touch with over the phone or via text message.      A Giants source told The Post, “We don’t know anything about his condition.” The source also said, “We’re more concerned than upset.”      Repeated calls to members of Pierre-Paul’s family went unreturned. Pierre-Paul posted a since-deleted video on Instagram last week in which he is standing in front of a U-Haul van and mentions setting off fireworks. Also, an alleged neighbor of his posted a tweet, also deleted, with a photo of the same U-Haul van that the neighbor claimed was filled with fireworks.      Because Pierre-Paul never signed his franchise-tag tender, which would have paid him 14.8 million this season, he currently is not under contract with the Giants. Further complicating matters, he skipped the Giants’ offseason program and minicamp. If the offer is rescinded, the 26-year-old defensive lineman would become a free agent. A source expects JPP to sign the tender, granted the Giants don’t take it away.      — Additional reporting by Paul Schwartz and Steve Serby ||||| NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — This situation with JPP has gone from bizarre to downright frightening.      According to an ESPN report on Wednesday evening, the two-time Pro Bowl defensive end had his right index finger amputated as a result of a Fourth of July fireworks mishap.

Medical source expects him to play this season, \\"sooner than people think.\\" — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) July 8, 2015      That shocking news came following a report from WFAN and NFL Media’s Kim Jones that said the Giants had sent officials down to Jackson Memorial Hospital in Florida to check on the health of Pierre-Paul, only to leave without seeing him.      Giants trainer Ronnie Barnes is heading back to East Rutherford from Miami without seeing Jason Pierre-Paul. — Kimberly Jones (@KimJonesSports) July 8, 2015      Giants officials were reportedly denied entry to Pierre-Paul’s hospital room on Tuesday, not making it past the waiting room, CBS2 reported.      The Daily News reported later that the 26-year-old former All-Pro’s family had demanded privacy.      The latest ESPN report appears to explain why.      Following the incident over the holiday weekend, ESPN reported Pierre-Paul had suffered “severe burns” to his palm and fingers in the fireworks accident. His fingers were said to be intact despite early reports to the contrary. He underwent tests on one finger for nerve damage, “and doctors believe there will be no permanent damage or disfigurement of his hands,” the network reported at the time.      CBS2’s Otis Livingston reported the injuries are not believed to be career-threatening, so Pierre-Paul is expected to play this year. But it is not clear when.      The Giants have since withdrawn a long-term contract offer worth 60 million, which Pierre-Paul was likely to turn down, according to NFL Media’s Ian Rapoport. A team spokesperson told Rapoport that the “first concern is for JPP’s well-being.”      Pierre-Paul is currently not under contract for the 2015 season, having not yet signed his 14.8 million franchise tag tender offer.

Information:  - Tiánmìmì (  , literally \`\` very sweet '' ) is a 1979 Mandarin Chinese song by Teresa Teng . The lyrics were written by Zhuang Nu (  born 1922 ) , the tune is the Indonesian folk song Dayung Sampan .  - \\"When Will You Return?\\" is a Chinese song first sung by Zhou Xuan in 1937, but now better known as a song by Teresa Teng. The song has also been variously translated as \\"When Will the Gentleman Come Back Again?\\" or \\"When Will You Come Back Again?\\" The lyrics were written by Huang Jiamo to a tune composed by Liu Xue'an.  - Teresa Teng, Teng Li-Chun or Deng Lijun (January 29, 1953  May 8, 1995) was a Taiwanese pop singer. She was known for her folk songs and romantic ballads. Many became standards in her lifetime, such as \\"When Will You Return?\\" and \\"The Moon Represents My Heart\\". She recorded songs not only in her native Mandarin but also in Taiwanese Hokkien, Cantonese, Japanese, Indonesian and English.  - Taiwan, officially the Republic of China (ROC), is a state in East Asia. Neighbors include China (officially the People's Republic of China, abbreviated as PRC) to the west, Japan to the northeast, and the Philippines to the south. Taiwan is the most populous state that is not a member of the United Nations, and the one with the largest economy.  - A ballad is a form of verse, often a narrative set to music. Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.    What is the relationship between 'tian mi mi' and 'pop'? Answer:","output":"Tiánmìmì (甜蜜蜜, literally \\"very sweet\\") is a 1979 Mandarin Chinese song by Teresa Teng, a renowned Taiwanese pop singer. The relationship between \\"Tiánmìmì\\" and \\"pop\\" lies in the fact that it is a popular song belonging to the pop music genre. Pop music, short for \\"popular music,\\" is characterized by its wide appeal to the general public, catchy melodies, and simple musical structure. Teresa Teng was well-known for her contributions to the pop music scene, particularly in the Asian market. Her songs, including \\"Tiánmìmì,\\" were and continue to be popular among listeners across different age groups and cultural backgrounds. Although \\"Tiánmìmì\\" has its roots in an Indonesian folk song, its adoption and popularity as a Mandarin Chinese song by a pop singer like Teresa Teng make it a part of the pop music tradition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first quarter, the Chargers would score 2 field goals to start out:  Travis Coons kicked them both from 21 and 40 yards out to make the lead 3-0 to 6-0.  The Browns took the lead however when DeShone Kizer found David Njoku on a 28-yard pass to make it 7-6.  Though, the Chargers would move back into the lead when Coons kicked his third field goal of the day from 22 yards out to make it 9-7.  This would remain the halftime score as neither team scored in the second quarter.  In the third quarter however, the Chargers managed to increase their lead when Philip Rivers found Keenan Allen on a 7-yard pass to make it 16-7.  This would be followed up by Coons kicking a fourth field goal from 27 yards out to put his team up 19-7.  The Browns scored their only points in the half during the fourth quarter when Zane Gonzalez kicked a 35-yard field goal. The losing streak continued as the Browns fell to the Chargers 19-10.  With the loss, the Browns fell to 0-12 and the losing streak was extended to 13 consecutive games while their road losing streak was extended to 19 consecutive games.  The loss made the Browns 1-27 in the first 28 games under Jackson and Brown, overtaking the 1976-1977 Buccaneers (2-26) for the worst 28 game start under a HC and GM in NFL history. On the following Thursday, Brown was relieved of his GM duties. Question: How many total yards in touchdown passes were thrown in the game? Answer:","output":"In the game between the Browns and the Chargers, there were two touchdown passes thrown. The first one was a 28-yard pass from DeShone Kizer to David Njoku, and the second one was a 7-yard pass from Philip Rivers to Keenan Allen.

This one is about why semicolons arent as universal as SOME PEOPLE insist on thinking they are and you spend a literal eighth of a minute making the post entirely about you and your semicolon needs Please fix the punctuation.","output":"In recent years, there has been some debate on the significance and appropriate usage of semicolons within written content. While some people insist that semicolons are essential to the correct structure and clarity of a sentence, others argue that they are not as universally important as these proponents claim. To examine this argument, it's crucial to consider the role of the semicolon in writing, its benefits, and the reasons behind the varying opinions on its usage. First, let's explore the original purpose of a semicolon. The semicolon (;) is primarily used to connect two closely related independent clauses, each of which could stand alone as a complete sentence. Unlike a period, however, the semicolon implies a stronger relationship between these two related thoughts, suggesting a logical progression or connection of ideas. Moreover, semicolons can be used to separate items in a list where individual items already contain internal punctuation, such as commas. In this case, the semicolon provides clarity and ensures that the individual elements within the list are easily distinguishable.  In defense of those who advocate for the regular application of semicolons, these punctuation marks can provide clarity and nuance to written content. When used correctly, semicolons can showcase an author's attention to detail, their command of language, and their commitment to the effective communication of their ideas. Additionally, semicolons can add an element of sophistication to writing, particularly when contrasting with more simplistic sentence structures or conveying complex thoughts. However, it is important to understand that not all writing favors the use of semicolons. In particular, various styles of writing, such as informal communication, often rely on shorter and more concise sentence structures. Additionally, some writing conventions, like the Associated Press Stylebook, tend to avoid or discourage the use of semicolons in favor of other punctuation marks, such as em dashes or periods, to promote clarity and simplicity. This preference for alternate punctuation can contribute to the diminishing significance of semicolons within specific contexts. Another reason why people may not view semicolons as universal is the growing popularity of alternative methods of communication, such as texting, email, and social media platforms. In these fast-paced and informal environments, punctuation tends to be less rigid and more focused on conveying information quickly and informally. As a result, punctuation marks like semicolons may be seen as superfluous or overly formal, leading to their decreased prevalence. In sum, while there may be some staunch supporters of semicolon usage and its importance in writing, it is essential to recognize that the semicolon's role may not be as universally accepted as these advocates imply. The popularity and appropriate utilization of semicolons largely depend on the context, style, and purpose of the written content in question. As the English language evolves and adapts to new methods of communication, it is crucial to remain flexible and open-minded about punctuation conventions like semicolons and their place in modern writing."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The price of milk may be going up. There was not enough rain in some parts of the country last year and the bad weather may mean that a gallon   of milk will cost 41 cents more after October 1st. California already has high milk prices and the California court does not want the price to go any higher. High milk prices will be very hard for some people. Families with many children will have to spend more money to buy milk. The poor and older people without much money will also be hurt by higher prices. The court said that more milk from other states should be sold in California as the price of milk from other states is not as high. Some states got enough rain so their costs did not go up. People will then be able to buy the cheaper milk, meaning that unless milk producers bring their milk prices down, their milk will not sell. The drought   around the country has meant market forces are likely to push milk prices up by as much as 41-cent a gallon by October 1st. Experts said this decision by the Californian court could reduce   the effect of the price rise here. The 41-cent increase would add to California's already high milk prices so California must allow more milk producers from outside the state to sell their products there. This would then lead to increased supplies  , which would, as a result, stop milk prices from increasing. Options: A Short supplies from other states. B Being short of rain. C The California court. D Children's need for milk. Answer: B Being short of rain. Question:","output":"What is the primary reason for the potential increase in milk prices after October 1st as mentioned in the article?

The spouse of Logan cheated on him with Brett because","output":"The spouse of Logan cheated on him with Brett because they were experiencing feelings of deep dissatisfaction and emotional disconnect within their marriage, which led them to seek comfort, validation, and connection outside their relationship with Logan. To understand this situation better, let's look at the various factors that might have contributed to the spouse's decision to cheat. 1. Emotional dissatisfaction: Over time, the emotional bond between Logan and their spouse might have weakened due to various reasons such as unresolved conflicts, lack of intimacy, or growing apart as individuals. This could have led the spouse to feel lonely and unfulfilled, driving them towards seeking emotional comfort and support from another person. 2. Lack of communication: Communication is one of the most essential aspects of maintaining a healthy relationship. When a couple fails to express their feelings, needs, and expectations openly, it could lead to misunderstandings and emotional stagnation. In this case, the spouse might have felt that their concerns and feelings were not being valued or addressed by Logan. 3. Incompatibility issues: Sometimes, couples might discover that they have different goals or values that are hard to reconcile. This could be in terms of their professional aspirations, family plans, lifestyle choices, or even sexual preferences. These incompatibilities could lead to feelings of frustration and resentment, eventually pushing the spouse towards someone else who shared their perspective. 4. Sexual dissatisfaction: Physical intimacy is an important aspect of a romantic relationship. If the spouse felt sexually unfulfilled or neglected by Logan, they might have sought satisfaction elsewhere with someone like Brett, who could potentially offer them the excitement and passion they were craving. 5. Self-esteem and validation: The human need for validation and recognition might have led the spouse to cheat on Logan with Brett. If the spouse felt undervalued or unappreciated in their relationship, engaging in an affair might have given them a sense of excitement and a temporary ego boost, making them feel desired and wanted. 6. The thrill of the forbidden: Sometimes, people choose to cheat on their partners because they are drawn to the excitement and risk involved in pursuing a clandestine affair. The secrecy and adrenaline rush associated with an affair could have been a powerful lure for the spouse, especially if their relationship with Logan had become routine or predictable. 7. External influences: People’s social environments, friends, and cultural norms can also impact their decisions to cheat. If the spouse was surrounded by friends or colleagues who encouraged infidelity or if they believed that cheating was a common and acceptable behavior within their social circle, they might have felt more inclined to engage in an affair. Ultimately, the spouse's decision to cheat on Logan with Brett was a complex and multifaceted issue, involving a combination of emotional, physical, personal, and social factors. Cheating is never a simple or straightforward problem, and it is essential for both Logan and their spouse to engage in open and honest communication to understand the underlying issues that led to the affair and to work towards finding a resolution that heals their relationship or helps them move forward separately."},{"instruction":"Process: - A sperm meets an egg in the uterus of a woman - The sperm implants itself into the egg - The sperm and egg form a zygote on the wall of the uterus - The fetus grows and develops - The woman gives birth to a baby - The baby is raised by parents until it is able to take care of itself - The person goes out into the world and finds a job - The person meets other people and has a life - The person gets a career, and gets married - The person retires and eventually passes away -   Question: suppose less sperm meet eggs happens, how will it affect MORE babies.

Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa.  Which place would have thinner \\"A horizon\\", Kenya or Tanzania?  Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. A:","output":"Based on the information provided, Kenya, with its large contiguous grassland, would likely have a thicker A horizon compared to Tanzania.

If energy is applied, state B would adopt which state, state A or state C?  John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state. State B is in liquid state. And, state C is in gaseous state. He needs to determine the properties of each state.  Hint: As Figure above shows, the distance between particles is much smaller for the solid and liquid states than for the gas state. In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature.

They say revenge is a dish best served cold. And, for one jilted wife, if a few bugs and grubs are thrown in, all the better. For Rachael Butler – whose  husband had an affair with Nadine Dorries – has revealed how she has voted ‘hundreds of times’ for the Tory MP to take part in I’m A Celebrity’s gruesome bushtucker trials. Hard to stomach: Nadine Dorries, 55, who was suspended from the Conservative Party when she went on ITV show I’m A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here, has been repeatedly voted to undergo sickening Bushtucker Trials. Yuck: Coronation Street actress Helen Flanagan (left) takes on Nadine Dorries (right) in a Bushtucker trial as Ant and Dec (back right) watch on during an episode of ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. The 56-year-old mother of two has even put Miss Dorries’s hotline number into her speed dial to save crucial seconds when she is voting against her on the ITV reality. The 55-year-old politician has already had to face two gruelling ordeals, in which she was forced to eat a camel’s toe and a lamb’s testicle, and locked inside a wooden coffin filled with maggots, crickets and cockroaches. And there could be bigger trials to come – she has been suspended from the Conservative Party and faces questions upon her return about her reasons for abandoning her post for up to four weeks on full pay. Mrs Butler, who was married to husband John for 30 years before their split last year, said: ‘I voted for her to do the trial thing. Dislike: Rachael Butler (right) revealed she is helping Nadine Dorries MP (left) munch on the likes of baked spider, camel toe and other animal parts - by having the phone number to nominate her for trials on speed dial.

B***** that – I don’t want to see that. Keep her suffering. 'I wanted to see her suffer – I don’t. want her to be voted off.  They go into a five star hotel if they leave.

I must have voted  for her hundreds of times. It’s worth the money. ‘The public seem to be picking on her and I’m like, “Carry on, keep on picking on Dorries, she deserves everything she gets”.’ Mrs Butler first met Miss Dorries, then married to her ex-husband Paul, from whom she split in 2006, in the late 1990s when they became neighbours in Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire. Their daughters attended the same school, and the couples used to meet regularly for dinner, even going on holiday together to St Lucia in 2000. Together: Rachael Butler (left), 56, of Chipping Campden, Gloucestershire, hit the headlines in January 2011 when Nadine Dorries (right) - her friend of 13 years - admitted having a fling with her husband John. Scary: Nadine Dorris (in a 'bug burial' Bushtucker Trial) has drawn criticism for swapping her parliamentary duties for the Australian jungle, but pledged to donate her MP's salary during her time on the show to charity. But last year the friendship ended after it emerged the MP had started a relationship with Mr Butler. Mrs Butler said at the time she became suspicious of her husband ‘when he started to go to the pub a lot’. She added: ‘Before Christmas he was going out every night and he said he had to meet friends. ‘Some nights he just never came home. I kept saying to him, “Is there another woman?”. He would say, “No, no, no, there isn’t”. Foolishly I believed him. ‘My marriage hasn’t been in good shape for some years. It died a death some time ago. But this doesn’t excuse Nadine for what she did. ‘I just want everyone to know  that Nadine Dorries is not the saintly person she appears to be. Because she’s an MP, people think of her as a pillar of society but in fact she’s a marriage-wrecker.’ Miss Dorries and Mr Butler split in October last year after around nine months together. But Mrs Butler has refused to forget the hurt their relationship has caused. She said yesterday: ‘It did all die down and now she is in the public eye again. It’s a bit annoying. ‘She’s never been into that sort of thing, camping and roughing it. She likes creature comforts and luxury hotels. She is definitely doing it for the publicity and for the money. ‘She will probably need the money when she gets out because she might not have a job.

Article: An anti-wolf Montana hunter sparked outrage on social media after running over two young wolves with his wife’s van.      Toby Bridges runs a Facebook page called “Lobo Watch” in which he details his plan to rid Montana of wolves.      The group describes itself as “Sportsmen Taking Charge of Predator Problems.\\"      “We are here to support the efforts of all who feel that in order to save wildlife, outdoor recreation and a healthy outdoor lifestyle, sportsmen must fight radical anti-hunting environmental groups and state and federal wildlife agencies which have abandoned those who have financed real wildlife conservation efforts in this country for the past 75 to 100 years,” the page says.      (Daily Mail)      On Sept. 18, the group posted photographs of a dead wolf in a photo album labelled “Conquests.” In one of the pictures the van can be seen.      “The idiot braggart and social sociopath who did this is a lowdown confirmed coward and anyone who associates with him is the same,” commented Deborah Leddon. “How low down and cowardly!”      Bridges was reportedly travelling around 55 mph when he hit two wolves, killing at least one.      The images have been reported to the Montana Fish, Wildlife and Park officials, who are investigating the incident.      “We're trying to determine, first of all, what exactly we can do with something somebody says on Facebook with no other physical evidence,” Warden Capt. Joseph Jaquith told the Great Falls Tribune. “Whether or not it's true remains to be seen.”      Bridges later claimed he was protecting a calf elk from the wolf and he drove by just in time.      (Daily Mail)      \\"Just past MM4 (mile maker 4), a cow elk and calf suddenly ran right out onto Interstate 90, and I let up on the gas and had just started to brake — in case more elk followed,\\" Bridges wrote. \\"What followed were two adult wolves. The cow jumped over the concrete barrier separating West and East traffic lanes, the calf stayed on 'my' side — and both were running up the highway, toward the pass. The wolves went after the calf ... and I let off the brake and hit the accelerator. I was going to save that calf.\\"      \\"There was no time to hit the brakes (like I really would?) and I heard two distinct loud 'thumps,'\\" he added.      He rounded the pass and saw “the dead wolf laid on the shoulder.”      “I saw the other pup — dragging a broken leg — topping a steep bank about 80 or 90 yards upslope, just as it went back into the timber,” he added. “I thought about going up and putting the young wolf out of its misery…then I gave that second thought. The two adult wolves were still in the very close vicinity ... and I did not have a gun in the van.\\"      He did, however, get out of the van to take pictures of the dead wolf.      Brooks Fahy, of the national wildlife conservation organization Predator Defense, compared the incident to a hate crime.      \\"To me it's like a hate crime,\\" Fahy told the Great Falls Tribune. \\"You look at the language in these posts and it starts feeling very psychopathic. I'm very concerned about this.\\"      \\"This type of vitriol and hatred tends to build if it goes unchallenged,\\" Fahy said. \\"One thing that's very disconcerting so far in the Northern Rockies — Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming — is we're constantly hearing of animals being intentionally gut-shot, dead wolves being posed in disturbing position for photos.

I saw the other pup — dragging a broken leg — topping a steep bank about 80 or 90 yards upslope, just as it went back into the timber. I thought about going up and putting the young wolf out of its misery…then I gave that second thought. The two adult wolves were still in the very close vicinity ... and I did not have a gun in the van.\\"      According to his narrative, Bridges then pulled his vehicle over to take pictures of the scene.      \\"While I snapped a few photos, I heard the pup howling in distress ... and a few minutes later I heard quite a ruckus up above ... then all went quiet. I do believe that the adult wolves finished off their severely injured offspring.\\"      Early on in the post Bridges said he accelerated toward the wolves, but later claims striking the wolves with his car was an accident.      \\"Two wolves out of the equation ... and it was all an accident. I love it when things go good,\\" Bridges wrote.      Jaquith said \\"in general\\" it is illegal and \\"very unsporting\\" to intentionally run animals down with a vehicle.      \\"It's very unsporting, regardless of how you feel about wolves or lawful means for harvest of wolves, certainly running them down on the highway is not what we would accept,\\" Jaquith said.      Last year a federal prosecutor charged six members of a Montana Hutterite colony for killing and burying two grizzly bears after chasing them down in vehicles until the bears succumbed to exhaustion. The colony was fined nearly 20,000 in the deaths.      Wolves are no longer managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Services after they were removed from federal Endangered Species Act protections through a rider Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., attached to a 2011 budget bill.      Brooks Fahy, of the national wildlife conservation organization Predator Defense, said Bridges' post is part of a growing online \\"subculture\\" of individuals who post graphic pictures and stories of predators being purposefully maimed, tortured and killed in online forums and on social media sites.      In recent years, federal Forest Service and U.S. Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services agents have come under public scrutiny after posting graphic pictures online of wounded predators in traps. In one instance a federal Wildlife Services agent posted photos of his domestic dogs attacking a coyote caught in a leg-hold trap.      \\"To me it's like a hate crime,\\" Fahy said. \\"You look at the language in these posts and it starts feeling very psychopathic. I'm very concerned about this.\\"      Fahy also questioned whether state and federal wildlife protection and law enforcement agencies are doing enough to try to curb the illegal killing and torturing of wolves and other predators. Fahy said as the controversy surrounding wolves continues to build, wildlife agencies appear to be turning a blind eye to disturbing online posts.      \\"This type of vitriol and hatred tends to build if it goes unchallenged,\\" Fahy said. \\"One thing that's very disconcerting so far in the Northern Rockies — Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming — is we're constantly hearing of animals being intentionally gut-shot, dead wolves being posed in disturbing position for photos. As far as I'm aware, none of these agencies, including Montana, have come out and publicly said, 'this is deplorable; this language is deplorable.'\\"      Jaquith said FWP is taking the matter seriously, but at the same time he defended Bridges' \\"right to free speech.\\"      \\"This is a very recent thing. We're not going to rush into it,\\" Jaquith said. \\"We're going to look at it, we're going to see exactly where it falls. We've had incidents where it takes a little bit of time to figure out what we're going to do about something. We're taking a look at it. We're not turning a blind eye to it.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/1sbheLK ||||| Anti-wolf hunter is now being investigated by Montana wildlife officials      He teamed story with album of images showing two dead animals      An anti-wolf hunter is being investigated by wildlife authorities after bragging about purposefully killing two animals - and posting a sick photo album of his conquests on Facebook.      Toby Bridges runs a fan page called Lobo Watch in which he describes his plots to rid Montana of all its wolves.      His latest post sparked outrage among the local community as it detailed the graphic manner in which he sped up his wife's van and ran over the young animals, leaving them for dead.      Outrage: Toby Bridges is being investigated by authorities after describing accelerating to run over wolves      To illustrate his story, Bridges posted four images of the wolves lying dead on the road, believed to be the Interstate 90.      The incident has since been reported to Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials, who are investigating the claims.      'We're trying to determine, first of all, what exactly we can do with something somebody says on Facebook with no other physical evidence,' Warden Capt Joseph Jaquith told the Great Falls Tribune.      'Whether or not it's true remains to be seen.'      Writing on his Facebook page, which has more than 5,000 followers, Bridges said a group of wolves were chasing a cow and calf elk across the highway about four miles east of Lookout Pass.      Although he later claims it was an accident, he describes how he 'let off the brake and hit the accelerator'.      Sick: He posted these graphic images of the animals on his Facebook page dedicated to slaying wolves      Horrific: Commenters blasted Montana-based Bridges as a 'sick b******' for treating the activity as a sport      'The wolves went after the calf ... and I let off the brake and hit the accelerator. I was going to save that calf,' he explained.      Bridges said his vehicle was driving approximately 55 mph 'when suddenly four young wolves shot right out in front of me'.      He added: 'There was no time to hit the brakes (like I really would?) and I heard two distinct loud 'thumps,'' Bridges wrote.      'Out of my mirror, I saw an almost black 50-pound wolf spinning around in the middle of the highway — with one very apparent, very badly broken back leg.      'In the other mirror, I saw one slightly smaller wolf rolling onto the shoulder.'

The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Metacritic is a website that aggregates reviews of media products: music albums, games, movies, TV shows, DVDs, and formerly, books. For each product, the scores from each review are averaged. Metacritic was created by Jason Dietz, Marc Doyle, and Julie Doyle Roberts. The site provides an excerpt from each review and hyperlinks to its source. A color of Green, Yellow or Red summarizes the critics' recommendations and therefore the general appeal of the product to reviewers and, to a lesser extent, the public. It is regarded as the video game industry's foremost review aggregator.  - The video game industry (sometimes referred to as the interactive entertainment industry) is the economic sector involved with the development, marketing and sales of video games. It encompasses dozens of job disciplines and employs thousands of people worldwide.  - Outerlight was a small video game development company .

Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).  - A mobile game is a video game played on a feature phone, smartphone, smartwatch, PDA, tablet computer, portable media player or calculator.  - Video game development is the process of creating a video game. Development is undertaken by a game developer, which may range from one person to a large business. Traditional commercial PC and console games are normally funded by a publisher and take several years to develop.

They convey different events, as they detail different individuals resigning from the Knesset and the purpose of the resignation. Let's examine each sentence individually: 1. In October 2015, Shuli Mualem resigned from the Knesset in order to allow Bennett to take over his seat.        This sentence is about Shuli Mualem, who decides to step down from their position at the Knesset in October 2015. The main reason for this resignation is to create an opportunity for Bennett to take Shuli Mualem's seat and become a Knesset member. In this scenario, Bennett gains a position in the Knesset due to Shuli Mualem's resignation. 2. In October 2015, Bennett resigned from the Knesset in order to enable Shuli Mualem to take his seat.    In this second sentence, the roles are reversed. Bennett is the one who resigns from the Knesset in October 2015, leaving their seat open. The primary purpose of Bennett's resignation is to provide Shuli Mualem with the chance to join the Knesset and take Bennett's seat. In this context, Shuli Mualem gains a position in the Knesset as a result of Bennett's resignation. In summary, the two sentences describe different actions taken by Shuli Mualem and Bennett. In the first sentence, Shuli Mualem resigns to allow Bennett to take their seat in the Knesset, while in the second sentence, Bennett resigns to enable Shuli Mualem to take over their seat in the Knesset. The meanings of these sentences are not the same, as they represent distinct events and actions taken by the two individuals involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every morning when Jeff wakes up, he spends some time under a tanning machine, hits the speedbag, drinks a health drink, and races the bus to work on foot. Jeff presents himself as happy-go-lucky and quite a joker, but others tend to see him as obnoxious and boorish. Althea, who watches the race riots every night on TV with great interest, chastises Jeff for not having sympathy for the problems of black Americans. One morning, Jeff wakes up to find that his pigment has changed. He tries to fall back asleep, thinking that it is a dream, but to no avail. He tries taking a shower to wash the \\"black\\" off him, but finds it does not work, when Althea walks into the bathroom, and screams. He explains to her that the \\"Negro in the bathroom\\" is him. At first, Jeff believes this to be the result of spending too much time under the tanning machine.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: While originally reluctant to jump on the bandwagon of watching \\"Lost\\", I accidentally caught one episode at the beginning of season 1the one with the polar-bearand it has had my undivided attention ever since. The show, that is. Not the polar bear. So bear (heh) with me while I throw out as much rambling, semi-coherent praise as I can muster. \\"Lost\\" takes a simple idea of a passenger flight full of people crashing onto a desert island, and gradually adds extraordinary depth to its premise by exploring each character deeply and unflinchinglywhat drives them, who are they? Where did they come from? It soon becomes clear that the island upon which they are stranded acts as a common denominator for many things in their lives, whether they're running away from something (Sawyer and Kate among others) or getting in touch with spirituality (Locke, Claire). But \\"Lost\\" also zooms in on the island itself and the mysterious horrors that it houses... and they all seem to be strangely connected. While television actors are not exactly known for their subtlety or dazzling acting abilities, most of the cast of \\"Lost\\" are, in truth, spectacular actors for their respective parts, projecting heart and humour in their performances. There's also a multitude of eyecandy, but not generally of the plastic Hollywood kind as most TV shows. The characters all feel very real and they are extremely compelling to watch. Their interactions rarely fall prey to predictable sappiness, petty arguments or cheesy melodrama (although they are annoyingly secretive)  these people are first and foremost trying to survive and whatever relationship appears is treated secondary to action. The realism of these characters facilitate an already well-sculptured plot.  About this plot... Imagine a tree as the template plot, then the branches as subplots (in this case, one branch for every character)  well, Lost adds twigs to each branch and then tiny twigs to those twigs as other story lines. If you're a brother/sister to one of the main characters in the flashbacks, you will get your own storyline. If you're a DOG you will have your own storyline. Unless the writers manage to weave them all together into some glorious culmination in the end, they are setting themselves up. I am more than a little worried there will be some disappointing cop-out to this show, as I'm sure most people are. But assuming the writers do pull this off, \\"Lost\\" is possibly the best show ever to hit television. 9/10 OPTIONS:  A). negative.  B). positive.","output":"B). Positive. The reviewer expresses significant praise for the television show \\"Lost\\", citing aspects such as the depth of character exploration, quality of acting, the believable realism of the characters, and the appealing complexity of the storyline. The reviewer even suggests that if the show's writers effectively manage the plot, \\"Lost\\" could be considered the best show ever to hit television. These aspects indicate a strong positive sentiment towards the show. However, it should be noted that the reviewer does express some minor concerns towards the potential downfall of the plot if it's not properly concluded, hinting at a bit of hesitance. Yet, this doesn't outweigh the pervasive positivity in the review. Therefore, based on the predominantly positive comments and the overall rating of 9/10, the correct sentiment of this review is positive."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Build a movie plot around this: who is hope to bring Butch  in alive?

With a large bounty on his head, many have tried – and failed – to bring him in alive. That's when Red \\"Shadows\\" O'Reilly, a hardened and skilled bounty hunter with a personal vendetta, enters the fray.  Red's motivation to bring Butch in alive stems from the fact that Butch had killed his younger brother during a vicious armed robbery years ago. Red has always harbored guilt for not being able to protect his brother, and he believes capturing Butch and bringing him to justice can finally provide closure to his haunted past.  As Red carefully gathers information about Butch's gang, plans their every move, and enlists the assistance of other bounty hunters with their own unique skills, he uncovers a hidden side to Butch that makes him question everything he thought he knew about the infamous outlaw. It turns out that Butch has been secretly funding an orphanage with his stolen money, inspiring loyalty and creating a generation of followers. Despite his newfound knowledge of Butch's altruistic actions, Red remains focused on his mission, inspired by the spirit of his deceased brother. After numerous intense shootouts, betrayals, and unexpected alliances, Red finally captures Butch, but not without questioning his own beliefs and values. The film culminates in a dramatic courthouse showdown where Red stands as a witness to Butch's sentence. He must battle with the moral questions of whether justice is being served and if his personal desire for vengeance is justified. In the end, Red chooses to walk away from his career as a bounty hunter, realizing that revenge isn't the answer to finding peace with his past.

Step 3: Observe and identify problems Innovation often begins by observing and identifying problems or areas of improvement in everyday life, work, or society. Pay close attention to the world around you and consider potential ways to address the challenges you encounter. Step 4: Use brainstorming techniques Once you've identified a problem, use brainstorming techniques to generate innovative solutions. For example, mind mapping, rapid ideation sessions, or the \\"six thinking hats\\" method can help you think creatively. Step 5: Challenge the status quo Sometimes, traditional methods or solutions might not be the best option. If you find yourself stuck on a problem or in a rut, ask yourself what you can do differently or if there's a better way to approach the situation. Step 6: Collaborate with others Innovation often comes from collaboration. Work with others who have different skill sets, backgrounds, and perspectives to create a diverse environment. This fusion of different ideas and skills can lead to innovative solutions. Step 7: Experiment and iterate Innovation involves trial and error. Test your ideas, learn from your mistakes, and make adjustments as needed. This is an essential part of the innovation process, as learning from your failures can inform future success. Step 8: Foster a culture of innovation Surround yourself with an environment that encourages innovation. Support others' ideas and give them space to explore and grow, and look for inspiration from various sources. By following these steps, you'll be on your way to thinking innovatively and embracing innovation in your personal and professional life."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Answer the question below:   If Mona is comparing fossils she found in very old rocks to fossils she found in newer rocks.

Plot title: Silent House Movie plot: Note: This is a remake of the 2010 Spanish-language low-budget Uruguayan horror film 'La Casa Muda'. Both the original and this remake were (allegedly) shot in one take with no actual cuts or edits with a single camera, similar to the 1948 experimental film 'Rope' by Alfred Hitchcock.We begin with an overhead shot of a young woman, Sarah (Elizabeth Olsen) sitting on some rocks in a lake. As she gets off and begins to hop among the rocks back to the shore, the camera descends and begins following Sarah in real-time. She walks up to an obviously dilapidated house. The house is three stories tall and has red-brick exteriors with all of the windows boarded up. Sarah's father John (Adam Trese) meets her near the front steps and tells her sternly to pick up the gardening tools lying about. John then asks Sarah about her Facebook profile, and she admits that her ex-boyfriend may want to get back together with her, much to John's disapproval.John's younger brother and Sarah's Uncle Peter (Eric Sheffer Stevens) walks through the front door and greets the two of them. He says that there is a big problem in the house. They walk in, and though it is daylight outside, the house is almost pitch black as all the windows are boarded. The trio turn on their electric lanterns and follow Peter to the dining room (the source of the problem) where John hits the wall with a sledgehammer to reveal that mold has grown within the walls, and maybe throughout the entire house. Tools and clutter are strewn everywhere. They take a picture of the mold with their polaroid camera and after her father walks out of the room Peter stares at Sarah, telling her how beautiful of a woman she has become. After they enter the living room, John and Peter then leave to go into another part of the house, and Sarah starts up the stairs when she hears a knock at the front door.She opens the door to see a girl roughly her age standing on the porch.

Connan befriends subotai.","output":"Title: Chronicle of the Unbreakable Bond Genre: Action, Adventure, Drama Plot Summary: In a time when kingdoms and empires clash with sword and sorcery, Connan, the last survivor of his bloodline, sets forth on a quest to avenge the brutal massacre of his people by the vicious warlord, Thulsa Do'rak. Along the way, Connan befriends an enigmatic thief, Subotai, and the two of them embark on a dangerous journey through war-torn lands and mythical realms filled with unimaginable creatures, ferocious battles, and legends of old. Act 1: In the aftermath of the violent raid that leaves his village in ruins and his entire clan slaughtered, Connan barely escapes with his life. Now an orphan, he is taken in by a hermit who teaches him about herbs, healing arts, and other practical skills. Among the ravines and hills, Connan grows up to be strong and resourceful with intense hatred for Do'rak and a burning desire to take revenge. Years later, a chance encounter with a group of thieves leads Connan to Subotai, a skilled archer and thief with a sharp wit and unmatched agility. Initially cautious of each other, the two eventually gain each other's trust and form an unbreakable bond of friendship. Subotai shares his knowledge of the world, and together they hone their skills in combat and survival, all the while plotting their revenge on Do'rak and his ruthless empire. Act 2: As Connan and Subotai travel across the lands, they encounter various groups of people, some helpful, some hostile. Among them, a blind oracle predicts a great fate awaiting the duo, and a warrior princess named Valeria who aids them in their journey; she is captivated by Connan's iron will and unwavering sense of justice. The trio encounters a number of ordeals that test their limits, including battling supernatural beasts, traversing perilous landscapes, and facing off against a band of mercenaries sent by Do'rak upon learning about Connan's intentions. Connan and Subotai, along with Valeria, display great teamwork, loyalty, and the essence of true friendship, standing by each other through thick and thin. Act 3: As the trio uncover the whereabouts of Do'rak's stronghold—a fortress hidden within the nearly impenetrable, treacherous Labyrinth of Shadows, they discover that to reach and defeat their nemesis, they must liberate four relics known as the \\"Pillars of Eternity\\" scattered across the land. These relics hold the power to dissolve the ancient ward guarding the entrance of the Labyrinth. Connan, Subotai, and Valeria confront a series of challenges as they each face a task to retrieve a relic of their own. Their friendship and individual strengths are put to the test, but their unwavering determination to avenge the innocents slaughtered by Do'rak and to end his reign of terror bind them together in an unbreakable bond. The climax of the movie unfolds as our heroes assemble the Pillars of Eternity and unlock the hidden door to the Labyrinth of Shadows. They battle their way through the fortress filled with monstrous guards and lethal traps. Finally, they confront the warlord, Thulsa Do'rak, and after an epic battle filled with blood, sweat, and tears, ultimately emerge victorious. Epilogue: In the end, Connan, Subotai, and Valeria dismantle Do'rak's empire, liberating the people who once lived under his rule. Our protagonists deviate from their separate paths, enriched by the bonds forged on their remarkable journey and each embarking on their own path of adventure. The movie ends with a narration that these tales of the unbreakable bond between Connan and Subotai will echo through the annals of time—stories of friendship, loyalty, and courage in the face of adversity, forever reminding us of what it means to be human."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first name of the subject whose identification with the cathedral itself is emphasized by her monumental stature?  Van Eyck gives Mary three roles: Mother of Christ, the personification of the \\"Ecclesia Triumphans\\" and Queen of Heaven, the latter apparent from her jewel-studded crown. The painting's near miniature size contrasts with Mary's unrealistically large stature compared with her setting. She physically dominates the cathedral; her head is almost level with the approximately sixty feet high gallery. This distortion of scale is found in a number of other van Eyck's Madonna paintings, where the arches of the mostly gothic interior do not allow headroom for the virgin. Pächt describes the interior as a \\"throne room\\", which envelopes her as if a \\"carrying case\\". Her monumental stature reflects a tradition reaching back to an Italo-Byzantine type – perhaps best known through Giotto's Ognissanti Madonna (c. 1310) – and emphasises her identification with the cathedral itself. Till-Holger Borchert says that van Eyck did not paint her as \\"the Madonna in a church\\", but instead as metaphor, presenting Mary \\"as the Church\\". This idea that her size represents her embodiment as the church was first suggested by Erwin Panofsky in 1941. Art historians in the 19th century, who thought the work was executed early in van Eyck's career, attributed her scale as the mistake of a relatively immature painter.The composition is today seen as deliberate, and opposite to both his Madonna of Chancellor Rolin and Arnolfini Portrait. These works show interiors seemingly too small to contain the figures, a device van Eyck used to create and emphasise an intimate space shared by donor and saint. The Virgin's height recalls his Annunciation of 1434–36, although in that composition there are no architectural fittings to give a clear scale to the building. Perhaps reflecting the view of a \\"relatively immature painter\\", a copy of the Annunciation by Joos van Cleve shows Mary at a more realistic proportion scale to her surroundings.Mary is presented as a Marian apparition; in this case she probably appears before a donor, who would have been kneeling...

Pricing can vary depending on factors such as the brand, quality, and where you purchase it from. 6. Locate stores or online platforms: Look for local grocery stores, supermarkets, or specialty cooking stores in your area that sell parchment paper. Alternatively, find online platforms like Amazon, Walmart, or Target, where you can purchase parchment paper. Compare prices, customer reviews, and shipping options on the available parchment paper products before making your final purchase decision. 7.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the scientific name of the kongoni? , can you please find it?   The hartebeest (; Alcelaphus buselaphus), also known as kongoni, is an African antelope. Eight subspecies have been described, including two sometimes considered to be independent species. A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years.

Answer the following question: Given the background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.  and the situation: Mike is studying the predator prey relationship. He is specifically studying three species, species A, species B, and species C. Species A is a predator; species B is the prey; and species C is a plant species that species B lives on. Mike now needs to figure out how the predator prey relationship balance the ecosystem.  Answer the following question: If species B population increase, would species C population increase or decrease? Answer:","output":"If the population of species B (the prey) increases, then the population of species C (the plant species that species B lives on) would likely decrease. This is because species B would consume more of species C as its population grows, putting more pressure on the plant species and potentially reducing its overall population in the ecosystem."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Wrap your lobster in a few layers of cool, damp—not dripping wet—newspaper. Cool water will keep your lobster's metabolism low so they remain docile and sluggish. Dry lobsters are more likely to die before you're ready to prepare them. Use saltwater to dampen the newspapers. Tap water can kill your lobster. Containers with a simple opening, like a cooler or a cardboard box, work well for storing lobsters. Store 1 or 2 lobsters in the container at a time to avoid contention between your lobsters. The colder your lobster is, the less it will move. If you do not use a cooler to store your lobster, add in at least 1 or 2 ice packs. Make enough room for your lobster's container and slide it carefully into the fridge. If possible, put it in the darkest or coolest corner of the fridge to keep your lobster's metabolism down. Lobsters with a low metabolism move and struggle less. Set a timer for 5-6 hours and, when the timer goes off, remove your lobster from the container to check its newspaper wrapping. If the newspaper is dry or warm, change the newspapers for new, damp wrapping. Do not keep your lobster out on the counter for any longer than a few minutes. Storing your lobster at room temperature can dry out your lobster's wrapping and cause premature death. Summary:","output":"The article provides detailed instructions on how to properly store live lobsters using cool, damp newspaper and a container, while ensuring their environment is optimal for maintaining low metabolism and preventing premature death by keeping them in a cool, dark area within a fridge and regularly checking the condition of the wrapping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: You are given two sentences. You have to find if there is entailment or agreement of the Hypothesis by the Premise. From the given pair of sentences, you should identify if there is enough information in the Premise to support the claim made in the Hypothesis. The Premise may not exactly be the same as Hypothesis. Your task is to return 'entails' if the premise supports hypothesis else return 'neutral'. Problem:Premise: A watershed is a dynamic system that includes the area of land delineated by the drainage basin, its aquatic components (streams and rivers, agricultural drains, lakes and ponds, riparian zones, and wetlands), and its plant and animal life.   Hypothesis: All of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or the \\"wet\\" term  watershed Solution:","output":"Step 1: Read and understand the Premise and Hypothesis. Premise: A watershed is a dynamic system that includes the area of land delineated by the drainage basin, its aquatic components (streams and rivers, agricultural drains, lakes and ponds, riparian zones, and wetlands), and its plant and animal life. Hypothesis: All of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or the \\"wet\\" term watershed. Step 2: Identify the key components of the Premise and Hypothesis. Premise: - Watershed is a dynamic system - Components: area of land delineated by the drainage basin, aquatic components (streams, rivers, drains, lakes, ponds, riparian zones, wetlands), plant and animal life Hypothesis: - Land drained by river system - Called basin or \\"wet\\" term watershed Step 3: Analyze the information provided in the Premise and compare it with the claim made in the Hypothesis. The Premise states that a watershed is a dynamic system that includes the area of land delineated by the drainage basin, along with its aquatic components, plant, and animal life. The Hypothesis claims that all of the land drained by a river system is called its basin, or the \\"wet\\" term watershed. Step 4: Determine if the Premise entails or supports the Hypothesis. The Premise provides enough information about a watershed and its components to support the claim made in the Hypothesis that the land drained by a river system is called its basin or watershed. The Premise explains that a watershed includes the area of land delineated by the drainage basin, which corresponds to the land drained by a river system as stated in the Hypothesis. Step 5: Return the final answer. Since the information in the Premise supports the claim made in the Hypothesis, the solution is 'entails'."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What college is the only project Austen Harrison ever did in Britain? from the following article ?  Administration of Nuffield's donation was the responsibility of the University, as the college did not become an independent body until after the Second World War. A sub-committee, consisting of three heads of Oxford colleges (Sir William Beveridge from University College; Alfred Emden from St Edmund Hall; and Linda Grier from Lady Margaret Hall), was appointed to choose the architect; Emden appears to have played the major part in the group's work. Eight architects were initially asked to compete, including Louis de Soissons, Vincent Harris, Austen Harrison, Charles Holden, Edward Maufe, and Hubert Worthington. All but Holden and Maufe submitted photographs of their work, and the sub-committee then recommended Harrison, a decision confirmed after he was interviewed on 17 June 1938. At that time, Harrison had never worked in Britain: although he had qualified there, he had practised in Greece and Palestine.  Indeed, the college seems to have been his only project in the country, and remains his best known work, along with his later University of Ghana.  Harrison was not given any restrictions or limitations on style; Nuffield agreed to Harrison's appointment, but was not consulted on the architectural style of the college before Harrison started work. When Nuffield's donation was announced, it was reported that the \\"general idea\\" was that the college buildings should be sited behind gardens, similar to the memorial gardens at Christ Church, Oxford, so that those entering Oxford from the west would be faced with a \\"beautiful vista of well-planned gardens seen through railings\\"; this idea did not form part of Harrison's designs. After Harrison's preliminary studies, it became clear that the proposed site could not contain a college and an institute for social science research as planned; Nuffield agreed to provide an additional plot of land on the opposite side of Worcester Street. Harrison proposed to build the college on the main site, with the institute on the second site. The hall was to be at the east end...

He was always interested in my life-how my family was doing. The calls even came when he and my mother were in Australia, England or Florida. Nine years ago when I bought me first house, my father, 67 years old, spent eight hours a day for three days, painting my house. He would not allow me to pay someone to have it done.

Beginning in the lush paradise of Edenia, Princess Aria is blissfully unaware of the ever-looming darkness on the horizon. However, her life is turned upside down when she stumbles upon her father, the King, discussing with his closest advisors the worrying news regarding Shao Kahn's plans to invade their realm and claim its throne. Aria's father reveals that the emblems protecting Edenia's borders have gradually been destroyed by Shao Kahn's minions, increasing the risk of invasion. As the tension between the realms escalates, Aria, seeking to save her homeland, embarks on an epic adventure with her closest friends and skilled warriors - Kai, a firebender, and Zara, a master archer. Their mission is to seek the Guardians of the Elements, powerful, ancient beings that were once entrusted to protect and guide the denizens of Edenia.

I prefer the old cell phones compared to new cell phones because the","output":"old cell phones had a certain charm and simplicity to them. They were built to last, with sturdy buttons and a compact design that made them easy to carry around. The battery life was phenomenal and would hold its charge for days without the need for constant recharging. Plus, there was something deeply satisfying about the tactile feedback of pressing actual buttons, as opposed to tapping on a digital screen. Step 1: Establish the setting and narrator's perspective I introduced the old cell phones and their key features from the narrator's point of view, highlighting their charm, sturdiness, and battery life. Step 2: Introduce a nostalgic sentiment I emphasized the satisfaction derived from using actual buttons which not only evokes nostalgia but also allows a direct comparison with modern touchscreen phones. Nowadays, smartphones have become a necessity for most people. They perform countless tasks, far surpassing the abilities of old cell phones. Yet, there are still moments when I find myself longing for the good old days. I remember spending hours playing 'Snake,' a simple yet addictive game that captivated users for hours on end. There was also the unparalleled satisfaction of composing a text message using T9 predictive text, mastering the art of shortening words while still retaining their meaning. Step 3: Acknowledge modern advancements I acknowledged the benefits and capabilities of modern smartphones, establishing a contrast with the simplicity of old cell phones. Step 4: Express deeper nostalgia and reminiscence I delved into reminiscing about popular activities, such as playing 'Snake' and composing messages through T9 predictive text, which were characteristic and enjoyable aspects of old cell phones. In a world where everything is rapidly advancing, I sometimes feel an overwhelming sense of information overload. Constant notifications, endless apps, and the intrusive nature of social media can, at times, make modern smartphones draining and stressful. It's in these moments that I truly appreciate the simplicity and straightforwardness of my old cell phone. Step 5: Establish emotional appeal and juxtaposition I described the overwhelming nature of smartphones, creating a juxtaposition between the calm and simple experiences provided by old cell phones and the stress-inducing aspects of modern technology. As technology continues to evolve, I understand that these old cell phones will likely become obsolete and forgotten. However, there will always be a special place in my heart for the reliable, tactile, and undeniably nostalgic experience of using an old cell phone. Step 6: Conclude the story by accepting the passage of time I accepted the fact that old cell phones will likely be replaced by newer technologies but reinforced the lasting emotional impact they have on the narrator. All in all, by understanding the emotions and reasoning behind the preference for old cell phones, the story emphasizes nostalgia, simplicity, and the longing for a seemingly less-complicated time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your task is to classify given movie review into two categories: 1) positive, and 2) negative based on its content. Problem:This film was the recipient of the 1990 Academy award for Best Animated Short Film. Over the last few weeks, I have seen dozens of the nominees and recipients of this award from the last 30 years and I really think that this film might just be the worst of them all--yet it wasn't just a nominee but it won!! I assume that 1989 must have just been a horrible year for the genre.The film shows a group of characters that look a bit like super-skinny Uncle Festers. The appear to be simple articulated figures who are moved using stop motion animation. All are identical--with the same faces, bodies and clothes. The only difference is that each has a different number drawn on their backs. They are all standing on a large platform that is suspended, as if by magic, in space. Each has a pole and their is also a box on the platform. The platform begins tilting slightly and in response the men move about in an effort to balance the platform. This goes on and on and on and on for the longest time. The only relief from this tedium is when one of them acts rather nasty towards the end, but it just isn't enough to make this fun to watch in the least. Aside from passable stop motion animation, this short offers nothing of interest to me....NOTHING.By the way, the great short KNICK KNACK also came out in 1989 and I have no idea why it was not among the nominees. It was a GREAT short and was far better than any of the nominees that year or the year before. Perhaps Pixar's success in previous years resulted in a bias against them, but KNICK KNACK is so clever and so funny it seems almost criminal to have ignored it. Could Pixar have not entered it? This seems unlikely. Solution:","output":"Step 1: Read the movie review carefully. Step 2: Identify the relevant information that can help determine if the review is positive or negative.

Information:  - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Sturgeon is the common name for the 27 species of fish belonging to the family Acipenseridae. Their evolution dates back to the Triassic some 245 to 208 million years ago. The family is grouped into four genera: \\"Acipenser\\", \\"Huso\\", \\"Scaphirhynchus\\" and \\"Pseudoscaphirhynchus\\". Four species may now be extinct. Two closely related species, \\"Polyodon spathula\\" (paddlefish) and \\"Psephurus gladius\\" (Chinese paddlefish, possibly extinct) are of the same order, Acipenseriformes, but are in the family Polyodontidae and are not considered to be \\"true\\" sturgeons. Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America.  Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries. Some species inhabit freshwater environments exclusively while others primarily inhabit marine environments near coastal areas, and are known to venture into open ocean.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition.  - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia . It contains two species , which both are critically endangered : Huso dauricus ( Georgi , 1775 ) ( kaluga ) Huso huso ( Linnaeus , 1758 ) ( beluga ) Recent data indicate a polyphyletic origin of the genus Huso , and it is suggested that the two Huso species should be included in the genus Acipenser .

In the first quarter, Denver was first out of the gate as FB Michael Pittman got a 1-yard TD run.  The Chargers would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 34-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Denver replied with QB Jay Cutler completing a 3-yard and a 14-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  San Diego would immediately respond with RB Darren Sproles returning the kickoff 103 yards for a touchdown, yet the Broncos replied with rookie kicker Matt Prater getting a 52-yard field goal.  The Chargers would strike as their lead as QB Philip Rivers completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, yet Denver retaliated with Cutler completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. In the third quarter, San Diego started to rally as Rivers completed a 15-yard TD pass to Chambers, and Kaeding kicked a 21-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Chargers took the lead with Kaeding's 28-yard field goal and Rivers' 66-yard TD pass to Sproles. Fortunately, the Broncos responded with a 12-play, 80-yard drive (which included a controversial officiating call that turned a Cutler fumble into an incomplete pass) that was capped off with Cutler's 4-yard TD pass to rookie WR Eddie Royal, followed by Cutler's successful 2-point conversion pass to Royal. Brandon Marshall's 18 receptions would become a single-game franchise record and tie for 2nd most in league history. How many yards longer was Kaeding's longest field goal compared with his shortest?","output":"To answer this question, I need to find Nate Kaeding's longest and shortest field goals from the article.  In the article, it mentions Kaeding's field goals as follows:  1. A 34-yard field goal in the first quarter 2. A 21-yard field goal in the third quarter 3. A 28-yard field goal in the fourth quarter Now, I will compare the longest and shortest field goals by Kaeding: The longest field goal is 34 yards, which happened in the first quarter. The shortest field goal is 21 yards, which happened in the third quarter. So, the difference of yards between Kaeding's longest and shortest field goal is: 34 yards (longest) - 21 yards (shortest) = 13 yards.

Lyndon Baines Johnson (; August 27, 1908 - January 22, 1973), often referred to by his initials LBJ, was an American politician who served as the 36th President of the United States from 1963 to 1969, assuming the office after having served as the 37th Vice President of the United States from 1961 to 1963. A Democrat from Texas, he also served as a United States Representative and as the Majority Leader in the United States Senate. Johnson is one of only four people who have served in all four federal elected positions. In 1964, at Johnson's request, Congress passed the Revenue Act of 1964 and the Economic Opportunity Act, as part of the war on poverty. Johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as Head Start, food stamps and Work Study. During Johnson's years in office, national poverty declined significantly, with the percentage of Americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 percent to 12 percent.  Johnson took an additional step in the War on Poverty with an urban renewal effort, presenting to Congress in January 1966 the \\"Demonstration Cities Program\\". To be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to \\"arrest blight and decay and make substantial impact on the development of its entire city.\\" Johnson requested an investment of 400 million per year totaling 2.4 billion. In the fall of 1966 the Congress passed a substantially reduced program costing 900 million, which Johnson later called the Model Cities Program. Changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill; the New York Times wrote 22 years later that the program was for the most part a failure.  Johnson's initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of The Commission on Heart Disease, Cancer and Strokes (HDCS). Combined, these diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nation's deaths in 1962. To enact recommendations of the commission, Johnson asked Congress for funds to set up the Regional Medical Program (RMP), to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice; Congress passed a significantly watered down version.  As a back-up position, in 1965 Johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under Social Security. The key player in initiating this program, named Medicare, was Wilbur Mills, Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. In order to reduce Republican opposition, Mills suggested that Medicare be fashioned as a three layer cake--hospital insurance under Social Security, a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor, known as Medicaid. The bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on April 8. The effort in the Senate was considerably more complicated; however, the Medicare bill passed Congress on July 28 after negotiation in a conference committee. Medicare now covers tens of millions of Americans. Johnson gave the first two Medicare cards to former President Harry S Truman and his wife Bess after signing the Medicare bill at the Truman Library in Independence, Missouri.

Summarize this article: Parenting skills, like any other ability, can be learned.  Taking parenting classes can help you learn what you’ll need to know and do as you prepare for the arrival of a newborn.  Most classes cover changing diapers, bathing, burping, and feeding your baby, among other skills. For a unique bonding experience, attend these classes with your partner. Books that offer advice to expectant parents (and, especially, books targeted specifically towards men) can offer valuable insights and information.  Many of these books are available at your local library, though you could of course buy them, too. Focus on learning practical skills like how to calm a crying baby. When your partner goes to the doctor for checkups and ultrasounds, tag along.  Listen to the doctor’s advice.  Write down information about what the birth process will entail and how you can prepare for the newborn’s arrival. Talk to your partner about where they want you to be during labor.  Some expectant mothers want their partners in the birthing room during labor.  Others expect their partner to remain outside.  There is no right way for a couple to plan this experience, but you should discuss the options together and come to an agreement. If you’re invited into the birthing room, you’ll probably just be there to squeeze your partner’s hand and offer moral support.

On 5 September 2003, Mui publicly announced that she had cervical cancer, from which her sister had also died. She held a series of eight shows at the Hong Kong Coliseum from 6-11 November and 14-15 November 2003, which were to be her last concerts before her death.  Her symbolic act was to \\"marry the stage\\", which was accompanied by her hit song \\"Sunset Melody\\" (Xi Yang Zhi Ge ) as she exited the stage. The last song she performed on stage was \\"Cherish When We Meet Again\\" (Zhen Xi Zai Hui Shi ), a rendition of The Manhattans' \\"Let's Just Kiss And Say Goodbye\\" on 15 November 2003, where she was accompanied by her friends on the stage. She eventually succumbed to cervical cancer and died of respiratory complications leading to lung failure at Hong Kong Sanatorium and Hospital on 30 December 2003 at 02:50 (HK local time). She was 40 years old. Thousands of fans turned out for her funeral at North Point in January 2004.

Main subject: Both sentences feature \\"Kerry\\" (most likely referring to John Kerry, who served as the U.S. Secretary of State from 2013 to 2017) as the main subject. This establishes a common topic in both sentences. 2. Central theme: The two sentences are centered around the \\"Mideast peace process,\\" or efforts aimed at resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This central theme is another strong point of similarity. 3. Kerry's approach: In the first sentence, Kerry is described as pursuing a 'quiet strategy,' which indicates that he's working on the peace process discreetly or without making a lot of noise. In the second sentence, it is noted that Kerry is meeting with Israeli leaders, a direct and public effort to push forward the Mideast peace process. Although these specifics differ, the overall implication in both sentences is that Kerry is involved in diplomatic efforts to further the peace process in the Mideast. The reason why the similarity is not a perfect 5 is because the two sentences do not convey the exact same information.

Write an article that answers the following question: Were more of Iran's population on fixed-line phones or mobile phones in 2010?","output":"Title: Fixed-line vs. Mobile Phone Usage in Iran in 2010 Introduction Telecommunications in Iran, like in many other developing countries, has witnessed rapid growth in recent years. The transition from fixed-line phones to mobile phones has been particularly noticeable as people search for more effective ways to communicate in an increasingly digital world. The question at hand is whether fixed-line phone usage or mobile phone usage was more prevalent in Iran's population in 2010. Background  To address this question, it's essential to take a look at the telecommunications landscape in Iran at the time. In the early 2000s, access to phone services was limited, but the Iranian government soon undertook ambitious projects to expand the country's telecommunications infrastructure. Consequently, both fixed-line and mobile phone subscriptions increased, greatly enhancing the accessibility of phone services to the population. Methodology To make an accurate comparison between fixed-line and mobile phone usage among Iran's population in 2010, various factors were considered, including data from the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), government and industry reports, as well as historical trends. Results According to a report from the ITU, fixed-line phone subscriptions in Iran reached 27 million by the end of 2010, representing a penetration rate of 36.2% in a population of around 73 million. In the same timeframe, the number of mobile phone subscriptions surpassed 65 million, accounting for a penetration rate of approximately 89.1%. In other words, almost nine in every ten people in Iran had a mobile phone, while slightly more than a third had access to a fixed-line phone. Discussion The higher prevalence of mobile phones, compared with fixed-line phones, can be attributed to a variety of factors. One of the primary reasons is the superior flexibility and mobility offered by mobile phones, which allow users to communicate and access the internet on the go. Additionally, mobile phone technology experienced rapid advancements during the latter part of the 2000s, putting mobile phones at the forefront of telecommunications trends. Moreover, Iran's government introduced policies to promote and invest in mobile phone services, such as allocating resources to expand network coverage and offering concessional loans to encourage private companies to enter the market. These initiatives led to increased competition, which in turn resulted in lower prices and attractive offers for consumers, further driving the surge in mobile phone adoption in Iran. Conclusion The analysis of available data and factors influencing the telecommunications industry in Iran during 2010 clearly shows that mobile phones were more prevalent among the population than fixed-line phones. This marked shift toward mobile phone usage can be attributed to the technological advancements, government policies, and increased accessibility that accompanied the rapid expansion of the mobile phone industry. As we continue into the digital age, it is evident that mobile phones have become a preferred mode of communication for many people worldwide, and the case of Iran in 2010 was no exception."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ellington was born on April 29, 1899, to James Edward Ellington and Daisy (Kennedy) Ellington in Washington, D.C. Both his parents were pianists. Daisy primarily played parlor songs and James preferred operatic arias. From 1936, Ellington began to make recordings with smaller groups (sextets, octets, and nonets) drawn from his then-15-man orchestra and he composed pieces intended to feature a specific instrumentalist, as with \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. In 1937, Ellington returned to the Cotton Club which had relocated to the mid-town Theater District. In the summer of that year, his father died, and due to many expenses, Ellington's finances were tight, although his situation improved the following year.  After leaving agent Irving Mills, he signed on with the William Morris Agency. Mills though continued to record Ellington. After only a year, his Master and Variety labels, the small groups had recorded for the latter, collapsed in late 1937, Mills placed Ellington back on Brunswick and those small group units on Vocalion through to 1940. Well known sides continued to be recorded, \\"Caravan\\" in 1937, and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" the following year.  Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist, began his association with Ellington in 1939. Nicknamed \\"Swee' Pea\\" for his mild manner, Strayhorn soon became a vital member of the Ellington organization. Ellington showed great fondness for Strayhorn and never failed to speak glowingly of the man and their collaborative working relationship, \\"my right arm, my left arm, all the eyes in the back of my head, my brain waves in his head, and his in mine\\". Strayhorn, with his training in classical music, not only contributed his original lyrics and music, but also arranged and polished many of Ellington's works, becoming a second Ellington or \\"Duke's doppelganger\\". It was not uncommon for Strayhorn to fill in for Duke, whether in conducting or rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage, and in the recording studio. The 1930s ended with a very successful European tour just as World War II loomed in Europe. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Any other aspects of his career happen during this time frame?","output":"In the provided text, several aspects of Ellington's career between 1936 and the late 1930s are given. Here are few of them: 1. He began making recordings with smaller groups - sextets, octets, and nonets - derived from his fifteen-man orchestra, and began composing pieces intended to spotlight specific instrumentalists. These compositions include \\"Jeep's Blues\\" for Johnny Hodges, \\"Yearning for Love\\" for Lawrence Brown, \\"Trumpet in Spades\\" for Rex Stewart, \\"Echoes of Harlem\\" for Cootie Williams, and \\"Clarinet Lament\\" for Barney Bigard. 2. In 1937, he returned to the relocated Cotton Club in the Theatre District and faced financial struggles after his father's death, until his situation improved the next year. 3. He left agent Irving Mills and joined the William Morris Agency. However, Mills continued to record his music. When Mills' labels folded in 1937, he put Ellington back on Brunswick and the small group units on the Vocalion label. 4. He produced well-known pieces like \\"Caravan\\" in 1937 and \\"I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart\\" in 1938. 5. Billy Strayhorn, originally hired as a lyricist in 1939, became a pivotal part of the Ellington organization and often stepped in for Duke in a variety of roles, including conducting, rehearsing the band, playing the piano, on stage or in recording sessions. 6. He ended the 1930s with successful European tours just before the start of World War II."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  Now, I have a new situation: Mark decides he want a cold drink and puts a bottle of warm water in his freezer. By doing this he makes the water colder and as water cools its density increases eventually freezing and becoming a solid, Ice. After a while mark forgets that he put the bottle of water in the freezer. He eventually remembers and comes back to check and the bottle of water is frozen solid. Because of this he leaves the bottle out on his kitchen counter for a few hours and returns to a nice cold bottle of water.

Summarize this article in one sentence. You'll need a large glass jar that can hold at least a quart (4 cups). The jar should have a sealable lid since you'll be storing the brandy in it and shaking it frequently. Place 2 cups (44g) of blackberries into your clean jar and smash them a little with the end of a wooden spoon to release some juice. If you like your blackberry brandy to be a little tart, add 1/2\\" piece of lime zest to the jar. Buy an unflavored vodka and brandy. Any quality brandy will work when making homemade blackberry brandy, especially if you let the blackberries infuse the alcohol for several months. Pour 3/4 cup (177 ml) of brandy and 1 1/4 (355 ml) cup of vodka into your jar with the muddled blackberries. For a stronger brandy flavor, you can replace the vodka with more brandy or even whisky, rum, or gin. Seal the jar with your berries, vodka, and brandy. Shake the mixture and let it sit for 3 days. Avoid refrigerating it and keep it out of direct sunlight. After 3 days, pour the brandy mixture through a strainer lined with cheesecloth. This will catch any blackberry solids. You can throw away the blackberry solids since they'll mainly be seeds. Mix 1 cup (235 ml) of water with 1 cup (200g) of granulated sugar in a small saucepan. Cook it over medium heat until the sugar dissolves. Refrigerate the syrup until it's cool. Add all of the cold simple syrup to your strained blackberry brandy. If you want to make extra simple syrup to further sweeten the brandy or to use in other drinks, you can double the water and sugar. Refrigerate your extra simple syrup for up to 5 days. Shake the jar so that the simple syrup and blackberry brandy completely mix. Let it rest for at least 1 day after you add the syrup. You can then serve the blackberry brandy or mix it into a cocktail. Refrigerate your blackberry brandy for up to 2 months.","output":"This article describes the process of making homemade blackberry brandy by infusing blackberries with vodka and brandy, adding simple syrup, and letting it rest before enjoying it in cocktails or on its own."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He did not have a rich family. He was not born with a silver spoon in his mouth. Instead,my friend was always hard up for cash. He did not have much money. And the money he did earn was chicken feed -- very little. Sometimes Al even had to accept handouts,gifts from his family and friends. But do not get me wrong. My friend was not a deadbeat. He was not the kind of person who never paid the money he owed. He simply _ pennies. He was always very careful with the money he spent. In fact,he was often a cheapskate. He did not like to spend money. The worst times were when he was flat broke and had no money at all. One day,Al scraped together a few dollars for a lottery ticket. He thought he would never strike it rich or gain lots of money unexpectedly. But his combination of numbers was chosen and he won the lottery. He hit the jackpot. He won a great deal of money. Al was so excited. The first thing he did was buy a costly new ear. He splurged on the one thing that he normally would not buy. Then he started spending money on unnecessary things. He started to waste it. It was like he had money to burn. He had more money than he needed and it was burning a hole in his pocket so he spent it quickly. When we got together for a meal at a restaurant,Al paid every time. He would always foot the bill,and pick up the tab. He told me the money made him feel like a million dollars. He was very happy. But,Al spent too much money. Soon my friend was down and out again. He had no money left. He was back to being strapped for cash. He had spent his bottom dollar, his very last amount. He did not even build up a nest egg. He had not saved any of the money. I admit I do feel sorry for my friend. He had enough money to live like a king. Instead,he is back to living on a shoestring--a very low budget. Some might say he is penny wise and pound foolish. He is wise about small things,but not about important things. Why did A1 live a poor life again after he won the lottery? A) Because he lost a lot of money he had won. B) Because he spent much money freely on unnecessary things.

Rutherford centralized organizational control of the Watch Tower Society. In 1919, he instituted the appointment of a director in each congregation, and a year later all members were instructed to report their weekly preaching activity to the Brooklyn headquarters. At an international convention held at Cedar Point, Ohio, in September 1922, a new emphasis was made on house-to-house preaching. Significant changes in doctrine and administration were regularly introduced during Rutherford's twenty-five years as president, including the 1920 announcement that the Jewish patriarchs (such as Abraham and Isaac) would be resurrected in 1925, marking the beginning of Christ's thousand-year Kingdom. Disappointed by the changes, tens of thousands of defections occurred during the first half of Rutherford's tenure, leading to the formation of several Bible Student organizations independent of the Watch Tower Society, most of which still exist. By mid-1919, as many as one in seven of Russell-era Bible Students had ceased their association with the Society, and as many as two-thirds by the end of the 1920s.

A:","output":"Gérard Filion was born on August 18, 1909, in L'Isle-Verte, a small rural town on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River in the province of Quebec, Canada. Raised in a French-speaking community, Filion was deeply rooted in an environment that cultivated both intellectual and cultural growth while treasuring the values of hard work. This upbringing shaped Filion into a self-reliant individual with strong entrepreneurial spirit, a passion for journalism, and an unwavering commitment to community development. Gérard Filion's career took off when he entered the world of international business. His first foray into business began in the agricultural sector, where he developed an in-depth understanding of the many challenges faced by farmers and the importance of advocating for their rights and needs. This early experience equipped Filion with essential business acumen, a keen interest in social justice, and an unyielding dedication to strengthening the economic and social well-being of rural communities. As Filion's business ventures expanded, he began to explore another passion – journalism. With a keen sense of observation and the ability to eloquently articulate complex information, Filion found journalism to be a natural space where he could voice the concerns of his fellow compatriots, share ideas, and stimulate public debate on key socioeconomic issues. One of his most notable career achievements was the founding of the French-language Canadian daily newspaper, \\"Le Devoir\\". Under Filion's leadership as its director, \\"Le Devoir\\" became one of the most influential newspapers in Quebec. It gave voice to the province's rapidly growing and diversifying population, who clamored for increased self-determination and cultural identity. Under Filion's guidance, \\"Le Devoir\\" shed light on critical issues, such as rural prosperity, economic development, education, and healthcare, which were often overlooked elsewhere. Filion was also deeply committed to improving the lives of those he served throughout his career. He was known for his empathetic and genuine concern for the well-being of his fellow citizens. He went beyond his journalistic duties and used his influence to advance important social causes, reflecting his belief in the importance of community involvement and social responsibility. On a personal level, Gérard Filion was married to Françoise Servêtre, with whom he shared his life and engaged in a partnership built on mutual respect, support, and shared values. Their union undoubtedly strengthened their commitment to the pursuit of social justice and the improvement of the lives of the people they served. Gérard Filion passed away on March 26, 2005, leaving an enduring legacy rooted in perseverance, ingenuity, and compassion. As a pioneering businessman and journalist, Filion inspired future generations to step up, seize opportunities, and serve as advocates for change in their communities. Today, his life's work and contributions continue to be remembered and celebrated in Quebec and beyond."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given two phrases: Head and Tail, separated with <sep>.

Read this and answer the question In response to the criticism of the Kinsey scale only measuring two dimensions of sexual orientation, Fritz Klein developed the Klein sexual orientation grid (KSOG), a multidimensional scale for describing sexual orientation. Introduced in Klein's book The Bisexual Option, the KSOG uses a 7-point scale to assess seven different dimensions of sexuality at three different points in an individual's life: past (from early adolescence up to one year ago), present (within the last 12 months), and ideal (what would you choose if it were completely your choice).

How to make a Denver Omelet at home.","output":"Making a Denver Omelet at home is a delicious and satisfying meal that can be enjoyed for breakfast, lunch, or dinner. A Denver Omelet, also known as a Western Omelet, typically consists of diced ham, onions, green bell peppers, and cheese, all cooked together with beaten eggs. The following is a step-by-step guide to help you create a fantastic Denver Omelet: Ingredients: - 4 large eggs - 1/3 cup diced ham - 1/4 cup diced green bell pepper - 1/4 cup diced onion - 1/2 cup shredded cheese (cheddar, Monterey Jack, or Swiss, or a combination) - 2 tablespoons milk or cream (optional, for fluffier eggs) - Salt and pepper to taste - 1-2 tablespoons butter or oil - Optional: hot sauce or salsa, for serving Instructions: 1. Prepare ingredients: Dice the ham, bell pepper, and onion into small pieces. Shred the cheese if it's not already shredded. 2. Beat the eggs: In a medium-sized mixing bowl, crack the eggs and beat them until the yolks and whites are well combined. If you'd like a fluffier omelet, add 2 tablespoons of milk or cream and whisk until fully incorporated. Season the eggs with salt and pepper to taste. 3. Cook the vegetables: Heat 1 tablespoon of butter or oil in a non-stick or cast iron skillet over medium heat. Once the butter has melted or the oil is hot and shimmering, add the diced onions and green bell peppers. Cook for 2-3 minutes, or until the onions are translucent and the peppers are slightly softened. 4. Cook the ham: Add the diced ham to the skillet and cook for an additional 2-3 minutes, or until the ham is heated through and beginning to brown. 5. Add the eggs: Pour the beaten eggs into the skillet, ensuring that they evenly cover the vegetables and ham. You may need to gently tilt the pan or use a spatula to spread the eggs evenly. 6. Add the cheese: Sprinkle the shredded cheese evenly over the egg mixture. As the eggs cook, use a spatula to lift the edges and allow any uncooked egg to flow beneath, so it's cooked evenly. Cook for about 4-5 minutes, or until the eggs are almost set but still slightly soft on top. 7. Fold the omelet: Using a spatula, carefully fold one side of the omelet over the other half, creating a half-moon shape. 8. Finish and serve: Let the omelet cook for another 1-2 minutes to allow the cheese to melt and the eggs to fully set. Carefully slide the omelet onto a plate, and serve immediately. If desired, top with hot sauce or salsa for an extra kick of flavor. With this recipe, you can easily create a mouth-watering Denver Omelet in the comfort of your own home. Feel free to get creative and add additional ingredients or substitute other types of vegetables, meats, or cheeses to customize your omelet to your preferences.

A long time ago, people made strong, thick strings called ropes in a place called Bold St. These ropes were very important because they helped in tying and lifting heavy things, like in big boats and buildings.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How does the sentence end? Nick thought role playing games were fun but Justin preferred shooter games.  Choose from: [A]. Nick bought a Final Fantasy game.; [B]. Justin bought a Final Fantasy game.;","output":"Although both options mention the purchase of a Final Fantasy game, which is a role-playing game, each option involves a different character making the purchase. To provide context and make a well-informed decision about how this sentence should end, let's analyze both Nick and Justin's preferences. Nick enjoys role-playing games, which means he appreciates the story-driven nature and immersive world of these games. He probably values character development and strategic gameplay mechanics that often come with role-playing games. Final Fantasy is a popular role-playing video game series, so it makes sense that Nick might have an interest in purchasing a game from this franchise. On the other hand, Justin prefers shooter games. These games typically focus on reflexes, hand-eye coordination, and fast-paced action. They generally prioritize combat and gunplay over deep narrative experiences. While it's possible that Justin may want to try a role-playing game like Final Fantasy, it's not consistent with his stated preference for shooter games. Based on this analysis, the most fitting conclusion to the sentence would be: Nick thought role playing games were fun, but Justin preferred shooter games. [A]. Nick bought a Final Fantasy game. This choice is consistent with the preferences and interests of each character. While it is not impossible for someone to enjoy multiple genres, the information provided in the sentence points towards Nick being the one more likely to purchase a role-playing game like Final Fantasy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You may have an underlying disease that’s causing your hair loss, and this may require treatment for you to regrow your hair. Your doctor may order blood tests to assess hormone levels that can cause hair loss. Minoxidil is an over the counter liquid or foam that you massage into your scalp twice daily. This medication may help promote hair growth or decrease hair loss, or even both.  Men and women can use minoxidil and you don’t need a prescription.  Regrowth peaks at about 16 weeks. You need to continuously reapply minoxidil to maintain the benefits.  You may experience some side effects such as scalp irritation, rapid heart rate, and may even have some hair growth on the face and hands.  You can purchase minoxidil at most pharmacies and some grocery stores. If medications and home treatments don’t help hair regrowth, have hair transplant or restoration surgery. This can immediately help fill out thinning hair and can stimulate hair regrowth.  Hair transplants or restoration are procedures in which you doctor takes small plugs of hair from different parts of your scalp and implants them into thinner or bald sections.  You may need to take hair loss medication before surgery.  Hair transplants can be very painful and cause infection and scarring.  Be aware that hair transplants and restoration are expensive and insurance may not cover either procedure. Some studies have shown that lower-level laser device treatment can help decrease hair loss and improve thickness. Although more research is necessary, laser treatment may be a good option for you if medications don’t work and you don’t want to undergo a painful hair transplant. There are no known side effects of laser therapy for hair loss.","output":"If you are losing hair, you should visit a doctor to find the reason. Sometimes, it's because of a sickness and you need to get better to grow your hair back. There is a special lotion called minoxidil that you can rub on your head to help your hair grow or stop falling out. Both boys and girls can use it without asking the doctor, but it may cause some problems like an itchy head or faster heartbeat. If that doesn't work, there are special surgeries, like hair transplant, where a doctor moves hair from one part of your head to another. But this can hurt a lot and costs a lot of money. Another option is using a gentle laser light that might help your hair grow thicker but needs more research to be sure. The good thing is, laser treatment doesn't have bad side effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Because of this, Miss Collins asks the school principal to excuse Carrie from gym class for a week because of the trauma.

Let's analyze these issues before generating a correct version of the sentence. 1. Syntactic Issues: The sentence seems to be a blend of two distinct clauses, which should be separated for better clarity. Additionally, there is a comma between \\"be\\" and \\"better\\" that breaks the flow of the sentence and doesn't serve a clear function. 2. Semantic Issues: The concepts behind the sentence may be understood, but the sentence lacks clarity in its current form. This becomes problematic as the reader has to deduce the intended meaning through context and inference.  Considering these issues, we can propose a revised version of the sentence that is both syntactically and semantically acceptable: \\"The more we pretended to be content and well-fed, the angrier we grew at the doctors.\\" In this revised sentence, the structure has been separated into two distinct clauses, where each clause has a clear meaning. The first clause indicates that the act of pretending to be content and well-fed is directly proportional to the subsequent effect – becoming angrier at the doctors.

And while nearly five dozen Democratic members of Congress took to the chamber's floor to cast their votes in favor of mulling impeaching Trump, more than twice as many Democrats opted to cast their ballots against the proposal.

The main similarity between the two sentences is that they both focus on a skier and a specific activity being performed. However, the actual activities being described are rather different in their content and context, which distinguishes the meaning between the two sentences. In the first sentence, \\"A skier wearing blue snow pants is flying through the air near a jump,\\" the primary focus is on the skier's actions of being in motion and flying through the air. This scene can be perceived as an action-packed moment in skiing, likely in the context of a ski event or an adventurous skiing activity. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"A skier stands on his hands in the snow in front of a movie camera,\\" describes a different type of activity. Here, the skier is performing a handstand on the snow, possibly for a movie or a film shoot. This context might suggest that the skier is involved in a more controlled environment, as opposed to actively skiing on the slopes. The presence of the movie camera also provides an additional element that is completely unrelated to the first sentence.

Let me address each question individually. Question 1:  To properly install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) for C language programming and ensure accurate output results, follow these steps: 1. Download and Install Visual Studio Code: Download the latest version of VS Code from the official website (https://code.visualstudio.com/) and install it following the standard installation procedures for your operating system. 2. Download and Install a C/C++ Compiler: As you are learning C language, you'll need a C compiler like GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your machine. For Windows, you can use the MinGW distribution (https://mingw-w64.org/) of GCC. For macOS, you can obtain the compiler from Xcode Command Line Tools. For Linux distributions, GCC should already be preinstalled, or you can install it using your package manager. 3. Install the C/C++ extension: Inside VS Code, click on the Extensions tab (or use the shortcut 'Ctrl+Shift+X'). Search for 'C/C++' by Microsoft and install the first one that appears. This extension allows proper syntax highlighting, debugging, and support for C programming language in VS Code. 4. Set up tasks.json: In your project folder, create a file named \\"tasks.json\\" in the \\".vscode\\" folder. This file tells VS Code how to compile and build your C programs.

Ask a question about Insect.","output":"Sure, here is an in-depth question on the topic of insects: What are the distinguishing characteristics of Insecta, their roles in the ecosystem, the diverse types of insects present worldwide, their unique reproductive and metamorphosis processes, their adaptations to survive in various environments, and the impacts, both positive and negative, on human life and the overall biodiversity? This question invites a discussion on several different facets of insects. Here's a brief overview: 1. **Distinguishing Characteristics of Insecta**: This could cover the physical and functional properties that differentiate insects from other species in the animal kingdom. For instance, insects generally have three pairs of legs, a body segmented into three parts (head, thorax, abdomen), compound eyes, antennae, and often one or two pairs of wings. 2. **Roles in the Ecosystem**: This could delve into how insects contribute to various ecological systems. For instance, insects are beneficial as pollinators in the reproduction of many plants, serve as a food source for other animals, and play significant roles in soil aeration and nutrient cycling.  3. **Diverse Types of Insects**: This could cover the classification of different types of insects like beetles, butterflies, bees, ants, flies, etc., and their notable species worldwide, along with their specific attributes. 4. **Reproductive and Metamorphosis Processes**: This part could discuss the various reproductive methods adopted by insects, from egg-laying to live births in some species. The unique transformation process insects like butterflies or beetles go through, from eggs to larvae/caterpillars to adulthood, commonly known as metamorphosis, could also be discussed. 5. **Survival Adaptations of Insects**: This could discuss various adaptations insects manifest to survive and thrive in their respective environments. For example, certain insects may develop camouflage abilities to blend in, some could evolve mechanisms to tolerate extreme temperatures, and others might develop sophisticated social structures like in the case of ants, bees, and termites. 6. **Impacts on Human Life and Biodiversity**: This would include discussing how insects could be both harmful and beneficial to humans. On the one hand, some insects spread diseases, cause crop loss, or become residential pests, while on the other hand, they are important in pollination, keeping pest populations in check, producing honey, silk, etc.  Overall, this question should lead to a comprehensive exploration of Insecta, providing a holistic understanding of these fascinating creatures."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Isaac Kolstad, a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, finally got a chance to return home after suffering a skull fracture and traumatic brain injury in a bar fight that happened last May near his school. His wife, Molly, shared the happy news on Kolstad's CaringBridge page. Scroll down for video. Back and doing better: Isaac Kolstad m(above in yellow at a September football game), a former linebacker at Minnesota State University, Mankato, emerged from rehab five months after he was attacked in a bar fight and suffered a traumatic brain injury. Baby girl: While he was in rehab his wife gave birth to a daughter, Malia (above with her father) Sportsman: Kolstad (pictured playing in a 2012 game) had to relearn how to walk. 'It is with a full heart that I update you all that today Isaac was discharged from inpatient care!' she wrote. 'After 5 months of being confined to a facility, of sleeping in a twin sized hospital bed, of reporting daily to nurses, doctors, therapists, and aides, Isaac is finally released and free to go home. He and his entire family are incredibly excited to take this huge step in Isaac’s recovery and start the process of transitioning back to family life.' Just this past September, Kolstad, 24, who graduated in 2013, made an emotional return to the playing field with some of his former teammates, walking out before kickoff during the opening game of ther season. He also became a father for the second time when his baby daughter Malia was born in June, less than a month after he was injured. Kolstand and his wife have another daughter, Haidyn. Rutgers University quarterback Philip Robert Nelson, who once played at the University of Minnesota, has been charged with one count of first-degree assault and one count of third-degree assault for the incident. Trevor Shelley, 21, who authorities believe punched Kolstad, was arrested just days after the attack and charged with felony assault counts. Kolstad, described by a friend as 'a quiet, young man' who was not a big drinker, was with a group of football players in the South Street Saloon just before closing time on the night of the fight. According to a criminal complaint, 20-year-old Nelson was angry that night because a bouncer at the bar had hit on his girlfriend.

Nelson and Kolstad got into a verbal dispute before Kolstad threw a punch that hit Nelson in the back, causing him to fall to the ground, according to a police officer, the complaint says. Graduate student Steph Stassen, 25, told the Star Tribune that the attacker came 'out of nowhere'. 'He [Kolstad] was knocked out on his feet,' she told the paper. 'He fell straight back and smoked his head on the pavement.' He was found at an intersection around 2am by police and taken to hospital in an ambulance. Kolstad suffered bleeding of the brain, skull fracture, brain swelling, brain shifting, and deterioration of lungs from lack of oxygen, according to the criminal complaint. He is now being treated at an inpatient rehabilitation program in the Twin Cities. There, he has bonded well with his new daughter, his wife Molly wrote.

Green was forced to issue an international charter to the auto workers in August 1935, although he assumed control of the union through appointing its president, Francis Dillon, a henchman. Say this using Spanish","output":"En agosto de 1935, Green se vio obligado a emitir una carta internacional a los trabajadores del automóvil, aunque asumió el control del sindicato al nombrar a su presidente, Francis Dillon, un hombre de confianza.  A continuación, se presentará una explicación detallada de este evento histórico en español. La Industria del automóvil experimentó un crecimiento acelerado en la década de 1930, atrayendo a un número creciente de trabajadores y generando una mayor demanda de representación laboral. En ese contexto, William Green, líder de la American Federation of Labor (AFL), se encontró bajo la presión de integrar a estos trabajadores en la federación y defender sus derechos e intereses. A lo largo del período previo a agosto de 1935, la industria automotriz fue testigo de un creciente descontento entre los trabajadores, quienes abogaban por mejoras en sus condiciones laborales, salarios y el reconocimiento de sus derechos. Esta situación llevó a la creación del United Automobile Workers (UAW), un sindicato especialmente diseñado para representar a los trabajadores en este sector en particular y abogar por sus intereses colectivos. La AFL, que representaba a múltiples sindicatos en diferentes sectores, tenía un enfoque más conservador en cuanto a la representación laboral y no estaba dispuesta a otorgar el tipo de autonomía que los trabajadores del automóvil buscaban en su sindicato. En este contexto, en agosto de 1935, Green se enfrentó a una situación en la que se vio obligado a emitir una carta internacional para el UAW y, al mismo tiempo, mantener su autoridad y control sobre la organización. Para lograr esto, Green decidió nombrar al presidente del UAW, seleccionando a Francis Dillon, quien era conocido por ser uno de sus hombres de confianza, leales a sus ideales y estrategias. Con Dillon en el cargo de liderazgo del sindicato, Green garantizó que el UAW se mantuviera bajo el control de la AFL y seguiría sus directrices, limitando su capacidad de lucha y negociación. De este modo, aunque Green accedió a otorgar la carta internacional, impuso restricciones al movimiento obrero automotriz y su autonomía. Este control ayudaría a mantener el predominio de la AFL en la representación laboral en los Estados Unidos durante algún tiempo. Este hecho, sin embargo, contribuyó a la creciente insatisfacción entre los trabajadores y, en última instancia, sentaría las bases para un impulso renovado a la independencia y la búsqueda de una mejor representación, lo cual culminaría en el desarrollo del Congreso de Organizaciones Industriales (CIO) en 1938, que se convertiría en otra entidad influyente en la defensa de los derechos de los trabajadores."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The locals warn the group that removing the tablet will end its magic. In present-day New York City, Larry Daley remains the night guard of the American Museum of Natural History. He, Theodore Roosevelt, Sacagawea, Attila the Hun, Jedediah, Octavius, Rexy the Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton and Dexter the capuchin monkey help re-open the Hayden Planetarium. A new wax Neanderthal resembling Larry named Laaa is introduced, identifying Larry as his father. Ahkmenrah shows Larry that the tablet is corroding, which later causes the exhibits to act erratically, causing mayhem at the planetarium's reopening. Afterwards, Larry catches his son Nick, who plans on taking a gap year to sort out his life, throwing a house party. Larry reunites with Cecil, now in retirement, who realizes the end of the tablet's magic will cause the exhibits to become lifeless. Cecil explains that Ahkmenrah's parents, Merenkahre and Shepseheret, may be able to restore the tablet's power but that they are located in the British Museum. Larry convinces the museum's curator, Dr. McPhee, to let him ship Ahkmenrah to London to restore the tablet, convinced that McPhee knows its secrets. Larry and Nick travel to the British Museum, bypassing the night guard Tilly.

Texas A&M began claiming the 1919 national championship in 2012. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Texas A&M began claiming the 1919 national championship after 2010\\"?","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, we can indeed conclude that Texas A&M began claiming the 1919 national championship after 2010. Specifically, the paragraph states that Texas A&M started boasting about their supposed national championship achievement in 2012 – that's two years after 2010, thus supporting the statement. To explain further, a declaration of claiming the 1919 national championship, particularly in 2012, essentially denotes that Texas A&M's standpoint regarding their status in that championship season only officially came to light 93 years after the season had taken place. This decision on their part naturally implies that for a long period, Texas A&M did not assert themselves as the champions of that particular season. However, it's critical to remember that in the case of the 1919 NCAA football season, there was no clear-cut national champion. The NCAA's official record book recognizes multiple teams - Centre, Harvard, Illinois, Notre Dame, and Texas A&M - as potential champions according to different major selectors. Of this group, only Harvard, Illinois, and Texas A&M have claimed national championships for the 1919 season. This demonstrates that claims regarding championships in historical seasons can be subject to revision or newly brought to light years, even decades, after the games were played. This long-delayed claim to the national championship by Texas A&M could be due to a variety of reasons, notably including reassessment of the season's play, re-evaluation of records, or even changes in the school's policy or ambition in asserting its historical performance in athletics. It must be remembered, however, that such claims, especially made long after the events, may sometimes be contentious and not universally accepted.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Paragraph: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which new planet has a cooler atmosphere? The answer is:","output":"Bothar. Given that Bothar does not have a species emitting large amounts of carbon dioxide into its atmosphere, unlike Norlon, it would not be experiencing the same level of greenhouse effect-caused warming as Norlon and therefore would have a cooler atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Tragedy of Lucretia is a tempera and oil painting on a wood \\"cassone\\" or \\"spalliera\\" panel by whch Italian Renaissance master, it is housed in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts, having been owned by Isabella Stewart Gardner in her lifetime? The answer is:","output":"The Tragedy of Lucretia is a tempera and oil painting on a wood \\"cassone\\" or \\"spalliera\\" panel by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli. Born as Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi in Florence, Italy, Botticelli was a prominent artist during the Italian Renaissance, and he is particularly known for his mythological and religious paintings. The Tragedy of Lucretia, completed around 1499-1500, depicts the story of Lucretia, a noblewoman from ancient Rome, whose rape by the son of the Etruscan king, Sextus Tarquinius, led to the uprising that overthrew the monarchy and established the Roman Republic. The painting captures the moment of Lucretia's suicide, showing her stabbing herself in the chest with a dagger while surrounded by various members of her family, who appear in a state of shock and despair. The artwork is housed in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum of Boston, Massachusetts. Isabella Stewart Gardner was an American philanthropist and art collector who purchased the painting during her lifetime. She was known for her extensive travels in Europe and assembling an impressive collection of Old Master paintings, which included works by Titian, Raphael, and Rembrandt. In 1903, she founded the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum as a way to share her extensive art collection with the public. The museum is designed in the style of a Venetian palace and reflects Gardner's passion for Italian art and architecture. The Tragedy of Lucretia is displayed in a way that allows visitors to appreciate the intricate details and rich colors used by Botticelli. The painting is an important example of Botticelli's late style, which is characterized by a greater emphasis on line and more abstract, elongated forms. Its presence in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum contributes to the significance of the collection and helps to showcase the extraordinary talent of Sandro Botticelli during the Italian Renaissance period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Bernard Kramer, from Florida, hid 1.1m from the IRS for around 25 years. He squirreled the money away in secret Swiss and Israeli accounts. He has been ordered to pay a 588,042 penalty and could face years in jail. Article:","output":"Title: Florida Man Hides Over 1 Million from IRS for 25 Years Subtitle: Bernard Kramer faces jail time and heavy penalties for tax evasion by utilizing secret accounts  Introduction: For many, tax evasion seems like a far-fetched crime reserved for the ultra-wealthy or those involved in organized crime. However, Bernard Kramer's case shows that it can happen closer to home.  Step 1: Introduce Bernard Kramer and tax evasion charges Bernard Kramer, a resident of Florida, managed to keep 1.1 million hidden from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for approximately 25 years. His elaborate plan to avoid paying taxes involved maintaining secret Swiss and Israeli bank accounts, where the money was safely concealed from the prying eyes of authorities. Step 2: Mention the consequences Bernard Kramer faces However, all good things must come to an end. Now that the truth has been unveiled, Kramer has been ordered by the court to pay a penalty of 588,042. In addition to the hefty financial hit, Kramer could face years in jail for his actions to evade taxes for such an extended period.  Step 3: Explain the broader implications of tax evasion  This case highlights the pressing issue of tax evasion in the United States and serves as a sharp reminder of the consequences that await those who intentionally mislead the IRS. Law enforcement agencies and federal authorities have frequently been involved in efforts to combat and prosecute tax evasion in recent years. Step 4: Discuss the impact on the general public Apart from the financial and legal repercussions, such cases also serve as a deterrent to others who may be considering similar tax evasion tactics. By taking appropriate legal action against tax evaders, the IRS sends a strong message to the public about the obligations and responsibilities of every citizen to pay their taxes in full and on time. Conclusion: Bernard Kramer's tax evasion case shines a light on the various tactics people employ in an attempt to evade taxes. It also serves as a sobering reminder of the severe consequences that come with such actions. The penalties and potential jail time send a clear message to anyone considering engaging in tax evasion that the risk is not worth the possible rewards. The story of Kramer's hidden millions is a cautionary tale for all, emphasizing the importance of diligently paying taxes and being transparent with authorities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: For example, avoid forwarding an email containing a secret, especially if the person you're e-mailing doesn't want you to. Doing so can possibly cause the recipient to lose trust in you, and you could possibly have your relationship messed up. You certainly do not want that to happen. If you feel tempted to do so, put yourself in the other person's shoes, and think about how you would feel if that person spread rumors about you. For example, if your friend has a reputation for being mean and bossy, think about how you would feel if your friend told your other friends about one of your quirks. You wouldn't be very happy, right? For example, avoid letting your friend know that her friend broke up with an ex-boyfriend. Email isn't completely private, so it's possible that the person whose business you're discussing could see the emails and become mad at you and/or embarrassed, and this could mess up your relationship with the person. Flames are basically insults sent online to offend you, so it's important not to send flames to other people or start flame wars. This could make the other person mad, and you could also have your account suspended for this. This can be anything, from a person's age to the name of the school that he or she goes to. Put yourself in the other person's shoes -- how would you feel if someone gave your friend the address of your house? You would not be very happy, so be sure to obtain permission before sharing someone's personal information with others over email, or don't do so at all. It will show you are angry and you can upset the person. For example, if you're angry at someone at work, and you email that person a large rant in all caps, this could cause the person that you emailed to become irritated. This is the same thing with replying to emails; if you're angry at someone for sending you a particular message, hold off replying until you have calmed down. Summary:","output":"Avoid forwarding sensitive information in emails, as this can damage trust and relationships. Consider how you would feel if someone spread rumors about you. Remember that email is not completely private. Don't engage in insulting behavior or share personal information without permission. If you're angry, wait until you're calm before responding to emails to prevent escalation and negative consequences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But these were not just the isolated actions of a scientist dragged into the world of politics. Einstein's life was, in fact, \\"divided between politics and equations .\\" Sickened by what he saw as the waste of human lives during the First World War, he became involved in antiwar demonstrations. His support of civil disobedience did little to endear him to his colleagues. Then, following the war, he directed his efforts toward reconciliation  and improving international relations. And soon his politics were making it difficult for him to visit the United States, even to give lectures. Einstein's second great cause was Zionism . Although he was Jewish, Einstein rejected the idea of God. However, a growing awareness of anti-Semitism , both before and during the War, led him gradually to identify with the Jewish community, and later to become an outspoken supporter of Zionism. His theories came under attack. One man was accused of motivating others to murder Einstein and fined a mere six dollars. When a book was published entitled 100 Authors Against Einstein, he retorted, \\"If I were wrong, then one would have been enough!\\" When Hitler came to power, Einstein then in America declared he would not return to Germany. While Nazi attacked his house and confiscated his bank account, a Berlin newspaper displayed the headline \\"Good News from Einstein--He's Not Coming Back.\\" Fearing that German scientists would build a nuclear bomb, Einstein proposed that the United States should develop its own.

Throughout his life, Einstein's efforts toward peace probably achieved little and won him few friends. His support of the Zionist cause, however, was recognized in 1952,...

The zinnia is a member of which flower family","output":"The zinnia is a member of the Asteraceae family, also commonly referred to as the Compositae family. This family of flowering plants is one of the largest in the plant kingdom, consisting of over 23,000 species, with more than 1,620 genera and 13 subfamilies. The Asteraceae family is distributed across the globe, with species native to many regions including America, Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. The most distinguishing characteristic of the Asteraceae family is the composite nature of its flowers. They are composed of numerous small individual flowers, or \\"florets,\\" that form a larger, single flower head called a capitulum. The capitulum is typically surrounded by a whorl of leaves, known as an involucre, which gives the appearance of petals. However, the true flowers are the florets themselves. There are generally two types of florets within a capitulum: the disk florets, which are in the center and usually tubular in shape, and the ray florets, which tend to be either petal-like or flattened around the edges of the cluster. This unique composition of the Asteraceae family allows for a great diversity of flower shapes, sizes, and colors, which is why it encompasses such a large array of genera and species. Some popular members of this family, besides the zinnia, include daisies, sunflowers, chrysanthemums, asters, and marigolds. Zinnias, belonging to the genus Zinnia, are native to Mexico and the American Southwest; however, they have been cultivated across the world due to their vibrant colors and dazzling displays. There are nearly 20 species of zinnia, and they come in various shapes, sizes, and colors, ranging from small, single-flower plants to large, bush-like varieties with a height of 40 inches or more. These annual plants have a relatively short growing season and prefer hot, dry conditions, making them a popular choice for gardens in many regions. Zinnias are also valued for their ability to attract pollinators, such as bees, butterflies, and hummingbirds. They are incredibly popular among gardeners because they are easy to grow and maintain, provided they receive plenty of sunlight and are kept in well-drained soil. In summary, the zinnia is a member of the Asteraceae or Compositae family, which is characterized by its unique flower structure, featuring numerous small florets forming a composite flower head. Known for their diversity in size, shape, and color, zinnias are a popular choice among gardeners worldwide, appreciated for their vibrant beauty and ease of maintenance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley?, using the article: From the time of his earliest recordings in the 1960s, Bowie employed a wide variety of musical styles. His early compositions and performances were strongly influenced by rock and rollers like Little Richard and Elvis Presley, and also the wider world of show business. He particularly strove to emulate the British musical theatre singer-songwriter and actor Anthony Newley, whose vocal style he frequently adopted, and made prominent use of for his 1967 debut release, David Bowie (to the disgust of Newley himself, who destroyed the copy he received from Bowie's publisher). Bowie's music hall fascination continued to surface sporadically alongside such diverse styles as hard rock and heavy metal, soul, psychedelic folk, and pop.Musicologist James Perone observes Bowie's use of octave switches for different repetitions of the same melody, exemplified in his commercial breakthrough single, \\"Space Oddity\\", and later in the song \\"Heroes\\", to dramatic effect; Perone notes that \\"in the lowest part of his vocal register ... his voice has an almost crooner-like richness.\\"Voice instructor Jo Thompson describes Bowie's vocal vibrato technique as \\"particularly deliberate and distinctive\\". Schinder and Schwartz call him \\"a vocalist of extraordinary technical ability, able to pitch his singing to particular effect.\\" Here, too, as in his stagecraft and songwriting, the singer's role playing is evident: historiographer Michael Campbell says that Bowie's lyrics \\"arrest our ear, without question. But Bowie continually shifts from person to person as he delivers them ... His voice changes dramatically from section to section.\\" In a 2014 analysis of 77 \\"top\\" artists' vocal ranges, Bowie was 8th, just behind Christina Aguilera and just ahead of Paul McCartney. In addition to the guitar, Bowie also played a variety of keyboards, including piano, Mellotron, Chamberlin, and synthesizers; harmonica; alto and baritone saxophones; stylophone; viola; cello; koto (in the Heroes track \\"Moss Garden\\"); thumb piano; drums (on the Heathen..., what would be the answer ?

Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. In 1683, the Holy League of Austria, Poland, Venice, and  Russia was formed to oppose the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman Empire suffered defeat at the Battle of Vienna in 1683 and was forced to withdraw rapidly from Central Europe. The defeat and the chaotic situation within the Ottoman Empire created widespread social disruption in the Central Balkans, particularly in the regions of Skopje and Niš, where Karposh's rebellion originated. On 25 October 1689, the Austrian branch of the Holy League, led by General Piccolomini, reached the Plain of Skopje and were met with rejoicing by the inhabitants of the villages there. The same day, Piccolomini began a withdrawal of his forces, and on October 26, set fire to the city. Skopje burned for two whole days, through the 26th and 27 October. Most of the city of Skopje was destroyed in the fire. Some accounts of these events state that Piccolomini razed Skopje due to an inability of his forces to occupy and govern a city so far from his headquarters, while other accounts state that it was perpetrated to prevent the spread of infectious disease. Answer this question: What happened first,  Piccolomini withdrew his forces or set fire to the city?","output":"According to the information provided, on October 25, 1689, General Piccolomini and the Austrian branch of the Holy League reached the Plain of Skopje and were met with rejoicing by the inhabitants.

By the time I woke up , ate breakfast / lunch , showered , and got ready it was 2 pm . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why does the narrator feel so rested ?","output":"The narrator feels so rested likely because they slept for an unusually long duration of 13 hours on Tuesday. Typically, adults need around 7-9 hours of sleep per night to function optimally. In this case, the narrator significantly exceeded the average sleep duration, allowing their body and mind to recover and rejuvenate more extensively.  There could be various reasons for this extended sleep, such as accumulated fatigue, the body's need for extra rest to recover from illness, or simply the individual's unique sleep pattern. The passage also implies that the narrator was surprised by the length of their sleep, indicating it was not a routine occurrence. This sudden increase in rest may allow the narrator to feel more refreshed and rejuvenated than they would if they had only slept the typical 7-9 hour duration. Moreover, the passage describes the events that transpired after waking up, such as having breakfast/lunch, showering, and getting ready. Such routines can also contribute to the narrator feeling rested, as engaging in these activities helps to signal the start of a new day, allowing the narrator to feel more prepared and energized. In summary, the narrator feels so rested because they had an unusually long and extended sleep, which allowed their body and mind to recover more than they would have during an average night's rest. Additionally, their morning routine and activities may have further contributed to this feeling of rejuvenation and preparedness for the day ahead."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You see, Kyle gets cold easily, so he likes to wear something called a sweatshirt. It's a warm and cozy piece of clothing that covers his arms and body, kinda like a big, soft hug. On the other hand, Aaron doesn't feel the cold as much as Kyle does. So, he chose to wear something called a tank top. A tank top is a shirt that doesn't have any sleeves, which means his arms are not covered. This allows Aaron to keep cooler in the sun. As the two friends walked down the street, they spotted an ice cream truck. This is a big, colorful vehicle that plays happy music and sells sweet, cold treats called ice cream. When you eat ice cream, it helps you cool down when it's hot outside - and it's tasty, too! Kyle and Aaron couldn't resist the yummy ice cream, so they lined up to buy some. Kyle chose a chocolate ice cream cone with lots of sprinkles on top. Chocolate is a rich, sweet flavor that many kids like. Sprinkles are tiny, colorful candies that make the ice cream look even more fun! Aaron picked a fruity popsicle, which is another type of frozen treat. It's made of fruit juice that's turned into a solid, cold bar on a stick. Aaron loves the sweet and tangy taste of the fruit-flavored popsicle. With their frozen treats in hand, Kyle and Aaron sat down on a bench under a big tree. The tree had wide, green leaves that made a cool shade for them to enjoy their ice cream and popsicle.

The imminent risk of conflict breaking out and disturbing the peace in the continent had become a deep-seated concern for many, especially for the leaders of Germany. As the crisis between Ukraine and Russia moved from a proxy war to an all-out conflict, Europe's stability was put into limbo. Countries watched, waiting for signs that would determine the fate of the continent. Germany, notably, was not just a passive observer. With Angela Merkel at the helm, it took the initiative to mediate the situation, and with good reason. Germany's economy is one of the largest in Europe and a war in the continent would bring tension and insecurity that could disrupt many of its engagements. Moreover, Germany's post-war identity is deeply tied to its commitment to peace in Europe. Any threat to this peace puts at risk more than just economic interests but the very values that modern Germany stands for. Many important decisions had to be made. Political, economic, and military strategies had to be laid out meticulously. In turn, as the country in the middle, Germany did not only mediate but also had the responsibility to mitigate any potential spillover effects of the escalating conflict. Talks in Berlin and Brussels took over the scenography. The centrality of Germany in these negotiations was key. Angela Merkel, armed with her patient yet firm negotiating style, became the voice of diplomacy in the crisis. She spoke, not only with world leaders but also with the citizens, reiterating the importance of peace and stability in Europe.  However, despite all these, war broke out. The fog of uncertainty had lifted, revealing a tense battlefield. Yet, even in the face of a full-blown conflict, the dedication towards peace negotiations continued.  The story culminates in an important meeting - a diplomatic summit arranged by Germany, attended by leaders from Europe as well as representatives from Russia and Ukraine. In this meeting, the grievances of each side were heard, interests were discussed, and solutions were proposed. The tension in the room was palpable, with everyone aware that the decisions made could alter the course of European future. After a grueling negotiation, an agreement was reached. Merkel's voice echoed through the room, sealing the deal that can possibly put an end to a war and setting forth a new framework for peace reinstatement in the region. Yet, even as this compromise marks an important step, everyone in the room knew that this only signals the beginning of a long and difficult journey towards peace. This, quite tentatively, marked the end of the story. No hero's win, no villain's defeat. Simply a commitment to a long path to peace. Yet, this doesn't negate the fact that significant progress has been made. Progress that took the most out of Germany and its allies, out of Merkel and her tenacity.  As the room settled, a wave of relief filled the room, bringing a sense of peace after weeks, months, of uncertainty. A peace won not on the battlefield, but in rooms filled with diplomats striving to keep, sustain, and carry forward the peace of Europe - the very thing they had a lot at stake for."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\".

McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes.

Article:","output":"Title: The Key to a Successful Job Interview: Preparation, Presentation, and Follow-up  Introduction Job interviews can be stressful and challenging scenarios that have the potential to define your professional future. The difference between having a successful job interview and struggling to make a positive impression often comes down to good preparation, effective presentation, and diligent follow-up. By considering these factors, candidates can substantially improve their chances of success and increase the probability of obtaining their desired position. In this article, we will discuss several vital aspects to keep in mind when preparing for and conducting an interview, as well as the importance of following up afterward. 1. Study the Company Beforehand One of the most effective ways to make a positive impression on your interviewer is to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of the company where you are seeking a job. Before the interview takes place, take some time to research the organization's history, mission, and values. Familiarize yourself with the company's products or services, target market, and competitive landscape. Make sure you know who the key players are within the organization, such as its founders, executives, and managers. By studying the company, you will show the interviewer that you have a genuine interest in the position and that you have taken the time to consider the organization's context and environment. 2. Research Commonly Asked Interview Questions While interview questions are often tailored to each specific job, there are a number of commonly asked questions that candidates should be prepared to answer. Some of these questions include: - What can you tell me about yourself? - Why do you want this job? - Where do you see yourself in five years? - Can you explain why you left your last job? In addition to these general questions, be prepared to discuss your strengths, weaknesses, and any job-specific skills or qualifications you may possess. The key to answering interview questions is to be concise, honest, and engaging. Think about how your answers will highlight your suitability for the role and consider examples from your professional or personal life that illustrate your capabilities. 3. Mind the Basics on Interview Day The day of your interview is just as important as the preparation you do ahead of time. First, make sure to dress appropriately for the company culture, whether that means choosing a formal suit or opting for more casual attire. Arrive at least 10-15 minutes early, as punctuality is crucial. Bring multiple copies of your resume, a notepad, and a pen to take notes during the interview. Finally, come prepared with a positive and motivated attitude to make the best impression possible. 4. Pay Attention to Body Language During the interview, it is essential to be conscious of your body language. Maintaining eye contact, avoiding slouching, and using confident body postures can make a significant difference in the way you are perceived by the interviewer. These gestures show that you are attentive, confident, and engaged in the conversation. Also, keep in mind the importance of active listening – give the interviewer the full attention that they deserve. 5. Follow the Tone of the Interviewer Each interview and interviewer will be unique and adopt a different tone. It is crucial to be adaptable in response to the interviewer's style, whether it is formal, casual, or somewhere in between. Be aware of the interviewer’s cues and adjust your responses accordingly. This will help create rapport and demonstrate your ability to work within a diverse range of professional settings. 6. Ask Questions to the Interviewer Many interviewers will provide the opportunity for candidates to ask questions at the end of the interview. Utilize this time to demonstrate your interest in the company and position by asking thoughtful and relevant questions. Examples of appropriate questions include: - What is the company culture like? - What kind of growth opportunities are available within the company? - Can you tell me more about the team I would be working with? 7. Follow Up After the Interview Finally, the interview process does not end when you leave the room. Within 24-48 hours, send a thank-you email to the interviewer, expressing your gratitude for the opportunity and reiterating your interest in the position. This gesture will leave a lasting positive impression and could make the difference in securing a job offer. Conclusion To sum up, the key components to a successful job interview are thorough preparation, effective presentation, and diligent follow-up. By studying the company, anticipating interview questions, adhering to interview day basics, and establishing rapport with the interviewer, you significantly increase your chances of making a positive impression and securing a job offer. Remember, showing genuine interest and enthusiasm goes a long way, and with the right mindset, you can truly stand out as the perfect candidate for the role."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Mac magic Review: This \\"album\\" was a real ear-opener back in the day...who ever thought the Brits knew anything about the blues? Their versions were the real music invasion into U.S. music turf if anybody were to ask me. Well, nobody's asking, but it's too bad our American blues founders didn't get the fame and fortune they deserved, eh? Is this product review negative? OPTIONS: (1). Yes. (2). No. Answer:","output":"The product review is not negative, but it highlights some interesting points.  To give a more detailed answer, we'll first break down the elements of the review and consider the context behind the statements made by the reviewer. The album referred to appears to be Fleetwood Mac's \\"Mac Magic,\\" which features a combination of British rock and American blues music. The reviewer acknowledges the appeal this album had back in the day; the use of the term \\"ear-opener\\" suggests that the reviewer found the music refreshing and novel. This can be considered a positive aspect of the review. However, it is important to notice that the reviewer's tone implies a slight surprise, as they mention that they didn't expect the Brits (British musicians) to know anything about the blues – a musical genre deeply rooted in the African American experience. The mention of the \\"real music invasion\\" implies that the blending of two distinct musical cultures resulted in a significant and noteworthy impact on the U.S. music scene. The latter part of the review expresses a hint of regret or criticism towards the way the original American blues founders did not get the fame and fortune they deserved. This sentiment, while not directed towards the album itself, sheds light on the historical context and the power imbalance in music appropriation. The reviewer doesn't seem to blame Fleetwood Mac for this issue, rather acknowledges the unfortunate circumstances surrounding it. Considering these aspects, the answer to the question would be: (2). No. The review doesn't have a negative stance towards the album itself; it offers praise and puts forward an important discussion about the recognition and appreciation of the original American blues musicians."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Read this: Measurement of light or photometry is generally concerned with the amount of useful light falling on a surface and the amount of light emerging from a lamp or other source, along with the colors that can be rendered by this light. The human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum, therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light. The basic SI unit of measurement is the candela (cd), which describes the luminous intensity, all other photometric units are derived from the candela. Luminance for instance is a measure of the density of luminous intensity in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through or is emitted from a particular area, and falls within a given solid angle. The SI unit for luminance is candela per square metre (cd/m2). The CGS unit of luminance is the stilb, which is equal to one candela per square centimetre or 10 kcd/m2. The amount of useful light emitted from a source or the luminous flux is measured in lumen (lm). What is the SI unit for lumiance? What is the answer?

Information:  - An electric guitar is a fretted string instrument that uses a pickup to convert the vibration of its stringswhich are typically made of steel, and which occurs when a guitarist strums, plucks or fingerpicks the stringsinto electrical signals. The vibrations of the strings are sensed by a pickup, of which the most common type is the magnetic pickup, which uses the principle of direct electromagnetic induction. The signal generated by an electric guitar is too weak to drive a loudspeaker, so it is plugged into a guitar amplifier before being sent to a loudspeaker, which makes a sound loud enough to hear. The output of an electric guitar is an electric signal, and the signal can easily be altered by electronic circuits to add \\"color\\" to the sound or change the sound. Often the signal is modified using effects such as reverb and distortion and \\"overdrive\\", with the latter being a key element of the sound of the electric guitar as it is used in blues and rock music.  - John Michael \\"Ozzy\\" Osbourne (born 3 December 1948) is an English singer, songwriter, and actor. He rose to prominence in the early 1970s as the lead vocalist of the heavy metal band Black Sabbath. He was fired from Black Sabbath in 1979 and went on to have a successful solo career, releasing 11 studio albums, the first seven of which were all awarded multi-platinum certifications in the US. Osbourne has since reunited with Black Sabbath on several occasions, recording the album \\"13\\" in 2013. His longevity and success have earned him the informal title of \\"Godfather of Heavy Metal\\".   - Ö, or ö, is a character that represents either a letter from several extended Latin alphabets, or the letter O modified with an umlaut mark or diaeresis. In many languages, the letter ö, or the O modified with what is known as an \\"umlaut mark\\", is used to denote the non-close front rounded vowels or . In languages without such vowels, the character is known as an \\"O with diaeresis\\" and denotes a syllable break, wherein its pronunciation remains an unmodified .  - Ian Fraser Kilmister (24 December 1945  28 December 2015), better known as Lemmy, was an English musician, singer, and songwriter who founded and fronted the rock band Motörhead.

It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Waysted is a rock band formed by the UFO bass guitarist Pete Way and the Scottish rocker Fin Muir (Ian More) in 1982. Recruiting Frank Noon (formerly with Def Leppard), Ronnie Kayfield and Paul Raymond, Waysted signed to Chrysalis Records and released \\"Vices\\" in 1983.  - Motörhead were an English rock band formed in June 1975 by bassist, singer, and songwriter Ian Fraser \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister, who was the sole constant member. The band is often considered a precursor to, or one of the earliest members of, the new wave of British heavy metal, which re-energised heavy metal in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Though several guitarists and drummers played in Motörhead, most of their best-selling albums and singles feature the work of \\"Fast\\" Eddie Clarke on lead guitar and Phil \\"Philthy Animal\\" Taylor on drums.  - Mechanix is the tenth studio album by the British hard rock band UFO ; it was released in 1982 .

Question: How did Lady Beldon disregard the judges' decision that her rose was the winner? Movie title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat to assist in the Dunkirk evacuation. Early one morning, Kay unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk. Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her... A:","output":"In the movie \\"Mrs. Miniver,\\" it was not actually Lady Beldon who disregards the judges' decision that her rose was the winner. Instead, she gracefully accepts the decision and is flattered by the recognition. However, after seeing the genuine joy and excitement in the face of another villager, Mr. Ballard, over his rose \\"The Mrs. Miniver\\" being entered into the competition, Lady Beldon decides to make a grand gesture. She intentionally withdraws her rose from winning the prize at the flower show so that Mr. Ballard's rose can be given the opportunity to win.

These preserved pieces of history come in various forms, such as bones, teeth, shells, imprints, or even entire organisms trapped in amber or tar. By analyzing these fossils, scientists can piece together a timeline of evolutionary history, tracing the development and diversification of life on Earth. There are multiple ways fossils serve as evidence for evolution, some of which include: 1. Morphological change: Studying the similarities and differences among the physical, anatomical, and morphological features of fossil specimens can show how species have evolved over time. For example, the fossils of early horses reveal a gradual development from small, dog-sized creatures with multiple toes to larger, single-toed modern horses. This morphological change helps to demonstrate the evolutionary process. 2. Transitional fossils: These fossils show intermediary stages in the evolution of one species to another. They provide insight into how different organisms are related and how they evolved from common ancestors. For example, fossils of Tiktaalik, a fish-like creature with limb-like appendages, provide evidence of a link between fish and early tetrapods (four-legged vertebrates). 3. Ancestral and descendant relationships: By analyzing fossils and their geological context, scientists can determine the relative age of species and trace the ancestral and descendant relationships among them. This helps to build a \\"family tree\\" of life on Earth, showing how species evolved from common ancestors and diversified over time. 4. Biogeographical distribution: The geographical distribution of fossils can provide information about the movement of continents and how species migrated and evolved in response to changing environments. This distribution often aligns with the predictions of evolution, as closely related species are typically found in close geographical proximity to each other. 5. Comparisons with living organisms: Fossil evidence can be compared to living organisms to help determine how groups of species are related and how they evolved over time. For example, by comparing the structure of the limbs of whales, bats, and humans, we can see evidence of a common ancestor with a similar limb structure, supporting the idea of divergence through evolution. In conclusion, fossils are valuable evidence for evolution, as they offer snapshots into Earth's biological history and allow scientists to trace the development, adaptation, and diversification of species over time. By studying fossils, researchers can learn more about how life on Earth has changed and evolved, further strengthening the foundations of evolutionary theory."},{"instruction":"Question: what are some animals in a tigers environment?

The answer is:","output":"No, that would not be a reasonable answer to the question about animals in a tiger's environment. A more appropriate response would be: Some animals in a tiger's environment include deer (such as sambar, chital, and muntjac), wild boar, monkeys, langurs, buffalo, antelope, and various bird species. Tigers are dominant predators and share their habitat with other predators such as leopards, hyenas, and crocodiles.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person whose mother died in 1818? is inside the article: Bennett was born in Sheffield, Yorkshire, the third child and only son of Robert Bennett, the organist of Sheffield parish church, and his wife Elizabeth, née Donn. In addition to his duties as an organist, Robert Bennett was a conductor, composer and piano teacher; he named his son after his friend William Sterndale, some of whose poems the elder Bennett had set to music. His mother died in 1818, aged 27, and his father, after remarrying, died in 1819. Thus orphaned at the age of three, Bennett was brought up in Cambridge by his paternal grandfather, John Bennett, from whom he received his first musical education. John Bennett was a professional bass, who sang as a lay clerk in the choirs of King's, St John's and Trinity colleges. The young Bennett entered the choir of King's College Chapel in February 1824 where he remained for two years. In 1826, at the age of ten, he was accepted into the Royal Academy of Music (RAM), which had been founded in 1822. The examiners were so impressed by the child's talent that they waived all fees for his tuition and board.Bennett was a pupil at the RAM for the next ten years. At his grandfather's wish his principal instrumental studies were at first as a violinist, under Paolo Spagnoletti and later Antonio James Oury. He also studied the piano under W. H. Holmes, and after five years, with his grandfather's agreement, he took the piano as his principal study. He was a shy youth and was diffident about his skill in composition, which he studied under the principal of the RAM, William Crotch, and then under Cipriani Potter, who took over as principal in 1832. Amongst the friends Bennett made at the Academy was the future music critic J. W. Davison. Bennett did not study singing, but when the RAM mounted a student production of The Marriage of Figaro in 1830, Bennett, aged fourteen, was cast in the mezzo-soprano role of the page boy Cherubino (usually played by a woman en travesti). This was among the few failures of his career at the RAM. The Observer wryly commented, \\"of the..., can you guess it ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Bennett.

Identify the common elements:    - A person wearing a hat (large-brimmed hat vs. hat pulled down over eyes)    - A motor vehicle (green moped vs. motorbike) 2. Determine whether the common elements are consistent.    - The hat can be considered consistent since a large-brimmed hat can be pulled down over the eyes    - The motor vehicle is not consistent since a moped and motorbike are different types of vehicles 3.

Article: Children whose minds wander might have sharper brains, a research suggests. A study has found that people who appear to be often distracted   have more \\"working memory\\", giving them the ability to hold a lot of information in their heads and control it cleverly. Children at school need this type of memory on a daily basis for a variety of tasks, such as following teachers' instructions or remembering dictated   sentences. During the study, volunteers were asked to perform one simple task during which researchers kept asking if their minds were wandering. At the end, volunteers measured their working memory capacity   by their ability to remember a series of letters mixed with simple maths questions. Daniel Levinson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in the United States, said that those with higher working memory capacity reported \\"more mind wandering during these simple tasks\\", but their performance did not _ . The results, published online in the journal Psychological Science, appear to confirm former research that found working memory allows humans to deal with multiple thoughts at the same time. Dr Jonathan Smallwood, of the Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Science in Leipzig, Germany, said, \\"What this study seems to suggest is that, when surroundings for the task aren't very difficult, people with additional working memory capacity use them effectively to think about other things besides what they're doing.\\" Working memory capacity is also associated with general measures of intelligence, such as reading comprehension and IQ scores. Dr Smallwood added: \\"Our results suggest the sorts of planning that people do quite often in daily life - when they are on the bus, when they are cycling to work, when they are in the shower - are probably supported by working memory.\\" Question: What's the text mainly about?

Please answer the following question: President Donald Trump capped what has been a difficult week politically with an all-out push for tax reform Friday. In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.  Moore’s victory, aided by the active support of former Trump White House strategist Steve Bannon, signals what could be a series of divisive Republican primary battles heading into next... Why did Senate Republicans postpone voting on Obamacare replacement?  A. they had a threat to Congress if they replaced Obamacare  B. they thought it was a bad idea to try to replace Obamacare  C. not enough information  D. They didn't have enough votes to pass the measure A:","output":"D. They didn't have enough votes to pass the measure Senate Republicans decided to postpone the vote on the Obamacare replacement because they did not have enough votes to pass the measure. This was mainly due to a handful of Republican defectors who opposed the plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, which is former President Barack Obama's signature achievement. As the Republicans were not able to secure the necessary votes for the replacement bill, they faced opposition and had to delay the vote. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer stated that the reason the bill failed was because millions of Americans were against it. It's crucial for the Senate Republicans to gather the required votes for passing the measure, otherwise, their repeated attempts to repeal and replace Obamacare would continue to be unsuccessful."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: Marjorie Minna Jenkins Pratt, Countess of Brecknock DBE, JP (died 24 August 1989), was a British peeress. She was the daughter of Colonel Atherton Edward Jenkins and his wife, Anna Isabella (née Schoenbrunn), the niece of Sir Ernest Cassel. She was a cousin (and life-long close friend) of Edwina Ashley, who married Lord Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma. Hypothesis: Marjorie Minna Jenkins Pratt was born into wealth.","output":"The text doesn't explicitly state the socio-economic status at Marjorie Minna Jenkins Pratt's birth, but we can make reasonable inferences from the given information. Marjorie was a British peeress, a title often associated with upper class and wealth. Her father, Colonel Atherton Edward Jenkins, was a military officer, a profession typically associated with a certain social standing. Additionally, Marjorie's mother, Anna Isabella, was the niece of Sir Ernest Cassel, a significant detail as Sir Ernest Cassel was an influential private banker, financier and a millionaire philanthropist to whom royalty and powerful individuals turned for financial advice and support. Furthermore, Marjorie was a cousin and life-long friend of Edwina Ashley, who married Lord Louis Mountbatten, indicating connection to another wealthy and noble family. Based on the familial and social connections outlined in this paragraph, it is reasonable to infer that Marjorie was likely born into a family of wealth and high social standing. Her close ties to prominent figures in British society help further support this inference. However, it's important to recognize that these connections and titles don't guarantee wealth at the time of Marjorie's birth. Wealth can be lost, or her family might not have shared their affluence directly with Marjorie. It would still be necessary for further historical research or direct evidence about the financial state of Marjorie's immediate family at the time of her birth to confirm the hypothesis beyond doubt.

This equation represents a circle with center C_1(-1,0) and radius r_1=sqrt{2}. 4. Since the distance from C to C_1 is equal to the radius r, circle C always passes through the fixed point (-1,0).

Therefore, (a_1) and (a_1 + 1) are both good numbers. 3. **Induction Hypothesis:**    Assume that for some (n = k), (a_k) and (a_k + 1) are good numbers. This means:    - The factorization of (a_k) contains every prime factor with at least the power of 2.    - The factorization of (a_k + 1) contains every prime factor with at least the power of 2. 4. **Inductive Step:**    We need to show that (a_{k+1}) and (a_{k+1} + 1) are good numbers.    - By the definition of the sequence:      [      a_{k+1} = 4a_k(a_k + 1).      ]      Since (a_k) and (a_k + 1) are both good numbers, their product (a_k(a_k + 1)) is also a good number because the product of two numbers with each prime factor having at least the power of 2 also has each prime factor with at least the power of 2.      - Additionally, multiplying by 4 (i.e., (2^2)) does not change this property as it introduces only a power of 2 which is also at least 2.    - Now consider (a_{k+1} + 1):      [      a_{k+1} + 1 = 4a_k(a_k + 1) + 1.      ]      - Observe that (a_k), being a product of good numbers and multiplied by 4, keeps the primes with at least power of 2.      - Considering (a_{k+1} + 1):        [        a_{k+1} + 1 = (2a_k + 1)^2,        ]        which is a square of (2a_k + 1). As a square, it automatically makes each prime in the factorization of (2a_k + 1) to be raised at least to the second power.

Odd counts can still be achieved by configurations and don't automatically signify an impossibility in this context. - **Impossible Configurations**: Previous analysis showed 2 intersections are impossible for 4 lines, but this doesn't necessarily rule them out in the case of 5 lines, as more combinations are available. An explicit proof or disproof similar to the one provided for 4 lines would need to be calculated. For simplicity, we consider the problem in feasible range without explicit proof of impossibility. Adding possible values, the sum is: [ sum_{k=0}^{10} k = frac{10 times 11}{2} = 55 ] Thus, the sum of all possible values of M is 55. Conclusion: Given the computational and hypothesis considerations, the problem setup and solution are consistent, and there are no contradictions in the hypothesis used. boxed{The correct answer is **C) 55.**}"},{"instruction":"The base edge length of a regular square pyramid is 4, and the slant height is 3.

Prove that there are two clubs that intersect in exactly one student.","output":"Consider a more generalized problem: let there be ( k ) students participating in ( n ) clubs, where each club consists of three students, and ( k leq n ). We aim to show that there exist at least two clubs that intersect in exactly one student. 1. **Assumption of the Contrary**: Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that every pair of clubs either do not intersect at all or intersect in exactly two students.    2. **Observation on Club Intersections**:     - Let ( K ), ( L ), and ( M ) be clubs. If ( K ) and ( L ) intersect with ( M ), then ( K ) and ( L ) must intersect with each other because their intersections with ( M ) must share a common element. This means that clubs form groups of intersecting clubs where each pair within a group of clubs intersects with exactly two students. 3. **Defining Groups of Clubs**: Each group of intersecting clubs can be associated with a group of students combining the sets of their members. 4. **Key Observation**: Since the number of clubs ( n ) is greater than or equal to the number of students ( k ), in at least one group, the number of clubs exceeds the number of students in that group. Let's analyze such a group of clubs and students. 5. **Analyzing Pairs**: Assign each pair of clubs in the group a pair of students, where each student attends exactly one of these two clubs.     - There are more pairs of clubs than pairs of students.     - Therefore, there exists at least one pair of students which corresponds to at least two pairs of clubs. Let these be students ( {a, b} ) and pairs of clubs ( {a, c, d} ) and ( {b, c, d} ) or ( {a, u, v} ) and ( {b, u, v} ). 6. **Contradiction**:      - Consider clubs ( {a, c, d} ) and ( {b, u, v} ). These cannot share exactly two students between them since the pairs ( {c, d} ) and ( {u, v} ) do not match. This yields a contradiction as per our initial assumption about clubs intersection properties. 7. **Concluding Intersection Properties**:     - Suppose each club within a group contains at least one of the specified pairs ( {a, b} ). The number of clubs in this group will be fewer than the number of students comprising those clubs. 8. **Final Argument**: Therefore, the assumption that each pair of clubs either do not intersect at all or intersect in exactly two students is invalid, leading to the conclusion that there must be at least two clubs which intersect in exactly one student. Thus, we have proven that given 32 students and 33 clubs, each consisting of three students, some pair of clubs must intersect in exactly one student. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Bill put his french fries in the oven after it finished heating.

The time it takes for the second train to catch up to the first train is the same amount of time the first train has been traveling since 10 am.

Find all positive integers  k  for which the following assertion is true: if  a,b  are real numbers such that the closed interval  [a,b]  contains infinitely many  2020 good numbers, then the interval   [a,b]  contains at least one  k good number. (Josef Tkadlec, Czech Republic)","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We need to find all positive integers ( k ) such that if the interval ([a, b]) contains infinitely many 2020-good numbers, then it must also contain at least one ( k )-good number. A number ( x ) is ( n )-good if it can be expressed as the sum of the reciprocals of ( n ) positive integers. 2. **Properties of ( n )-good Numbers:**    - Any ( n )-good number is also an ((n+1))-good number. This is because if ( x = frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n} ), then ( x ) can also be written as ( x = frac{1}{a_1} + frac{1}{a_2} + cdots + frac{1}{a_n} + frac{1}{infty} ).    - The maximum value of an ( n )-good number is ( n ), which occurs when all ( a_i = 1 ). 3. **Analyzing the Interval ([a, b]):**    - If ([a, b]) contains infinitely many 2020-good numbers, then there must be a sequence of 2020-good numbers within this interval.    - Consider the sequence ( x_n = 2019 + frac{1}{n} ). Each ( x_n ) is a 2020-good number because ( x_n = 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 + frac{1}{n} ) (with 2019 ones and one (frac{1}{n})). 4. **Bounding ( k ):**    - For ( k leq 2018 ), the maximum ( k )-good number is ( k ), which is less than 2019. Therefore, it is impossible for the interval ([a, b]) to contain a ( k )-good number if ( a geq 2019 ).    - For ( k = 2019 ), consider the sequence ( x_n = 2018 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{n} ). Each ( x_n ) is a 2020-good number because ( x_n = 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 + frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{n} ) (with 2018 ones, one (frac{1}{2}), and one (frac{1}{n})). This sequence converges to 2019 as ( n to infty ), so the interval ([a, b]) must contain 2019. 5. **Conclusion:**    - If ( k geq 2019 ), then the interval ([a, b]) containing infinitely many 2020-good numbers must also contain at least one ( k )-good number. This is because we can always find a sequence of 2020-good numbers converging to any ( k )-good number for ( k geq 2019).

Therefore, the cost price of each T-shirt in the second batch would be (x - 5) yuan, considering the given condition that each T-shirt in the second batch costs 5 yuan less than those in the first batch. Given that the quantity of the second batch is 1.5 times that of the first batch, and the total cost for the second batch is 5400 yuan, we can set up the following equation based on the ratio of the quantities and the total costs: [ frac{5400}{x - 5} = 1.5 times frac{4000}{x} ] Solving this equation for x, we proceed as follows: [ 5400x = 1.5 times 4000 times (x - 5) ] [ 5400x = 6000x - 30000 ] Bringing all terms to one side: [ 6000x - 5400x = 30000 ] [ 600x = 30000 ] [ x = 50 ] After verifying, we find that x = 50 satisfies the given conditions.

We analyze each of these cases: 1. **( n = overline{abcd} )**:    The number ( n ) can be expressed as:    [    n = 1000a + 100b + 10c + d    ]     2. **( x = overline{a0bcd} )**:    The number ( x ) can be expressed as:    [    x = 10000a + 100b + 10c + d    ] 3. **( y = overline{ab0cd} )**:    The number ( y ) can be expressed as:    [    y = 10000a + 1000b + 10c + d    ]     4. **( z = overline{abc0d} )**:    The number ( z ) can be expressed as:    [    z = 10000a + 1000b + 100c + d    ] 5. **( w = overline{abcd0} )**:    The number ( w ) can be expressed as:    [    w = 10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d    ] Now, we proceed to consider each pair's difference sequentially: # Case 1: ( x - n ) [ x - n = (10000a + 100b + 10c + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 9000a ] We need ( 9000a ) to be a multiple of 7. Since 9000 is not a multiple of 7, ( a ) must be a multiple of 7. Given ( a ) is a single digit and non-zero ((1 leq a leq 9)), the only possible value is: [ a = 7 ] # Case 2: ( y - n ) [ y - n = (10000a + 1000b + 10c + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 9000a + 900b ] Since ( a = 7 ), we substitute: [ 9000a + 900b = 9000 cdot 7 + 900b = 63000 + 900b ] This needs to be a multiple of 7. Since 900 is not a multiple of 7, ( b ) must be a multiple of 7. Similarly, ( b ) can only be ( 0 ) or ( 7 ). # Case 3: ( z - n ) [ z - n = (10000a + 1000b + 100c + d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 9000a + 900b + 90c ] Given ( a = 7 ) and ( b = 0 ) or ( 7 ), we need to ensure: [ 9000 cdot 7 + 900 cdot b + 90c = 63000 + 900b + 90c  ] Since 90 is not a multiple of 7, ( c ) must again be ( 0 ) or ( 7 ). # Case 4: ( w - n ) [ w - n = (10000a + 1000b + 100c + 10d) - (1000a + 100b + 10c + d) = 9000a + 900b + 90c + 9d ] Similarly,  [ 9000 cdot 7 + 900 cdot b + 90 cdot c + 9d = 63000 + 900b + 90c + 9d ] Since ( 9 ) is not a multiple of 7, ( d ) must be ( 0 ) or ( 7 ). # Conclusion: Deductively, each digit ( b, c, d ) needs to be either 0 or 7.

The negation of a universal statement is an existential statement. This means that to negate p, we need to find a specific example where the statement is not true. 3. Therefore, the negation of p is lnot p: exists xinmathbb{R}, 2^{x}leqslant 0. This states that there exists a real number x such that 2^{x} is less than or equal to 0. 4. Options A and D can be eliminated because they suggest that x is not a real number, which contradicts the given proposition. 5. Option C can be eliminated because 2^{x} can never be less than 0 for any real number x. 6.

Since DF is a tangent and DF = FB, angle DFB = angle DBF.

For a line not to pass through this quadrant, it must either lie entirely in the first, second, and fourth quadrants or just in the second and fourth quadrants. 2. **Condition for the Second and Fourth Quadrants:** If the line only passes through the second and fourth quadrants, one possible condition is k=0.

Since the sides and altitude are rational, the area will be rational.

Of the geese that survived the first month, a fraction did not survive the first year. If 120 geese survived the first year and if no more than one goose hatched from each egg, how many goose eggs were laid at the pond? What fraction of the geese that survived the first month did not survive the first year?","output":"Let's denote the total number of goose eggs laid at the pond as E. According to the information given, 1/4 of the eggs hatched. So the number of geese that hatched is (1/4)E. Out of the geese that hatched, 4/5 survived the first month. So the number of geese that survived the first month is (4/5)(1/4)E. We are told that 120 geese survived the first year. This number represents the geese that survived both the first month and the first year. Therefore, we can set up the following equation: (4/5)(1/4)E = 120 Now, let's solve for E: (1/5)(1/4)E = (1/20)E = 120 E = 120 * 20 E = 2400 So, 2400 goose eggs were laid at the pond. Now, to find the fraction of the geese that survived the first month but did not survive the first year, we need to find out how many geese survived the first month and then subtract the number that survived the first year (120). The number of geese that survived the first month is: (4/5)(1/4)E = (4/5)(1/4)(2400) = (4/5)(600) = 480 Now, we subtract the number that survived the first year (120) from the number that survived the first month (480): 480 - 120 = 360 So, 360 geese that survived the first month did not survive the first year. The fraction of the geese that survived the first month but did not survive the first year is: 360 (geese that did not survive the first year) / 480 (geese that survived the first month) = 3/4 Therefore, boxed{3/4}  of the geese that survived the first month did not survive the first year."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = x + a(e^(2x)  3e^x + 2), where a ∈ R: 1.

Let e^x = t > 0, then f'(t) = 2at^2 - 3at + 1.    - When a = 0, f'(x) = 1 > 0. The function f(x) is increasing on R and has no extreme points.    - When a > 0, Δ = 9a^2 - 8a.      - If 0 < a ≤ 8/9, then Δ ≤ 0, f'(x) ≥ 0. The function f(x) is increasing on R and has no extreme points.      - If a > 8/9, then Δ > 0. Let g(t) = 2at^2 - 3at + 1 have two unequal positive real roots t1 and t2, where t1 < t2. Then f'(x) = 2a(e^x - t1)(e^x - t2).        - When x ∈ (-∞, ln(t1)), f'(x) > 0, and f(x) is increasing.        - When x ∈ (ln(t1), ln(t2)), f'(x) < 0, and f(x) is decreasing.        - When x ∈ (ln(t2), +∞), f'(x) > 0, and f(x) is increasing.

In summary, when a = 0, f(x) has no extreme points; when a < 0, f(x) has one extreme point; when a > 8/9 or a < 0, f(x) has two extreme points. 2. For all x, let e^x = t > 1.    - When 0 ≤ a ≤ 8/9, the function f(x) is increasing on R. Since f(0) = 0, f(x) ≥ 0 holds.    - When a > 8/9, g(t) = 2at^2 - 3at + 1 has two unequal positive real roots t1 and t2, where t1 < t2, and t1 * t2 = 1/(2a), t1 + t2 = 3/2. Since t1 < 3/2 < t2, if f(x) ≥ 0 holds for all x > 0, then t2 < 1 is required.      - Thus, g(1) = 2a - 3a + 1 ≥ 0, which gives a ≤ 1. Now, f(x) is increasing on (0, +∞), and f(x) ≥ 0 holds for all x > 0.    - If a < 0, f(x) = x + a(e^(2x) - 3e^x + 2) ≤ e^x + a(e^(2x) - 3e^x + 2) = ae^(2x) - (3a - 1)e^x + 2a. Let e^x = t > 0, then φ(t) = at^2 - (3a - 1)t + 2a ≥ 0, which is not always true. In conclusion, the range of a is [0, 1]. Final answer for (1): - When a = 0, f(x) has no extreme points. - When a < 0, f(x) has one extreme point. - When a > 8/9 or a < 0, f(x) has two extreme points.

Now, let's find the total number of eggs they both gathered in both rounds. Since there were 8 people gathering from a pile of 400 eggs, we can assume that all the eggs were gathered. The total number of eggs Tank gathered in both rounds is T + (T - 20) = 2T - 20. The total number of eggs Emma gathered in both rounds is (T - 10) + 60 = T + 50. The sum of the eggs gathered by both Tank and Emma is (2T - 20) + (T + 50) = 3T + 30.

If x^2 - 2x + c = (x-3)g(x) for some polynomial g(x), then substituting x = 3:     3^2 - 2(3) + c = 0 Rightarrow 9 - 6 + c = 0 Rightarrow c = -3  2.

A: f(x) is symmetric with respect to the line x=1 B: f(x) is centrally symmetric with respect to the point (1,0) C: f(2023)=1 D: sum_{k=1}^{15}f(k)=15","output":"Given the problem's conditions, let's analyze the options step by step: 1. **Even Property of g(x+2) and Its Implication on f(x):** Since g(x+2) is an even function, we have g(2-x) = g(2+x). Given that f(x) + g(2+x) = 4, substituting x with -x, we get f(-x) + g(2-x) = 4. Using the even property, we can rewrite this as f(-x) + g(2+x) = 4. Therefore, we have: [f(x) + g(2+x) = f(-x) + g(2+x) = 4] This implies f(x) = f(-x), indicating that f(x) is an even function. 2. **Analysis of Option A:** Given f(x+1) + f(x-1) = 2, substituting x with 1-x, we get f(2-x) + f(-x) = 2. Since f(x) is even, f(-x) = f(x), so we have f(2-x) + f(x) = 2. This does not necessarily imply symmetry with respect to the line x=1, so option A is incorrect. 3. **Analysis of Option B:** Since f(x+1) + f(1-x) = 2 and we know f(x) is even, this condition alone does not guarantee central symmetry specifically with respect to the point (1,0). The correct point of symmetry, considering the even nature of f(x), would be along the y-axis, not (1,0). Therefore, option B is incorrect. 4. **Analysis of Option C:** Given f(x+1) + f(x-1) = 2, we can deduce a periodic behavior. For instance, f(x+3) + f(x+1) = 2 implies f(x+3) = f(x-1). This suggests a period of 4 for f(x). Therefore, f(2023) = f(2023 mod 4) = f(-1). Also, from f(1) + f(-1) = 2 and knowing f(-1) = f(1), we find 2f(1) = 2, which leads to f(1) = 1. Hence, f(2023) = f(-1) = 1. So, option C is correct. 5. **Analysis of Option D:** The sum sum_{k=1}^{15}f(k) can be broken down using the periodicity discovered. Given f(4) = 2 (from f(0) = 2 and the periodic nature), and knowing f(1) = 1, f(3) = 1 (since f(3) + f(1) = 2), and f(2) = 0 (from f(4) + f(2) = 2 and f(4) = 2), we calculate the sum as 4 times (f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + f(4)) - f(4) = 4 times (1 + 0 + 1 + 2) - 2 = 14.

Given that sin theta = frac{5}{13}, we can consider a right triangle where the opposite side (relative to theta) is 5 units long, and the hypotenuse is 13 units long.  To find the length of the adjacent side, we can use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (c) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (a and b). In formula terms, this is c^2 = a^2 + b^2.
