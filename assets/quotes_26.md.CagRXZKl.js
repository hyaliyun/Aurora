Given the question: Information:  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - The University of California, San Diego (also referred to as UC San Diego or UCSD) is a public research university located in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, California, in the United States.

Article: An American educational expert, Frederick M. Hess, says that a long summer vacation doesn't make sense in today's world. This summer, 50 million kids will spend much time talking online, watching TV, playing video games and asking older brothers or sisters to take them to the supermarket. They will also be putting their academic futures at risk. During much of the 20th century, many Americans worked in factories that did not need a college degree but still offered a high salary. Also, in the 19th century, there was no air condition. And poor hygiene   meant that crowded schools had health risks. Things have changed. For today's students, academic skills are key to future success. Many countries don't give kids an American-style summer vacation. They offer no more than seven consecutive   weeks of vacation. Most American school districts offer up to 13 weeks. To compete in global marketplace, Americans must be prepared to go up against international competitors. Summer vacation also causes challenges for today's families. In the 1960s, more than 60% of families had a stay-at-home mum. Now, two-thirds of American children live families where every adult works. For these families, summer vacation can be more burden than break. Someone must watch the kids. But the biggest problem may be how summer vacation hurts academic achievement. Scientist have found that disadvantaged students lose important ground in the summertime. A school year can allow time-limited teachers to conduct richer and more imaginative lessons. Schools would have more time for sports, languages, music and the arts. Question: According to the text, who will benefit from a long school year? - American students, teachers and parents. - American students, parents and shop owners. - American students, parents and international competitors. - American students, teachers and international competitors.

What is the goal of a poor person having food? - digesting - being full - will not starve - survive - getting fat  The best answer is The answer to this question is:","output":"The goal of a poor person having food can be broken down step-by-step: 1. First and foremost, the primary goal is to survive. Without food, a person cannot sustain themselves and will eventually die from starvation. By consuming food, a poor person can maintain their health, meet their basic nutritional needs, and continue living. 2. Secondly, digesting the food is essential. After eating, the body breaks down the nutrients in the food through the process of digestion. This enables the person to absorb the nutrients, which are necessary for maintaining good health and performing various bodily functions. 3. The next goal is to feel full and satiated. A sense of fullness helps the person feel content and satisfied, which is essential to their overall mental wellbeing. It is important to have enough food to achieve this, as being constantly hungry could lead to feelings of anxiety and stress. 4. Another important aspect is not having to starve. By having access to food, a poor person can avoid the painful experience of starvation and the related physical and mental health consequences. 5. Lastly, while getting fat might not be a primary goal, maintaining a healthy weight is crucial to overall health and well-being. Having enough food to maintain a stable weight can prevent complications from malnutrition and other health-related issues. In summary, the best answer is that a poor person's goal when having food is to survive, digest, be full, not starve, and maintain a healthy weight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: \\"An unstable isotope is produced.\\" Justification of steps: 1. An unstable isotope is produced: To begin the process, there must be the creation or formation of an unstable isotope. This could happen through various processes, such as nuclear reactions or cosmic ray exposure. 2. The isotope is unstable: The isotope in question is not stable and has a tendency to change its form to reach a more stable state. Its instability is the driving force behind the next steps in the process. 3. The isotope emits radiation: As a consequence of being unstable, the isotope releases energy in the form of radiation. This emission is the process through which the isotope begins to decay and transform. 4. The isotope decays: Decay is the process by which an unstable nucleus loses energy by emitting radiation. It is a natural occurrence in various isotopes trying to achieve a more stable state. 5. The isotope loses some atomic particles: During the decay process, isotopes often lose atomic particles, such as protons, neutrons, or electrons. This loss impacts the composition of the isotope, ultimately leading to a change in its atomic structure. 6. The isotope turns into a different element: As a result of the changes in atomic structure, the isotope transforms into a new element with different properties. This is due to the loss or gain of protons, which define the element. 7. The isotope is finished decaying and emitting radiation: The process comes to an end when the isotope has reached a stable state. At this point, it no longer emits radiation or goes through decay, meaning its transformation is complete."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Friends and family gathered around the metal statue Tuesday, June 25, at the National Ranching Heritage Center for what they hoped would be an opportunity to find peace and honor Miguel Martinez where he died within minutes of the accident just before 3 a.m. Saturday.      “We just need to get together and pray and be supportive,” said Brenda Garcia, a family friend.      One of two adults near Martinez in his last minutes said his death was a “pure accident.”      Marenda Podhorsky said Tuesday that she and her boyfriend took her four children and Martinez to play in the park area near the center early Saturday morning, according to the Associated Press.      Martinez was spending the night with Podhorsky’s son and the children were awake well past midnight after eating sweets to celebrate her boyfriend’s birthday.      When she heard a thump, she thought Martinez might have been knocked down by the bull’s horn during a game of hide-and-seek. Instead, Martinez suffered a chest wound. He died after being impaled by the horn.      Texas Tech police, who continued investigating the death Tuesday, released a heavily redacted copy of a police report. The redacted report shows only the date, time, location and a brief synopsis.      “He was running and ran into the horn of one of the statues,” the report states. “The boy was unresponsive and died because of his injuries.”      Garcia said she has known Martinez for years. Her daughter and Martinez were close friends who attended Cavazos Middle School together.      She described him as a good role model to their friends.      “And he was always into sports,” she said, listing basketball, football and track. “Whatever season the sports were, he was playing.”      Garcia said she would not allow her daughter out past midnight, but avoided laying blame for the accident.      “Boys are going to be boys and they’re going to be out late,” she said. “This could happen to anybody, day or night.”      Stephanie Cole, a store manager at Wells Fargo’s North University Avenue bank branch, said Martinez’s family is accepting donations through the Miguel Martinez Memorial Fund at Wells Fargo.

Question: \\"What specific elements in the faith of the followers of the man formerly known as Siddhartha Gautama make up the core also known as the Triple Gem?\\"  Context: \\"Buddhist schools vary on the exact nature of the path to liberation, the importance and canonicity of various teachings and scriptures, and especially their respective practices. Buddhism denies a creator deity and posits that mundane deities such as Mahabrahma are misperceived to be a creator. The foundations of Buddhist tradition and practice are the Three Jewels: the Buddha, the Dharma (the teachings), and the Sangha (the community). Taking \\"refuge in the triple gem\\" has traditionally been a declaration and commitment to being on the Buddhist path, and in general distinguishes a Buddhist from a non-Buddhist. Other practices are Ten Meritorious Deeds including, giving charity to reduce the greediness; following ethical precepts; renouncing conventional living and becoming a monastic; the development of mindfulness and practice of meditation; cultivation of higher wisdom and discernment; study of scriptures; devotional practices; ceremonies; and in the Mahayana tradition, invocation of buddhas and bodhisattvas.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Triple Gem, also known as the Three Jewels or Triratna, is the core of the Buddhist faith and consists of three fundamental aspects: the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha. These elements are central to Buddhist beliefs and practices, and taking refuge in the Triple Gem signifies a person's commitment to following the Buddhist path. Here is a detailed explanation of the three components: 1. The Buddha: This refers to Siddhartha Gautama, who became the historical Buddha, and also to the concept of the Buddha-nature that exists within all sentient beings. Buddha, which means the \\"awakened one\\" or the \\"enlightened one\\", is a person who has reached the state of perfect enlightenment and serves as a guide for others in their quest for spiritual awakening. The Buddha is a role model and a symbol of the potential for liberation that exists within all living beings. By taking refuge in the Buddha, one acknowledges the Buddha's teachings and seeks to follow his example. 2. The Dharma: The Dharma embodies the teachings, the truths, and the path expounded by the Buddha to guide his followers toward spiritual enlightenment. Dharma encompasses the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path, and various other discourses, parables, and teachings that address different aspects of human existence and spiritual development. By taking refuge in the Dharma, one commits to understanding and putting these teachings into practice, which ultimately leads to the cessation of suffering and the attainment of enlightenment. 3. The Sangha: The Sangha is the spiritual community of Buddhists who walk the path to enlightenment together. It encompasses both the monastic community (monks and nuns) and the lay community (laypeople who practice Buddhism). The Sangha is important because it provides support, guidance, and inspiration to individuals along the spiritual journey. By taking refuge in the Sangha, one joins a community of like-minded practitioners committed to following the Buddha's teachings and upholding the Dharma. In summary, the Triple Gem forms the core of Buddhist faith and practice, representing the ideal of the Buddha, the truth of the Dharma, and the support of the Sangha. By taking refuge in these three aspects, individuals show their commitment to walking the Buddhist path and seeking enlightenment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bush administration in its first months faced many problems other than terrorism. They included the collapse of the Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U.S.\\" spy plane\\" brought down in Chinese territory. The new administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf. In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda. Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \\"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\\" In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness. The next few months were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the Sixth Fleet back to Washington to manage it.

The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (大日本帝國海軍航空隊 , Dai-Nippon Teikoku Kaigun Kōkū-tai ) was the air arm of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. The organization was responsible for the operation of naval aircraft and the conduct of aerial warfare in the Pacific War. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? The Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's pilots received high salaries","output":"Although the opening statement introduces the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service (IJNAS) and its role during World War II, it does not provide any information on the salaries of its pilots. However, I can provide context and additional information on the topic. In the context of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, it is important to understand the background and training of the pilots. The IJNAS had a rigorous selection process and an extensive training program for their pilots, who were known for their skill and bravery. These pilots, also referred to as \\"Kaigun Kokutai,\\" were instrumental in many major air campaigns and battles, such as the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 and the Battle of Midway in 1942. Regarding the compensation of IJNAS pilots, given the economic conditions of Japan during World War II, it is not accurate to claim that these pilots received high salaries compared to the global standard or even to civilian salaries within their own country. Japan's economy was strained by the war, leading to widespread conscription and a focus on nationalistic duty over individual compensation. However, when compared to other military enlisted personnel within the Imperial Japanese Navy, it could be argued that the IJNAS pilots received better compensation and benefits commensurate with their rank and training. Additionally, their status as pilots in such an elite organization would have afforded them a certain level of prestige and respect among their peers and society. It is also important to note that the concept of compensation in Imperial Japan often extended beyond just salaries to include social status and recognition for one's service and loyalty to the country. In conclusion, while it may not be accurate to claim that the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service's pilots received high salaries compared to the global standard, within the context of wartime Japan and the Imperial Japanese Navy, they were likely better compensated and respected compared to enlisted personnel in other branches of the military. This includes factors such as rank, benefits, prestige, and social recognition associated with their role in the IJNAS."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a news article: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) — The African Union says the largest Ebola outbreak in history is creating a sense of siege in affected communities during an emergency meeting.      The regional bloc has promised to send health care workers, but there are concerns about whether there is enough protective gear to keep them safe. Doctors and nurses are at high risk of infection, and a higher proportion of health workers have become infected in the West African outbreak than in any other previous one.      The outbreak began in Guinea and has spread to Liberia, Sierra Leone, Nigeria and Senegal, killing more than 2,000 people.      Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, chair of the AU Commission, told a meeting Monday that efforts to stop Ebola — like border closures and flights bans — have stigmatized the affected countries. ||||| A driver brings a sick woman to an Ebola clinic in Monrovia, Liberia. Kieran Kesner for The Wall Street Journal      Milton Mulbon arrived in a taxi at the gates of an Ebola clinic in Liberia's capital, Monrovia, with his 24-year-old daughter, Patience, bleeding in the back seat. Guards turned them away.      \\"They're telling me no space?\\" he protested, the taxi parked nearby. \\"She's lying down in there almost at the point of death!\\"      Taxis, ambulances, and even men pushing their sick in wheelbarrows are crisscrossing Monrovia, looking for an open bed in West Africa's overbooked Ebola clinics, health-care workers say. Sometimes they get in, through persistence and good timing. Mostly they don't.      Liberia's tradition of hands-on burial has exacerbated the Ebola epidemic. Burial teams now don biohazard suits to remove corpses, but they're struggling to keep up. (Photo: Kieran Kesner for The Wall Street Journal)      Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea—the three nations bearing the brunt of the outbreak—need at least 1,515 hospital beds for the more than 20,000 people who could be infected before the outbreak can be curtailed, according to World Health Organization estimates. At present, there are only a few hundred beds. International support has been slow to come and is just beginning to address this specific problem, with the U.S. promising 1,000 additional beds in a new aid package.      The shortage is so dire that ambulances have picked up people raging with the symptoms of Ebola, driven them around for hours, then dropped them back at home, medical workers say.      The odds of surviving Ebola at home, without intravenous hydration, are slim. Along the way, the sick often infect their families. That is creating ever more Ebola patients arriving at the gates of overcrowded clinics.      Some, like Mr. Mulbon, collect a bag of sanitary products and painkillers. His daughter, the mother of two boys, died within hours of receiving it. \\"She was helpless,\\" Mr. Mulbon said.      Health workers complain they can't throw down mattresses fast enough. Some organizations, including Doctors Without Borders, are asking Europe and the U.S. to send disaster relief—even military personnel—to help West Africa get ahead of an Ebola epidemic that has been under way since December.      \\"Many months into an Ebola outbreak, we're in the position of turning away patients who look like they have Ebola,\\" said Henry Grey, a Doctors Without Borders emergency coordinator. \\"That's an indication of the direct failure of the international community.\\"      Ebola patients at the hospital. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images      A few foreign governments are beginning to respond. On Friday, the European Union said it would pledge €140 million (181.3 million) to the three hardest-hit countries, €97.5 million of it going directly to their national budgets.      \\"The situation is going from bad to worse,\\" said Kristalina Georgieva, the EU commissioner for international cooperation, humanitarian aid and crisis response.      On Thursday, the U.S. Agency for International Development said it would build 10 Ebola treatment centers with 100 beds each, part of a nearly 100 million aid package to the three nations. USAID Administrator Raj Shah said the agency is moving to fund and deliver beds and several hundred critical-care personnel \\"as quickly as possible.\\"      The challenge isn't just delivering beds. It is training staff, said Jeremy Konyndyk, director of USAID's Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance, which is coordinating the U.S. government's response.      \\"We could get a bunch of tents and beds in here in no time,\\" said Mr. Konyndyk. \\"The hard part is who staffs those beds.\\"      It takes between 200 and 250 health workers to treat 80 Ebola patients, according to the World Health Organization. USAID and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are both looking to recruit and train health workers to take care of Ebola patients. The CDC program will begin in late September.      The trouble is finding doctors and nurses willing to treat a deadly disease—with no vaccine or formally approved treatment. In addition, the training is challenging, because they have to learn to care for patients while wearing cumbersome protective gear and meticulously guarding their safety.      Meanwhile, USAID is giving sick people who can't find a free bed a home treatment kit. It includes bleach and disposable gloves, Mr. Konyndyk said.      An estimated 3,685 people have been sickened by the latest outbreak, WHO says. About half have died.      But those numbers represent a small portion of the true toll, the organization says. Because most Ebola victims are suffering at home, their deaths or recoveries aren't noted in any official tally. Now, as clinics open, some of those who have been fighting the virus at home are beginning to show up.      A WHO clinic opened late last month in what had previously been a dental office. It was meant for 30 patients. But on a recent Tuesday, it was overbooked, with several patients sprawled out on the concrete floor, including children. The hospital's director was reviewing a list of patients in the car on her way to brief Liberia's Health Ministry.      Dr. Anne Deborah Omoruto Atai counted 44 patients. It was an improvement from a week prior when they had more than 70 people in the clinic with patients dying on the ground, she said.      Workers wearing protective gear stand inside the contaminated area at a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders in Monrovia, Liberia, on Sunday. Agence France-Presse/Getty Images      \\"It's difficult to give them adequate care when they're lying on the floor,\\" she added. \\"We just leave it to natural selection.\\"      Across town, workers at the Doctors Without Borders clinic were assembling a 400-bed tent hospital in the mud and rain. The field clinic they already have, with 125 beds, uses 350 head-to-toe body suits, 25,000 liters of water and 2,500 gallons of bleach—every day.      Taxis pull up here so frequently that both Doctors Without Borders and the CDC worry the taxis themselves have become conveyors of the virus. The disease spreads through bodily fluids and if a healthy person were to put his hands into the sweat left by previous passenger, it could spread—and in a way that would be impossible to trace.      \\"We're hearing stories of people taking four taxis across town,\\" said Caitlin Ryan, communications officer for Doctors Without Borders.      Outside the clinic, two taxis pulled up at the same time. Once again, there wasn't any room for the sick. So a shouting match ensued.      \\"We are all Liberians,\\" screamed a man who had brought a sick girl in his cab.      \\"They think we don't want to help,\\" said Randy Tomanne, one of the guards. \\"Their child is ill. There's no other way you'd feel.\\"      Later, a third taxi arrived. The driver said he had been paid 10 to take a family with a 6-year-old girl lying across their laps to a clinic. He had no idea it was an Ebola clinic.      \\"He just said the hospital,\\" said the driver, Ibrahim Somir, while a man in a head-to-toe plastic suit sprayed down his taxi in bleach.      Before leaving to try his luck elsewhere, the girl's uncle shrugged off the risk he'd put the taxi driver in: \\"What else should we do?\\"      —Matina Stevis in Nairobi contributed to this article.

Write highlights for this article: Three beaches along coastal Vandenberg Air Force Base in California have been closed through the weekend following a nonfatal shark attack, authorities said Friday. The attack occurred about 4 pm Thursday, military officials said in a brief statement posted on Vandenberg's website. The attack happened Thursday about a quarter-mile north of Wall Beach, which will be closed along with Surf and Minuteman beaches until 4 pm Sunday. A bite from a great white shark killed a surfer at Surf Beach in October 2012, and a bodyboarder at the same beach died in October 2010 when an apparent great white nearly severed one of his legs. Scene: Three beaches that line the Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara - Wall, Surf and Minuteman - will remain closed until 4pm Sunday following a shark attack near Wall Beach in 2012. Closed: Surf Beach had only recently reopened after being closed for seven months. Tragedy: In 2012, Califonia bodyboarder Francisco Javier Solorio Jr, 39, was killed by a great white at Surf Beach. In 2010, Lucas Ransom, a 19-year-old student at the University of California, died when a shark nearly severed his leg as he bodyboarded at the same beach. Vandenberg's statement only described the latest attack as non-fatal. A base public information officer did not immediately respond to a message seeking additional details. Vandenberg is a missile and space-launch site in Santa Barbara County about 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Surf Beach, which had been closed for several months during the Western Snowy Plover's nesting season, only reopened earlier this week.

They knew what sort o' trees to use, and how to split 'em up into planks, an' all that sort o' thing.\\"  \\"But McCoy used to study that subject, and talk much about it, when we were in Otaheite,\\" returned Young. \\"I've no doubt that with his aid we could build a good enough canoe, and the women would be as able as the men, no doubt, to direct us what to do if we were in a difficulty. McCoy is a handy fellow, you know, with tools, as he has proved more than once since the death of poor Williams.\\"  Adams shook his head.  \\"No doubt, Mr Young, he's handy enough with the tools; but ever since he discovered how to make spirits, neither he nor Quintal, as you know, sir, are fit for anything.\\"  \\"True,\\" said Young, with a perplexed look; \\"it never occurred to me before that strong drink was such a curse. I begin now to understand why some men that I have known have been so enthusiastic in their outcry against it. Perhaps it would be right for you and me to refuse to drink with Quintal and McCoy, seeing that they are evidently killing themselves with it.\\"  1. What is the chapter title? 2.

Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated.  and a hint : Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  Please answer this question : Which of the two areas had more phytoplankton?

The rocket's main components are designed by Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division and built in the United Launch Alliance (ULA) facility in Decatur, Alabama. Final assembly is completed at the launch site by ULA. The rockets were designed to launch payloads into orbit for the United States Air Force Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program and commercial satellite business. Delta IV rockets are available in five versions: Medium, Medium+ (4,2), Medium+ (5,2), Medium+ (5,4), and Heavy, to cover a range of payload size and weight. Delta IV was primarily designed to satisfy the needs of the U.S. military.  - A Launch service provider (LSP) is a type of company which specialises in launching spacecraft. It is responsible for the ordering, conversion, or construction of the carrier rocket, assembly and stacking, payload integration, and ultimately conducting the launch itself. Some of these tasks may be delegated or sub-contracted to other companies. For example, the United Launch Alliance subcontracts the production of GEM solid rocket motors for its Atlas V, Delta II and Delta IV rockets to Alliant Techsystems. An LSP does not necessarily build all the rockets it launches.  - A rocket (from Italian \\"rocchetto\\" \\"bobbin\\") is a missile, spacecraft, aircraft or other vehicle that obtains thrust from a rocket engine. Rocket engine exhaust is formed entirely from propellant carried within the rocket before use. Rocket engines work by action and reaction and push rockets forward simply by expelling their exhaust in the opposite direction at high speed, and can therefore work in the vacuum of space.  - A geosynchronous transfer orbit or geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) is a Hohmann transfer orbit used to reach geosynchronous or geostationary orbit using high thrust chemical engines. It is a highly elliptical Earth orbit with an apogee of , or above sea level, which corresponds to the geostationary (GEO) altitude. The period of a standard geosynchronous transfer orbit is about 10.5 hours. The argument of perigee is such that apogee occurs on or near the equator. Perigee can be anywhere above the atmosphere, but is usually restricted to a few hundred kilometers above the Earth's surface to reduce launcher delta-V (formula_1V) requirements and to limit the orbital lifetime of the spent booster so as to curtail space junk. If using low-thrust engines such as electrical propulsion to get from the transfer orbit to geostationary orbit, the transfer orbit can be supersynchronous (having an apogee above the final geosynchronous orbit). This method however takes much longer to achieve due to the low thrust injected into the orbit. The typical launch vehicle injects the satellite to a supersynchronous orbit having the apogee above 42,164 km. The satellite's low thrust engines are thrusted continuously around the geostationary transfer orbits in an inertial direction. This inertial direction is set to be in the velocity vector at apogee but with an outer plane direction. The outer plane direction removes the initial inclination set by the initial transfer orbit while the inner plane direction raises simultaneously the perigee and lowers the apogee of the intermediate geostationary transfer orbit. In case of using the Hohmann transfer orbit, only a few days are required to reach the geosynchronous orbit. By using low thrust engines or electrical propulsion, months are required until the satellite reaches its final orbit.  - Delta II is an American space launch system, originally designed and built by McDonnell Douglas. Delta II is part of the Delta rocket family and entered service in 1989. Delta II vehicles included the Delta 6000, and two Delta 7000 variants (\\"Light\\" and \\"Heavy\\").  - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon.  - Alliant Techsystems Inc. (ATK) was an American aerospace, defense, and sporting goods company with its headquarters in Arlington County, Virginia, in the United States. The company operated in 22 states, Puerto Rico, and other countries. ATK's revenue in the 2014 fiscal year was about US4.78 billion.  - Atlas V is an active expendable launch system in the Atlas rocket family. Atlas V was formerly operated by Lockheed Martin, and is now operated by the Lockheed Martin-Boeing joint venture United Launch Alliance (ULA). Each Atlas V rocket uses a Russian-built RD-180 engine burning kerosene and liquid oxygen to power its first stage and an American-built RL10 engine burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to power its Centaur upper stage. The RD-180 engines are provided by RD Amross, while Aerojet Rocketdyne provides both the RL10 engines and the strap-on boosters used in some configurations. The standard payload fairing sizes are 4 or 5 meters in diameter and of various lengths. Fairings sizes as large as 7.2 m in diameter and up to 32.3 m in length have been considered. The rocket is assembled in Decatur, Alabama and Harlingen, Texas.  - Arianespace SA is a French multinational company founded in 1980 as the world 's first commercial launch service provider . It undertakes the production , operation , and marketing of the Ariane programme . The main launch vehicles offered by the company are the Ariane 5 , the Soyuz - 2 as a medium - lift alternative , and the Vega as a lighter one . As of 2008 , more than 240 commercial launches have occurred since May 22 , 1984 . Arianespace states that the total number of launch contracts signed since Ariane launches commenced operations in 1984 is 285 . Arianespace uses the Centre Spatial Guyanais in French Guiana as a launch site . It has its headquarters in Courcouronnes , Essonne , France , near Évry . On 21 October 2011 Arianespace launched the first Soyuz rocket ever from outside former Soviet territory . The payload was two Galileo navigation satellites .  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - An expendable launch system is a launch system that uses an expendable launch vehicle (ELV) to carry a payload into space. The vehicles used in expendable launch systems are designed to be used only once (i.e. they are \\"expended\\" during a single flight), and their components are not recovered for re-use after launch. The vehicle typically consists of several rocket stages, discarded one by one as the vehicle gains altitude and speed.  - Ariane 5 is a European heavy lift launch vehicle that is part of the Ariane rocket family, an expendable launch system used to deliver payloads into geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) or low Earth orbit (LEO). Ariane 5 rockets are manufactured under the authority of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales. Airbus Defence and Space is the prime contractor for the vehicles, leading a consortium of sub-contractors. Ariane 5 is operated and marketed by Arianespace as part of the \\"Ariane\\" programme.

The premise reveals: 1. The subject: a group of teenagers. 2. The action: waiting to cross the street. Now, let us examine the hypothesis in question: \\"The group of teenagers is in the middle of the street.\\" This statement describes a potential location of the teenagers, specifically in the middle of the street. To determine whether the hypothesis is true or false based on the premise, we need to consider if the information provided in the premise leads us to believe that the teenagers are indeed in the middle of the street.  Upon close examination of the premise, we can infer that the group of teenagers is most likely on the sidewalk, near the street, or at an intersection as they are \\"waiting to cross the street\\". If the teenagers were already in the middle of the street, the most logical assumption would be that they are in the process of crossing the street or that they have some intention other than just waiting to cross. Furthermore, the action \\"waiting\\" implies anticipation and preparation for a certain event—in this case, crossing the street—rather than being in the process of the event. In conclusion, while the provided premise does offer some information about the location and actions of the teenagers, it does not give us enough data to confirm or deny the hypothesis that \\"The group of teenagers is in the middle of the street.\\" The premise suggests that the teenagers are waiting to cross the street, possibly being near a sidewalk or an intersection, but it does not explicitly state their exact location.

Article: Somehow, the conservative jurist's arguments in prior opinions have become a regular feature in lower court rulings legalizing gay marriage. The latest example came Thursday in a decision by renowned Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, with whom Scalia has an ongoing feud.      Posner wrote an impassioned opinion for a unanimous three-judge panel to overturn gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. He said three past Supreme Court decisions in favor of gay rights — Romer v. Evans, Lawrence v. Texas and United States v. Windsor — didn't necessarily make gay marriage a constitutional right, although he noted that Scalia had suggested otherwise.      \\"But Justice Scalia, in a dissenting opinion in Lawrence ... joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Thomas, thought not. He wrote that 'principle and logic' would require the Court, given its decision in Lawrence, to hold that there is a constitutional right to same-sex marriage,\\" Posner wrote for the Court.      He was referring to Scalia's passionate dissent in a 2003 case which prohibited states from outlawing consensual same-sex sodomy. Scalia declared at the time that the Court had endorsed the \\"homosexual agenda\\" and had effectively knocked down the legal argument for prohibiting gay marriage. \\"Today's opinion dismantles the structure of constitutional law that has permitted a distinction to be made between heterosexual and homosexual unions, insofar as formal recognition in marriage is concerned,\\" Scalia wrote. He made a similar prediction in the 2013 ruling that axed the Defense of Marriage Act.      It was a cheeky move by Posner. As Garrett Epps, a constitutional law professor at the University of Baltimore, argued recently in The Atlantic, Scalia may have ironically made it likelier that lower courts rule for gay marriage by insisting that the Supreme Court had quashed the legal justification against it.      Scalia and Posner, both appointed by Ronald Reagan, have been feuding for several years. In 2012, Posner wrote a lengthy piece in The New Republic attacking Scalia's newly published book, arguing that the justice's philosophy of \\"originalism\\" was a smokescreen for the goal of achieving conservative ideological outcomes. Scalia accused the judge of lying and the two have been critical of one another ever since. ||||| A box of cupcakes are seen topped with icons of same-sex couples at City Hall in San Francisco, June 29, 2013.      WASHINGTON A U.S. appeals court judge known for his outspoken views described arguments by Wisconsin and Indiana defending bans on gay marriage as \\"totally implausible\\" on Thursday, in a ruling in favor of same-sex couples.      Judge Richard Posner, appointed by Republican President Ronald Reagan in 1981, wrote the unanimous decision on behalf of a three-judge panel of the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. The court ruled against the bans.      The unusually swift decision, issued just over a week after the court heard oral arguments in two different cases, does not take immediate effect and is unlikely do so until the U.S. Supreme Court weighs in during its coming term.      The arguments advanced by both states in defense of the bans were \\"totally implausible,\\" wrote Posner, 75 and the panel's lone Republican appointee.      \\"Heterosexuals get drunk and pregnant, producing unwanted children; their reward is to be allowed to marry. Homosexual couples do not produce unwanted children; their reward is to be denied the right to marry. Go figure,\\" Posner said.      Posner has written dozens of books, including one about economics and intellectual property law. He also is a founding author of a blog on law and economics.      Two years ago he engaged in an unusual public spat with Justice Antonin Scalia, a leading conservative on the Supreme Court. In a review of Scalia's new book, Posner wrote the justice's judicial opinions deviated from the strict, text-based approach to interpreting law espoused in his book. Scalia, also appointed by Reagan, publicly disagreed.      EQUAL PROTECTION      The ruling said the bans on gay marriage in the two states violated the U.S. Constitution's guarantee of equal protection under the law. Two other federal appeals courts have ruled the same way, striking down bans in Virginia, Utah and Oklahoma.      The Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the gay marriage issue during its coming term, which starts in October and ends in June 2015.      More than 30 courts overall have ruled in favor of gay marriage since a Supreme Court ruling in June 2013 struck down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act under which states could refuse to recognize same-sex marriages from other states. A federal judge in Louisiana bucked the trend on Wednesday when he upheld that state's ban.      Gay marriage is legal in 19 of the 50 states and in Washington, D.C.      Wisconsin will appeal the ruling, said a spokeswoman for the state's attorney general, J.B. Van Hollen, a Republican. “The attorney general has always believed that this case will ultimately be decided by the United States Supreme Court,\\" spokeswoman Dana Brueck said.      Indiana Attorney General Greg Zoeller said in a statement that he will seek a suspension of the appeals court ruling and hopes for a quick decision from the Supreme Court.      Hoosiers Unite for Marriage, a gay rights group that backed the challenge to Indiana's ban, said in a statement that its members were \\"incredibly grateful\\" that the court ruled so quickly in favor of couples who want to get married.      Larry Dupuis, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin, who has helped litigate the case, said he hoped state officials would \\"see the light on this\\" and end their defense of the ban.      (Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien; Editing by Frances Kerry, Grant McCool and Howard Goller) |||||Summary:","output":"The article discusses how conservative jurist Justice Scalia's previous arguments have become a recurring part of lower court rulings that legalize gay marriage. Specifically, it speaks about a case ruled by Judge Richard Posner of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals, who used Scalia’s arguments to overturn gay marriage bans in Wisconsin and Indiana. Scalia and Posner, despite both being appointed by Ronald Reagan, have an ongoing feud due to their clashing viewpoints on legal principles and rulings. Interestingly, Posner, in his argument, cited Scalia's dissenting opinion in a past Supreme Court case Lawrence v. Texas. In this 2003 case, the court ruled against the outlawing of consensual same-sex sodomy. Scalia in his dissent, held that the court’s ruling in this matter would inevitably lead towards the constitutional recognition of same-sex marriages. He contended that it was a contradiction for the same court to hold constitutional prohibitions against same-sex marriage when it had endorsed the right to same-sex sodomy. This dissent of Scalia was applied by Posner as he argued for the rights of same-sex marriages, bouncing off from Scalia’s past arguments, and using them, ironically, to uphold the opposite of what Scalia intended. Therefore, while Scalia had tried to argue for the traditional conservative prohibition against gay marriage, his arguments were used instead to uphold the constitutionality of same-sex marriages. This led to the humorously ironic situation of Scalia inadvertently contributing to the legal arguments favoring gay marriage.  This dynamic signifies the ongoing evolution of legal thought on the matter, with past dissenting opinions being utilized in favor of the issue they were designed to contest. It highlights the transforming landscape of constitutional law, which now includes the inherent right to same-sex marriage. The pushback against traditional conservative views embodied by Scalia’s past dissent is also shown in the courts’ unanimous decisions that reject bans on gay marriage, and instead, uphold the constitutionality of same-sex marriages, utilizing the argument of equal protection under the constitution. The article finally includes the perspective of states that had their bans on gay marriage overturned. Wisconsin, for one, announced its intention to appeal the ruling, insisting that the decision regarding gay marriage will eventually fall under the jurisdiction of the US Supreme Court. Indiana also plans to challenge the court ruling, hoping for an expedited Supreme Court decision. Member groups of those opposing the ban find the quick court ruling in favor of same-sex marriages as a positive step forward. The article sets the stage for the expected Supreme Court hearing on the matter of same-sex marriage. Amidst the shifting viewpoints and the utilization of legal principles in nuanced ways, the final decision of the Supreme Court will be the ultimate declaration on the matter of constitutionality of same-sex marriages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information:  - A graduate school (sometimes shortened as grad school) is a school that awards advanced academic degrees (i.e. master's and doctoral degrees) with the general requirement that students must have earned a previous undergraduate (bachelor's) degree with a high grade point average. A distinction is typically made between graduate schools (where courses of study vary in the degree to which they provide training for a particular profession) and professional schools, which offer specialized advanced degrees in professional fields such as medicine, nursing, business, engineering, or law. The distinction between graduate schools and professional schools is not absolute, as various professional schools offer graduate degrees (e.g., some nursing schools offer a master's degree in nursing). Also, some graduate degrees train students for a specific profession (e.g. an MSc or a PhD in epidemiology trains a person to be an epidemiologist).  - The Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) is the teaching hospital and biomedical research facility of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, located in Baltimore City, Maryland, U.S. It was founded in 1889 using money from a bequest by philanthropist Johns Hopkins. Johns Hopkins Hospital and the school of medicine are the founding institutions of modern American medicine and the birthplace of numerous medical traditions including rounds, residents and housestaff. Many medical specialties were formed at the hospital including neurosurgery, by Harvey Cushing; cardiac surgery by Alfred Blalock; and pediatrics and child psychiatry, by Leo Kanner.  - Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.  - The Johns Hopkins University (commonly referred to as Johns Hopkins, JHU, or simply Hopkins) is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His 7 million bequestof which half financed the establishment of The Johns Hopkins Hospitalwas the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the United States at that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university to revolutionize higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States.  - John Lewis Holland (October 21, 1919  November 27, 2008) was an American psychologist and Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University. He was the creator of the career development model, \\"Holland Occupational Themes,\\" otherwise known as The Holland Codes.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Daniel Coit Gilman (July 6, 1831  October 13, 1908) was an American educator and academic. Gilman was instrumental in founding the Sheffield Scientific School at Yale College, and subsequently served as the third president of the University of California, as the first president of Johns Hopkins University, and as founding president of the Carnegie Institution. He was also co-founder of the Russell Trust Association, which administers the business affairs of Yale's Skull and Bones society. Gilman served for twenty five years as president of Johns Hopkins; his inauguration in 1876 has been said to mark \\"the starting point of postgraduate education in the U.S.\\"  - Heidelberg University (informally Heidelberg) is a public research university located in the town of Heidelberg, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Founded in 1386 on instruction of Pope Urban VI, Heidelberg is Germany's oldest university and one of the world's oldest surviving universities. It was the third university established in the Holy Roman Empire.  - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.  - A psychologist is a professional who evaluates and studies behavior and mental processes (see also psychology). Typically, psychologists must have completed a university degree in psychology, which is a master's degree in some countries and a doctorate in others. This definition of psychologist is non-exclusive; in most jurisdictions, members of other professions (such as counselors and psychiatrists) can also evaluate, diagnose, treat, and study mental processes. Some psychologists, such as clinical and counseling psychologists, provide mental health care, and some psychologists, such as social or organizational psychologists conduct research and provide consultation services.  - The Holland Codes or the Holland Occupational Themes ( RIASEC ) refers to a theory of careers and vocational choice ( based upon personality types ) that was initially developed by American psychologist John L. Holland ( 1919 - 2008 ) , Professor Emeritus of Sociology at Johns Hopkins University . The US Department of Labor ETA has been using an updated and expanded version of the RIASEC model in the \`\` Interests '' section of its free online database , The Occupational Information Network ( O * NET ) , since its inception during the late 1990s .  - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.

He also refused to sell Wadiya's oil fields, a promise he made to his father on his deathbed. After the United Nations Security Council resolves to intervene militarily, Aladeen travels to the UN Headquarters in New York to address the council. Shortly after arriving, Aladeen is kidnapped by Clayton (John C. Reilly), a hitman hired by his treacherous uncle Tamir (Ben Kingsley), whom Aladeen's father passed over as successor in favor of his son. Tamir then replaces Aladeen with a dimwitted political decoy named Efawadh (Baron Cohen), whom he intends to manipulate into signing a document nominally democratizing Wadiya while opening the country's oil fields to Chinese and other foreign vested interests. Aladeen escapes after Clayton accidentally kills himself in a botched torture attempt; when his corpse is discovered Tamir thinks Aladeen has been killed.

As shown by M D Eddy, natural history in this context was a very middle class pursuit and operated as a fertile trading zone for the interdisciplinary exchange of diverse scientific ideas.\\"  Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"Zoology. In the given context, natural history encompasses a wide range of scientific disciplines, including botany, zoology, meteorology, hydrology, and mineralogy. These disciplines focus on various aspects of the natural world, ranging from plants, animals, and the Earth's atmosphere to the study of water and minerals. When considering the disciplines alphabetically, the last one alphabetically is zoology. Zoology is a branch of biology that deals with the study of animals and their classifications, behavior, distribution, physiology, and evolution. This discipline covers organisms from the smallest invertebrates, like insects and microscopic organisms, to the largest mammals, such as elephants and whales. Zoological research provides valuable insights into the diversity of organisms, their life processes, and their relationship with the environment and other living beings. During the Enlightenment period, natural history gained significant importance and popularity, especially among the upper classes. This era saw the rise of scientific literature that was primarily focused on the observation, classification, and description of the natural world. Works such as René-Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur's Histoire naturelle des insectes and Jacques Gautier d'Agoty's La Myologie complète, ou description de tous les muscles du corps humain (1746) were essential additions to the field of natural history. These and other publications helped to generate scientific knowledge and exchange ideas across various disciplines. Natural history disciplines were integral to both medicine and industry during this time and were taught to students in universities and academies to prepare them for a myriad of careers, including medicine and theology. As noted by M D Eddy, natural history provided an ideal platform for promoting interdisciplinary discussions, bringing together different scientific ideas and fostering a collaborative pursuit of knowledge among the middle class. In conclusion, of the disciplines of natural history mentioned in the context provided, the last one alphabetically is zoology. The popularity of natural history during the Enlightenment period contributed to the growth of scientific literature and led to remarkable advancements in the understanding of the natural world, which in turn had significant implications for medical, industrial, and educational pursuits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November. RealClearPolitics averaged several recent polls and found that 45.6 percent of those surveyed said they would support Democratic congressional candidates in November, compared with 38.9 percent who said they would vote for Republicans. Analysts see the generic ballot as a key indicator of party strength heading into the midterms. Historically, the president's party usually loses congressional seats two years after winning the White House.The losses are usually worse if the president's public approval rating is under 50 percent. Trump's approval has recently averaged about 41 percent. Question: After the end of this story, did Trump probably: Options: - not enough information - Keep the same amount of congress seats - Gain congress seats - Lose congress seats A:","output":"Lose congress seats"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: ANN ARBOR, Mich. — Katy Bodenmiller was worried about the proposed pipeline work near her house in Groveland Township, Mich., so she started looking for help. She emailed U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) asking about the project being pushed by a Canadian pipeline company called Enbridge Inc., which spilled 20,000 barrels of tar sands oil in Michigan in 2010. The email response from Stabenow’s office: A form letter about the proposed Keystone XL pipeline — a different pipeline project proposed by another company altogether,TransCanada Corp. The next big oil pipeline battle is here, and hardly anybody knows about it. “It saddens me to say that all evidence points to us being better informed about this project than our elected officials,” Bodenmiller said. “But that's only because officials and the press, with a few exceptions, have failed to advocate for those they serve.” A few weeks after she received the form letter -- and after The Times asked Stabenow's office for comment -- a staffer called to apologize for the mix-up, Bodenmiller said. Alberta-based Enbridge is moving forward with 8.8-billion worth of plans to greatly expand its U.S. pipeline network to pump more oil through nearly a dozen states. That work includes the construction of two new pipelines from Illinois and Texas and the expansion of a line running through Bodenmiller’s property in Michigan that will move 500,000 barrels per day through the state once completed. A somewhat similar effort by TransCanada to build an 830,000-barrel-per-day pipeline extension from Canada to the Texas coast — called Keystone XL — met national opposition from landowners, politicians and environmentalists. Their pressure put part of the project on hold because of a federal approval process managed by the State Department that allows the U.S. government to deny pipeline projects. That hasn’t happened to Enbridge, even though one of the company's proposed pipeline projects would take 850,000 barrels per day from Oklahoma to the Texas coast. A nuance in federal law allows Enbridge to improve its pipelines inside the U.S. as long as the work doesn’t cross the Canadian border, meaning the State Department does not have to approve. Enbridge is moving forward at the local and state level without the same friction faced by its competitor with Keystone XL, and expects to complete most of its projects by 2014. Local environmentalists and residents, worried about Enbridge’s safety record and requests to work on their land, have begun opposing Enbridge’s projects on their own. Ernest “Junior” Hamilton, a 69-year-old Holly, Mich., resident, told The Times that Enbridge offered him 7,000 for pipeline work that would tear up his yard, remove all his trees, pass over his drinking well and ruin his septic system. Hamilton refused to cooperate and now has a court date to determine whether the company could exercise eminent domain and take his land to do its work. “If the judge says, ‘OK, you can take his property,’ it’s done,” Hamilton said. “I just paid it off last year. Paid on it for 30 years, and now a judge can say [to Enbridge], ‘Oh, you can have it because you feel the need.' \\" Hamilton added, “Hopefully it will get somebody else’s attention, what they’re doing. Because it isn’t just me living out in the sticks.” The company says it has followed all the rules, contacting landowners to notify them and negotiating to secure the necessary property easements. Now environmental groups are discovering the limitations they face in opposing Enbridge’s projects state by state and county by county. In contrast, the Keystone XL battle provided a national platform. Activists with the Indiana environmental group Save the Dunes said Enbridge was avoiding their request to hold a state-level meeting with residents and environmental groups about pipeline work in Indiana’s three northwest counties. “Up to this point, we believe that the public has not been adequately informed of the project [in Indiana], and Enbridge has so far declined our request for a public meeting of state, federal and local regulators and concerned citizens,” Nathan Pavlovic, a land and advocacy specialist for the group, told The Times in an email. An Enbridge spokesman said the company had already held an open house with local residents and offered to meet privately with Save the Dunes about the project.","output":"Enbridge's Quiet Pipeline Expansion Sparks Concerns Among Locals and Environmentalists"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that released Off the Wall? is inside the article: Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)\\".With Off the Wall, Jackson's \\"vocabulary of grunts, squeals, hiccups, moans, and asides\\" vividly showed the singer's maturation into an adult, Robert Christgau wrote in Christgau's Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies (1981). The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years. In 1985, Jackson co-wrote the charity anthem \\"We Are the World\\"; humanitarian themes later became a recurring theme in his lyrics and public persona., can you guess it ?

Vaccinations: Vaccinations work by preparing the immune system to fight against specific diseases. They do not prevent particles from entering the respiratory system. So, vaccinations are not an appropriate option. 2. Layers of fat: Layers of fat serve the purpose of storing energy and providing insulation. They do not protect the respiratory system from harmful particles like mold. Therefore, layers of fat will not help in this situation. 3. Deep breaths: Deep breaths can actually cause more particles to be inhaled into the respiratory system. So, this option is not suitable. 4. Sweating: Sweating helps to regulate body temperature and remove waste materials through the skin. It does not prevent mold particles from entering the respiratory system. Therefore, sweating is not the right choice. 5. A breathing mask: A breathing mask is specifically designed to filter out harmful particles from the air before they enter the respiratory system. This is a suitable option for keeping mold from entering the respiratory system. 6. Moisture: Mold requires moisture to grow and thrive. Moisture cannot protect the respiratory system from mold particles. In fact, high moisture can promote mold growth. 7. Organic molecules: Organic molecules make up living organisms, but they do not provide protection from mold particles in the respiratory system. 8. Hydrogen and oxygen: Hydrogen and oxygen are elements that combine to form water molecules. They do not offer protection against mold particles entering the respiratory system. Based on the analysis, the most suitable option to keep mold from entering the respiratory system is using a breathing mask. A breathing mask filters the air and prevents harmful particles, such as mold spores, from entering the respiratory system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What has there been a drastic decline in over the past 100 years that is probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water? ?  Although The Big Cypress is the largest growth of cypress swamps in South Florida, such swamps—as well as portions of sawgrass marshes—can be found near the Atlantic Coastal Ridge and between Lake Okeechobee and the Eastern flatwoods. Hardwood hammocks and pineland are often interspersed with the cypress ecosystem. Much like tree islands that are colloquially referred to as \\"heads\\", cypress trees grow in formations that resemble domes, with the tallest and thickest trunks in the center, rooted in the deepest peat. As the peat thins out, cypresses continue to grow, but are smaller and thinner, giving the small forest the appearance of a dome. They also grow in strands, slightly elevated on a plateau of limestone and surrounded on two sides by sloughs. Other hardwood trees can be found in cypress domes, such as red maple (Acer rubrum), swamp bay (Persea palustris), and pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana). If cypresses are removed, hardwoods take over, and the ecosystem is recategorized as a mixed swamp forest. Because the cypress domes and strands retain moisture and block out much of the sunlight, plants such as orchids, bromeliads, and ferns thrive in cypress domes and strands. Orchids bloom throughout the year in cypress heads, and bromeliads appear in many varieties; on Fakahatchee Strand alone, thirteen species have been documented. Bromeliads collect moisture from rain and humidity in the bases of their leaves, which also nurture frogs, lizards and various insects. Wood storks (Mycteria americana) nest almost exclusively in cypress forests and in the past 100 years have seen a dramatic decline, probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks' reproductive cycles coincide with the dry season, when small fish and amphibians are trapped in shallow pools and puddles. When water from canals or locks is released too soon or not at all, storks are unable to find enough food for themselves and their offspring. An estimated 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress in the 1930s, but by the... A:","output":"Based on the given article, there has been a drastic decline in the population of wood storks (Mycteria americana) over the past 100 years, which is probably due to lack of reproduction tied to controlled water. Wood storks primarily nest in cypress forests, and their reproductive cycles are closely linked with the availability of small fish and amphibians, which tend to get trapped in shallow pools and puddles during the dry season. Controlled water, such as water released from canals or locks, when not managed properly, can disturb the natural feeding patterns of wood storks. When water is released too soon or not at all, it drastically affects the food supply for these birds, making it difficult for them to find enough sustenance for themselves and their offspring. This disruption in their feeding and reproductive cycles has led to a significant decline in their population levels. In the 1930s, it was estimated that around 20,000 wood storks nested in The Big Cypress, but the article does not mention the current population; however, it can be inferred that there has been a substantial decrease due to the mentioned factors. This highlights the importance of understanding and preserving delicate ecosystems and ensuring that human interventions, such as controlled water systems, do not have adverse consequences on local flora and fauna."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Are the particles in Beaker X more or less likely to bump into each other than the particles in Beaker A?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

The price of basic food such as wheat and corn has stayed the same for quite a long time,about 30 years.But as the world's population is getting bigger,there's more pressure to feed more people,plus there's less land and water to go round. Another reason is climate change.Droughts and floods make it hard to grow crops like rice and grain.The price of oil has gone up and that makes it more expensive for farmers to run their tractors and to transport the food they make.And lots of fields are being used to grow crops to make other things that can't be eaten--which is bad news for hungry people. The main losers are poor people who live in cities in poor countries,who are facing higher prices for food.Some people are doing well out of the food crisis  though.Farmers in rich countries like the US,Canada and Australia are getting record prices for their harvests.

He intensified his criticism of Canada Friday for what he says are the country's \\"highly restrictive\\" trade practices. Trump has repeatedly said measures such as tariffs are necessary to protect American jobs and industries in key manufacturing sectors. \\"The president's actions are about protecting American steel, American aluminum,\\" a White House spokesman, Raj Shah, said on Fox News. \\"They're critical for national security.\\" But the negative reaction from some of America's most important strategic allies has been quick and fierce. European Union Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom said shortly after the tariffs took effect they were illegal and the 28-nation bloc would initiate a settlement dispute case with the World Trade Organization. \\"We can do so. We have the right to do so. I think we must do so, as well, to show that we cannot just take these tariffs and stand silent and we do not accept these kind of imposed illegal tariffs,\\" said Malmstrom. Without elaborating, Malmstrom also said the EU would explore \\"rebalancing measures,\\" which typically are retaliatory actions. Trudeau called the tariffs \\"totally unacceptable\\" and vowed retaliation. \\"This decision is not only unlawful, but it is... Question: After the end of the story, Macron probably is Options:  A.

As I mentioned in my previous post on Sacré-Coeur, one of the other places I didn’t get a chance to see when I was in Paris last summer was the catacombs so I wanted to be sure to fit in a visit this time around. Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€. It’s a nice cool 14°C (57°F) down there, a lovely break from the hot summer weather above. It is damp in places and the ground can be slippery so watch your step as you walk.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person that George Grove helped?, using the article: In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care. Um yeah right. Each time this stuff happens, they issue an apology (or a justification for their behavior) and promise they will take steps to better inform users and protect their privacy, but it’s clear that this is just lip service at this point.

Answer the following question: where does the word pro bono come from?","output":"The term \\"pro bono\\" is derived from Latin and has a rich historical and cultural significance in the context of providing services or expertise. To provide a detailed understanding of the origin and meaning of the term, it's helpful to break it down into its Latin components and explore their implications. The phrase \\"pro bono\\" is an abbreviation of the longer Latin term \\"pro bono publico,\\" which directly translates to \\"for the public good.\\" Let's examine each part of this phrase: 1. Pro: The Latin preposition \\"pro\\" carries the sense of \\"for\\" or \\"in favor of.\\" It is used to denote support, advocacy, or allegiance to a specific cause or entity. 2. Bono: \\"Bono\\" is the ablative singular form of the Latin noun \\"bonum,\\" which means \\"good\\" or \\"advantage.\\" In this context, it refers to the benefit or welfare of a larger collective, such as a community or society. 3. Publico: \\"Publico\\" is the ablative form of the Latin adjective \\"publicus,\\" which means \\"public\\" or \\"belonging to the people.\\" It denotes a collective group or entity rather than a private individual or organization. When combined, \\"pro bono publico\\" emphasizes rendering services for the benefit and welfare of the general public rather than for private gain or profit. In the modern context, the term \\"pro bono\\" is predominantly used in connection with the legal profession to denote legal services offered voluntarily and without any financial cost to individuals, nonprofit organizations, or social causes that may not be able to afford adequate legal representation. The roots of the pro bono concept can be traced back to ancient Roman law and that era's emphasis on social responsibility. Lawyers in the Roman Empire were known to provide legal assistance to help less fortunate community members. Over time, as modern legal systems evolved, the principle of providing legal services pro bono endured and became an important component of ethical conduct for legal professionals. In today's world, many law firms, bar associations, and legal aid organizations encourage attorneys to take up pro bono work as a part of their regular practice to help increase access to justice for the underprivileged, to advance public interest causes, and to increase goodwill towards the legal profession in general. While not universally mandated, some jurisdictions have implemented pro bono requirements for legal professionals as a part of their licensure obligations. In summary, the word \\"pro bono\\" comes from the Latin phrase \\"pro bono publico,\\" meaning \\"for the public good.\\" It has a strong historical foundation rooted in ancient Roman law and serves as an enduring reminder of the social responsibility and ethical obligation of legal professionals to provide services for the benefit of their communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night.

Anger: Warwickshire Chief Fire Officer Graeme Smith said the charges should never have been brought. The families of three firemen killed in a warehouse blaze have called a chief fire officer 'hypocritical', 'arrogant' and 'small minded' after he welcomed the acquittal of three long-serving firefighters who had been charged with manslaughter over the tragedy. Graeme Smith, the head of Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service, claimed Adrian Ashley, Paul Simmons and Timothy Woodward had been 'treated like common criminals' in the wake of the fatal fire at Atherstone-on-Stour in 2007. Jurors at Stafford Crown Court yesterday cleared watch manager Ashley, 45, and 51-year-old station manager Woodward of gross negligence manslaughter after hearing six weeks of evidence about the deaths of Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid. Watch manager Simmons, 50, was acquitted of the same charge on the directions of the judge part-way through the trial. Police never found the criminals who started the fire and £4.7million has been spent over five. years trying to pin blame for the losses on the managers who let the. firemen enter the building even though all employees had already been. accounted for. Speaking after the verdicts, Mr Smith said it was 'crystal clear' that the case should not have been brought to court and called for an investigation into why the three men were prosecuted. But at a press conference in Warwickshire today, relatives of Mr Stephens, Mr Reid and Mr Yates-Badley said they had been let down by Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service following the fire at a vegetable packing plant on November 2. The family of Mr Averis were present but decided not to speak. Ian Reid’s widow Julie said she had been devastated by the not guilty verdicts, adding: 'Why does Warwickshire chief fire officer Smith think this case should not have gone to court? Does he not think that where the evidence is there, action should be taken? 'Is he really that arrogant and small minded to think that firefighters are above the law? 'We are all accountable for our actions, even the police. No one is above the law. Victims: (clockwise from top left) Darren Yates-Badley, Ashley Stephens, Ian Reid and John Averis were killed  tackling the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007. Their families are angry at the fire service's reaction to the manslaughter acquittal. 'We have a legal process in this. country and if the police suspect a crime has been committed they are. duty bound to investigate and pass their findings to the Crown. Prosecution Service. 'The legal process will determine. whether charges should be brought, not the profession of an individual. The jury could not find guilt in this case. But if this case makes. incident commanders take one extra minute to assess the situation. presented on arriving at an incident then that can only be for the good. 'A firefighter’s life is not worth. less than that of a member of the public and it most certainly is not. worth a pallet of packing material.' Mrs Reid, who described the fire. service as a 'sleepy hollow', added: 'I do acknowledge that the. defendants and their families have had a difficult year with this. hanging over their heads but it is nothing compared to the heartache. that Sophie (the couple’s daughter) and I have suffered for four and a. half years. Cleared: Watch Manager Adrian Ashley and Station Manager Timothy Woodward were found not guilty of. manslaughter following the deaths of four firefighters killed when a roof collapsed during warehouse blaze. Cleared: Station Manager Timothy Woodward speaks to the media flanked by Watch Leaders Paul Simmonds and Adrian Ashley yesterday. The three men were cleared of causing the deaths of four colleagues. 'I lost my husband, who I loved very much, and Sophie lost the dad she adored. Our heartache and loss is permanent.' Paul Stephens, the firefighter father of Ashley Stephens, was present at the blaze that killed his son. In a statement read on his behalf by a. police liaison officer, he said: 'As his father, and at the time a. serving firefighter being present at the incident, having witnessed the. horrendous scene on that night has left me with images that will stay. with me forever - images so strong I have not been able to attend the. court hearing. 'The loss of Ashley has left such a big hole in our hearts that it is impossible to mend. 'Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service. gave us unlimited support up until the charges were brought against. three of their officers. After that it seemed we were on the wrong side. and support dwindled down to nothing. 'To hear the Chief Fire Officer speak. to the press saying their thoughts were with the families was very. hypocritical as the only family support shown has been to the. defendants’ families. Tragedy: Firefighters Ashley Stephens, Darren Yates-Badley, John Averis and Ian Reid were killed as they tackled the blaze in Atherstone-on-Stour, Warwickshire, in 2007. 'Ashley loved being part of the fire. service and wanted to become a full-time firefighter. It seems so unjust. that the full- time officers he would have looked up to have let him. down so badly.' Mandy Baylis, the mother of Darren Yates-Badley, said: 'That night will haunt me forever. 'I never thought I would feel so let. down by the fire service. They talk about brothers in arms and one big. family. This is not true in our case. 'Family and friends of Alcester Fire. Station, which we have been part of for 25 years, have crossed over the. street rather than speak to us. 'It’s as if we’ve done something. wrong. All we did is lose Darren in the most impossible way. Not to be. able to say goodbye... Darren didn’t deserve that.' Addressing the media at the end of the. trial, Chief Fire Officer Mr Smith said: 'It is crystal clear that. these cases should never have been brought to court. 'The police investigation into this fire took a wrong turn early on. Collapse: An aerial view shows the roof of the warehouse after it collapsed killing the four firefighters. The Fire Brigade Union said it was absurd that the arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the CPS. 'The police treated decent fire officers like common criminals and the arsonist who started this fire has got away with it. 'It has taken almost five years and. £5million of public money to construct a case against these three men. and when it was presented in court it simply fell apart.' During two days in the custody of. Warwickshire Police, Mr Simmons, Mr Ashley, and Mr Woodward had their. belts and shoelaces taken away and were also held at a police station. overnight between interviews. Mr Smith said Warwickshire Fire and. Rescue Service and the Chief Fire Officers’ Association intended to. write to the Home Secretary and the Justice Secretary to seek a formal. investigation why the firefighters were charged. After yesterday's verdicts, critics said. firemen may now hesitate before trying to save lives for fear they could. be arrested. Verdict:. After hearing six weeks of evidence jurors decided Mr Woodward and Mr. Ashley had not acted illegally during their command of the incident on. the evening of November 2 2007. The police officer in charge of the. inquiry, Detective Superintendent Ken Lawrence, insisted the. investigation was justified and said he hoped the fire service had. learned lessons from the tragedy. The union said it was absurd that the. arsonists who started the blaze had never faced trial, while those who. struggled to put it out were 'relentlessly pursued' by police and the. CPS. FBU assistant general. secretary Andy Dark said: 'This was the first time firefighters at an. incident were accused of the manslaughter of their colleagues. 'This prosecution cast a shadow across the whole fire service and caused anger and concern. 'We are relieved at the not-guilty verdicts but firefighters are furious at the police and prosecutors. 'The. criminals who started the fire are still free, but those who tried to. put the fire out were arrested, charged and brought to trial.'

Question: when does the electoral college votes? Would \\"The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The Electoral College casts their votes after the general election in the United States. The election takes place every four years, on the first Tuesday of November. Once the general election is held, states certify their election results, which typically takes a few weeks after the election. The Electoral College members, called electors, then meet in December to cast their votes for the President and Vice President of the United States. These electors are chosen by the political parties in each state, and their number is based on the state's representation in Congress, with each state having a number of electors equal to the total of its Representatives and Senators. The District of Columbia (D.C.) is also allocated electoral votes, even though it does not have voting representation in Congress, due to the Twenty-third Amendment. As for your statement, \\"The Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors,\\" it accurately reflects the historical outcome of the amendment. Ratified in 1961, the Twenty-third Amendment granted the District of Columbia the ability to participate in presidential elections, by assigning it the same number of electors it would be entitled to if it were a state, up to the number of electors held by the least populous state. The least populous states have always had three electors, hence the District of Columbia has consistently been allocated three electoral votes. With the passage of the Twenty-third Amendment, citizens of D.C. have been able to cast their votes in presidential elections. However, it's important to bear in mind that the influence of the Electoral College goes beyond just the District of Columbia, as it determines the outcomes of presidential elections on a nationwide scale, with the candidate who receives the majority of electoral votes (270 or more) winning the presidency. In summary, the Twenty-third Amendment has always resulted in the District of Columbia having three electors. The Electoral College casts its votes in December following the general election, which is held on the first Tuesday of November every four years. The role of the Electoral College is significant in determining the winner of the U.S. presidential election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Rick Perry told the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute Friday that it is the responsibility of a conservative and compassionate government to protect the most vulnerable in society.","output":"Title: Embracing a Compassionate Conservative Government: Gov. Rick Perry's Vision for Protecting Society's Most Vulnerable Introduction In a recent address to the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, Governor Rick Perry highlighted the significant role of a conservative and compassionate government in safeguarding the interests of the most vulnerable members of society. Throughout his speech, Perry emphasized the need to strike a balance between maintaining the core values of conservatism while embracing a strong sense of empathy and understanding for those in need of assistance. The Argument for Compassionate Conservatism Governor Perry's stance on compassionate conservatism acknowledges the importance of providing a safety net for vulnerable populations while still adhering to traditional conservative principles. By promoting limited government intervention, fiscal responsibility, and self-reliance, compassionate conservatism encourages individuals and communities to take advantage of existing resources and opportunities to overcome socio-economic challenges. However, Perry's approach also acknowledges that certain demographics require additional aid and intervention from the government to truly prosper and achieve their full potential. Identifying the Most Vulnerable According to Gov. Perry, the most vulnerable populations include children, the elderly, individuals with disabilities, low-income families, and veterans. These demographics often face unique challenges, obstacles, and hardships, which can hinder their ability to overcome barriers and achieve economic stability. By providing targeted assistance and appropriate resources, the government can facilitate a more level playing field for these populations, allowing them greater opportunities for success and independence. Targeted Assistance Programs and Strategies Governor Perry's vision for a compassionate conservative government includes implementing targeted assistance programs designed to address the specific needs of the most vulnerable populations. These programs include: 1. Early Childhood Education and Intervention: By investing in high-quality early childhood education and intervention programs, Gov. Perry's administration aims to improve outcomes for children living in disadvantaged or underserved communities. 2. Health and Nutrition Programs: Providing access to vital healthcare services and nutritional support for low-income families, elderly individuals, and disabled citizens is crucial in improving their quality of life and reducing overall healthcare costs. 3. Job Training and Employment Assistance: Gov. Perry's administration stresses the importance of equipping low-income individuals and disadvantaged groups with the necessary skills and resources to secure fulfilling, well-paying jobs and achieve economic independence. 4. Veteran Services: The government has a responsibility to look after those who have served their country, particularly in terms of providing appropriate care, resources, and support for veterans struggling with mental and physical health issues. 5. Accessible Social Services: Ensuring that members of vulnerable populations have access to vital social services, such as housing assistance, mental health resources, and addiction recovery programs, is essential in facilitating their long-term well-being and economic stability. Accountability and Fiscal Responsibility To ensure that these targeted assistance programs are both effective and fiscally sustainable, Gov. Perry emphasizes the need for ongoing monitoring, evaluation, and adjustment of government policies and services. This approach encourages cost-effective government spending while maximizing the positive impact on the lives of vulnerable members of society. Conclusion The compassionate conservatism endorsed by Gov. Rick Perry offers a viable, nuanced approach for governments looking to protect society's most vulnerable members while maintaining a focus on limited intervention and fiscal responsibility. By striking a careful balance between targeted assistance programs and fiscal discipline, Perry's administration aims to create a supportive environment for the disadvantaged, ensuring equal opportunities for all individuals to thrive and contribute to their communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Rainwater is being collected and moved into the cistern for multiple purposes. The step-by-step process and justification are as follows: 1. Conservation of water resources: By collecting rainwater and reusing it for irrigation, the household reduces its reliance on external water sources, which may help conserve water resources in the area. 2. Wastewater treatment: The wastewater from showers, sinks, and toilets is directed into the underground purifying tanks, where it is treated before being added to the cistern. This process enables the reuse of water which might have otherwise been wasted, reducing the overall water consumption of the household. 3. Environmental benefits: Using collected rainwater and treated wastewater for irrigation helps maintain the health of the native plants and landscape surrounding the property. This ensures that the property blends into the surrounding rural landscape, promoting a natural ecosystem and habitat for local wildlife. 4. Cost reduction: By reusing rainwater and wastewater for irrigation, the household can potentially reduce their water bill and save money, especially in areas where water costs are high.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: need to be sleeping  B: need to be playing poker  C: need to be near Remy A:","output":"C: need to be near Remy Based on the context provided, Riley is autistic and has a tendency to copy what other people say. In order to engage in this behavior, it can be inferred that Riley needs to be near someone whose speech they can imitate. Therefore, out of the options given - A: need to be sleeping, B: need to be playing poker, and C: need to be near Remy - the most appropriate answer to the question according to the context is C: need to be near Remy. Being near Remy would allow Riley to observe and listen to the speech patterns, tones, and expressions of Remy, enabling them to mimic and imitate Remy's speech. While being asleep or playing poker may be activities that Riley could participate in, these situations wouldn't necessarily lead to Riley copying what people say. It is important to note that individuals with autism often have unique ways of processing and interacting with the world around them. While imitation can be a common trait among people with autism, it's essential to focus on providing support, understanding, and the necessary resources to help Riley develop social and communication skills in a way that is most suited to their needs and learning style."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Earth has its own blanket, too, called the atmosphere. The atmosphere helps keep our planet warm by trapping some of the sun's heat. Carbon dioxide is like adding an extra layer to the Earth's blanket. When we burn fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas, they let out a lot of carbon dioxide into the air. With more carbon dioxide, our Earth's blanket gets thicker and traps more heat.

How is \\"This is one of the effects of the euro which I mentioned previously.\\" said in Finnish?","output":"In Finnish, the sentence \\"This is one of the effects of the euro which I mentioned previously\\" can be translated to: \\"Tämä on yksi niistä vaikutuksista, jotka mainitsin aiemmin liittyen euroon.\\"  Here's a breakdown of the translation and a brief explanation of the Finnish sentence structure: - Tämä (This) - This word refers to the effect being discussed, and it remains unchanged regardless of the subject's gender or number. - on (is) - \\"on\\" functions as the verb \\"is\\" in the sentence. - yksi (one) - This word specifies a singular effect among multiple effects being mentioned. - niistä (of those) - \\"Niistä\\" comes from the pronoun \\"ne,\\" which translates to \\"those\\" in English. In this context, \\"niistä\\" is used to indicate \\"one of those\\" effects. - vaikutuksista (from the effects) - \\"Vaikutus\\" stands for \\"effect\\" in Finnish. \\"-sta\\" (-ista) ending is added to create the Finnish word for \\"from the effects\\" or \\"of the effects.\\" - jotka (which) - \\"Jotka\\" serves as a relative pronoun used to link two clauses. - mainitsin (I mentioned) - This verb is the first person, past tense of \\"mainita\\" (to mention). The subject pronoun \\"I\\" is not required, as the verb in Finnish already implies its meaning. - aiemmin (previously) - The word \\"aiemmin\\" acts as an adverb to provide information about the time when something happened. - liittyen (related to) - \\"Liittyen\\" functions as an adverb meaning \\"related to\\" or \\"concerning.\\" - euroon (the euro) - Here, \\"euro\\" refers to the European currency. The \\"-oon\\" (-än) ending is added to show that the sentence pertains to the Euro. Altogether, the translation of \\"This is one of the effects of the euro which I mentioned previously\\" is \\"Tämä on yksi niistä vaikutuksista, jotka mainitsin aiemmin liittyen euroon.\\" This maintains the original meaning of the English sentence while conforming to appropriate Finnish grammar and sentence structure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When approaching the end-of-year holidays and activities, it is not uncommon to experience increased stress and a sense of urgency in completing various tasks, both personal and professional. This phenomenon is often referred to as the \\"December rush.\\" In order to maintain a healthier and more balanced lifestyle, it is crucial to take steps to avoid this overwhelming time of the year. One approach to prevent the December rush is to plan ahead, prioritizing tasks and setting realistic deadlines for their completion. By organizing your time and responsibilities effectively, you can evade the race against the clock that often occurs in the month of December. Another essential aspect of avoiding the December rush is to set boundaries and make sure to allocate enough time for self-care, relaxation, and engaging in activities that you genuinely enjoy. It's okay to say no to certain obligations, thereby preventing an overbooked schedule that only adds to the pressure. Additionally, it's crucial to pay attention to your mental and emotional well-being. The December rush affects not only your physical health but also your psychological state, leading to increased anxiety, frustration, and even a sense of burnout. To counteract this, make sure to engage in practices such as meditation, exercise, spending time with loved ones, or participating in relaxing hobbies. These activities help alleviate stress and might even provide an outlet for decompression. Another useful tactic to avoid the December rush is to set realistic expectations for yourself and others during this time. Acknowledge that the number of tasks on your to-do list might be greater than your available time, and that it's okay for some things to remain unfinished or be postponed. As long as you're making progress and dedicating time to the essential tasks on your list, it's important to give yourself credit for the work you've done and not dwell on the things you haven't. Remember to maintain open communication with your colleagues, family members, and friends, as they can offer support, advice, and, in some cases, assistance in completing tasks or reaching goals. This way, you can address the pressure from the December rush collectively, as opposed to shouldering the burden alone. In summary, avoiding the December rush is about careful planning, setting realistic boundaries and expectations, staying attentive to your mental and emotional well-being, and cultivating a network of support amongst those around you. By taking these steps, you can ensure a more enjoyable and less-stressful end-of-year experience."},{"instruction":"Q:Context: aubrey saw her mom was sick so she took her to the hospital.

Sentiment analysis involves determining the emotions, opinions, or attitudes a piece of text conveys. In this case, the tweet appears to convey a mildly negative sentiment. The tweet seems to express a feeling of disappointment or regret due to not having obtained one of the \\"708 magnets.\\" There is also an element of curiosity as the author seeks to know if anyone else has one. Breaking down the different elements of the tweet can lead to a more in-depth understanding of the sentiment: 1. Language: The tweet uses casual and informal language, with no strong negative or positive words used. However, the phrase \\"never got one\\" carries a slightly negative connotation, indicating that the author wished they had a magnet but failed to get it. 2. Tone: The tone of the tweet is conversational and comes across as a sincere query from the author. The question at the beginning showcases a sense of curiosity and interest in the topic, while the second part of the tweet reveals a sense of disappointment or regret in not having obtained one of the magnets themselves. 3. Context: To fully understand the sentiment, one must consider the context surrounding the mention of \\"708 magnets.\\" If the magnets signify an exclusive or limited-edition item, this tweet's negative sentiment could be heightened as the author might express their regret more keenly. On the other hand, if the magnets were widespread and readily available, the sentiment expressed might be less intense. 4. Intent: Lastly, the intent of the tweet plays a crucial role in describing its sentiment. In this case, it seems the author wants to learn more about these magnets and would appreciate receiving information from others. While an inherent disappointment exists in not having a magnet, their purpose may be to gather intel or even form a connection with other users who also have an interest in the magnets.

The 52-year-old is set to join struggling Hull as assistant to Steve Bruce.","output":"Title: Mike Phelan's Journey from Alex Ferguson's Right-Hand Man to Hull City Introduction: Mike Phelan has enjoyed a successful career in football. Known for his excellent tactical knowledge and astute understanding of the game, Phelan has spent many years honing his skills under Sir Alex Ferguson. As the former right-hand man of the legendary Manchester United figure, Phelan has now embarked on a journey to revitalize struggling Hull City in collaboration with head coach, Steve Bruce. This article will delve into the exciting career of Mike Phelan and his recent appointment at Hull City. Mike Phelan’s Time with Sir Alex Ferguson: Mike Phelan's impressive tenure as the assistant to Alex Ferguson at Manchester United is one that many aspiring coaches would only dream of. During his five years working with Ferguson, Phelan helped guide the Red Devils to multiple domestic and European titles. Under their partnership, Manchester United won three Premier League titles, two League Cups, and reached the UEFA Champions League final on two occasions.  The success under Ferguson's reign was, in part, due to Phelan's tactical astuteness and eye for detail. The legendary manager trusted him with overseeing training sessions, scouting opponents, and relayed important decisions on the pitch. The two forged a strong working relationship, with Phelan becoming an integral part of the coaching staff at Old Trafford. As a result, Phelan's influence on games cannot be understated, as the team consistently achieved impressive high-level results. First-team Coach at Norwich City: After leaving Manchester United in 2013, Mike Phelan took up a new position at Norwich as the first-team coach in November 2014. Although his time at Norwich was relatively brief, Phelan brought his tactical prowess, experience, and winning mentality accumulated from his days at Manchester United to the Canaries. Phelan was tasked with improving the tactical set-up and player performance, while also working closely with Neil Adams, Norwich City's manager at the time. Ultimately, Phelan's invaluable experience within the English top-flight football helped Norwich as they earned promotion to the Premier League in the 2014/15 season. Assistant to Steve Bruce at Hull City: At the age of 52, Phelan was appointed as assistant coach to Steve Bruce at Hull City, a team that had been struggling to retain their position in the top tier of English football. With Bruce being a former Manchester United legend and a manager with a wealth of experience, combining forces with Phelan made perfect sense in an attempt to revive Hull City's fortunes. The role of an assistant coach at Hull City is one that demanded Phelan's vast experience, tactical acumen, and motivational abilities. He assists Bruce in various coaching capacities, including the planning of training sessions, strategizing for matches, and adjusting tactics to counter the opposing team's strengths and weaknesses. Furthermore, Phelan's experience as a high-level footballer and an influential right-hand man under Ferguson have made him the ideal candidate to communicate and build strong bonds within the Hull City squad. Conclusion: Mike Phelan's footballing journey is certainly one to admire. From his formative years under the tutelage of Sir Alex Ferguson at Manchester United to helping secure promotion for Norwich City, Phelan has continuously showcased his expertise and love for the sport. His recent appointment as assistant coach to Steve Bruce at Hull City is a testament to his esteemed reputation within the world of football. While Hull City faces numerous challenges, the partnership between Bruce and Phelan could prove to be the catalyst for their resurgence and a bright future ahead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2]  I am facing a new situation today: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake had more dissolved nutrients?","output":"Based on the information provided, Low lake had more dissolved nutrients. This is because High lake had stratified water, which limits nutrient mixing between layers, thus resulting in poorer nutrient availability.

Hellenistic art saw a turn from the idealistic, perfected, calm and composed figures of classical Greek art to a style dominated by realism and the depiction of emotion (pathos) and character (ethos). The motif of deceptively realistic naturalism in art (aletheia) is reflected in stories such as that of the painter Zeuxis, who was said to have painted grapes that seemed so real that birds came and pecked at them. The female nude also became more popular as epitomized by the Aphrodite of Cnidos of Praxiteles and art in general became more erotic (e.g. Leda and the Swan and Scopa's Pothos). The dominant ideals of Hellenistic art were those of sensuality and passion. Character is called what in Hellenistic art? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"In Hellenistic art, character is often referred to as \\"ethos.\\" This term encapsulates the depiction of emotions, personality, and individual qualities in the art of the Hellenistic period.

Whose musical works included Composition For Orchestra and Philomel?","output":"The musical works \\"Composition for Orchestra\\" and \\"Philomel\\" were composed by Milton Babbitt, an influential American composer, music theorist, and teacher. He is known for his serial and electronic music. Born on May 10, 1916, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Milton Babbitt grew up in Jackson, Mississippi, and began studying violin when he was four but soon switched to clarinet and saxophone. Largely self-taught as a composer, he was already writing music in his teens. He later studied mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania before switching to music and transferring to New York University, where he received his bachelor's degree in 1935. Babbitt's early works, such as his Composition for Orchestra (1940), show an incredible understanding in manipulating musical forms like sonata and fugue. He had considerable technical skill, despite the complexity of many of his works. \\"Philomel\\" (1964) represents one of Babbitt's significant accomplishments in the realm of electronic music, a genre in which he began to work during the 1960s. This composition combines both live soprano and synthesized sound. The lyrics of the piece are a modernist poem by John Hollander, which reimagines the myth of Philomel, a character in Greek mythology who is turned into a nightingale. Despite its complex and abstract nature, the piece has been well received in the music world due to its expressive power and integration of electronic elements. In this work, Babbitt demonstrated innovation in using synthesized sounds and live performance in combination, an example of his broader significance in the development of electronic music in the 20th century. It gave way to a new compositional style that broke free from traditional scores and performances. Overall, Milton Babbitt has left a profound impact in the field of modern classical music, not only through his advanced compositions, including \\"Composition for Orchestra\\" and \\"Philomel\\", but also through his extensive theoretical work. His compositions and theories continue to influence countless composers and musicians today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Rio counting on ‘luck’ to avoid major outbreak of Zika during Olympic Games Rio de Janeiro – \\"This is not an Olympic issue,\\" Rio de Janeiro's mayor, Eduardo Paes, told a reporter when he was asked about the possibility that a Zika outbreak might happen during the Games. \\"The Olympics are taking place when the mosquito is not procreating, not active. August and July are the driest months, and they’re less warm, so you have a lower incidence of mosquito bites,\\" he said. The Olympics are set to take place from Aug. 5 to 21 in Brazil’s second-largest city, followed by the Paralympic Games from Sept. 7 to 18. Tens of thousands of athletes and fans from every country on Earth will flood Rio in that time, only to return home potentially having been exposed to the Zika virus. It’s a scenario that might concern any epidemiologist. Even so, no \\"special preventive actions\\" like fogging with pesticides will be taken during or before the Olympic Games, Cristina Lemos, the city’s Health Department superintendent told Fox News Latino. \\"We will not direct our campaign at tourists,” she said. “We're just instructing them to use personal protection, like long-sleeved shirts, long pants and to avoid exposure to places that may have mosquitoes.” “And also to use insect repellent,\\" Lemos added. But many are skeptical of the city’s preparations. \\"We are counting on luck, we are counting on weather,” Brazilian biologist Mario Moscatelli told FNL. \\"The problem is that a city hosting an event like this should be taking actions to prevent the spread of disease, not depend on external factors.” He added that while it’s true that winters in Rio are relatively cooler and drier, “The mosquitos are still out there, and any change in weather – and we have seen extraordinary changes in these last months – could cause a disaster. The neighborhood where most of the competitions will take place is also where we have the highest concentration of Zika and dengue fever cases.\\" The numbers would seem to validate his concern. Since April 2015, more than 100,000 Brazilians have contracted the Zika virus – which has been linked to the increase of cases of microcephaly, in which babies are born with abnormally small heads. Although summer ended two months ago, in May the country’s southeast region, where Rio is located, surpassed the northeast, where the epidemic began in 2015, in number of cases of Zika with 46,318, according to Brazil’s Health Ministry. The Zika virus is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito which also transmits dengue and yellow fever. The mosquito breeds in small pools of stagnant water that collect in and around residences, such as flower vases, buckets, old tires, even wet floors and in the tanks of toilets. Lemos, the health department official, said that the city has more than 3,000 agents deployed throughout the city to inspect places where Aedes mosquitoes are most abundant. They visit homes, she said, educating residents about how to protect themselves, “searching for water deposits that can become potential breeding sites … [and] treating with pesticide larval deposits that cannot be eliminated.” In extreme cases, she indicated, they would spray homes with insecticide. Lemos also said that squares, parks, clubs, parking lots, stadiums, vacant lots and other sites are being regularly inspected. But Moscatelli, with his expertise in biology, is not convinced. \\"We did almost nothing in the last 20 years to prevent the spread of Aedes. Seven years ago we were chosen to host the Olympics, which gave us a second chance, but nothing was done. What can we do in two months? Pray for the weather to behave. That’s it.\\" Carolina Torres is a freelance journalist living in Rio de Janeiro.

Rio de Janeiro's mayor, Eduardo Paes, disregards the chances of an outbreak by pointing out that the Games will take place during the driest months of July and August, when mosquitos are less active. Despite these claims, many people are skeptical about the city’s preparations for the international event. A significant influx of athletes and fans will be descending on the city, potentially exposing a global population to the virus. Even so, no special preventive measures such as fogging or pesticides are due, leaving visitors advised to take personal precautions against mosquitoes. Health Department superintendent, Cristina Lemos, identified that their campaign will not directly target tourists. Instead, the approach will revolve around advising personal protection, like wearing long-sleeved shirts, long pants and using insect repellent. Additionally, efforts are being made to educate residents on mosquito prevention and eliminate potential breeding sites for the Aedes mosquito, which transmits the Zika, dengue, and yellow fever viruses. Biologist Mario Moscatelli is critical of the city's reliance on \\"luck\\" and \\"weather\\". He specifies that although winters are cooler and drier in Rio, mosquitoes are still present, and any extraordinary change in weather could lead to an outbreak.

It is linked to cases of microcephaly, a condition resulting in babies born with abnormally small heads. Despite the end of summer two months ago, as of May 2016, Rio has surpassing the northeast region where the epidemic began in the number of Zika cases. The criticisms against the lack of preventative measures are linked to the past 20 years of minimal action in controlling the Aedes mosquito. Despite winning the bid for the Olympics seven years ago and viewing it as an opportunity to increase disease control, critics argue that not much has been accomplished.

Former President Barack Obama unveiled plans for his future presidential library and museum on the south side of Chicago where he raised his family and launched his political career. The designs show a complex of modern buildings, with a library, museum and event center, plus a community garden, a children's play area and possibly an athletic field. \\"What we want this to be is the world-premiere institution for training young people and leadership to make a difference in their communities, in their countries and in the world,\\" he told the crowd that included Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, his one-time chief of staff.

The way we buy music, use our phones, operate our computers and so on. But the world has pretty much overlooked one of Apple’s greatest ideas yet: messages. The Times’s technology columnist, David Pogue, keeps you on top of the industry in his free, weekly e-mail newsletter. It started with iMessages, an iPhone/iPad app that lets you send text messages between Apple hand-held gadgets without cost. Instead of using the cellphone network (and paying 20 cents each or whatever), texts you send using this little app get sent across the Internet, costing you pretty much nothing. These Apple messages have many advantages over regular text messages. For example, the tiny word “received” appears beneath any message you send to let you know that your recipient’s gadget has received it. (If the recipient has turned on “Show read receipts” in Settings, you’ll even see the word “read” to let you know that the person has actually read the message.) If you’re in a back-and-forth conversation, the text messages show up on a single screen, scrolling up in conversation balloons like a chat session. While the other guy is typing, you see “…” in his balloon, so you know he’s working on a response and not just ignoring you. You can send pictures and videos through Messages. And you aren’t held to the usual 160-character limit of phone text messages. And if you have more than one iGadget — say, an iPhone and an iPad — you’ll find the same message threads on each one. You can pick up on a chat from wherever you left off on a different machine. Above all, Messages means that you can keep your text messages. They’re not locked onto your phone, like regular text messages. And they don’t scroll away forever, like regular text messages. You can go back and refer to them whenever, and they’re backed up every time you back up your device. So: Messages is cool. And coolly clever, the way it cuts the cellphone company out of the revenue stream. But that’s not the big news. Apple announced recently that this summer, it will release a new version of Mac OS X called Mountain Lion. And Mountain Lion will come with a new Mac app called Messages. You can download the beta version of Messages free, right now, even before Mountain Lion is available. (It’s actually just a beefed-up version of the previous iChat program, and still includes all of its audiochat and videochat features.) O.K., this is where things get crazy. Suddenly your computer and your phone are sharing the same communications stream. First, this means that you can now send text messages from your computer, using a full keyboard, which is a fairly radical change right there. You’ve been able to do that computer-to-phone trick before, but it’s been tricky. For years, I’ve been using Google Voice to send text messages for that very reason: on its Web page, I can send text messages, free, to phones, with the full comfort of mouse and keyboard. And you could sent text messages from chat programs — but only with special codes, and, of course, without the ability to resume the conversation on a different device. But Messages is the first time there’s been a low-friction, mass-available way to send computer-to-phone messages. The second huge change is that now you have your entire hard drive full of attachments — photos, videos, documents — to send to people’s phones. From your computer. Third, Messages preserves all of these exchanges, just as the iPhone did. But it’s far more useful to have your transcripts on the actual computer. Now you can archive them, search them, copy and paste them, print them, forward them and so on. Finally, Messages blurs the line between text messages, chats and e-mail. Or maybe it erases the line completely, and creates something entirely new. (One wild side effect: It gives birth to this frequently asked question: “Are you on the phone or the Mac?” For the first time, there’s no way to know. You can’t tell if someone’s being terse because she’s tapping out her responses with one finger on glass, or because she’s on her computer but just distracted.) Messages is in beta testing, so there are some kinks to work out. They’re actually kind of cool: side effects of the disruptive Messages change. For example, when I’m conducting a chat on my Mac, the iPhone in my pocket goes nuts, vibrating or dinging madly with each line. Remember, the phone believes that each line of the chat is an incoming text message. Sure, I could go into Settings and turn off the ringing and vibrating — but that’s a lot of trouble every time I start or stop chatting on the Mac. Similarly, a number of times, I’ve had this bizarre situation: I’ve conducted a chat during an airplane ride on the laptop. Then, when I land and turn my phone back on, it’s tied up for seven minutes, furiously downloading all of those “text messages” that happened while it was asleep, frantically vibrating or dinging. I mean, this is logical. It’s what Messages is supposed to do: sync the phone, tablet, Touch, and Mac. But there should be a setting somewhere: “Don’t alert me when downloading messages I’ve already read.” There are also some bugs, including some creepy sequencing errors. I’ve seen text messages appear chronologically in the wrong place in the Mac transcript, for example. Even among Mac-to-Mac chats, I’ve sometimes seen messages appear too soon in the transcript. Finally, I don’t know if I’m typical, but I had some trouble getting started. You have to have an iCloud account (it’s free) to make the syncing work between devices, and somehow I had to enter the proper e-mail address in the phone’s Settings before everything worked. I hope Apple gets around to solving these glitches. In the meantime, Messages will be changing the lives of heavy texters everywhere. Phones, tablets, Touches and computers are now all equal citizens in the world of short typed communications. Photos, videos and documents can now be part of computer-to-phone correspondence. Your dialogue can be archived and preserved forever. In other words, for heavy communicators, the one small modification Apple has made to the rules has changed the game completely.

Well, iMessage lets you do that from other Apple things like your iPad or even your computer, and it's free! You can even send pictures and videos without worrying about a character limit like normal text messages. And the best part? You can see your conversations on all your Apple stuff. So if you text on your iPad and then move to your computer, you can pick up right where you left off! This makes it really easy to keep all your messages and look at them whenever you want.

Article: One of the worst feelings you have as a professional athlete is the feeling after losing a game to a team that you should have beaten. That happened last night against the lowly Boston Celtics. They had only won 13 games the whole year and were really struggling. We had just come off a very good win against the Orlando Magic on the road and were feeling good about ourselves. The day did not start out good for us when we learned that T-Mac was going to miss the game with the flu. When you lose your best players (Yao, T-Mac) everyone must play a little harder and do a little bit more on the floor. We inserted Bonzi Wells into the lineup (he was the only one to have a good game for us), in place of T-Mac. It was a nasty game. We are usually one of the best three point shooting teams in the NBA and we only made 1 of 22 three point shots! I have never seen that happen. Never! Rafer Alston, Luther Head, and me combined to shoot 5 of 33 from the field. Ouch! You aren't going to win too many games like that. Even as poorly as we shot the ball, we STILL had a chance to win the game in the fourth quarter but failed to make the winning plays that you must make to leave the floor victorious. In the locker room after the game, everybody felt terrible. When we play a bad game, we feel that we let our teammates down. There is a bad feeling in the pit of your stomach when you leave the gym and you just want to go home and not talk to anyone. It is a terrible feeling, but it is a feeling that makes you want to try harder and do better the next time. I'll talk to you guys later. Shane Question: What is the passage mainly about?

When Kindler and Meinike do meet, Meinike, who is repentant, begs Kindler to confess his crimes. Instead, Kindler strangles Meinike, who might expose him. Eventually, Wilson deduces that Rankin is Kindler, but not having witnessed the meeting with Meinike, he has no proof. Only Mary knows that Meinike came to meet her husband.

Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ).

To further deliberate on whether to invest in this film proposal, it is essential to look at the various factors that contribute to a successful film investment. These factors could include the target audience, genre popularity, production team, potential for revenue generation, and other market trends. 1. Target Audience: This movie is likely to appeal to a teenage and young adult audience looking for a mix of comedy, fantasy, and science fiction. The themes of nerd empowerment, wish fulfillment, and social acceptance are also relatable to a wider audience. 2. Genre popularity: While the film's release date will influence its reception, films that blend comedy, fantasy, and science fiction have historically performed reasonably well. This genre mix can cater to a diverse audience seeking humor, escapism, and futuristic concepts. 3. Production team: Consider the reputation and reliability of the director, producers, and other key members of the production team. Look at their past work, how it was received, and if their skills suit the project. For the movie Weird Science, it is important to note that the original film was directed by John Hughes - a well-known director with successful films including The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, and Ferris Bueller's Day Off. If you are investing in a remake or reinterpretation of the film, ensure the chosen director and production team can bring a fresh creative vision that does justice to the original film. 4. Potential for revenue generation: Assess the market and explore factors such as comparable films and their box office performance. Evaluate how the movie's themes and plot can potentially generate revenue through theatrical distribution, streaming services, home video, or other platforms. Analyze the potential for merchandising or licensing agreements that can help boost revenue. 5. Other market trends: Examine market trends that might impact the film's success, such as the popularity of similar film genres, potential competition from other movies, and how the film might contribute to the current discourse in popular culture. In conclusion, while I provided a direct answer to your question about the character's name, it is crucial to consider the various factors mentioned above before making an investment in the film proposal. Analyzing the film's market potential, target audience, and the competence of the production team can guide you towards making a well-informed decision about investing in Weird Science or any other movie proposal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many Francophones.  - Charles Joseph \\"Joe\\" Clark, (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian statesman, businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th Prime Minister of Canada, from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980.  - Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (; October 18, 1919  September 28, 2000), better known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 19681979 and 19801984. He is the 3rd longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald), having served for 15 years, 164 days.  - The Conservative Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Tories, is a political party in Canada. It is positioned on the right of the Canadian political spectrum. The party's leader from 2004 to 2015 was Stephen Harper, who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015.  - The Liberal Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Grits, is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum. The Liberal Party is traditionally positioned to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party (NDP).  - The Canadian federal election of 1979 was held on May 22 , 1979 to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 31st Parliament of Canada . It resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party of Canada after 11 years in power under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative Party to power , but with only a minority of seats in the House of Commons . The Liberals , however , did beat the Progressive Conservatives in the overall popular vote by more than 400,000 votes .  - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874  July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state.  - The New Democratic Party (NDP NPD) is a social-democratic political party in Canada. The leader of the federal wing of the NDP is Thomas Mulcair, who was elected in the 2012 leadership election, led the party through the 2015 federal election and then lost a party leadership review on April 10, 2016. Mulcair will remain as leader, until his replacement is chosen at a leadership election to be held in 2017.    What is the relationship between 'canadian federal election' and 'prime minister of canada'? A:","output":"The relationship between the Canadian federal election and the Prime Minister of Canada is that the Canadian federal election determines the composition of the House of Commons, which in turn influences the selection of the Prime Minister.

They organize themselves into groups with very specific tasks: foraging for food, defending against predators, building tunnels, etc. An enormous amount of coordination and communication is required to accomplish this.      To explore the evolutionary roots of the remarkable system, researchers at The Rockefeller University have created the first genetically altered ants, modifying a gene essential for sensing the pheromones that ants use to communicate. The result, severe deficiencies in the ants' social behaviors and their ability to survive within a colony, both sheds light on a key facet of social evolution and demonstrates the feasibility and utility of genome editing in ants.      \\"It was well known that ant language is produced through pheromones, but now we understand a lot more about how pheromones are perceived,\\" says Daniel Kronauer, head of the Laboratory of Social Evolution and Behavior. \\"The way ants interact is fundamentally different from how solitary organisms interact, and with these findings we know a bit more about the genetic evolution that enabled ants to create structured societies.\\"      Social beginnings      The most important class of pheromones in ant communication are hydrocarbons, which can communicate species, colony, and caste identity as well as reproductive status. These pheromone signals are detected by porous sensory hairs on the ants' antennae that contain what are called odorant receptors -- proteins that recognize specific chemicals and pass the signal up to the brain.      Work in the Kronauer lab, led by graduate student Sean McKenzie and published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, has shown that a group of odorant receptor genes, known as 9-exon-alpha ORs, are responsible for sensing hydrocarbons in the clonal raider ant species Ooceraea biroi.      McKenzie and his colleagues also examined the genomes of related insects to determine where 9-exon ORs emerged in the evolution of this species, and found that there was an enormous duplication in this gene in a relatively short evolutionary timescale: While the ancestors of bees and ants only had one to three copies of this gene, clonal raider ants have about 180 copies. The massive expansion of 9-exon ORs happened concurrently with the evolution of complex social behavior, suggesting that the duplication of odorant receptor genes was vital to the development of ant communication.      Communication interrupted      To further dissect the role of odorant receptors in ant communication and social behavior, the Kronauer lab disrupted a gene called orco, required for the function of all odorant receptors. Introducing the mutation -- using a genetic manipulation technique known as CRISPR -- was easy. The challenge was keeping the mutant ants alive.      \\"We had to convince the colonies to accept the mutants. If the conditions weren't right, the worker ants would stop caring for larvae and destroy them,\\" says graduate fellow Waring Trible, who led this portion of the study, published separately in Cell. \\"Once the ants successfully made it to the adult phase, we noticed a shift in their behavior almost immediately.\\"      Ants typically travel single-file, sensing the route by detecting pheromones left by the ants in front. Using an automated system that tracks color-coded ants and an algorithm that analyzes movement, the researchers observed that, among other behavioral abnormalities, the mutant ants couldn't fall in line. The finding suggests that the missing odorant receptors are crucial for pheromone detection, and therefore social organization.      The lack of odorant receptors also changed the shape of the ants' brains. This was a surprise, says Trible, \\"because brain anatomy is not affected in orco mutants in other insects, like the fruit fly. Our findings suggest that ants are fundamentally different -- they need functional odorant receptors for the brain to develop correctly. This points to how crucial sensing odors is to ants, an ability that may be less important in other insects. \\"      Now that the lab is able to generate mutant ants, Kronauer has a bucket list of genes to explore, including those related to the division of labor between groups. \\"We've successfully taken a gene out, and next we'd like to put a gene in. We have a whole new world to explore,\\" says Kronauer. ||||| Two independent research teams at New York University and Rockefeller University say they have genetically modified two different species of ants. Here's some of what they found. (Monica Akhtar/The Washington Post)      Despite what you might've seen in 1950s monster movies, it's difficult to raise mutant ants. For years biologists have altered the genetics of organisms as varied as mice and rice. Mutant fruit flies are a laboratory staple. But ants' complex life cycle hampered efforts to grow genetically engineered ants — until now.      On Thursday, two independent research teams described their work deleting ant genes. Two papers chronicling the first mutant ants appeared in the journal Cell, along with a third study that altered ant behavior using an insect brain hormone.      Claude Desplan, a New York University biologist and an author of one of the studies, said that, as far as he could tell, these ants are “the first mutant in any social insect.”      Ants have complex social roles, even though members of a colony are genetically very similar. Females may be egg-laying queens or sterile workers, colony cleaners or fierce soldiers. Males, who are little more than sperm-delivery systems with wings, appear only seasonally. To ensure the mutant genes carry on, “you need to go through the queen,” Desplan said. “It is not so easy to make queens.”      “There's a lot of interesting biologic questions that you can study with ants that you can’t study with fruit flies or even mice,” said Rockefeller University biologist Daniel Kronauer, an author of the other mutant-ant study. If you throw a thousand fruit flies in a bucket of dirt, maybe they'll fight or copulate, he said. But that's about it. Do the same with ants and they'll set to work digging, caring for broods and foraging.      What's more, the insects are prime targets for studies of epigenetics, the external factors that toggle genes on and off. “Ants are amazing because with the same genome you can be a queen, or a worker, or another class of worker, or a soldier,” Desplan said.      Desplan's research group chose to study a species of jumping ant found in India, Harpegnathos saltator, because all of these ants are potentially fertile. Before laying eggs, though, the workers have to become pseudo-queens. (The scientific term for a pseudo-queen is a “gamergate” — no relation to the anti-feminist video game hullabaloo circa 2014.) If a jumping-ant colony loses its queen, the workers go through a gantlet of ritualized antenna-flailing duels. The victor transforms into a pseudo-queen.      Kronauer and his colleagues, led by Rockefeller University graduate student Waring Trible, studied clonal raider ants, Ooceraea biroi. Unlike most ants, the raider ants reproduce asexually, through parthenogenesis. Popularly called virgin birth, it's a phenomenon seen in some snakes, lizards and sharks. The offspring end up as clones of the females. For both species, the desired result of genetic alteration was the same: creating mother ants that gave birth to future generations of mutants.      Both research groups mutated their ants in the same way. Using the CRISPR-Cas9 technique, with bacterial molecules acting like scissors to snip out genes, the scientists knocked out a crucial component of the ant's odor receptors.      Pheromones, the odors by which ants communicate, are their social medium. Though there are hundreds of olfactory genes in ants, deleting one particular gene — called orco, for odorant receptor co-receptor — effectively renders almost the entire ant olfactory system useless.      Removing every individual odor gene would be “essentially impossible,” Kronauer said. But the power of orco to “take out the whole family” of olfactory genes makes it an obvious candidate for manipulation. (It's why both research groups independently decided to focus on deleting the gene.) The insects lost about 90 percent of their olfaction, Desplan said.      The behavior of the mutants changed dramatically. The Indian jumping ants wandered away from the colony and wouldn't forage. If Desplan isolated a mutant jumping ant, the ant still became a fertile gamergate. But these pseudo-queens laid very few eggs and were poor mothers. And if the mutants belonged to a colony that lost its queen, they didn't partake in the antennae duels. Instead, they only twitched their antennae when alone, as if shadowboxing.      The clonal raider ants that couldn't sense pheromones acted strangely, too. Normally, these ants detest the smell of Sharpie markers. But the mutants marched right over lines drawn in Sharpie.      Like the jumping ants, the Ooceraea biroi mutants became antisocial. “Suddenly these ants aren’t really social any more. They wander off, they don’t join the colony,” Kronauer said. “They just walk around.” Nor did they follow the pheromone trails their brethren left.      Stranger things happened, too. One particularly odd loner crept into a colony, stole off with an egg and began to groom it with her antennae. All of a sudden she startled. There was no cause for alarm, but the flood of warning pheromones she released sent the rest of the non-mutant colony into a tizzy, Kronauer said.      Rockefeller University biologist Daniel Kronauer and his colleagues created the first mutant ants using CRISPR technology. Here's how they did it and what they found. (Kate Bredbenner, SimpleBiologist)      Now that scientists know they can alter ant behaviors through their genes, Kronauer plans to study the way colonies divide their labor.      Imagine two people living in an apartment. As the dishes pile up, the roommate with a lower threshold for dirty plates begins to wash dishes more often. In the parlance of a biologist observer, that roommate “emerges as a dishwashing specialist.” The old research methods would be to alter the external cues — the equivalent of removing the dishwashing machine and seeing what happens. Through genetic manipulation, Kronauer plans to directly change an ant's internal thresholds.      Desplan is interested in the way ants alter their longevity, in addition to sensory perception. Workers live to about seven months old. But workers that become pseudo-queens live for four years. That's like one human twin living to age 85 and the other to age 550. “Expanding by a factor of 10 is unheard of,” Desplan said.      Workers who become pseudo-queens turn back to workers once they're exposed to queen pheromones. These former queens die within months. That means there must be a reversible genetic switch that controls the ant life span.      Other scientists have taken note of the mutant ant models, Kronauer said, including experts who study honeybees. “People are very excited,” he said, and they have asked whether his lab could help establish a similar protocol in other species.      Research such as this opens the door for new model organisms, in Desplan's view. If the traditional bioscience method is to ask many questions of the same organism — such as mice or fruit flies — then genetic engineering techniques allow biologists to ask very specific questions to an animal that fits their needs.      If you want to model communities, look to ants. “Even mice don’t have very sophisticated behavior,” Desplan said.      Some entomologists became ant experts because they loved ants. For Desplan, his was a more pragmatic affinity. He has worked with insects as varied as fruit flies, wasps and butterflies. And now mutant ants.      “We became ant people because we needed to,” he said, “not because we were born ant people.” And, if these model mutants catch on the way Desplan and Kronauer predict, expect the ranks of ant people to swell.

A CNN/ORC International survey released Monday also found a majority saying that the Republicans' policies are too extreme. And according to the poll, Democrats have an 8-point advantage over the Republicans in an early indicator in the battle for control of Congress. But with more than a year to go until the 2014 midterm elections, there's plenty of time for these numbers to change. Forty-nine percent say the Republicans should give up more than the Democrats in any future bipartisan agreement, but nearly as many -- 44% -- would prefer to see the OPTIONS: - Americans give up more than the GOP. - CNN give up more than the GOP. - Congress give up more than the GOP. - Democrat give up more than the GOP. - Democrats give up more than the GOP. - GOP give up more than the GOP. - ORC International give up more than the GOP. - Republicans give up more than the GOP.","output":"- Democrats give up more than the GOP.  Justification: The story is talking about the public opinion concerning political concessions among the Republicans (GOP) and Democrats. Therefore, the last sentence should reflect the flip side of the earlier point where it talks about 49% people wanting Republicans to give up more. Thus, the sentence \\"- Democrats give up more than the GOP.\\" perfectly balances and concludes the story. Other options either are repetitive (GOP give up more than the GOP, Republicans give up more than the GOP) or non-contextual (CNN, ORC International, Americans)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trembling with cold and hunger crept she on, the picture of sorrow: poor little child! The snow-flakes fell on her long, fair hair, which curled in such pretty ringlets over her shoulders; but she thought not of her own beauty, or of the cold. Lights were glimmering through every window, and the savor of roast goose reached her from several houses;it was New Year's eve, and it was of this that she thought. In a corner formed by two houses, one of which projected beyond the other. She sat down, drawing her little feet close under her, but in vain, she could not warm them. She dared not go home, she had sold no matches, earned not a single penny, and perhaps her father would beat her,besides her home was almost as cold as the street,it was an attic; and although the larger of the many chinks in the roof were stopped up with straw and rags. The wind and snow often penetrated through. Her hands were nearly dead with cold; one little match from her bundle would warm them. Perhaps, if she dared light it, she drew one out, and struck it against the wall, bravo! It was a bright, warm flame, and she held her hands over it. It was quite an illumination for that poor little girl; no, I call it rather a magic taper, _ , so beautifully blazed the fire within!

For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species.  Karen studied animals in school. She started studying predators for a school presentation. She liked it. Her friend Molly liked cows, sheep and other herbivores, so she decided to do a presentation about grazers, and their role in nature.  Which girl learned more about wolves?

Answer the following question: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused.

Chapter 27 is a 2007 biographical drama film depicting the murder of John Lennon by Mark David Chapman. It was written and directed by Jarrett Schaefer, based on the book Let Me Take You Down by Jack Jones, produced by Robert Salerno, and stars Jared Leto as Chapman. The film takes place in December 1980, and is intended to be an exploration of Chapman's psyche. Its title is a reference to J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and suggests a continuation of the book. The real Mark David Chapman is currently incarcerated at Wende Correctional Facility, on a guilty plea. Aside from two interviews with Larry King and Barbara Walters, both in 1992, he has not spoken with the media. However, Chapman did reveal the mechanics of his unraveling during those three days in New York City to journalist Jack Jones. The interviews were published in 1992 as Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, a book of Chapman's recollections of his act of violence. Chapter 27 is based on this text. The title \\"Chapter 27\\" suggests a continuation of J. D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, which has twenty-six chapters, and which Chapman was carrying when he shot John Lennon. Chapman was obsessed with the book, to the point of attempting to model his life after its protagonist, Holden Caulfield.  According to the British music magazine Mojo, the title was also inspired by Chapter 27 of Robert Rosen's book Nowhere Man: The Final Days of John Lennon (2000). Rosen's book explores the numerological meaning of the number 27, \\"the triple 9\\", a number of profound importance to John Lennon. Lennon was deeply interested in numerology, particularly Cheiro's Book of Numbers, along with nine and all its multiples. It was Chapman's goal, according to Rosen, to write Chapter 27 \\"in Lennon's blood\\".  Like Chapman, Schaefer is a fan of both The Beatles and J.D. Salinger's novel The Catcher in the Rye, and said he began the script to try to understand \\"how someone could be inspired to kill anyone as a result of being exposed to this kind of beautiful art. It really bothered me, because Lennon and Salinger have always made me feel so much better, and so much less alone.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"What is the significance of the title \\"Chapter 27\\" in relation to the film and J.D.

According to a recent study, the part of your brain that reacts to severe pain is largely the same part that reacts to expectation of pain. Researchers in this study worked with 10 volunteers, aged 24 to 46. Each volunteer wore a device that gave out 20-second-long pulses of heat to the right leg. There were three levels of heat, producing mild, moderate, or strong pain. During training, the volunteers would first hear a tone, followed by a period of silence, and then feel a heat pulse. They then learned to associate the length of the silent pause with the intensity  of the upcoming heat pulse. The longer the pause, the stronger the heat pulse would be, causing more severe pain. A day or two later, the real experiment began. The researchers found that the parts of the brain involved in learning, memory, emotion, and touch became more active as the volunteers expected higher levels of pain. These were mainly the same areas that became active when participants actually felt pain. Interestingly, when the volunteers expected only mild or moderate pain but experienced severe pain, they reported feeling 28 percent less pain than when they expected severe pain and actually got it. The new study emphasizes that pain has both physical and psychological elements. Understanding how pain works in the mind and brain could eventually give doctors tools for helping people cope with painful medical treatments. Options: A To provide the patient with more pain killers. B To talk to the patient and ease his/her worries. C To give the patient strong heat pulses beforehand. D To emphasize the possible severe pain to the patient. Answer: B To talk to the patient and ease his/her worries. Question: Answer:","output":"Question: According to the recent study on pain and expectations, what could be a potential approach for doctors to help patients cope with painful medical treatments? A. Provide the patient with more pain killers. B. Talk to the patient and ease his/her worries. C. Give the patient strong heat pulses beforehand. D. Emphasize the possible severe pain to the patient. Answer: B. Talk to the patient and ease his/her worries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Process: - Water in the clouds becomes very cold - The cold water forms ice crystals - The ice crystals grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets - Form snowflakes - The snowflakes fall to the ground.  Question: suppose the water becomes more cold happens, how will it affect more water droplets will be absorbed.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"A: more When the water in the clouds becomes colder, it will have a greater capacity to absorb more water droplets due to the following reasons: 1. Lower temperatures promote the growth of ice crystals: When the temperature of the water in the clouds decreases, the rate at which it freezes increases. This leads to the formation of ice crystals which grow by absorbing surrounding water droplets. The colder the water, the more efficiently the ice crystals grow. As a result, the ice crystals will absorb more water droplets when the water's temperature is colder. 2. Lower saturation vapor pressure at lower temperatures: The saturation vapor pressure of water decreases at lower temperatures. This means that at colder temperatures, the air can hold less water vapor before becoming saturated. When the temperature of the water drops, the surrounding air will become saturated more easily, leading to a higher relative humidity near the ice crystals. This increased humidity will lead to a higher rate of water droplet absorption by the ice crystals. 3. Increased density of air at lower temperatures: At lower temperatures, the density of air generally increases. This results in a higher concentration of water droplets within the same volume of air, making it more likely for the ice crystals to come into contact with them. As a result, the ice crystals will absorb more water droplets when the water is colder. 4. More efficient snowflake formation: The colder the water in the clouds, the faster the ice crystals can combine to form snowflakes. These snowflakes become more effective at absorbing additional water droplets as they grow larger due to their increased surface area. This leads to a higher rate of water droplet absorption by the snowflakes in colder conditions. In conclusion, when the water in the clouds becomes colder, it is more likely to absorb a higher number of water droplets due to factors such as faster ice crystal growth, lower saturation vapor pressure, increased air density, and more efficient snowflake formation. This results in more water droplets being absorbed by the ice crystals and eventual precipitation as snow."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Answer the question below:   If a product is unstretched, elastic force will increase or decrease?

Q:Question: \\"What was named after Jame II?\\"  Context: \\"In 1657, Oliver Cromwell granted the English East India Company a charter to govern Saint Helena and the following year the company decided to fortify the island and colonise it with planters. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, making Saint Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. A fort and houses were built. After the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, the East India Company received a royal charter giving it the sole right to fortify and colonise the island. The fort was renamed James Fort and the town Jamestown, in honour of the Duke of York, later James II of England.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The town of Jamestown and James Fort on the island of Saint Helena were named after James II, who was the Duke of York at the time.  This naming occurred after the Restoration of the English monarchy in 1660. Prior to the Restoration, Oliver Cromwell had granted the English East India Company a charter to govern Saint Helena in 1657. The purpose of this decision was to fortify the island and establish it as a colony with planters. The first governor, Captain John Dutton, arrived in 1659, making Saint Helena one of Britain's oldest colonies outside North America and the Caribbean. Consequently, a fort and several houses were built on the island. After the monarchy's restoration, the East India Company received a royal charter, which granted them the exclusive right to fortify and colonise the island. To honor the Duke of York, who later became James II of England, the fort was renamed James Fort, and the town was named Jamestown. This was done as a show of respect and recognition for the royal family and the Duke's status within it, as well as to solidify the connection between the English monarchy and the governance of the island. As a result, Saint Helena became an important strategic outpost for British trade during the Age of Exploration. Its location in the South Atlantic allowed the island to serve as a crucial stopover point for British ships traveling to and from the East Indies. The presence of Jamestown and James Fort showcased the influence of the English East India Company and the British Crown, both of which played a significant role in the administration of the island and its integration into the network of British colonies. The naming of the town and fort after James II serves as a reflection of the historical ties between Saint Helena, the English East India Company, and the British monarchy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner Movie plot: \\"The Loneliness Of The Long Distance Runner\\" begins with Colin Smith (Tom Courtenay) running, alone, along a bleak country road somewhere in rural England. In a brief voiceover, Colin tells us that running is the way his family has always coped with the world's troubles, but that in the end, the runner is always alone and cut off from spectators, left to deal with life on his own.Next, we see Colin in handcuffs with a group of other similarly encumbered young men. They are being taken to Ruxton Towers, what we would today term a medium security prison for young juvenile offenders. It is overseen by \\"The Governor\\" (Michael Redgrave), who believes that the hard work and discipline imposed on his charges will ultimately make them useful members of society. Colin, sullen and rebellious, immediately catches his eye as a test of his beliefs.An important part of The Governor's rehabilitation program is athletics, and he soon notices that Colin is a talented runner, able to easily outrun Ruxton's reigning long distance runner. As The Governor was once a runner himself, he is especially keen on Colin's abilities because for the first time, his charges have been invited to compete in a five-mile marathon against a nearby public school, Ranley, and its privileged students from upper class families. The Governor sees the invitation as an important way to demonstrate the success of his rehabilitation program.As the Governor takes Colin under his wing, offering him outdoor gardening work and eventually the freedom of practice runs outside Ruxton's barbed wire fences, we learn in a series of flashbacks how Colin came to be incarcerated. We see his difficult, economically strained family life in a lower-class workers' complex in industrial Nottingham.

Please answer the following question: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries.

A:","output":"A: Given the information in the paragraph, it can be inferred that France would likely have a lower labor supply in comparison to Germany.  The reasoning behind this inference is that France implemented a tax rate above the critical rate, which is often associated with pro-socialist governments. This higher tax rate potentially discourages businesses and individuals from expanding or investing in labor, resulting in a lower labor supply.

In Waters' absence, Gilmour had been recruiting musicians for a new project. Months previously, keyboardist Jon Carin had jammed with Gilmour at his Hookend studio, where he composed the chord progression that became \\"Learning to Fly\\", and so was invited onto the team. Gilmour invited Bob Ezrin (co-producer of 1979's The Wall) to help consolidate their material; Ezrin had turned down Waters' offer of a role on the development of his new solo album, Radio K.A.O.S., saying it was \\"far easier for Dave and I to do our version of a Floyd record\\". Ezrin arrived in England in mid-1986 for what Gilmour later described as \\"mucking about with a lot of demos\\".At this stage, there was no commitment to a new Pink Floyd release, and Gilmour maintained that the material might become his third solo album. CBS representative Stephen Ralbovsky hoped for a new Pink Floyd album, but in a meeting in November 1986, told Gilmour and Ezrin that the music \\"doesn't sound a fucking thing like Pink Floyd\\". Gilmour later said that the new project was difficult without Waters. He experimented with songwriters such as Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, but eventually settled on Anthony Moore, who was credited as co-writer of \\"Learning to Fly\\" and \\"On the Turning Away\\". Whereas many prior Pink Floyd albums are concept albums, Gilmour settled for the more conventional approach of a collection of songs without a thematic link.

We do not come across movies on brother-sister relationship in Indian cinema, or any other language or medium. This relationship has several aspects which have not been exploited in movies or novels. Typically, a sister is depicted as a pile-on who can be used for ransom in the climax. This movie treats the subject in an entirely different light. It is inspired by George Eliot's novel \\"The Mill on the Floss\\". The brother is very prosaic, all-good, the blue-eyed boy who is a conventionally good son and a favorite with his mother. The sister is romantic, wild and defiant of the unwritten rules of the society. In spite of this, the love of the brother-sister is the winner. This movie is about the love of the two siblings who are separated in childhood and revival of the same feeling when they meet years later. It is also the quest of the subdued brother to reunite with his sister who has chosen to be wild to defy the world. Although the movie and the novel are set about 3 centuries apart in two distant countries, yet the sentiments are the same and still hold true. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review can be described as appreciative and insightful, highlighting the emotional depth and the unique representation of the brother-sister relationship in the movie. The reviewer emphasizes the unexplored aspects of such relationships in cinema and the successful adaptation of George Eliot's novel \\"The Mill on the Floss\\".  The review also draws a comparison between the two main characters - the prosaic brother and the wild, defiant sister - and their complex bond. It outlines how their love for each other triumphs despite their differences and the obstacles they face. Additionally, the review praises the timeless theme of the brother-sister bond that transcends centuries and cultural boundaries, echoing similar values in both the movie and the novel. Overall, the sentiment of this review is positive, showcasing how the portrayal of an unconventional yet powerful brother-sister relationship creates a meaningful and emotionally rich cinematic experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He told the BBC's Andrew Marr show it would be \\"very difficult\\" for a public who voted to leave the European Union to have a leader who had opposed this. PM David Cameron announced on Friday that he would step down by October. He had urged the country to vote Remain in Thursday's referendum, but the Leave campaign won by 52% to 48%. Since Thursday's vote there has been intense speculation about who will replace Mr Cameron, and when and how the UK will begin formal negotiations to exit the EU. Meanwhile, potential leadership contender Boris Johnson has been meeting with Conservative MPs Jake Berry and Ben Wallace at his home. The BBC understands he also met with justice secretary and fellow Leave campaigner Michael Gove. Several sources have told BBC political editor Laura Kuennsberg that Mr Gove will co-chair Mr Johnson's leadership campaign, if he runs. Mr Johnson, who is widely expected to announce his leadership bid in the coming days, plans to run on a \\"unity\\" ticket, with a prominent Remainer part of the campaign leadership, our editor said. Meanwhile, Home Secretary Theresa May has been canvassing opinion among MPs and is expected to announce her leadership bid in the next couple of days. Our political editor said there was a growing sense among Tory MPs that only two or three names will enter the leadership contest because it is about choosing the next prime minister, rather than a wide field that would be narrowed down by the Parliamentary party. International Development secretary, Justine Greening, suggested today that Boris Johnson and Theresa May should come to a deal rather than having a drawn out contest at all. Mr Duncan Smith, who campaigned for Leave, said: \\"The government itself now had a view... which was to remain, and so now we need to change that position and actually deliver on this very clear mandate from the British people.\\" He said he was \\"incredibly sad\\" Mr Cameron had chosen to go as he wanted him to \\"remain to help stabilise the situation and get us moving\\". \\"But I do think it would be very, very difficult for the public who have voted for leaving the European Union to find that they then had a prime minister who actually was opposed to leaving the European Union. \\"So I think it is quite clear that - at least the leadership end of it - but I would like all the others, Remain and us, to come together.\\" Mr Duncan Smith also ruled himself out of the future Conservative leadership contest. He said the House of Commons had \\"an obligation to deliver on the British people's verdict\\" and progress with leaving the EU. \\"The Conservative party is in a majority in the House of Commons and my view about this is there are also a number of Labour MPs who are very clear they want this to be delivered on,\\" he said. When questioned about the Leave campaign's assertion that leaving the EU would free up Â£350m a week extra to spend on the NHS, Mr Duncan Smith said the NHS would receive \\"the lion's share\\". \\"It is not a promise broken, I never said that during the course of the election,\\" he said. \\"What I said was we would be able to spend the lion's share of that money, now the government is now able to spend, so people can say that there is more money available now for the NHS, categorically more, which is what's required and that's the key point.\\" Asked if UKIP leader Nigel Farage - a key Leave figure - would be involved in the cross-party exit negotiations with Brussels, Mr Duncan Smith suggested the party's sole MP Douglas Carswell would be consulted. \\"There is a UKIP MP who is part of that process in a parliamentary sense, and I'm very happy to discuss... with UKIP about what their expectations are, but the government itself, right now, actually dictates how this will happen,\\" he said. On immigration, he said the Conservative government had to honour its manifesto pledge to bring net migration - the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving - down to below 100,000. Mr Duncan Smith said: \\"I said consistently throughout that we need to get control of our borders and the only way to do that is to leave the European Unionâ€¦ \\"Once we do that we are in a much stronger position to achieve that objective of bringing down migration to tens of thousands within this Parliament - I will stand by that.\\" This article was about:","output":"This article is about the aftermath of the UK's referendum on leaving the European Union, with a focus on the Conservative party's leadership contest following David Cameron's resignation announcement.

Summarize this article: The former Millwall man struck in the 53rd minute after James Coppinger's pass and it was enough to earn Darren Ferguson's men their second win of the campaign. Doncaster dominated most of the first half with Andy Williams forcing a fine save from on-loan Everton goalkeeper Russell Griffiths in the 16th minute. Cheltenham relied heavily on counter-attacks, with Harry Pell setting up James Dayton for a chance which he curled just wide and Billy Waters forcing Marko Marosi into an one-handed stop before the break. Cheltenham improved in the second half, bidding to protect an unbeaten home record stretching back to last September when they were beaten 1-0 by Tranmere in the National League. Koby Arthur saw a shot blocked on the edge of the box and the on-loan Birmingham forward also sliced a shot wide of the near post - but Cheltenham are still waiting for their first win since returning to the EFL.

The equation given is: 568*y - 5218*y = -97650 Step 1: To simplify this, let's combine like terms on the left-hand side of the equation, those being 568*y and -5218*y. Subtracting 5218 from 568, we get -4650. So the equation simplifies to -4650*y = -97650. Step 2: Next we need to solve for y. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is -4650. This will isolate y on one side of the equation, giving us the solution. Mathematically, this looks like: (-97650) / (-4650) = y. Step 3: Performing this division gives us a solution of y = 21.

Summarize this article: The Price of Football surveys the cost of the cheapest and most expensive match-day and season tickets, as well as the cost of a pie, programme, cup of tea and adult and junior replica shirts. The calculator helps you navigate through this data with ease. Simply enter the name of your club and you'll have all the key data presented and put into context for you. In addition you can work out how much support of your team is costing you. Simply enter your ticket cost, food, drink and programme spend, plus how many replica shirts you buy and the amount you pay on TV sports subscriptions. The calculator will then compare that to a number of costs, such as player wages, transfer fees and other leisure pursuits. Throughout the calculator, we compare how various costs have changed using data from previous BBC Price of Football studies. Some data comparisons are not available for clubs not included in previous years. The 'price of a goal' is calculated by dividing the cost of a club's cheapest season ticket last season by the number of goals scored by the team at home in the same season. Some comparisons are not available for clubs not surveyed last season, or promoted to the National League. Programme costs were not collected from European clubs, as many do not publish match-day programmes in the same way as UK teams. The BBC contacted 227 clubs for the study. Of those, 200 were in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales and another 27 in Europe. The data was collated and verified by BBC Sport journalists. Swansea are omitted from the survey and calculator because they declined to take part. All ticket prices refer to an adult ticket when bought individually. The match-day ticket prices quoted refer to high and low prices available on the day of a game, to reflect the price for fans who decide on match day they would like to attend a game, and not individual offers. Match-day costs reflect categories that are registered with the relevant league, rather than individual, or one-off, offers. The season ticket prices quoted refer to the cheapest possible ticket (including early bird offers), and the most expensive season ticket. Replica shirt prices are listed according to the official cost in the club shop or website - rather than separate retailers.

Around 1560 Russia interacted with Kabardia but thereafter left the region alone except for the Caspian coast. In 1800 Russia annexed eastern Georgia and by 1806 held Transcaucasia from the Black Sea to the Caspian. Since Russia also claimed the steppes north of the mountains its claims were divided by the free mountaineers of the Caucasus. Russia had to hold the Georgian Military Highway in the center so the war against the mountaineers was divided into eastern and western parts. Circassia  refers to a region the majority of whose inhabitants before the 1860s were the Adygey  ethnic group, known to the West as Circassians. This region consisted for the most part of the region between the westward flowing Kuban River to the north and the Caucasus mountain range to the south, although the Kuban River constituted only part of the northern boundary. The Circassians were never politically united for a long period. The western bulk of Circassia, they belonged to any of about ten tribes, living in communities headed by chieftains. In the east of Circassia were two feudal polities, Greater Kabardá and Lesser Kabardá. In the late 1550s, the ruler of one of the Kabardás, Temryuk , struck a politico-military alliance with Tsar Ivan IV of Russia , for mutual assistance against expansionist attacks by the Persian and Ottoman Empires. In this period of history, the Circassians were Christians; Islam did not begin to penetrate Circassia until the following century.

The Magic of \\"Therefore\\" By nature, \\"therefore\\" is a conjunctive adverb that effectively conveys cause and effect relationships. When used appropriately, it can create a natural flow in your writing, providing readers with a clear understanding of the logical progression of your ideas. Moreover, it can replace other transition words and phrases with parallel meanings, simplifying your writing and making it more concise. Take, for example, the sentence: \\"The evidence suggests a strong correlation between poor air quality and respiratory health problems; therefore, improving air quality should be a priority for public health policy.\\" In this instance, \\"therefore\\" demonstrates the cause and effect relationship between air quality and respiratory health, tying the two concepts together and enabling the reader to make a logical connection between them without any ambiguity. Using \\"Therefore\\" to Replace Parallel Meaning Transitions Several transition words and phrases convey cause and effect relationships, such as \\"as a result,\\" \\"consequently,\\" \\"due to,\\" \\"owing to,\\" and \\"thus.\\" While some variety is desirable in writing, using \\"therefore\\" to replace these parallel meanings can help streamline your text and create a more coherent writing style. Consider the following sentences: 1. Jane faced numerous obstacles throughout her journey, and as a result, she learned valuable lessons about self-reliance. 2. John faced many difficulties due to his lack of preparation, which ultimately led to his failure. By incorporating \\"therefore\\" into these sentences, we improve the flow and coherence of the text: 1. Jane faced numerous obstacles throughout her journey; therefore, she learned valuable lessons about self-reliance. 2. John faced many difficulties due to his lack of preparation; therefore, he ultimately failed. Including \\"Therefore\\" to Improve Sentence Flow The proper placement of \\"therefore\\" can dramatically enhance the flow of your writing by guiding readers through a logical progression of ideas. When using \\"therefore,\\" it is essential to place it in a position where it will effectively signal a cause and effect relationship between two clauses or sentences. For example: - Incorrect: \\"Therefore, Sarah skipped breakfast, she was running late for work.\\" - Correct: \\"Sarah was running late for work; therefore, she skipped breakfast.\\" In the correct example, \\"therefore\\" links the cause (running late for work) with the effect (skipping breakfast), creating a clear and logical connection for the reader. Conclusion Mastering the art of using \\"therefore\\" in your writing can have a significant impact on the overall quality and readability of your work. By incorporating this powerful word into your writing style and replacing parallel meaning transition words and phrases, you can successfully establish cause and effect relationships, improve sentence flow, and create a more coherent and logical text for your readers to enjoy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Test sentence: \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence?","output":"Yes, the test sentence \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" is a correct grammatical English sentence. Let's break down its components to understand why it is grammatically correct: 1. Subject: \\"He\\" – This is a singular third person pronoun, which serves as the subject of the sentence.  2. Auxiliary verb: \\"is\\" – The verb \\"is\\" is contracted with the subject to form \\"He's\\". \\"Is\\" is the third person singular form of the verb \\"to be\\" and is an auxiliary verb, which is used to provide additional information about the main verb. In this case, \\"is\\" works as a linking verb to connect the subject \\"he\\" to the predicate (a description or action related to the subject). 3. Adjective + Adverb: \\"reliable enough\\" – \\"reliable\\" is an adjective that describes the subject \\"he\\", and \\"enough\\" is an adverb that modifies the adjective \\"reliable\\". When \\"enough\\" is placed after an adjective, it indicates a sufficient or adequate level of the quality expressed by that adjective. Thus, \\"reliable enough\\" means that the subject possesses a satisfactory level of reliability. 4. Noun: \\"man\\" – This is the noun complement that further specifies the subject \\"he\\". It is connected to the subject by the linking verb \\"is\\" and provides additional information about the subject, describing what or who \\"he\\" is. The sentence follows the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) order, which is common in English sentences. The subject is \\"He\\", the verb is \\"is\\" (in its contracted form), and the object (or noun complement) is \\"man\\". The adjective \\"reliable\\" and the adverb \\"enough\\" together function as an attribute complement in the sentence, providing information about the subject. In conclusion, the test sentence \\"He's a reliable enough man.\\" is a grammatically correct English sentence, as it follows standard English grammar rules, including a subject, verb, and object, along with appropriate modifiers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On 16 June 1808, the townsfolk — armed with little more than ancient swords, spears, and stones — attacked and captured the local French garrison. It's said that a party of local men then set sail from Olhão all the way to Brazil, without maps or navigational aids, to tell the king of the insurrection. The real battle, however, was waged under the leadership of the Duke of Wellington, whose coalition forces expelled the French after two years of bitter fighting. The war left Portugal further weakened, and in 1822 its major empire outpost, Brazil, declared independence. At the same time, a dispute over the crown continually raged between Pedro IV, the absentee monarch who preferred to reign as Emperor of Brazil rather than return to Portugal, and his brother Miguel. The power struggle, with strong overtones of absolutism versus liberalism, excited the interest and intervention of other powers. With British help, Pedro defeated Miguel off Cape St. Vincent in 1833, and his expeditionary force marched to Lisbon. Pedro took the throne, though armed struggle continued for months and the lingering bitterness long after that. By 1892 Portugal, racked by wars and the continuing expense of maintaining its African colonies (including those of Mozambique and Angola), declared itself bankrupt. The seeds of discontent with absolutist rule were sown. Kingdom's End Bloodshed would haunt the remaining years of the Portuguese monarchy. On 1 February 1908, the royal family was riding in an open carriage along the Lisbon river front plaza, Terreiro do Paço, when an assassin opened fire and killed King Carlos and the heir to the throne, Prince Luis Filipe. The prince's younger brother, Prince Manuel, was also hit, but he survived and was thus propelled to the throne at the tender age of 19. Amid republican agitation, a surprise uprising led by elements within the armed forces deposed Manuel in 1910. Having ruled for less than three years, Manuel died in exile in 1932 in England. The sudden end of more than seven centuries of monarchy brought confusion and crisis to the country. Presidents and prime ministers were ushered into and out of office an unbelievable 45 times between 1910 and 1926, until a military revolution suspended Portugal's problematic democracy.  After reading the above, is \\"16 years\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How many years passed between Portugal declaring bankruptcy and the assassination of King Carlos and Prince Luis Filipe?\\"?","output":"No, \\"16 years\\" is not the correct answer to the question.

Question: Q: Intensity is defined to be the power per unit area carried by a what?    Choices:  - filament  - shift  - wire  - wave  A: Answer:","output":"Intensity is defined to be the power per unit area carried by a wave. To provide a more detailed understanding of intensity, let's break down the concept.  In the context of physics, intensity is a measure of how much energy is being transmitted through a specific area in a given period of time. This concept is vital across a wide range of applications, such as optics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. A wave is a disturbance or oscillation that travels through space and matter, transferring energy from one point to another. Some common examples of waves include sound waves, electromagnetic waves (such as light, radio, and microwaves), and mechanical waves (like water waves or waves traveling through a rope). The power of a wave refers to the rate at which it carries energy, and is usually expressed in watts (W). Mathematically, power (P) can be defined as the work done (W) per unit time (t): P = W/t When discussing intensity, we're interested in how this power is distributed across a given area. For instance, in the case of sound waves, the intensity of the sound would depend on how much energy is being transferred through the air over a certain area. This area could be the surface of a microphone, eardrum, or the walls of a room. Mathematically, intensity (I) is calculated as the power (P) transmitted per unit area (A): I = P/A Units for intensity are typically watts per square meter (W/m²). Different types of waves may exhibit different intensity distributions. For example, in optics, laser light can have a very high intensity due to the small area over which the energy is concentrated, whereas sunlight spreads its energy over a much larger area, resulting in a lower intensity. In summary, intensity is defined as the power per unit area carried by a wave. This concept is crucial in understanding how waves transmit energy across various media and is applicable to multiple fields, such as acoustics, optics, and electromagnetism. By understanding intensity and how it relates to waves, we can better comprehend and control the energy transfer processes in various applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits. Charles Ares, a member of the board of directors in the 1950s, said the office was kind of a charity operation.

Green, for example, tries to show the quality of a product: how good it is for us or for our environment. It also suggests that the product is healthier, has less fat and maybe fewer calories. Red, on the other hand is an aggressive color that is often used for packaging food. Red wants us to become hungry or thirsty. Purple is a kind of color that is often seen as royal. It indicates that it is something special. Producers use purple to show that something is of good quality. Blue is not very often found in food packaging because there are not very many foods that have a blue color. Colors can also have different meaning in different cultures and countries. For example, while the color white is used in many Western countries to represent purity and innocence, it is seen as a symbol of mourning in many Eastern countries. The Egyptian pharaohs  wore white crowns. A white sale is a sale of sheets, towels, and other bed and bath items. A white flag is the universal symbol for truce . A white elephant is a rare, pale elephant sacred  to the people of India, Thailand, Burma, and Sri Lanka. In these countries, something that is a white elephant is either a possession that costs more than it is worth to keep or an item that the owner doesn't want but can't get rid of. Consumers are aware that certain foods must have certain colors. When Pepsi brought out a crystal clear cola in 1992, it thought that consumers would buy it because clear meant pure and healthy. After a few months Pepsi found out that a cola had to be dark-colored. Crystal Pepsi failed and the company pulled it off the market. Advertising professionals often need to look at a product through the consumers' eyes when choosing a color. The right packaging colors can truly improve the sales of a product but choosing...

Back at their house by the cemetery, Paul and Chloe found Bee in her room, what Paul referred to as her sanctum sanctorum - although no one else ever got the joke, and he refused to explain the comic book reference. As always, lighting was minimal (as opposed to Bee's workshop out behind the house, which was flooded with fluorescents). A bank of TV sets and computer monitors covered one whole wall, arranged on a precarious system of metal shelves that Bee had installed herself. A low, flat coffee table squatted below the glowing displays, supporting three keyboards, a bank of video editing tools and four different phone carriages. Bee sat in her accustomed place - in the midst of a pile of cushions on the floor, fiddling with a mouse in one hand and typing on one of the keyboards while she talked quietly into her headset. Paul and Chloe didn't bother to knock as they came in - Bee already knew they were there. Paul glanced at one of the screens mounted on the wall. Its display, divided into four quadrants, showed various images from inside the house, including the front door they'd just come through and the stairs they'd just climbed. The screen next to it - which Paul himself had salvaged from a bar on Duval that'd recently renovated into a finedining restaurant - showed images from four other cameras that covered the house's exterior. Nothing happened within fifty yards of their Crew's house that Bee didn't see, and if she had her way, that omniscience would soon extend to cover the entire island. \\"So, Bee, how goes Project Big Brother?\\" Paul asked. \\"I wish you wouldn't call it that,\\" she replied. \\"Sorry, but I have to call it something.\\" \\"You could call it something nice. Big Brother sounds so mean.\\" \\"What's mean about a reality show?\\" said Paul, joking. \\"What isn't bad about a reality show?\\" countered Chloe, stepping in to defend her friend.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve -1344 = 41*j + 39*j - 24*j for j. What is the solution?","output":"Okay, let's solve the math problem step by step. We have an equation: -1344 = 41*j + 39*j -24*j First, let's combine those j's that are being multiplied by those numbers (41, 39, and -24). You can imagine this like having 41 apples, 39 apples, and taking away 24 apples. How many apples do you have left? 41 apples + 39 apples - 24 apples = (41 + 39 - 24) apples Now let's add the numbers: 41 + 39 = 80 80 - 24 = 56 So our new equation will be: -1344 = 56 * j Now we need to figure out how many times we have to multiply the 'j' with 56 to get -1344. You can think of this as sharing -1344 pieces of candy evenly among 56 kids, and we need to find out how many pieces of candy each kid gets. To do this, we'll divide -1344 by 56. -1344 ÷ 56 = -24 So our solution is: j = -24 This means that when we multiply 56 by -24, we get -1344."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The street lights were shining, causing rather sad-feeling. I wandered aimlessly. A young father who held a child in his arms walked past me. I felt as if I saw my childhood from another space: happy and carefree. But now... I don't know whether it is because I have grown up or because Dad is getting old. We differ in our ways of thinking.

It feels like there is an iron door between us that can never be opened. I wandered in the streets, without a destination in mind. My heart was frozen on this hot summer night. As I walked on there were fewer and fewer people on the streets, until I had only the street lights to keep me company. When I finally reached the high-rise apartment block in which I lived, I saw that the light was still on. I thought to myself: \\"Is Father waiting for me, or is he still angry with me?\\" In fact, it was nothing. Perhaps, Dad was throwing away some of his old stamps.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If your parents don’t seem comfortable letting you go to homecoming, ask them to explain why. They may be concerned about drugs and alcohol, or they may be worried about who’s driving you. Listen to them calmly and patiently, so they have a chance to express themselves.  If you're not sure how to start the conversation, you might say, \\"I know that you're unsure about homecoming. What are you concerned about?\\" It may be difficult, but don’t interrupt your parents when they’re talking. Be respectful and show that you take their concerns seriously. Once you know what your parents’ concerns or objections are, you can try to find ways to address them. In most cases, that means being willing to compromise. For example, they might not want you to go to the post-homecoming activities, so agree that you’ll just go to the dance and come straight home. They may be concerned about your transportation for the evening, so you might suggest that they drive you to and from the dance. Find a way to make you and your parents both at least a little bit happy. Another way to compromise with your parents about homecoming is to suggest periodic check-ins over the course of the night. For example, you might agree to text or call when you arrive at the dance, at some point in the middle, and right before you leave. If you’re headed to post-homecoming activities, you can check in again when you arrive at the locale and when you’re on your way home. If you behave in a mature, responsible way, your parents are more likely to trust you and allow you to go to homecoming. Make a habit of always obeying your curfew, so they know that you'll be home when you say that you will. If they give you chores around the house, do them without your parents having to remind you. You should also be kind to your siblings, and try to resolve conflicts with them without having your parents intervene. Your performance in school can also help convince your parents to let you go.  Work to get good grades so they know that you take your responsibilities seriously. If your parents ultimately decide not to allow you to go to homecoming, accept the decision calmly and maturely. Avoid whining or yelling because you didn’t get what you wanted. That will only make your parents angry, so they’re less likely to allow you to attend other events in the future. It can also help convince them that they made the right decision. If you feel yourself getting upset about your parents’ decision, take a moment to count to 10 in your head. That can often help you calm down. Summary:","output":"If your parents don't want you to go to homecoming, ask them why and listen to their reasons. Be respectful and try to find a solution that makes both you and your parents happy, like agreeing to check in with them during the night. Show them you are responsible by doing chores, being kind to siblings, and getting good grades. If they still say no, stay calm and don't get upset, as it could make things worse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Premise: Two women holding checkered flags near an orange car. The presence of checkered flags and a car might hint at a car race event. Checkered flags are commonly used in auto racing to indicate the start or end of a race, and two women holding them could signify they are either \\"grid girls\\" or race officials responsible for signaling those crucial race moments. Furthermore, bright-colored cars like orange are often used in races to make them more visually distinctive on the track. Hypothesis: Women are holding flags, ready to wave them for the car race. Seeing two women with checkered flags near an orange car might suggest that they are preparing for a car race event. However, the information provided in the premise is limited, and not enough to definitively confirm that the circumstance is related to a car race. There are possible alternative explanations for the given premise: 1. The women could be promoting an event or a car show: The women holding the checkered flags could be working as brand ambassadors, promoting an automobile event, or drawing attention to a new car launch. 2. A marketing photoshoot: The mentioned situation could also be a staged photo for a marketing campaign related to racing, automobile products, or any car-related services. 3. A thematic party or gathering: The women might be involved in a car-racing-themed social event or a party where the checkered flags and the orange car are elements of the party décor. In summary, while the hypothesis is plausible based on the information available in the premise, we cannot definitively conclude that it is an accurate portrayal of the situation. The context described in the premise provides clues that might lead us to believe that the hypothesis could be true, but we would require additional specific information to confirm it with certainty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"To find the correct answer, we will use the provided explanation. The explanation states that a more gradual slope requires less input force and provides greater mechanical advantage. Step 1: Identify the given ramp angles - 25 degrees and 15 degrees. Step 2: Compare the angles - The 15-degree angle is more gradual compared to the 25-degree angle, and vice versa for the 25-degree inclined plane or ramp. Step 3: Apply the explanation - As the more gradual slope requires less input force, it means a steeper slope or ramp angle requires more input force. Step 4: Select the correct answer - In this case, the 25-degree angle is steeper than the 15-degree angle; therefore, it requires more input force.

Kate is a bike-maintenance instructor who realized she is no longer in love with her boyfriend of five years, Ollie. Kate and Ollie have been together since high school. Kate finds out she is pregnant, which complicates the whole situation because she is not sure if she truly does want to breakup with Ollie or not. However, Kate does not want to have a baby, but does not want to wait weeks for a clinical abortion, so her herbalist friend, Chloe tells her that being on a parsley diet can make you have a natural abortion.

Think of the savings in terms of fuel bills and unfriendly emissions. Such houses in fact exist, called \\"passive houses\\". The concept of these highly energy-efficient buildings took root in the 1990s, before slowly consolidating as a niche construction   concept in the 2000s. Are passive houses now actively moving into the mainstream as sustainable buildings? For Brian McGarry, an economics lecturer who built a family house based on passive housing criteria in the Pyrenees this year, the arguments look convincing. As his first full winter in the low energy house draws in, we asked him to keep us informed. Do passive houses work? I had never heard of a passive house in February 2012, when I purchased a plot of land. Nor did I expect that I would be persuaded to build a pre-constructed, custom-designed house based on energy-efficient passive house criteria. It promised to be easier and quicker to build, cheaper to run, and more comfortable to live in. The objective was to incorporate the fundamental concepts of passive energy management into my project: an airtight and highly insulated building envelope; large southfacing double or triple-glazed windows (if possible, filled with argon gas) that passively capture the energy of the sun; a heat recovery ventilation system to provide fresh air; and a simple, low-cost heating system consisting of a modern wood-burning stove, a bathroom heater and a portable radiator backup for when the sun doesn't shine and temperatures decline. No significant limitations were placed on the design, and it had excellent environmental credentials. Moreover, the cost was no more than a conventional build. After six months in use, the house is proving to be both cheap to run and remarkably comfortable-staying cool in the hot summer was effortless, as long as the windows were shuttered or shaded from the sun. Nowstaying warm in the cold, high-altitude December climate also seems easy, so far. Winter arrived in force in the... How did Brian McGarry find his self-built passive house?

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass.

The Cambrian is a major division of the geologic timescale that begins about 541.0 ± 1.0 Ma. Cambrian continents are thought to have resulted from the breakup of a Neoproterozoic supercontinent called Pannotia. The waters of the Cambrian period appear to have been widespread and shallow. Continental drift rates may have been anomalously high. Laurentia, Baltica and Siberia remained independent continents following the break-up of the supercontinent of Pannotia. Gondwana started to drift toward the South Pole. Panthalassa covered most of the southern hemisphere, and minor oceans included the Proto-Tethys Ocean, Iapetus Ocean and Khanty Ocean.

However, it does mention that the breakup of Pannotia led to the formation of Cambrian continents around 541 million years ago.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Fred was a good athlete in his youth, and so was Vic. Fred started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's. His cholesterol is very high now. Vic became a vegan later,and he is in a very good physical shape.  But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  What is an answer for this question: Which friend had a decreased blood flow to the heart? A:","output":"Based on the given information and background, it is most likely that Fred, who started eating junk food and other fatty foods in his 30's and now has very high cholesterol, experienced a decrease in blood flow to the heart. This is due to the role of cholesterol in the development of atherosclerosis, as described in the background. When Fred consumed excessive amounts of junk food and fatty foods, his cholesterol levels increased. High cholesterol is one of the factors that contribute to atherosclerosis, a disorder in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. Over time, these deposits form plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through blood vessels. Restricted blood flow in the coronary arteries can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. In more severe cases, it can result in a complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart, causing a heart attack, which can lead to significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, and in some cases, death. On the other hand, Vic became a vegan later in life and is now in excellent physical shape. By choosing a plant-based diet, he likely eliminated many sources of unhealthy fats and cholesterol, reducing his risk of developing atherosclerosis and, subsequently, having decreased blood flow to the heart. In conclusion, Fred, with his unhealthy dietary habits and high cholesterol levels, is the friend who likely experienced a decreased blood flow to the heart. Adopting a healthier lifestyle, like Vic's vegan diet, can help reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and maintain overall heart health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Select your answer: was the movie seen positively or negatively based on the preceding review? Options:  a). negative;  b). positive;","output":"Based on the preceding review, the movie was seen negatively. The review refers to it as a \\"mediocre fable from Burkina Faso,\\" which suggests that the critic did not find it an outstanding or impressive film. The word \\"mediocre\\" specifically indicates that the film was average or unexceptional, with the reviewer seemingly unimpressed by the story or its presentation. Option (a) \\"negative,\\" is the correct answer in this case, implying that the movie has not received a favorable review. The reviewer's choice of language suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction with the film's quality, and there is a strong indication that it has not met their expectations. Furthermore, it gives the impression that the movie simply did not leave a lasting or favorable impact on the critic, tarnishing its overall reputation. On the other hand, option (b) \\"positive,\\" does not apply in this situation. If the movie was seen positively, the reviewer would likely use words like \\"brilliant,\\" \\"captivating,\\" or \\"remarkable.\\" Those words would suggest a better reception of the movie and indicate that it managed to leave a strong impression on the audience.

The school had only three rooms, one for Grades 1, 2 and 3, and the other for Grades 4, 5 and 6. There was a third one for me. The children welcomed me warmly on my first day. They asked me a lot of questions, and I told them stories about myself and my life in Shanghai. The next day, I gave them a test to find out their level . To my surprise, though the test was very easy, over half of the students failed it, yet they all wanted to learn new things. I knew they needed me.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa). The term is sometimes used for the purposes of grouping countries in statistics.  - Stepanavan, is a town in the Lori Province of Armenia. It is located 139 km north of the capital Yerevan and 24 km north of the provincial centre Vanadzor, in the centre of Yerevan-Tbilisi highway. As of the 2011 census, the population of the town is 13,086.

Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - Spitak, is a town in the northern Lori Province of Armenia.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.  After reading the above, is \\"Japanese\\" the correct answer to the question \\"What are some of the languages are now spoken by employees of the NLS?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"Japanese\\" is the correct answer to the question, as the text indicates that Neighborhood Legal Services (NLS) has expanded their capacity to include staff who are proficient in a number of Asian languages including Japanese.  The text details how NLS, an organization dedicated to providing free legal services to the economically disadvantaged, has broadened its presence in the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys where there is a significant Asian population. The non-English speaking Asian population traditionally faced several barriers to accessing such services including language limitations, cultural isolation, and the legal service providers' own lack of cultural expertise.  However, in response to the particular needs of these communities, NLS has sought to enhance its language capabilities as part of its service expansion. As NLS executive director, Neal Dubovitz, specified, there was an objective to increase language diversity comparable to the Spanish-English bilingual capability which is now common in their legal offices. This expansion incentive gave rise to the hiring of around 13 attorneys capable of speaking different Asian languages. Attorney Rebecca Yee lists these languages as Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, and Tagalog.  One case illustrates Family Law Attorney Irene Mak who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin, and Thai and was hired to work on domestic violence cases. Mak's own experience, her zeal to serve the Asian community, along with her language skills, epitomize the broader goal of the NLS; to diversify and expand their services to cater to diverse communities and cultures.  Therefore, with the inclusion of Japanese-speaking staff as a part of their expansion, NLS has made an important step towards enhancing accessibility and inclusivity in their services for the Asian communities in the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys. So, \\"Japanese\\" is indeed a correct reference to the languages now spoken by employees of the NLS."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

But when bad weather gives you trouble, can you still make it before the bell rings? In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for students and everyone else. When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces    in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe  too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's an idea: Ask you parents to help you plant some trees this spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them from cutting. Question: Which is not stated in the passage?  _   . - Trees can help keep enough rain water - More trees need to be planted - Some people are doing harm to the environment - Sandstorms are the main cause of asthma The answer is:","output":"- Sandstorms are the main cause of asthma"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Yes, both Zorro and Snow Dogs are produced by American companies. Zorro, which is a fictional character created by Johnston McCulley in 1919, has been featured in numerous movies and television series produced by various American production companies.

Which case would see smaller opportunity for food sources, case A or case B?  Greg was studying behavior of different organisms. He noticed that some organisms were showing inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case A. Then he noticed some other organisms didn't show any inquiline behavior. He noted that behavior as case B. He was astonished by the complicated interactions among organisms.  Hint: Ants form symbiotic associations with a range of species, including other ant species, other insects, plants, and fungi. They also are preyed on by many animals and even certain fungi. Some arthropod species spend part of their lives within ant nests, either preying on ants, their larvae, and eggs, consuming the food stores of the ants, or avoiding predators. These inquilines may bear a close resemblance to ants. The nature of this ant mimicry (myrmecomorphy) varies, with some cases involving Batesian mimicry, where the mimic reduces the risk of predation. Others show Wasmannian mimicry, a form of mimicry seen only in inquilines. The answer to this question is:","output":"Case A would see smaller opportunity for food sources. In case A, organisms exhibit inquiline behavior, which means they live within the ant nests and can have a complex relationship with the host ants. These organisms may compete for the same food sources as the ants (e.g., larvae, eggs, and food stores), or they may depend on the ants for their own survival (e.g., through Wasmannian mimicry). On the other hand, in case B, organisms do not exhibit inquiline behavior and therefore do not rely on the ants' resources as a food source or as a means for survival. These organisms would have access to a wider range of food sources available in their environment, which would ultimately present more opportunities for food sources when compared to case A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Page Content      WASHINGTON – The U.S. Department of Treasury today imposed sanctions on two al-Qa'ida supporters based in Qatar and Yemen. Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi (Nu'aymi) and \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani (Humayqani) were named as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs) pursuant to Executive Order (E.O.) 13224. Nu'aymi was designated for providing financial support to al-Qa'ida, Asbat al-Ansar, al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and al-Shabaab, and Humayqani was designated for providing financial support to and acting on behalf of al-Qa'ida in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP).      \\"It is essential for countries to take proactive steps to disrupt terrorist financing, especially where al-Qa'ida and its affiliates are concerned. We will continue to work with our partners in the Gulf to ensure that charitable donations are not used to support violence in the region or elsewhere,\\" said Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence David S. Cohen.      Nu'aymi is a Qatar-based terrorist financier and facilitator who has provided money and material support and conveyed communications to al-Qa'ida and its affiliates in Syria, Iraq, Somalia and Yemen for more than a decade. He was considered among the most prominent Qatar-based supporters of Iraqi Sunni extremists. Humayqani has used his Yemen-based charity as a cover for funneling financial support to AQAP and has frequently traveled throughout the Arabian Peninsula while conducting business for AQAP. During political unrest in Yemen, Humayqani reportedly assisted AQAP in gaining a foothold and safe haven in al-Bayda' Governorate, Yemen and as of mid-2011 served as the acting AQAP amir there. Both Nu'aymi and Humayqani are at the center of global support networks that fund and facilitate terrorism.      As a result of today's designation, any assets these individuals may have under U.S. jurisdiction are frozen, and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from doing business with them.      'Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi      In 2013, Nu'aymi ordered the transfer of nearly 600,000 to al-Qa'ida via al-Qa'ida's representative in Syria, Abu-Khalid al-Suri, and intended to transfer nearly 50,000 more.      Nu'aymi has facilitated significant financial support to al-Qa'ida in Iraq, and served as an interlocutor between al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders and Qatar-based donors. Nu'aymi reportedly oversaw the transfer of over 2 million per month to al-Qa'ida in Iraq for a period of time. He also served as an interlocutor between these Qatari nationals and al-Qa'ida in Iraq leaders. Between 2003 and 2004, Nu'aymi provided support to the Iraqi insurgency more broadly and served as a conduit for their broadcast materials to media outlets.      Nu'aymi as of mid-2012 provided approximately 250,000 to two U.S.-designated al-Shabaab figures, Mukhtar Robow and Sheikh Hassan Aweys Ali, the latter of whom is also designated by the United Nations (UN). Also in 2012, Nuaymi provided financial support to a charity headed by Yemen-based Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad 'Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani, who channeled funding to AQAP.      \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani      In his capacity as the head of a Yemen-based charity, Humayqani has used his status in the charitable community to fundraise and has provided some of that funding to AQAP and has facilitated financial transfers from AQAP supporters in Saudi Arabia to Yemen in support of AQAP operations. As of 2012, Humayqani was an important figure within AQAP and reportedly had a relationship with important AQAP leaders. Humayqani and others in March 2012 reportedly orchestrated an AQAP attack on a Yemeni Republican Guard base in al-Bayda' Governorate, Yemen. The attack employed multiple vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices and killed seven. He is suspected to have recruited individuals to AQAP who were involved in a plot to assassinate Yemeni officials.      Humayqani has provided financial support and other services to AQAP and acted for or on behalf of the group. He has represented AQAP in meetings with Yemeni officials to negotiate the release of Yemeni soldiers held by AQAP and worked with AQAP operatives to coordinate the movement of AQAP fighters within Yemen. Humayqani has directed a group of armed AQAP associates that intended to carry out attacks on Yemeni government facilities and institutions, including a Yemeni government building in al-Bayda Governorate. He has also recruited individuals in Sana, Yemen on behalf of AQAP in support of AQAP efforts in southern Yemen.      Along with the U.S. and UN designated cleric Shaykh Abd al-Majid al-Zindani, he has issued religious guidance in support of AQAP operations. Humayqani and AQAP leadership have planned to establish a new political party in Yemen, which AQAP planned to use as a cover for the recruitment and training of fighters and a means to attract broader support. AQAP leadership decided that Humayani would play a public role as a leader and spokesman for the new political party.

The 59-year-old educator had a stellar résumé that included extensive fundraising experience and years of work with international human rights groups.      But one apparent accomplishment was omitted from the list: According to U.S. officials, Nu’aymi also was working secretly as a financier for al-Qaeda, funneling millions of dollars to the terrorist group’s affiliates in Syria and Iraq even as he led campaigns in Europe for greater freedoms for Muslims.      Nu’aymi was one of two men identified by Treasury Department officials last week as major financial backers of al-Qaeda and its regional chapters across the Middle East. Although U.S. officials routinely announce steps to disrupt terrorist financing networks, the individuals named in the latest case are far from ordinary. Both men have served as advisers to government-backed foundations in Qatar and have held high-profile positions with international human rights groups. The second man, a Yemeni, is heavily involved in his country’s U.S.-backed political transition.      Their alleged dual roles — promoting humanitarian causes and civil rights while simultaneously supporting extremist groups — reflect a growing challenge for counterterrorism officials attempting to monitor the torrents of cash flowing to Islamist rebel groups in Syria, current and former U.S. officials say.      “Individuals with one foot in the legitimate world and another in the realm of terrorist financing provide al-Qaeda with a cloak of legitimacy,” said Juan Zarate, a former Treasury Department official and author of “Treasury’s Wars,” a book that describes U.S. efforts to penetrate terrorist financial networks. Zarate said such cases greatly complicate the “financial diplomacy” involved in attempting to disrupt terrorist support networks, especially private funding from wealthy Persian Gulf donors seeking to help Syria’s rebels.      Despite attempts by gulf states to crack down on jihadist financial networks, former and current U.S. officials have described a surge in private support for Islamist extremists in Syria, particularly in Qatar and Kuwait.      The Obama administration has repeatedly urged both countries to rein in private donations to jihadists, while acknowledging that new tactics, including the widespread use of Twitter and other social media, make fundraising more difficult to track.      “It is essential for countries to take proactive steps to disrupt terrorist financing, especially where al-Qaeda and its affiliates are concerned,” David S. Cohen, the Treasury Department’s undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, said in announcing financial restrictions against Nu’aymi and the Yemeni national, Abd al-Wahhab al-Humayqani. Cohen said the Obama administration would continue to work with the gulf region’s capitals to “ensure that charitable donations are not used to support violence.”      The administration’s action last week named both men as “specially designated global terrorists,” a determination that allows U.S. officials to freeze their financial assets and bar American citizens and companies from doing business with them. Treasury Department documents alleged that both men used their charity work to conceal efforts to raise millions of dollars for al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, from Syria to the Horn of Africa.      The naming of the two officials raised eyebrows in Qatar and Yemen, where supporters viewed the allegations as politically motivated. Both men have been prominent critics of U.S. counter­terrorism policies, particularly the use of drone strikes against terrorism suspects.      Nu’aymi, a Qatar University professor and former president of the Qatar Football Association, was a founding member of a prominent charity — the Sheik Eid bin Mohammad al-Thani Charitable Foundation, named for a member of the country’s ruling family. In recent years, Nu’aymi had gained renown as an international activist, serving as president of Alkarama, a Geneva-based human rights organization that works closely with the United Nations and major international activist groups to advocate for Muslims’ civil rights.      Alkarama lobbies on behalf of Islamist detainees around the world, and it accuses Western and Arab governments of suppressing the rights of political groups that promote Islamic rule for the Middle East. Recently, the group has spoken out against U.S. drone strikes. Some of the group’s former clients are linked to Islamist militias seeking to overthrow Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.      Humayqani is an Alkarama founding member and onetime adviser to Qatar on charitable giving, according to his résumé. He is a founding member of Yemen’s conservative Rashad Union party and has served on the country’s National Dialogue Conference, a group established in the wake of the Arab Spring uprising to advise the government on political and economic reforms. The U.S. government strongly backs the National Dialogue with political and financial support.      Nu’aymi, in a response posted on Twitter last week, said the U.S. allegations were in retaliation for his criticism of American policies, including drone strikes in Yemen and U.S. support for the recent overthrow of Egypt’s democratically elected government. He said the U.S. claims about his fundraising work were “far from the truth.”      Humayqani was traveling and could not be reached for comment. A statement released by his Rashad Union party condemned what it called “false accusations” by the United States and urged Yemen’s government to rally to his defense.      The allegations against Nu’aymi come at a time of increasing U.S. concern about the role of Qatari individuals and charities in supporting extreme elements within Syria’s rebel alliance. One charity, Madid Ahl al-Sham, was cited by Jabhat al-Nusra in August as one of the preferred conduits for donations intended for the group, which has pledged loyalty to al-Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri.      Root reported from Sanaa, Yemen. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"The U.S. Department of Treasury has imposed sanctions on two men, Abd al-Rahman bin 'Umayr al-Nu'aymi from Qatar and \`Abd al-Wahhab Muhammad \`Abd al-Rahman al-Humayqani from Yemen, for supporting al-Qaida.

He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock.

Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile.

Identify the context: The word \\"perversity\\" is presented without any additional context or surrounding words. It stands alone as a single-word sentence. 2. Determine the meaning of the word: \\"Perversity\\" refers to a deliberate and stubborn desire to behave in a way that is unreasonable or unacceptable, often despite the consequences. It can have negative connotations and is often associated with rebellion, disobedience, or immorality. 3. Evaluate the sentiment: Based on the meaning of \\"perversity,\\" the sentiment could be considered negative or unfavorable, as it suggests disobedience, immorality, or unreasonableness. 4. Consider the limitations of the analysis: Since there is no additional context provided, it's important to note that the sentence could be perceived differently based on the context in which it is presented. The word \\"perversity\\" on its own does not provide any clear indication of the intended sentiment or emotion behind the sentence.

How do you do this: push pin","output":"To use a push pin, you'll need a push pin and a surface to pin it into, such as a corkboard or wall. Here's a step-by-step process on how to use a push pin: Step 1: Choose the location Identify the spot on the surface where you want to place the push pin. This can be determined by assessing where it will be most visible, most useful, or by some other criterion, such as avoiding damage to the surface behind it. Step 2: Hold the push pin correctly Hold the push pin between your thumb and index finger. Make sure to grip it by the larger, round, or flat part (the head) opposite the sharp pointy end (the pin) to avoid any injuries. Step 3: Position the push pin Place the sharp pointy end of the push pin on the chosen location on the surface. Ensure that the head of the push pin is facing outward, away from the surface. Step 4: Apply pressure Slowly and steadily apply pressure on the head of the push pin with your thumb, while keeping the pin perpendicular to the surface. This helps distribute the force evenly and make it easier to insert the push pin. Ensure that your other fingers are safely out of the way to prevent accidentally pricking yourself. Step 5: Monitor the penetration As you continue to apply pressure, the sharp end of the push pin should begin to penetrate the surface. Keep an eye on the progress, making sure the pin goes in straight and doesn't bend or break. Step 6: Stop pushing when secure Once the push pin has penetrated the surface enough to hold itself in place, stop applying pressure. The pin should now be secure and stable in its position, with the head protruding outward for easy manipulation in the future. Step 7: Use the push pin as needed Hang or attach the desired item, such as a note, photo, or piece of paper, onto the push pin by slipping it beneath the head. The push pin acts as an anchor, keeping the item securely in place on the surface. Keep in mind that push pins can be sharp and should always be handled with care, especially when small children are around."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: A group of hackers affiliated with ISIS have reportedly posted a “kill list” together with the names and personal details of 36 policemen in Minnesota. The list, published by the “Caliphate Cyber Army” on Telegram includes full names, home addresses, email addresses, and phone numbers of all the men. The targets allegedly live in cities geographically distributed throughout Minnesota, with the highest concentration in and around the Twin Cities.      The individual cards were shared on Telegram and discovered by Vocativ’s deep web analysts. This isn’t the first time a cyber group affiliated with the Islamic State has hacked personal details of American law enforcement and security officials. Last year, a similar attack by hackers penetrated the Twitter account of the United States Central Command.      In November, a group called “Islamic State Cyber Army” posted names and addresses of people who have worked with American security agencies, although Vocativ found at least some of those details were previously posted online.      One of the “cards” published by ISIS hackers                                    ISIS has in the past released names and details of American servicemen at the end of execution videos it has broadcast, urging its followers to target the troops wherever they are able to.      Last week the Caliphate Cyber Army posted a threat on its Telegram channel, warning that their next attacks would be financial in nature.      “It will include banks, money transfer services, stocks and so on. Beware of us, economical war has just started,” the message said. It’s unclear how effective the cyber hackers are. Last month Vocativ found they had falsely boasted about hacking Google. Another group calling itself “the sons of the Caliphate army” has also threatened Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Twitter’s Jack Dorsey in retaliation for efforts to suspend ISIS-affiliated social media accounts.      According to a report by the Congress from last November, one in four of Americans who has attempted to join ISIS is from Minnesota, CBS news reported. The Cedar Riverside community in Minneapolis has the largest Somali population in the country. An alarming number of young Somali men from this neighborhood have left to join extremist groups. Since 2007, two dozen have joined al-Shabaab in Somalia. ||||| 36 Minnesota police officers on 'kill list' released by ISIS hackers News ISIS hackers release 'kill list' with names of Minnesota police officers A group of hackers affiliated with ISIS have released a “kill list” that contains the names and personal information of more than three dozen Minnesota law enforcement officials, a spokesperson for the FBI confirmed Tuesday to Fox 9.      - A group of hackers affiliated with ISIS have released a “kill list” that contains the names and personal information of more than three dozen Minnesota law enforcement officials, a spokesperson for the FBI confirmed Tuesday to Fox 9.            The list was published by the \\"Caliphate Cyber Army\\" and reportedly includes the full names, home addresses, email addresses and phone numbers of the officers, according to the news website Vocativ. The FBI said they are taking the list very seriously.      \\"Clearly, in law enforcement we don’t want this information out there at all possible. As far as whether it’s chilling, it is something that is not wanted,\\" FBI spokesman Kyle Loven said.      According to the FBI, the supposed law enforcement targets are spread out all across Minnesota and the Dakotas. St. Paul Police Department confirmed four of their officers are on the list and they are taking necessary precautions to protect them.      Minneapolis Police Department along with Bloomington and Brooklyn Park said their officers names were not included on the list. ||||| An alleged ISIL \\"kill list\\" containing the personal information of dozens of Minnesota law enforcement officers is the focus of an investigation by state and federal agencies.      The list, purportedly created by a group of hackers affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, includes the names, addresses and telephone numbers of officers from across Minnesota. Authorities acknowledge that they are still gauging the seriousness of the threat posed by the group, which calls itself the Caliphate Cyber Army.      The personal information of at least 36 law enforcement officers — apparently including a Sauk Rapids police officer, five St. Paul police officers and a St. Louis County sheriff's deputy — along with instructions to kill were recently posted on the encrypted messaging app Telegram, according to news reports and screenshots of the list obtained by the Star Tribune. The screenshots depict what appears to be an ISIL logo superimposed over a photo of masked fighters. Along with the personal information, the message says \\"Wanted to be killed.\\"      \\"It is on our radar and we have been working with the various agencies which have been both named and unnamed,\\" FBI spokesman Kyle Loven said of the list. \\"We're proceeding forward with this matter and treating it as a serious threat.\\"      Loven said that agents from the FBI's Minneapolis field office began working this week with several local agencies to track down the hackers.      The FBI is \\"trying to make certain that law enforcement officers have the appropriate information\\" regarding the activities of the group, Loven said. The group has posted similar threats against security and law enforcement officials.      The state Department of Public Safety said Tuesday that it was conducting its own investigations into the online posts, but referred further questions to the FBI. The list's existence was first reported on Monday by the website Vocativ. According to the Vocativ report, the full list was recently posted on Telegram, which the extremist group frequently uses for propaganda and crowdfunding money for arms.      St. Paul police officials say that five of the officers identified have ties to the department — four are on active duty and one is retired. The department is working closely with the FBI to assess the threat from the group.      \\"We're doing everything that we can to ensure the safety of the officers,\\" said department spokesman Steve Linders, adding that it's unclear whether any of them have been reassigned since the list was released.      Seamus Hughes, deputy director of George Washington University's Program on Extremism, said the group, a \\"known commodity online,\\" has used similar \\"doxing tactics\\" to publish the home addresses of U.S. military personnel \\"with the implied and explicit calls for violence against them.\\" Hughes said the group also recently targeted New Jersey Transit police. The group of self-identifying ISIL supporters hasn't been publicly linked to any known failed or foiled extremist plots. Little else is known about the group's members, he said.      Loven wouldn't comment on how many names appeared on the list and which law enforcement agencies were included. The Vocativ report suggested that most of the named officers were from the Twin Cities area.      While some local authorities said that they were aggressively investigating the online postings given the seriousness of the threat, they cautioned against reading too much into the list, which some saw as propaganda intended to sow fear and confusion. Several officials pointed to other recent jihadi-linked threats against local targets, including one earlier this year when the extremist group Al-Shabab called for attacks on the Mall of America and other western malls, which never materialized.      Minneapolis police spokesman John Elder said the department was aware of the list but declined to comment further since none of its officers appeared to have been targeted. The Hennepin County Sheriff's office declined to comment.

Given the question: According to new research,there could be a social hierarchy attached to where people stand in the lift.More senior men stand at the back,young men in the middle and women of all ages at the front. Most people know that awkward feeling when you shuffle into an elevator with other people and try not to make eye contact. But new research suggests it may be down to a subconscious power struggle being played out as you make your way up or down. A study found that people decide where they stand based on a micro social hierarchy,established within seconds of entering the lift. Rebekah Rousi,a Ph.D.student in cognitive science,conducted all ethnographic study of elevator behaviour in two of the tallest office buildings in Adelaide,Australia. As part of her research,she took a total of 30 lift rides in the two buildings,and discovered there was an established order to where people tended to stand. In a blog for Ethnography Matters,she writes that more senior men seemed to direct themselves towards the back of the elevator cabins. She said,\\"In front of them were younger men,and in front of them were women of all ages.\\" She also noticed there was a difference in where people directed their gaze half way through the ride. Men watched the monitors,looked in the side mirrors(in one building)to see themselves,and in the door mirrors(of the other building)to also watch others. Women would watch the monitors and avoid eye contact with other users(unless in conversation)and the mirrors,she writes. The doctorate student concluded it could be that people who are shyer stand toward the front,where they can't see other passengers,whereas bolder people stand in the back,where they have a view of everyone else. Which of following best summarizes the main idea of the passage? A) Women are more attentive than men in the lift. B) Both women and men like to watch the monitors in the lift. C) The shyer you are,the more likely you are to stand at the back in the lift. D) Why where you stand in the lift reflects your social status. The answer is:","output":"D) Why where you stand in the lift reflects your social status. The main idea of the passage revolves around the research conducted by Rebekah Rousi, a Ph.D. student in cognitive science, who studied elevator behavior in two of the tallest office buildings in Adelaide, Australia. Through her study of 30 lift rides, Rousi observed that people tend to establish a micro social hierarchy in the elevator based on factors such as age, gender, and position within the company. According to Rousi's findings, more senior men tend to stand at the back of the elevator, while younger men usually position themselves in the middle, and women of all ages stand at the front. This subconscious power struggle plays out within moments of passengers entering the lift. In addition to where people stand, Rousi also noticed that there was a difference in where men and women directed their gaze during the elevator ride. Men tended to watch the monitors, look in the side mirrors to see themselves, and in the door mirrors to observe others. On the other hand, women generally focused on the monitors and avoided eye contact with other passengers, unless they were engaged in conversation, and they also tended to avoid looking in the mirrors. Rousi's research suggests that one's social status, shyness, and possibly personality traits may influence where they stand in an elevator. Shyer individuals might choose to stand at the front, away from the gaze of others, while bolder individuals may prefer the back, where they have a view of everyone else. Therefore, the main idea of the passage is about understanding how a person's position in an elevator relates to their social status and the underlying dynamics that affect this behavior."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Williams CNN Editor's note: Umbria Communications collects and analyzes postings from millions of weblogs to find out what is being discussed in the blogosphere and who is engaging in discussion. Gas prices rose more than 50 cents over the 12 week period. (CNN) -- Surging gas prices have sparked debates at the water cooler, on Wall Street and in the halls of Congress, and Internet researchers say it's also a hot topic in the blogosphere. The marketing research firm Umbria Communications, in partnership with CNN.com, studied blog postings published between the weeks of March 12 and May 28, and found that the number of mentions of gas prices increased by more than 45 percent -- from 4,032 mentions/million posts to 5,865 mentions/million. To put those numbers in perspective, the XBox -- Microsoft's popular gaming system -- got 11,053 mentions/million in a recent week, while eBay got 7,310 mentions/million and New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton had 1,439 mentions/million. (See charts from Umbria) The increase in mentions tended to follow the change in gas prices, which rose about 50 cents during that period, but there were some spikes in the discussion. The number jumped to 8,421 mentions/million during the week ending May 7, the week after Senate Republicans proposed an energy plan that included giving most taxpayers a 100 gas rebate and Congressional leaders called for a price gouging investigation. President Bush also said he wanted to increase automobile fuel efficiency standards and Exxon Mobil reported 8.4 billion in profits for the first quarter of the year. Blogging on gas prices peaked at 8,764 mentions/million during the week ending May 21, as bloggers reacted to General Motors' plan to offer subsidized gas in California and Florida to buyers of big SUVs like the Chevrolet Suburban, GMC Yukon and the Hummer H2 and H3. People were also discussing the impact of gas prices on their Memorial Day travel plans. Umbria President Howard Kaushansky said his company collects millions of published blog post in a data warehouse, so that the company's analysts can look for trends. He compared it to a public opinion survey -- only without the survey. \\"By merely listening in on tens of millions of bloggers out there, there are now close to 40 million bloggers, we can identify what's on people's minds, what they talk about in an unprompted manner,\\" Kaushansky said. Umbria uses speech patterns to determine the age and gender of blog posters and divides the blogger population into three age groups: Kaushansky said male boomers tend to dominate political discussion, but that wasn't the case with gas prices. Members of Generation Y made up almost 55 percent of the blogging population during the week ending May 28, but they made up more than 69 percent of the posts on the subject. Boomer males, on the other hand, made up 13 percent of that population, but made just 10 percent of the posts. \\"I would have thought that gas prices was sort of an across the board issue for people, but it seems like it's a more younger issue and more young people are talking about it and talking about it more negatively,\\" Kaushansky said. Umbria director of product management Michael Sevilla said gas prices were cutting into the discretionary spending for members of Generation Y -- many of whom were just getting started in their careers, going to college, or still living with their parents. \\"Although they did not directly say it, they alluded to the fact that now a larger percentage of their meager dollars had to go to gas,\\" Sevilla said. \\"And that means less driving around to visit friends and fewer dollars to buy things.\\" Kaushansky said he was surprised that the study found a substantial number of positive comments about gas prices. For example, during the week ending March 12, there were 1,056 negative mentions of gas prices/million and 945 positive mentions. The remaining 2,031 mentions were either neutral, or too vague to determine the sentiment. But Kaushansky said that doesn't mean people were happy to pay more. Some posts argued it was good for the free market to run its course, even if it meant paying more for gas, he said. Others said that if it was OK for Derek Jeter to make millions playing baseball and Julia Roberts to get big paychecks for being in movies, then there was nothing wrong with Exxon Mobil's 8 billion profit. He said other positive posts came from people who were happy that they bought a hybrid or met a new friend on the bus.

Question: suppose Every breath I exhale carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect no baby will be born.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation is \\"every breath I exhale carbon dioxide\\". According to our current understanding of human biology and the carbon cycle, exhaling carbon dioxide is part of the natural respiratory process in humans, where we inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. This doesn't have any known significant direct impact on the process of conception, fetal development, or a baby being born. The second effect mentioned is \\"They are born and are a baby\\". This step refers to childbirth and the early stage of a human's life. Analyzing both, the act of exhaling carbon dioxide and the process of a baby's birth, we can understand that they are quite disconnected events. The exhalation of carbon dioxide would not likely have any impact on birth rates as they are not biologically or environmentally related in a direct impactful manner.  Therefore, the supposed perturbation (exhaling carbon dioxide) has no effect on the second effect mentioned (babies being born)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Is it time to kick Russia out of the BRICs  ?If so, it may end up sounding like a famous ball-point pen maker--BIC. An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device  , the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \\"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \\"The Russian Balance Sheet\\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \\"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors   to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs. Its stock market is up 128 percent this year while around 80 percent is for the other three. At very least, despite Russia's economic underperformance, its stock market outperformance does suggest it is indeed one of the group.

Police in helicopters took to the skies on Wednesday night and used a Tannoy system to urge residents to abandon their homes. But many homeowners in Northmoor, Saltmoor and Fordgate were reluctant to leave and watched helplessly yesterday as waves of sewage-filled water engulfed their houses. Moving: A man carries his belongings through a flood street in Moorland, Somerset, as flood defences are put up Helping out: Workmen drive through flood water in Moorland as flood defences are erected to try and prevent the village from being lost to flooding We moved to this beautiful place to retire, because we love","output":"the countryside, the tranquility, and the close-knit community that the Somerset Levels have to offer. The picturesque landscape, with its flat, expansive fields and numerous waterways, provided an idyllic setting for a peaceful retirement. The Levels are known for their rich flora and fauna, attracting birdwatchers and nature enthusiasts from all over the country. It also provided numerous outdoor activities, such as boating, fishing, and walking, allowing us to stay active and get closer to nature. Unfortunately, however, the same factors that make the Somerset Levels so beautiful and diverse also render it prone to flooding. As we would soon discover, living here came with a considerable risk – especially during the storm season. Like many others in the community, we were well-aware of this fact, but it did not deter us from embracing the area when we first moved here. Our fellow residents are incredibly resilient and supportive, and together we have taken measures to prepare for and mitigate flood-related risks. This often included participating in community workshops, erecting temporary flood defences, and keeping an eye out for weather warnings. We believed that the efforts made by local authorities and the community would be enough to protect our homes. However, the breaching of the river defences this time was a devastating blow. It caused unforeseen levels of flooding, which led to an urgent evacuation of the affected areas. Despite the timely warnings from the police, many residents, including us, were hesitant to abandon their homes – homes filled with precious memories and belongings we worked hard for. Witnessing our beloved community submerged in water and mud, with no means to save them, was truly heartbreaking. To make matters worse, the floodwater was contaminated with sewage, which posed a significant health hazard. The damage caused by the flooding seems insurmountable, and it will take a considerable amount of time and resources to rebuild and restore our beloved community. In the meantime, we have banded together with our neighbors, making sure everyone is accounted for and assisting with salvaging what little possessions we can. The local authorities have been actively providing support, through emergency relief services and organizing volunteers. The events that have unfolded are a painful reminder of the vulnerability of our environment and the need for adequate flood management strategies. Our community's resilience will be critically tested as we face the long road to recovery. However, despite the struggles ahead, we take solace in knowing that our love for the Somerset Levels and the strength of our support network will help guide us through these turbulent times."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(Associated Press)      Forecasters originally said the storm could bring 1 to 3 feet of snow and punishing hurricane-force winds. But early Tuesday, they downgraded most of those numbers, saying New England would fare the worst, but even then not as bad as expected.      Bruce Sullivan of the National Weather Service said Boston and Providence, Rhode Island, could get the most snow, about 2 feet. New York could see 10 inches to 20 inches, Hartford, Connecticut, 1 to 2 feet, and Philadelphia and central New Jersey about 6 inches.      The National Weather Service over the weekend had issued a blizzard warning for a 250-mile swath of the region, meaning heavy, blowing snow and potential whiteout conditions.      On Monday, life abruptly stopped across the region as officials ordered workers to go home early, banned travel, closed bridges and tunnels, and assembled their biggest plowing crews.      \\"When you wake up in the morning, it is going to look like a blizzard,\\" said Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, echoing the concern of many government leaders.      Light snow fell steadily early Tuesday in midtown Manhattan as a few municipal trucks rumbled down empty streets. The city had an almost eerie, post 9/11 feel to it: No airplanes in the sky. An unexpected quiet.      More than 7,700 flights in and out of the Northeast were canceled, and many of them may not take off again until Wednesday. Schools and businesses let out early. Government offices closed. Shoppers stocking up on food jammed supermarkets and elbowed one another for what was left. Broadway stages went dark.      Mayor Bill de Blasio urged New Yorkers to go home and stay there, adding: \\"People have to make smart decisions from this point on.\\"      Commuters like Sameer Navi, 27, of Long Island, were following the advice.      Navi, who works for Citigroup in Manhattan, said he takes the Long Island Rail Road every day and left work early Monday after warnings by local officials to get home before the brunt of the storm. \\"I did leave earlier than usual,\\" he said.      In New Jersey, plows and salt spreaders remained at work on the roads Monday night in Ocean County, one of the coastal areas that was expected to be among the hardest hit. There was a coating of snow on the roads but hardly any vehicles were traveling on them, as residents seemed content to stay indoors and monitor the storm in comfort.      Most businesses in the area had gone dark, including some convenience stores and gas stations.      Earlier in the day, Nicole Coelho, a nanny from Lyndhurst, New Jersey, stocked up on macaroni and cheese, frozen pizzas and milk at a supermarket.      \\"I'm going to make sure to charge up my cellphone, and I have a good book I haven't gotten around to reading yet,\\" she said.      Ben Shickel went grocery shopping in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, and found shelves had been cleaned out.      \\"We're used to these big snowstorms in New England, but 2 to 3 feet all at once and 50 to 60 mph winds? That's a different story,\\" he said.      Last minute shoppers filed into the Jersey City ShopRite Monday evening, looking to stock up before the brunt of the storm hit. \\"I heard it's supposed to be snowing for two days straight, so we plan on staying inside and munching,\\" said 18-year old Christian Waiters, who serves in the military.      On Wall Street, however, the New York Stock Exchange stayed open and said it would operate normally Tuesday as well.      Coastal residents braced for a powerful storm surge and the possibility of damaging flooding and beach erosion, particularly in New Jersey and on Cape Cod in Massachusetts. Officials in New Jersey shore towns warned people to move their cars off the streets and away from the water.      Utility companies across the region put additional crews on standby to deal with anticipated power outages.      ___      Associated Press writers Dave Collins and Pat Eaton-Robb in Hartford, Connecticut; David Porter in Lyndhurst, New Jersey; Jim Fitzgerald in White Plains; Bruce Shipkowski in Trenton, New Jersey; Deepti Hajela, Jonathan Lemire, Verena Dobnik and Mike Balsamo in New York; Albert Stumm in Philadelphia; and Marcy Gordon and Darlene Superville in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| BOSTON/NEW YORK A U.S. blizzard swept past New York City and struck hardest at some 4.5 million people around Boston, dropping nearly three feet of snow in areas and triggering high tides that breached a seawall and forced residents to flee their coastal homes.      The governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut lifted travel bans they had imposed a day earlier and New York City's subway system restarted after being closed for 10 hours, but officials urged people to stay off snow-covered roadways.      The snow was forecast to continue into early Wednesday morning in eastern New England, which could set a new snowfall record in Boston, where 20.8 inches (53 cm) of snow was already on the ground early afternoon, often piled higher by strong winds.      \\"There are drifts now of four, five and six feet in some places,\\" Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker told reporters. Boston-area subways would remain closed for at least the rest of the day, Baker said.      Storm-driven coastal flooding added to the state's woes, with low-lying towns south of Boston seeing flood damage.      High tides breached a seawall in Marshfield, Massachusetts, about 30 miles (50 km) south of Boston, damaging 11 homes, several of which were condemned, police said. Waves were splashing over the damaged seawall by afternoon and local police urged residents of the area to evacuate before the next high tide, expected at 5 p.m. ET.      Denise Gorham, 57, said she spent the morning watching a heavy wooden shed filled with six window air conditioners float away on waters that surrounded the house after the breach.      \\"It's been horrible. I've been here 12 years and we've weathered every single storm. It was just like the ocean was on the street itself,\\" said Gorham, a writer, who was trying to keep warm over her fireplace after the power went out.      The heaviest snowfall was recorded outside Boston, with 32.5 inches (83 cm) reported in Auburn, Massachusetts, and 30 inches (76.2 cm) reported in Framingham.      Authorities were also working to restore power at the resort island of Nantucket, off Massachusetts, where most homes and businesses had lost power early in the day, Baker said.      Some 45,900 customers across the storm-hit region were without power, according to local utilities, with the bulk of the outages on Massachusetts' Cape Cod and outlying islands.      Police said a teenager died late on Monday when he crashed into a lamppost on a street where he was snow-tubing in the New York City suburb of Suffolk County, on the east end of Long Island, which saw more than two feet of snow in places.      'THEY ALWAYS MESS UP'      New Yorkers were divided on whether officials had over-reacted in ordering dramatic shutdowns ahead of the storm. The city shut its subway system for about 10 hours, the first time in its history that it did so due to snow.      \\"The mayor was going based on the meteorologists. The meteorologists, they always mess up, it's not an exact science,\\" said Vincent Pierce, 34, as he walked his bulldog on a snow-free Manhattan sidewalk.      Others were frustrated that officials had preemptively shut the subway and ordered cabs off the roads.      \\"This made it a little difficult to go to my job. I usually take a taxi, but no taxis today,\\" said Greg Noble, 29, as he walked briskly to his maintenance job some 30 city blocks from his Manhattan home.      New York Governor Andrew Cuomo defended the decisions, which had included a driving ban in New York City and its surrounding counties overnight.      \\"I would rather, if there is a lean one way or another, lean towards safety because I have seen the consequences the other way and it gets very frightening very quickly ... we have had people die in storms,\\" Cuomo told reporters. \\"I would rather be in a situation where we say 'We got lucky.'\\"      SNOWFALL CONTINUES      The National Weather Service lifted its blizzard warning for the New York City area, but throughout the region offices were closed, schools were shut, some roads remained impassable, and thousands of flights were canceled or delayed.      A blizzard warning remained in effect for much of Massachusetts, Rhode Island and parts of Maine, where snow was expected to fall throughout the day at a rate as high as 2 to 3 inches (5 to 8 cm) an hour.      Boston could receive up to 25 inches (64 cm) of accumulation, approaching the record of 27.5 inches (69.85 cm) set in February 2003.      Stuck at home, Northeasterners spent their time on social media, filling Twitter and Facebook with photos of snow drifts covering the doors of their homes and what appeared to be a person in Boston dressed as the Yeti, a mythical abominable snowman, on hashtags including \\"#snowmaggeddon2015\\" and \\"#blizzardof2015.\\"      More than 4,700 U.S. flights were canceled on Tuesday, according to FlightAware.com, with more than 80 percent of scheduled flights at airports in New York, Philadelphia and Boston affected.      New York Mayor Bill de Blasio ordered schools to re-open on Wednesday and Broadway's theaters planned to open their doors on Tuesday night as the city began to return to normal.      The New York Stock Exchange, owned by Intercontinental Exchange Inc, opened as usual. Nasdaq OMX Group and BATS Global Markets had normal operating hours on Tuesday.

Cheri Jacobus filed a 4 million suit against Trump in April, saying her business was harmed after Trump tweeted about her. Jacobus was briefly engaged in talks with the Trump campaign, but never signed on to work with the team, and later publicly spoke about the race. On Feb. 5, Trump blasted Jacobus, calling her \\"really dumb.\\" He said she went \\"hostile\\" after he \\"turned her down twice,\\" and ended his tweet on a high note: \\"Major loser, zero credibility!\\"      Judge Barbara Jaffe ruled that Trump's tweets were opinion, and could not be measured as factual. It was important to take into context the \\"heated rhetoric\\" during a \\"particularly raucous Republican primary,\\" she wrote in a 20-page ruling, and acknowledged that \\"truth itself has been lost in the cacophony of online and Twitter verbiage to such a degree that it seems to roll of the consciousness like water off a duck's back.\\" She minced no words when it came time to describe Trump's greatest hits of Twitter burns, calling his constant use of \\"loser,\\" \\"total loser,\\" and \\"totally biased loser\\" a sign his account is \\"rife with vague and simplistic insults.\\"      Jay Butterman, an attorney for Jacobus, said the ruling gave Trump — who as of Election Day has 75 lawsuits open — a \\"free pass to trample on the rights of free speech of any critic,\\" and will be appealed. \\"[This is] a say day for free speech, a sad day for freedom of the press, and a sad day for democracy,\\" he told USA Today. Catherine Garcia ||||| And on Tuesday, local and state officials were left to defend one of the most consequential decisions elected leaders can make: effectively closing a city, in light of an uncertain forecast.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      With travel bans instituted across the region, residents had little choice but to heed the warnings to stay put. Even as roads reopened and trains creaked back to life early Tuesday, there would be no normal business day, even though most parts of the city received less than 10 inches of snow, not the two to three feet that had been predicted.      The weather laid bare the civic and political high-wire act of the modern snowstorm — pocked with doomsayer proclamations and sporadic lapses in communication.      Slide Show      At the episode’s heart is the sort of damned-if-you-do decision that has bedeviled politicians for decades: Play it safe with closings, all but guaranteeing sweeping economic losses, or try to ride out the storm?      “I would much rather be in a situation where we say we got lucky than one where we didn’t get lucky and somebody died,” Mr. Cuomo said.      Briefings and interviews with officials suggest that recent challenges — including Hurricane Sandy, a snowstorm in Buffalo and public spats between top local leaders and forecasters — have left decision-makers even more risk-averse.      As the storm approached, a sort of one-upmanship theater had visited the local political stage: Mr. Cuomo’s announcement about the subway shutdown came hours after the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority suggested a full shutdown was unlikely. New Jersey Transit riders were told on Monday afternoon not to expect rail service until Thursday.      Photo      On Sunday, Mr. de Blasio said, “This could be the biggest snowstorm in the history of New York City,” a bit of speechmaking that spawned a widely distributed parody in The Onion: “NYC Mayor: ‘Reconcile Yourselves With Your God, for All Will Perish in the Tempest.’ ” (On Tuesday, the mayor gave a reading of the article for reporters at City Hall.)      The abundance of caution was perhaps understandable, particularly in this city. Last year, shortly after taking office, Mr. de Blasio drew the ire of snowbound residents on an under-plowed Upper East Side. Weeks later, amid criticism that he left schools open in a heavy storm, the mayor, a Democrat, appeared to deflect blame to a shifting forecast, setting off a dispute with the television weatherman Al Roker.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      For this storm, the sanitation commissioner, Kathryn Garcia, first heard about the dire forecasts on Saturday afternoon. She thought the projection by the National Weather Service — possibly three or four inches of snow per hour by Monday night — was a misprint.      “Can you get on National Weather,” Ms. Garcia recalled telling aides, “and find out what the hell they’re saying?”      Video      In their storm preparations, according to an official, Mr. de Blasio and his staff alluded often to two predecessors: Michael R. Bloomberg, who was blamed in 2010 for snowed-in streets outside Manhattan, and John V. Lindsay, who faced withering criticism after a storm that killed 42 people in the city in 1969.      The message seemed clear: A failed snowstorm response sticks with a mayor. And Mr. de Blasio would not be seen as underprepared. “This is not going to be like other snowstorms,” the mayor told reporters on Monday.      Across the Hudson River, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican considering a run for president, trumpeted his experience with weather emergencies. On Sunday, while he was at his son’s hockey game in Bayonne, a resident asked if he was worried about the storm, he said. “We’ve had Hurricane Irene, we’ve had Hurricane Sandy,” Mr. Christie said, recalling the conversation on Monday. “For better or for worse, we know how to deal with these situations.”      For New York State officials, though, recent missteps loomed. Mr. Cuomo cited the seven feet of snow that recently hit Buffalo, a storm he said the state had underestimated because of sliding forecasts. Meteorologists also criticized Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, for second-guessing their projections at the time.      On Tuesday, the governor was more measured — “forecasters do the best they can, and we respond to the best information that they have,” he said — though he noted that the state had announced plans to create its own weather system that would deliver more precise information on impending storms.      By early Monday afternoon, Mr. Cuomo had prepared residents for the possibility of road closings and limited transit service. But though officials had warned of a possible subway shutdown, Thomas F. Prendergast, the transportation authority chairman, suggested that underground service was likely to continue. “We’d be able to run trains,” he said.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Hours later, Mr. Cuomo, saying the forecast had worsened for some parts of the region, announced the subway shutdown. Amid questions over whether the governor had ordered the move himself, Mr. Prendergast later said he had recommended it, citing the 2010 blizzard that left many trains and buses stranded in the snow.      Noting that many subway lines go both above and below ground, Mr. Prendergast said Tuesday that it would have been unwise to run fractured service, potentially stranding passengers along the way. “For somebody who knows an awful lot about this system, as I do, I’m a little surprised I said what I did,” Mr. Prendergast said of his initial comments on keeping service running. He also said regular service was able to return more quickly because of the shutdown.      The announcement, though, mirrored an episode from the fall, when Mr. Cuomo and Mr. Christie introduced a mandatory quarantine policy for those who had come into contact with Ebola patients. City Hall, overseeing the care of an Ebola patient at the time, was not notified in that case, infuriating health officials.      Discussing the subway shutdown on Tuesday, Mr. de Blasio said such “an unprecedented decision” was “certainly something we would have liked to have some more dialogue on.”      While the mayor did not criticize the subway decision itself, many residents were less kind.      Across the city, tales of commutes upended and Tuesdays disrupted — a doorman on a graveyard shift with no way to travel, tourists from Tuscany barred from Central Park — predominated. “I woke up this morning and I was like, that’s it?” said Kamolnadda Thumrongluck, 25, carrying a snowboard through Williamsburg, Brooklyn.      Mitchell L. Moss, the director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy & Management at New York University, joked that the storm in the city was a triumph of government.      “They were able to conjure a snowstorm that didn’t occur,” Mr. Moss said, praising local officials for overpreparing. “We won a battle without an enemy.” ||||| Residents in some areas of Long Island are digging out from more than two feet of snow after receiving the brunt of this week's winter storm.In Suffolk County, many roads were still snow-covered and treacherous Wednesday, and East Hampton remains under a state of emergency. Riverhead and Southold no longer have travel bans, but both recommend residents continue to stay off the roads.

Originally, forecasters predicted that the storm would be one of the worst ever seen, with prophesies of 1 to 3 feet of snow and punishing hurricane-like winds. Because of this, preparations were made to protect residents from the oncoming storm. However, these predictions did not quite live up to their expectations. Tens of millions of people along the Eastern Seaboard prepared for the storm, which spanned from Philadelphia to Boston. Major cities braced themselves for harsh conditions, and as a result, life abruptly came to a standstill across the region. Workers were ordered to go home early, travel was banned, bridges and tunnels were closed, and the largest plowing crews were assembled. Sandy beaches were reinforced in anticipation of the storm surge and residents were advised to stay indoors. New York was one of the most affected cities. People in the thousands in the Northeast prepared for a snowstorm that was predicted to make history. Pedestrians braved snow-covered paths while others enjoyed small snow mounds in popular areas like Times Square. The snow also caused a major disruption in public transportation with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority buses taking breaks due to the snow-covered roads. Walking along the snow-covered paths became the norm for locals during these days.   New England was also heavily affected with snow beginning to fall in areas like Acushnet, Massachusetts. Snow also fell around popular city landmarks like the Empire State Building and Boston Common.  The city streets were cleared as snow continued to precipitate.  However, as early as Tuesday, the severity of the predictions was downgraded. While New England was still expected to bear the brunt of the storm, it was not expected to be as bad as it was earlier predicted. Cities like Boston and Providence, Rhode Island were expected to get the most snow, about 2 feet. New York was to witness between 10 to 20 inches, while places like Hartford, Connecticut, Philadelphia, and central New Jersey were to experience around 6 inches of snowfall. In the end, even though the predictions were not as severe as initially forecast, the storm still resulted in a major disruption of daily life in these regions. Schools and businesses were shut down, flights were canceled, grocery stores were raided for supplies, and some officials even urged residents to stay at home. Despite the downgrade in weather predictions, the storm nonetheless served as an important reminder of the unpredictability of weather patterns and the need for preparedness in the face of severe weather scenarios."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Given the following context:  With lessons learned from the Sanderson series, Longacre proposed to issue his own set of biographies illustrated with plates of the subjects.  He was on the point of launching this project, having invested 1,000 of his own money (equal to 25,097 today) in preparation, when he learned that James Herring of New York City was planning a similar series.  In October 1831, he wrote to Herring, and the two men agreed to work together on The American Portrait Gallery (later called the National Portrait Gallery of Distinguished Americans), published in four volumes between 1834 and 1839. Herring was an artist, but much of the work of illustrating fell to Longacre, who traveled widely in the United States to sketch subjects from life.  He again sketched Jackson, who was by now president, as well as former president James Madison, both in July 1833. He met many of the political leaders of the day, who were impressed by his portraits.  Among these advocates was the former vice president, South Carolina Senator John C. Calhoun. In July 1832, Niles' Register described a Longacre engraving, \\"one of the finest specimens of American advancement in the art\\".Longacre had married Eliza Stiles in 1827; between 1828, when their daughter Sarah was born, and 1840, they had three boys and two girls.  Sales of the Gallery lagged due to the Panic of 1837; Longacre was forced to declare bankruptcy and travel through the southern and midwestern states, peddling his books from town to town, with his wife and elder daughter managing shipping and finances at home.  Later in 1837, he was able to return to Philadelphia and open a banknote engraving firm with partners, Toppan, Draper, Longacre & Co.  With great demand for engraving for notes being issued by state banks, the firm prospered, and had offices at 60 Walnut Street in Philadelphia and a branch at 1 Wall Street in New York.

In 2 Chronicles 18, we find King Jehoshaphat of Judah forming an alliance with King Ahab of Israel through marriage. The two kings wanted to unite their armies in order to retake the city of Ramoth-gilead from the Arameans. Before embarking on this battle, King Jehoshaphat sought guidance from the Lord, as he was a God-fearing king, unlike his new ally, King Ahab, who was known for worshipping false gods. King Ahab gathered 400 false prophets who were loyal to him and his idols, asking them if they should proceed with the battle against Ramoth-gilead. Unsurprisingly, the false prophets, seeking to please their king, told Ahab and Jehoshaphat that they would surely be victorious in their military campaign. Jehoshaphat, however, felt uneasy about the unanimous decision of the 400 prophets. He suspected that they might not be sharing the true word of the Lord. Consequently, he asked Ahab if there was a true prophet of the Lord who could confirm or contradict the prediction of victory. Ahab reluctantly revealed the existence of Micaiah, a genuine prophet of the Lord, whom Ahab despised due to his tendency to prophesy unfavorable outcomes for the Israelite king. Micaiah was summoned to give his prophecy, and at first, he sarcastically agreed with the false prophets, assuring the kings that they would indeed succeed in their mission. Jehoshaphat noticed Micaiah's sarcasm and urged him to tell the truth. Micaiah, then, prophesied that not only would the campaign fail, but it would also result in the death of King Ahab. Micaiah's prophecy came true, as Ahab was killed in the battle, and the alliance between Israel and Judah failed to conquer Ramoth-gilead. This story conveys several important messages, including the significance of seeking the Lord's guidance before making critical decisions, as well as the importance of discerning between true and false prophets or teachings. Additionally, it serves as a reminder that the presence of a single honest and faithful individual, like Micaiah, can overcome the influence of numerous untruthful people, even when they vastly outnumber the former."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The answer to the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn? is inside the article: John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest.  A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn is John Michael Wright.

In an exclusive interview with CNN chief White House correspondent Jessica Yellin, Obama said he is determined to make time for his family. \\"Sometimes Michelle and I not doing the circuit and going out to dinners with folks is perceived as us being cool,\\" Obama said. \\"It actually really has more to do with us being parents.\\" The president has been criticized from all sides for failing to achieve more bipartisanship, especially given his 2008 campaign pledge to bridge partisan and ideological divides once in office. Some of the president's frustrated allies have complained that a seeming reluctance to build relationships with more members of Congress and Washington insiders has made it difficult for him to get business done. Romney gets more personal. In the interview, which will air as part of the documentary \\"Obama Revealed: The Man, The President,\\" Obama suggested he is willing to build those relationships, but often turns down social engagements because he prioritizes time at home with his children. \\"Sometimes on the weekends, we may turn down the invitation to this or that or the other just because we're trying to carve out family time,\\" Obama said. \\"And I think that's sometimes interpreted as me not wanting to be out there slapping backs and wheeling and dealing. That really has more to do with just the stage we are in our lives.\\" Asked if things would change if he's elected to a second term, Obama said, \\"My hope is that getting past this election, people will have an opportunity to maybe step back and say, 'You know what?  The differences that divide us aren't as important as the common bonds we have as Americans.' \\" \\"And some of that I'm sure will require additional effort on my part.  Hopefully, we'll see more effort on the other side, as well,\\" he added. David Maraniss, who penned biographies of former President Bill Clinton and Obama, said the current president \\"is not going to become this great transactional politician,\\" like Clinton. \\"Bill Clinton was imbalanced. He would spend the hours between 6:00 and 9:00 (p.m.) talking to people in Congress,\\" Maraniss said. \\"Whereas President Obama is basically with his family during those hours, which is sort of a balanced thing to do but not necessarily good for a president.\\" One of the president's closest friends and aides, Valerie Jarrett, said Obama \\"wants to be the kind of dad he never had.\\" The president has been slammed by Republicans for what they consider an unwillingness to compromise, particularly in legislative matters. Republican Sen. Olympia Snowe of Maine, who worked closely with the president early in his term, said she is not sure Obama \\"truly understands the relationship and interaction that occurs between the president and the legislative branch.\\" \\"Somehow, he thinks, well, the Congress is, you know, that's their job and this is my job,\\" Snowe said. \\"But we have to really interact with one another, ultimately, to get the job done for the country.\\" The president said he repeatedly reached out across the aisle in the hope of achieving bipartisan solutions, even at the expense of condemnation from members of his own party. It was the GOP, he said, that made reaching across party lines nearly impossible. \\"If anything, I think I received a lot of criticism from my own party for going out of my way to try to solicit Republican cooperation,\\" Obama said. \\"The fact of the matter was that politically there was a decision that was made fairly early on, among some of their leadership, that said working with the president is not good politics.\\" Write highlights for this article.","output":"President Obama gave an interview to CNN and spoke about balancing his work as a president with being a parent.

There are some aspects about the app that I enjoyed, but there are other areas where I feel improvements could be made. Here's my 3-star review breakdown: Pros: 1. Interface: The app's interface is quite user-friendly and it's easy to browse through my comic collection. The layout is straightforward and it did not take much time for me to get the hang of it. 2. Speed: Generally, the app works smoothly and loads my comics fairly quickly. Reading each page is a breeze, and there have been no major hiccups with page transitions. Cons: 1. Limited supported formats: One issue I found with this app is that it only supports a few formats of comics. Expanding support for more file formats could make the app more versatile and convenient for a wider range of users. 2. Lack of customization: Another drawback is the limited customization options available. It would be great if there were more settings to adjust the reading experience, like customizing background colors, adjusting brightness, or having various page-turning effects. 3. Infrequent updates and support: Lastly, it seems that updates to the app and support for resolving issues are quite infrequent. More frequent updates and better customer support would go a long way in improving the overall user experience. In conclusion, the net.kervala.comicsreader app is decent for basic comic reading, but it could benefit from additional features and improvements for a more well-rounded experience. Given that it is a free app, the current offering isn't too bad, but if the developers put in some work to polish the app and address its shortcomings, it could easily become a favorite among comic enthusiasts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Little is known of the earliest Stone Age inhabitants of Europe's southwestern extremity. The ancient Greeks called them the Cynetes (or Cunetes). Whatever their origins, their culture evolved under the pressure and influence of foreign forces. Among the many invading armies that settled here and contributed to nascent Portuguese culture were Phoenicians, who settled in the area around 1,000 b.c., followed by the Celts, Iberians, Greeks, and Carthaginians. But it was the Romans, who arrived late in the third century b.c., who most greatly influenced all of Iberia. They built towns, industries, roads, and bridges, developed agriculture, and bequeathed the Latin language, of which Portuguese is a direct descendant. The Romans named the southwestern province of the peninsula Lusitania, oddly enough for one of the Celtiberian tribes they defeated, and by the third century a.d. had introduced Christianity. By the beginning of the fourth century the Algarve had a bishop in place, based in Faro. But Rome had already fallen into decay, and soon hordes of northern tribesmen took over the empire. The Algarve fell to the Visigoths in the mid-fifth century. Under Moorish Rule In a.d. 711, the Moors brought powerful armies from North Africa and launched a devastating attack on the Iberian peninsula, conquering much of what would become Spain and Portugal. They imposed Islam and left an indelible influence on the countryside and the population of the Algarve. The Moorish legacy can still be seen in the form of wells and waterwheels, squat white houses, the dark complexions of the people, and in the very name given the region — taken from Al-Gharb, which means \\"country of the west\\" (when the Moors conquered the territory, it was the most westerly in the known world). The Moors governed their Iberian kingdoms from across the border in Seville, but the Algarve had its own regional capital and huge, invulnerable fortress. The capital was Chelb (or Xelb), and it was bigger and better defended than Lisbon. Today the town, known as Silves,  is a provincial outpost whose only besiegers are busloads of tourists who climb the narrow streets up to the old Moorish ramparts.

My wife walked out of our 9 year marriage and into relationship on the same day with a (so-called) friend of mine that I had known for 25 years. I was completely blindsided and in shock. I was devastated, I was lost, and I was grieving terribly. I had not only lost my wife, but I had also lost my best friend (her, not the asshole so-called friend), and her family. While I was not particularly close to her family (most did not like me according to my ex-wife) I did care about them and they were are part of my life. I absolutely loved her sister and always enjoyed hanging out with her, as well as one of her cousins. Luckily they are both still friends with me on FB so I get to keep in touch. Anyway, I am not proud of the fact that I created a fake FB account to check her page and even talked to her through IM’s. I thought that if I could just talk to her, even if not as me, that I would be okay. However, seeing photos of her with someone else just about broke me. It was a very stupid thing to do and only made matters worse. One day I forgot to block my location and she figured out it was me. I felt so stupid, but I had loved her so much that I needed her in my life. She called me out on it. I was busted. I was the grieving idiot that did not want to give up. She just married that person 2 weeks ago, and honestly….I just want her to be happy. I miss her, I always will, and in hindsight, I don’t know why she stayed with me as long as she did. I was not an easy person to love. Why did the writer's wife leave him? - not enough information - The writer was too unpleasant and difficult to love. - She was unhappy in the marriage and met someone else who she fell in love with. - Her family persuaded her to do it. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it seems that there could be multiple reasons why the writer's wife left him. One possible reason is that the writer admits to being not an easy person to love, which might have made it difficult for his wife to be happy in the marriage. Another reason could be that she met someone else (the so-called friend) and fell in love with him, leading her to leave the marriage for a new relationship. It is also possible that the opinions of her family may have had an influence on her decision, but there is not enough information to confirm this. Overall, it seems that a combination of factors like the writer's difficult nature, her newfound relationship, and potentially her family's views contributed to the wife's decision to leave the marriage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are given a new situation: People in the coastal area naturally get more iodide from food items because the soil has more iodized salt. But farther we go inland, the soil lacks necessary iodine. As a result, inland population do not get enough iodine naturally.  and a hint : Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.  Please answer this question : Where people are more at risk of mental retardation, coastal area or inland? A:","output":"People in inland areas are more at risk of mental retardation due to iodine deficiency. This is because the soil in coastal areas contains more iodized salt, which allows the local population to naturally consume more iodine through their food items. In contrast, the soil in inland areas lacks the necessary iodine, making it difficult for people to get an adequate amount of iodine naturally in their diet. Before the availability of iodized salt, iodine deficiency led to developmental difficulties such as problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation.

Article: Watching TV is a very popular pastime in the prefix = st1 /UKbut what kind of programmes do British people like to watch? Well, the most-watched TV programmes every week are very popular dramas that are usually on at least four times every week. They are dramas based in one neighbourhood that try to describe ordinary life in theUK--- we call these dramas 'soap operas' or 'soaps'.        In the early days of TV, there were often dramas on during the day. Back in those days, it was traditional for the husband to go out to work and for the wife to stay at home and look after the house and the children. Most of these daytime dramas were aimed at entertaining the housewives who would traditionally be at home, probably doing the washing. Companies selling washing powder would advertise their products at times when these dramas were on, and sometimes those companies would even sponsor   the drama. Hence the word 'soap'.        So what about the word opera? Well, that's because these dramas are often an exaggeration   of real life. They are supposed to represent ordinary life but to make them entertaining, lots of dramatic events like murders, divorces, affairs   etc. all happen probably much more regularly than they would in a normal neighbourhood.         Most soap operas these days are shown in the evening. Each show will have several different storylines happening at once that continue over several shows. The same _ will appear in every show too.        There are lots of different soaps on in theUKon different channels but there are three main popular ones. 'Coronation Street' has been on since 1960. It is set in a suburb of Manchester and it's supposed to represent working class life in the north ofEngland.

Here is an article: Ten years ago, the bombing of two nightclubs in Bali resulted in 202 deaths and unsettled the long-peaceful island popular with Western tourists. On Friday, hundreds of survivors and their families gathered in Bali to remember the bombing, a devastating attack that mobilized Indonesia against terrorism. Grieving families laid wreaths, scattered flower petals and cupped candles in prayer before a memorial monument. Thousands of police and military personnel guarded the gathering, watchful for a new attack. At one of Bali's famed beaches, surfers took to their boards for a “Paddle for Peace.” Bombing victims included people from more than two dozen countries, including Australians, Indonesians, Britons, Americans and Swedes. The attack shook governments allied with the West; U.S. officials feared the bombing was part of a new global spasm of terrorist attacks. As the 10th anniversary neared this week, Indonesian police said they had detected a new terror threat, but the news didn’t seem to deter the crowds bearing candles and flowers Friday. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard insisted she wanted to be in Bali on the fateful date, remembering “the worst terrorist attack our nation has ever known.” “Perhaps there is a grim reassurance in knowing that the terrorists did not achieve what they set out to do,” Gillard said in a speech at the memorial service. “They did not undermine Indonesian democracy, which has only grown stronger across the passage of a decade. And though our vigilance is greater, we have not surrendered the freedoms that brought us here in the first place.” In the wake of the attack, Bali reeled economically as tourists steered clear of the island. Just as it began to recover, a second attack nearly three years later killed dozens of people, again shattering its sense of security. The Indonesian president at the time, Megawati Sukarnoputri, was accused of doing too little to combat extremism until it exploded into view. In response to the attack, the country passed new laws against terrorism. It pinned the crimes on a group tied to Al Qaeda and cracked down on the network. Three men were ultimately convicted and executed in connection with the 2002 attack; hundreds more alleged militants were arrested in a broader crackdown on terrorism across Indonesia. Like Gillard, sitting Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono declared that the bombing had failed to achieve its desired effect, arguing in a Sydney Morning Herald column that it galvanized the country to quash terror. Terror networks in Indonesia are now feeble and fractured, yet they are still at work, experts say. Extremists have hatched more than a dozen plots since 2010, the International Crisis Group said in a recent report. Though Indonesian police have foiled many of their attempts, the government hasn’t stopped terrorist groups from continuing to recruit new members, the group warned. Extremists can easily crisscross the country, buying airline tickets under false names, it said. Another militant group was discovered in Jakarta last month. Leery of returning to the restrictive rules in place under longtime autocrat Suharto, the government has also shied away from criminalizing speech that incites people to violence, said Sidney Jones, Asia program director for the International Crisis Group. Vandalizing churches or other lesser acts of violence have gone unpunished. “It becomes a green light to go on to further levels of violence,” Jones said.

A pony  bit me earlier.\\" As it happened, the bite was virtually painless: more the kind of small bite you might get from a naughty child. The pony responsible was queuing up for some ice cream in the car park near Haytor, and perhaps thought I'd jumped in ahead of him. The reason why the ponies here are naughty is that Haytor is a tourist-heavy area and tourists are constantly feeding the ponies foods, despite sighs asking them not to. By feeding the ponies, tourists increase the risk of them getting hit by a car, and make them harder to gather during the area's annual pony drift . The purpose of a pony drift is to gather them up so their health can be checked, the baby ones can be stooped from feeding on their mother's milk, and those who've gone beyond their limited area can be returned to their correct area. Some of them are also later sold, in order to limit the number of ponies according to the rules set by Natural England. Three weeks ago, I witnessed a small near-disaster a few mils west of here. While walking, I noticed a pony roll over on his back. \\"Hello!\\" I said to him, assuming he was just rolling for fun, but he was very still and, as I got closer, I saw him kicking his legs in the air and breathing heavily.

The Hokkaido Prefectural Police say that Yamato's comments in an hour-long interview jibed with what father Takayuki Tanooka and his wife told authorities about deciding to leave the boy alone in the forest for a few minutes on May 28 as punishment for throwing rocks; Yamato was found six days later. The AP reports the case may still be transferred to a local children's welfare center. A rep with the Hakodate Children's Welfare Center had no comment. As for Yamato being fine, the AP reports that while he went without food for the length of his time in the woods (tap water was available in the military training ground hut where he sought shelter), he suffered only mild dehydration and had some insignificant bruises on an arm and his legs. He told those gathered outside the hospital that he is eager to go back to school and take part in a school sports day. The BBC notes that in a Monday interview, the boy's father recounted a conversation he had with his child in which he apologized for making him \\"go though such a hard time.\\" The boy's reply, per Tanooka: \\"You are a good dad.

With television cameras focused on him, the resilient young survivor waved and assured a reporter, \\"I am fine.\\" On May 28, Yamato's parents left him alone in the forest as punishment for throwing rocks. Unable to find their son, they soon alerted the authorities, sparking a massive search operation that ended with Yamato being found six days later. The Hokkaido Prefectural Police interviewed Yamato and his parents, father Takayuki Tanooka and his wife, for an hour to determine the facts of the case. The consistency of their accounts regarding the incident led the police to rule out child-neglect charges. However, the Associated Press (AP) reports that the case may still be transferred to a local children's welfare center, as the Hakodate Children's Welfare Center remains tight-lipped on the matter. Yamato disappeared on May 28 after his parents decided to teach him a lesson for throwing rocks at people and cars. Intending to leave him in the forest for only a few minutes, they soon lost sight of their son, leading to a desperate search for the young boy supported by the authorities, volunteers, and the Japan Self-Defense Forces. On June 3, in a much-celebrated stroke of luck, Yamato was discovered in a hut on military training grounds approximately 5.5 kilometers from where he was initially abandoned. Yamato emerged from the ordeal relatively unscathed and in good health, having survived without food for the duration of his time in the woods. Tap water was available to him in the hut where he had sought shelter, which contributed to his well-being during his time alone. He only suffered mild dehydration and had a few insignificant bruises on his arm and legs, showing the incredible fortitude of the young boy. Yamato revealed his excitement to return to school and participate in a school sports day, undeterred by the harrowing experience. According to the BBC, the boy's father recalled a conversation he had with his son in which he apologized to Yamato for \\"making him go through such a hard time.\\" Remarkably, the boy's response to his father was, \\"You are a good dad.

Title: Pointless Review: The original 1976 film wasn't exactly a classic, in my opinion, so why on earth bother to do an almost shot for shot remake of a mediocre film? Perhaps it is the (mostly American) obsession with the Apocalypse and the End of Time (just read one of those dreadful, poorly written LEFT BEHIND books) that caused FOX to think this might be a money maker. It is slow, boreing, breaks no new ground and is an insult to the intelligence of the audience. A complete waste of time. Answer:","output":"The customer review suggests that the customer is decidedly dissatisfied with the product—in this case, presumably a film. They expressed this dissatisfaction through the use of critical language and negative phrases throughout the review. Here are some examples to highlight: 1. The title itself is a first indicator of dissatisfaction. It is marked as \\"Pointless\\", thereby explicitly showcasing the customer's disappointment with the film. 2. The reviewer does not deem the original 1976 film as a classic, implying their discontentment from the start, since they believe the remake is of a film they didn’t consider impressive to begin with.  3. A strong hint of dissatisfaction is found in the question \\"why on earth bother to do an almost shot for shot remake of a mediocre film?\\" Strong words like \\"why on earth\\" and \\"mediocre\\" reveal a lack of joy and approval. 4. When they mention that the film might have been made with the motive of making money, it signals a feeling of being exploited as an audience member. This is not a positive sentiment and suggests dissatisfaction. 5. The pace of the movie is described as \\"slow\\" and \\"boring\\", and the reviewer claims it \\"breaks no new ground\\". These are solid signs of a poor and dreary experience. 6. The reviewer states that the film is \\"an insult to the intelligence of the audience\\". This highlights the significant displeasure experienced, as they feel the film disrespected their intellect. 7. Lastly, the reviewer concludes the review by calling the film \\"A complete waste of time\\". This conclusive statement cements their overall dissatisfaction. Therefore, based on the language and critiques used throughout the review, it's clear that the customer did not enjoy their experience with this product and displays an evident dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Tracy Caulkins is known as the first American to set an American record and win an American title in each of four swimming strokes : breaststroke, butterfly, backstroke, freestyle. Tracy Caulkins was born in Minnesota and lived in Iowa until she was six. She began swimming when she was eight, after the family had moved to Nashville, Tennessee. While unwilling at first to swim in cold water or get her face wet, she began to train in earnest   as her talent became clear. Though her father worked for the public schools, the family sent her to a private school when the public schools could not accommodate   her training schedule. At age 13, Tracy Caulkins took part in the trials  for the 1976 Olympics, but did not make the team. She continued to win national and international titles, and was disappointed in 1980 when the U.S. didn't attend the Moscow Olympics. She continued to train and compete. In 1981, Tracy Caulkins began college, graduating in 1985. In college, she continued competing and training, though she had slowed down from her peak   years. Caulkins trained especially hard for the 1984 Olympics, and not only made the team, but was captain of the swim team and at Los Angeles, won three gold medals and was named Sportswoman of the Year by the U.S. Olympic Committee. After that she retired from swimming, and was a commentator   for swimming events as well as taking advantage of her fame to do business. Tracy Caulkins married Australian swimmer, Mark Stockwell, in 1991, their romance having begun at the 1984 Olympics when he jumped into a warm-up pool to introduce himself. They married in Nashville and moved to Australia, where they had three children. Caulkins continued to be professionally involved in sports. Question: When was Tracy Caulkins born?

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: On July 4, 1969, an unknown man attacks Darlene Ferrin and Mike Mageau with a handgun, at a lovers' lane in Vallejo, California. Mageau survives; Ferrin dies. One month later, the San Francisco Chronicle receives encrypted letters written by the killer calling himself the \\"Zodiac\\" and taunting the police. Political cartoonist Robert Graysmith is not taken seriously by crime reporter Paul Avery or the editors and is excluded from the initial details about the killings despite his interest in the case. When the newspaper publishes the letters, a married couple is able to decipher one. At a local bar, Avery initially makes fun of Graysmith before they discuss the coded letters. Graysmith interprets the letter, which Avery finds helpful, and Avery begins sharing information. The Zodiac killer attacks law student Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Shepard at Lake Berryessa in Napa County on September 27, 1969. Shepard dies two days later, and Hartnell survives. One of Graysmith's insights about the letters is that the Zodiac's reference to man as \\"the most dangerous animal of them all\\" is a reference to the story and film The Most Dangerous Game (which features General Zaroff as a man who hunts live human prey). The fact that both Zaroff's surname and the name \\"Zodiac\\" start with a \\"Z\\" also seems significant. Two weeks later, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is shot and killed in the city's Presidio Heights district immediately after dropping the killer off. The Zodiac killer mails pieces of Stine's blood stained shirt to the Chronicle, along with a taunting letter. San Francisco police detectives Dave Toschi and his partner Bill Armstrong are assigned to the Stine case, and work closely with Vallejo's Jack Mulanax and Captain Ken Narlow in Napa. The killer, or someone posing as him, continues to toy with authorities by sending more letters and speaks on the phone with lawyer Melvin Belli when he makes an appearance on a television talk show. Avery and Graysmith form an alliance, delving deeper into the case as... Answer:","output":"Cryptic Zodiac: The Hunt for a Notorious Killer"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. NASA launches Maven orbiter to probe mysteries in Mars' air Alan Boyle, Science Editor NBC News NASA launched its Maven orbiter on Monday to begin a journey that could unravel the mysteries surrounding Mars' past and current atmosphere — and perhaps reveal how the planet lost its life-friendly environment. A United Launch Alliance Atlas 5 rocket rose from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 41 in Florida at 1:28 p.m. ET, carrying the probe into space to kick off its 671 million mission. \\"Hey, guys, we're going to Mars!\\" Bruce Jakosky, a planetary scientist at the University of Colorado who serves as Maven's principal investigator, declared afterward. If all goes according to schedule, the bus-sized, 2.7-ton spacecraft will enter Martian orbit next September to study the Red Planet's upper atmosphere over the course of at least one Earth year. What happened on Mars?\\"Maven\\" is an acronym that stands for Mars Atmophere and Volatile EvolutioN. The mission's objective is to help scientists figure out how the Red Planet's environment changed from a warm, moist place into the chilly wasteland it is today. Previous missions — including NASA's Curiosity rover, which has been working on Red Planet's surface for more than a year — have found ample geological evidence that Mars had enough liquid water on its surface to be hospitable to life billions of years ago. That's not the case anymore. \\"Something clearly happened,\\" Jakosky said. Great egrets take flight as an Atlas 5 rocket blasts off from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Space Launch Complex 41 in Florida on Monday, carrying NASA's Maven spacecraft into space. The leading hypothesis is that Mars was too small to hang onto its global magnetic field over the long term. As a result, the planet lost the kind of magnetic shield that protects Earth's atmosphere from the damaging effects of solar radiation. In this scenario, electrically charged particles from the sun stripped away Mars' air from the top, leaving behind a carbon dioxide atmosphere that's only 1 percent as dense as Earth's. That kind of atmosphere can't retain heat, shield the surface from radiation or sustain liquid water. There are also hints that some of Mars' atmospheric CO2 was locked up as carbonates in the Red Planet's rocks. How much was stripped away from above, and how much was locked up below? \\"We can't go back and study what happened over 4 billion years,\\" Jakosky told reporters, \\"but we can go and look at how these processes are operating today, and how the processes have changed over time.\\" Maven's array of nine sensors, built into eight scientific instruments, can monitor the solar radiation hitting the top of Mars' atmosphere, gauge the current rate of atmospheric loss, and map the planet's localized, jumbled-up magnetic \\"umbrellas.\\" Scientists plan to factor in all those readings to produce better models for the global climate shift that swept over Mars — and changed the odds for life in the process. A team playerMaven won't be working in isolation: It will be joining three other orbiters and two surface rovers that are already on the job at Mars. Yet another orbiter — India's Mars Orbiter Mission, also known as the Mangalyaan probe — was launched earlier this month and is due to reach Martian orbit just after Maven's arrival. The teams for Maven and Mangalyaan plan to collaborate in their studies of the Red Planet's atmosphere. For instance, there's been some evidence that methane is being released into the Martian atmosphere, which could hint at biological activity. Curiosity hasn't detected any methane at the surface, and Maven won't be measuring methane because that doesn't mesh with the mission's scientific goals. But Mangalyaan can take a closer look at the methane question, and its results could add to Maven's models. Maven is destined to be a team player in another sense: NASA's current Mars orbiters are well into their extended missions, and if one of them fails, Maven can help with the task of relaying data between the rovers on the Martian surface and radio antennas back on Earth. That relay function was considered so essential that the Maven team was exempted from the effects of last month's government shutdown. The science team might give Maven yet another task: The spacecraft's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph could get pictures of Comet ISON, said the University of Colorado's Nick Schneider, who is the lead scientist for that instrument. \\"We should, if we have the time, get some really great observations,\\" he said. A key part of Maven's payload won't be used for observations at all, but will instead bring messages to Mars. The spacecraft carries a decorated DVD that contains the digital code for about 100,000 names, 377 student artworks and more than 1,100 haiku poems — all of which were submitted in response to the Maven team's public outreach campaign. One of the 17-syllable poems puts Maven's climate-centric mission into cosmic perspective: Amidst sand and starsWe scan a lifeless planetTo escape its fate Update for 5:45 p.m. ET Nov. 18: Mission managers voiced satisfaction over Maven's launch during a news briefing at NASA's Kennedy Space Center. \\"So far, so good,\\" said the mission's project manager, David Mitchell of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. The next major milestone comes on Dec. 3, when the Maven team plans to correct the spacecraft's trajectory if necessary and start activating its scientific instruments. Jakosky said Maven's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph could capture images of Comet ISON during the second week of December, after the comet's close encounter with the sun, \\"if everything goes smoothly.\\" Jakosky looked back at the years of effort he put into preparing for launch day. \\"After 10 years of doing this, I don't have the words to describe what I'm feeling,\\" he told reporters. \\"It's every possible emotion, but they're all positive.\\" That apparently wasn't the case before liftoff. \\"In the last 10 seconds before launch ... I was shaking,\\" Jakosky said. When he was asked whether the experience was comparable to the \\"seven minutes of terror\\" that the Curiosity rover's mission team experienced just before last year's landing, Jakosky kicked it up a notch. \\"I think for me, it's 10 years of terror,\\" he said. \\"There is no point at which you know it's occurred safely until it's occurred safely.\\" Jakosky joked that being the principal investigator for an interplanetary mission has been \\"the experience of a lifetime — and there's no way that I'll do it again.\\" NASA wants to do it again, however. The agency's administrator, Charles Bolden, praised the Maven team for giving the mission such a strong start while sticking within their budget. He said \\"I would hope that this mission will be a model for the ones that come after it,\\" including human trips to Mars beginning in the 2030s.

We do not know exactly how the hijackers gained access to the cockpit; FAA rules required that the doors remain closed and locked during flight. Ong speculated that they had \\"jammed their way\\" in. Perhaps the terrorists stabbed the flight attendants to get a cockpit key, to force one of them to open the cockpit door, or to lure the captain or first officer out of the cockpit. Or the flight attendants may just have been in their way. At the same time or shortly thereafter, Atta-the only terrorist on board trained to fly a jet-would have moved to the cockpit from his business-class seat, possibly accompanied by Omari. As this was happening, passenger Daniel Lewin, who was seated in the row just behind Atta and Omari, was stabbed by one of the hijackers-probably Satam al Suqami, who was seated directly behind Lewin. Lewin had served four years as an officer in the Israeli military. He may have made an attempt to stop the hijackers in front of him, not realizing that another was sitting behind him. The hijackers quickly gained control and sprayed Mace, pepper spray, or some other irritant in the first-class cabin, in order to force the passengers and flight attendants toward the rear of the plane. They claimed they had a bomb. About five minutes after the hijacking began, Betty Ong contacted the American Airlines Southeastern Reservations Office in Cary, North Carolina, via an AT&T airphone to report an emergency aboard the flight. This was the first of several occasions on 9/11 when flight attendants took action outside the scope of their training, which emphasized that in a hijacking, they were to communicate with the cockpit crew. The emergency call lasted approximately 25 minutes, as Ong calmly and professionally relayed information about events taking place aboard the airplane to authorities on the ground. At 8:19, Ong reported:\\"The cockpit is not answering, somebody's stabbed in business class-and I think there's Mace-that we can't breathe-I don't know, I think we're getting hijacked.\\" She then told of the stabbings of the two flight attendants. At 8:21, one of the American employees receiving Ong's call in North Carolina, Nydia Gonzalez, alerted the American Airlines operations center in Fort Worth, Texas, reaching Craig Marquis, the manager on duty. Marquis soon realized this was an emergency and instructed the airline's dispatcher responsible for the flight to contact the cockpit. At 8:23, the dispatcher tried unsuccessfully to contact the aircraft.

The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury.

Here are some concepts: bee, cluster, flower What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"Bees play a crucial role in pollinating a diverse array of flowering plants, where they gather in clusters to efficiently collect pollen and nectar, ultimately contributing to the overall health and beauty of both natural and cultivated ecosystems. To better understand the essential relationship between these three concepts, it is important to delve deeper into their individual roles and how they intertwine in the marvelous process of pollination. Bees are the primary pollinators in many ecosystems, facilitating the reproduction of various plant species. As they travel from one flower to another in search of food, they inadvertently transfer pollen onto the reproductive structures of the blooms. This exchange enables plants to produce seeds and fruit, ensuring the survival of various species and the continuation of genetic diversity within ecosystems. Different types of bees have evolved to specialize in pollinating specific plants, highlighting the intricate and delicate balance that exists between these creatures and their environment. Clusters, in this context, generally refer to groups of bees that gather together to achieve their objectives more effectively. They can be found working in concert to collect pollen and nectar or to build and maintain their hives. By clustering together, bees can communicate with one another, share information about food sources, and labor efficiently - ultimately enabling the colony to thrive. Clustering also provides protection, as bees can collectively respond to threats and defend their habitat when necessary. Flowers are the reproductive structures of plants, and they have evolved to be visually attractive and produce appealing scents to lure pollinators like bees. Within a flower, the pollen-producing anther is located near the pollen-receiving stigma, increasing the likelihood of successful pollination. Additionally, flowers offer nectar, a sweet, nutritious substance that serves as a vital food source for bees and other pollinators like butterflies and hummingbirds. As these creatures move from one flower to another in search of nourishment, they unwittingly transport pollen and contribute to the fertilization of other flowers, thereby ensuring the health and sustainability of their habitats. Thus, the sentence encompassing these concepts highlights the incredible dynamics at play between bees, clusters, and flowers in promoting the reproduction and survival of various plant species. This cooperative relationship is a prime example of the intricate connections between different organisms that enable the seamless functioning of the natural world."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: At what number did the album that did not include the man who got rights to The Wall chart in the UK and US? ?  In 1986, Gilmour began recruiting musicians for what would become Pink Floyd's first album without Waters, A Momentary Lapse of Reason. There were legal obstacles to Wright's re-admittance to the band, but after a meeting in Hampstead, Pink Floyd invited Wright to participate in the coming sessions. Gilmour later stated that Wright's presence \\"would make us stronger legally and musically\\", and Pink Floyd employed him as a musician with weekly earnings of 11,000. Recording sessions began on Gilmour's houseboat, the Astoria, moored along the River Thames. Gilmour worked with several songwriters, including Eric Stewart and Roger McGough, eventually choosing Anthony Moore to write the album's lyrics. Gilmour would later admit that the project was difficult without Waters' creative direction. Mason, concerned that he was too out-of-practice to perform on the album, made use of session musicians to complete many of the drum parts. He instead busied himself with the album's sound effects.A Momentary Lapse of Reason was released in September 1987. Storm Thorgerson, whose creative input was absent from The Wall and The Final Cut, designed the album cover. To drive home that Waters had left the band, they included a group photograph on the inside cover, the first since Meddle. The album went straight to number three in the UK and the US. Waters commented: \\"I think it's facile, but a quite clever forgery ... The songs are poor in general ... [and] Gilmour's lyrics are third-rate.\\" Although Gilmour initially viewed the album as a return to the band's top form, Wright disagreed, stating: \\"Roger's criticisms are fair. It's not a band album at all.\\" Q Magazine described the album as essentially a Gilmour solo album.Waters attempted to subvert the Momentary Lapse of Reason tour by contacting promoters in the US and threatening to sue them if they used the Pink Floyd name. Gilmour and Mason funded the start-up costs with Mason using his Ferrari 250 GTO as collateral. Early rehearsals for the upcoming tour were chaotic, with...

Answer the following question: This article: In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon.  Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days.  In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result. Elder Farrell promises that God will never stop loving her regardless of her mistakes. At a local ward luau, another missionary interviews Carl for baptism, teaching him the story of Ammon, a missionary who teaches a group of people  to give up their weapons and bury them deep in the ground, vowing never to use them again. The night before his baptism, Carl buries his weapons in the yard and Elder Lozano baptizes him the following day. contains an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people that Carl tracks down for saving his life?, what is it ? Answer:","output":"The full names of the people that Carl tracks down for saving his life in the Santa Monica, California scenario described in the article are Elder Farrell and Elder Lozano. It's implied within the article that these are their full names as it is customary for Mormon missionaries to be addressed as \\"Elder\\" followed by their last name. Elder Farrell is portrayed as a strict adherer to the rules while Elder Lozano, played by Ignacio Serricchio, is depicted as being on the verge of completing his missionary service. In the presented scenario, these two missionaries intervene in a gang drive-by shooting incident, resulting in Elder Lozano saving Carl, a wounded gang member. Reduced to a vulnerable state and indebted to the missionaries for saving his life, Carl seeks out Elder Farrell and Elder Lozano to express his gratitude after being discharged from the hospital. Notably, his appreciation is further deepened when Elder Lozano presents him with a Book of Mormon. This chain of events, initiated by Carl tracking down Elder Farrell and Elder Lozano, sets the stage for his subsequent exploration of the Mormon faith and his ultimate baptism."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: Anna Christie (1931) On its own terms, this version of Garbo's Anna Christie, shot a year later in German with a whole new cast, is just toned down and refined enough to work better than the English version (both are American MGM productions). Garbo is if anything more commanding (or more beautiful as a screen presence) and her acting is more restrained. And she seems frankly more at ease, probably for a lot of reasons, but we can speculate that she was no longer making her first talking picture, so had adjusted quickly. Without comparing always one film to the other, this Anna Christie is still the same O'Neill play with too many words. His themes of a woman wanting love without losing her independence are here, but it comes off as oddly old fashioned anyway. There are some scenes missing--the Coney Island section is shortened and isn't as good--but overall it's a direct echo of the first film. The director, Jacques Feyder (Belgian-French), is simply redoing what was done already, which I assume must be a frustrating experience. It's interesting to see both films in succession because they are blocked out exactly the same way (not only the sets, but the shots, are all the same). There is an occasional scene lifted from the earlier film--some of the storm, understandably, but also a brief scene where Marie Dressler (from the English language version) is walking with her friend on a plank over a canal, drunk as can be. But they are just silhouettes, and when the next scene shows their faces, we see the German actors taking their parts. There is no replacing Dressler, for sure, but for me the German father is more believable and honest in his performance. Clearly the themes--immigration, wayward fathers, daughters turning to prostitution, and the troubles of finding true love--have strong currents back then, especially with European threads (Garbo, appropriately, plays a Swedish young woman). What is the sentiment of this review? Available options: 1). negative 2). positive","output":"This review has a more positive sentiment. The reviewer mentions that this version of \\"Anna Christie\\" is toned down and refined, and Garbo's acting is more commanding and restrained compared to the English version. They also mention that some themes resonate strongly at the time of the movie. The review does note some weaknesses, but overall, the sentiment leans more towards positive.

Photographer: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg via Getty Images While the social and political consequences of racism might be familiar to convention viewers, they might be less aware of the financial cost of racial discrimination. Turns out, data suggests that it's not just people of color who would benefit financially from closing the racial wage gap in the United States: About 2 trillion in U.S. gross domestic product is lost because of race-based pay discrimination, research suggests. Both \\"The Business Case for Racial Equality,\\" a report published by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and \\"The Equity Solution: Racial Inclusion Is Key to Growing a Strong New Economy,\\" a study published by PolicyLink, estimate that America's GDP would increase by around 2 trillion annually — or by 14% — if the racial income gap were closed. There are a few explanations why that figure is so high. Lower wages overall generally translates into less consumption, which isn't good for businesses, and racial economic inequality can institutionalize racism by reinforcing fundamental political biases, PolicyLink argues. Furthermore, according to the W.K. Kellogg Foundation study, if people of color were to earn as much as white people in America, it would increase corporate profits and tax revenues — benefiting both the private and public sectors.

Moreover, the connection between the boy's celebration and the possible recycling of paint is not explicitly established.

For example, if the paint used in the celebration is mentioned to have been collected from a recycling center or if there is a reference to the paint being reused from previous occasions, then we might be able to establish a link between the premise and the hypothesis. However, as it stands, the premise alone does not offer enough information to reach a conclusion about the recycling of the paint. It is important to recognize that there could be alternative explanations for the boy's celebration with paint on his face and clothing. Some potential scenarios could include: 1. The paint is a part of a cultural or religious celebration, where using paint is customary. 2. The boy is participating in an art workshop or a school activity that involves putting paint on faces and clothing as a fun and creative form of expression. 3. The paint could be color powder used in an event like the Color Run, a paintball game, or something similar that is not necessarily related to recycling.

Nonetheless, he is held in high esteem, and delivers a congratulatory speech to the enraptured elves. Much to Steve's frustration, who has long anticipated succeeding his father, Santa announces he looks forward to his 71st. During their family Christmas dinner, Arthur's suggestion for the family to play a board game degenerates into a petty quarrel between Santa and Steve, while Grand-Santa, bored by retirement, resentfully criticises their over-modernisation. Distraught, the various family members leave the dinner table. When Arthur humbly compliments Steve that he believes he will be a great Santa Claus, Steve rudely dismisses Arthur's overture; later, their father shares with Mrs. Claus his grave doubts about his self-identity should he retire. Meanwhile, an elf named Bryony finds the missed presenta wrapped bicycle that has yet to be deliveredand alerts Steve and his elf-assistant to the problem. Arthur is alarmed when he recognises the present as a gift for Gwen, a little girl to whom he had personally replied. Arthur alerts his father, who is at a loss as to how to handle the situation; Steve argues that one missed present out of billions is an acceptable...

Single/multi-select question: Do the following sentences say the same thing? russia said the system is a clear threat to russian security. it is a serious threat to international security. Return your answer on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"not similar\\" and 5 is \\"very similar\\". Choose from: [-] 0. [-] 1. [-] 2. [-] 3. [-] 4. [-] 5.","output":"On the suggested scale, where 0 represents \\"not similar\\" and 5 represents \\"very similar\\", the similarity between these two sentences would be scored as a 1.  The two sentences do not convey the same message even though both involve the notion of security threats. A detailed breakdown of the two sentences would help us understand why they aren't the same. The first sentence - \\"Russia said the system is a clear threat to Russian security\\" - is very specific. It indicates that Russia perceives a certain 'system' as posing a clear and direct threat to its own national security. This sentence is subjective in that it provides Russia's perspective of the issue in question.  On the other hand, the second sentence - \\"It is a serious threat to international security\\" - is more universal in its focus. It is discussing the 'system' as a serious threat not only to one nation but to global or international security. This sentence is broader and more inclusive, as it implies a threat that has implications for multiple nations and perhaps the global community at large, instead of a specific threat to just one country, Russia, as is the case with the first sentence. Additionally, there is a difference in the severity of the threats described in the two sentences. The first sentence describes the threat as a 'clear' threat while the second sentence takes it a notch higher by describing it as a 'serious' threat. Overall, while there are superficial similarities in the sense that both sentences discuss a 'system' being a threat, the differences in perspective, in the scope of threat, and the severity of the threat make these sentences dissimilar in their meaning. Hence the low score of 1. The presence of a common theme of 'security threat' is the only reason the score is not closer to a '0'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Culture Club are an English band that was formed in 1981. The band comprised Boy George (lead vocals), Roy Hay (guitar and keyboards), Mikey Craig (bass guitar) and Jon Moss (drums and percussion). They are considered one of the most representative and influential groups of the 1980s. Culture Club sold more than 50 million albums and 100 million singles (including Boy George solo) records worldwide, including 7 million-records awards RIAA certificate in the United States. In 1981, Blitz Club regular Boy George occasionally sang with the group Bow Wow Wow under the stage name Lieutenant Lush. After his tenure with the group ended, George decided to start his own band and enlisted bassist Mikey Craig, drummer Jon Moss, and finally guitarist Roy Hay.  Realising they had an Irish gay man as the lead singer, a black Briton on bass, a blond Englishman on guitar and keyboards, and a Jewish drummer, they eventually decided to call themselves Culture Club. The group recorded demos, which were paid for by EMI Records, but the label was unimpressed and decided not to sign the group. Virgin Records heard the demos and signed the group in the UK, releasing their albums in Europe, while Epic Records released their albums in the United States and much of the rest of the world since Virgin did not have a US presence at the time. George began sporting a look inspired by Siouxsie Sioux with \\"heavy make-up and swaggy hair\\".  The band released two singles in May and June 1982, \\"White Boy\\" and \\"I'm Afraid of Me\\", though both failed to chart. In August the single \\"Mystery Boy\\" was released in Japan. In September of that year, the group released their third single, \\"Do You Really Want to Hurt Me\\", a reggae-influenced number, which became one of their biggest hits. The song went to No. 1 in the UK in late 1982 and became an international smash, peaking at No. 1 in over a dozen countries (No. 2 in the US), this track sold up to 6.5 million copies worldwide.  The band's 1982 debut on Top of the Pops created tabloid headlines, which focused on George's androgynous style of dress and sexual ambiguity. Magazines began to feature George prominently on their covers. Pete Burns, lead singer of the new wave band Dead or Alive, would later claim he was the first to wear braids, big hats, and colourful costumes, but George would cut back with a sharp-tongued remark, \\"It's not who did it first, it's who did it better.\\"  The band's debut album, Kissing to Be Clever (UK No. 5, US No. 14) was released in October 1982, and the follow-up single, \\"Time (Clock of the Heart)\\", became another Top 10 hit in the US (Number 2) and UK (Number 3). \\"I'll Tumble 4 Ya\\" also became a Top Ten hit in the US (Number 9) and in Canada. This gave Culture Club the distinction of being the first group since The Beatles to have three Top Ten hits in America from a debut album. Kissing to Be Clever sold over 1.5 million copies in the US, being certified platinum, and sold another 3 million worldwide at the time of its release.

Article: One year, a college in the Unites States announced that it would offer a lot of money for the pure white marigold . The high reward attracted so many people, but in the nature, besides golden, the marigold is brown, and it is not easy to get the white one. So after they were excited for a time, many people had forgotten the announcement. One normal day after 20 years, the college received a letter and 100 seeds of pure white marigold. It turned out to be an old woman of over 70 years old. Some experts in the college doubted it , but in order not to let her down, those seeds finally took root  in the earth. The miracle appeared after one year: the field was covered by pure white marigold. Therefore, the old woman who was always unknown to the public became a new _ . The old woman was a flower-lover. When she read the announcement 20 years ago, she got very excited like others. But her right children were totally against her decision. After all, a woman who never knew the seed genetics  couldn't complete what the experts could never do, so her thought was only a day dream. Still, the old woman didn't change her mind and went on working. She planted some of the most common seeds and took good care of them. A year later, when the marigold came out, she chose one faintest  from those golden and brown flowers and get the best seed. The next year, she again grew them and chose.... Day after day, year after year, through many seasons, the old woman's husband died, her children flew far and high, a lot of things happened in her life, but only the desire to grow the pure white marigold took root in her heart. Finally, after 20 years on the day we all know, in the garden she saw a marigold which was not nearly white, but as white as sliver or snow. A problem even experts couldn't deal with was solved by an old woman who didn't understand genetics. Wasn't it a miracle? To take root in the heart, even the most common seed can grow into a miracle!

This story highlights the unwavering determination and perseverance of an old woman who, despite not having any expertise in genetics, was able to achieve what experts with knowledge and resources could not - cultivating a pure white marigold. Her strong desire and commitment to her dream drove her to work tirelessly, year after year, against all odds and opposition from her children. As the story unfolds, it demonstrates the power of an individual's dreams and the miracles that can result when one remains steadfast and dedicated. The old woman's love for flowers and her refusal to be deterred by her lack of expertise in the field ultimately led her to achieve the seemingly impossible goal of developing a pure white marigold. This extraordinary accomplishment became a symbol of hope and inspiration to many, showing that even the most common seed can indeed grow into a miracle when rooted in the heart. In conclusion, this passage emphasizes the importance of holding on to dreams, irrespective of one's knowledge or background. It serves as a testament to the resilience and strength of the human spirit, showing that when we believe in ourselves and remain committed to our goals, we can achieve greatness and create a lasting impact on the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As with Monday, I've focused on getting them out as quickly as possible rather than taking extra time to re-organize them by subject. Enron's business has been grouped into three buckets:  Core, Non-core, and Under Review. Core:  Wholesale energy business in North America and Europe, retail energy, pipelines Non-core:  Broadband, water, and international assets (i.e. EGAS). Enron has approx. 8Bn in investments in these assets, and they have produced 'dismal' returns. Enron will be exiting these businesses and will attempt to wind them up in an orderly fashion. An aggressive divestiture program has been set in motion for these assets. Under Review:  EGM, EIM. These businesses are being closely examined to determine whether they have a reasonable chance of long-term viability. Required resource levels are being carefully studied. Following review, Enron will move the different portions of these businesses to core or non-core as the analysis dictates. Approximately 800MM of asset sales are under contract and expected to close in the fourth quarter. These include a gas LDC in Brazil, EcoElectrica, and our Indian E&P assets. Enron is in active pursuit of an additional private equity infusion of 500MM-1Bn. Given the current environment, raising equity in the public markets would be 'inefficient', McMahon says. Short-term liquidity is provided by the 3Bn of credit drawn upon a few weeks ago, the 1Bn of new debt, and the 1.5Bn equity infusion from Dynegy. Longer-term, the proceeds from the sale of PGE will provide liquidity. Asset sales over the next year will be used to pay down debt. McMahon described the major off-balance-sheet vehicles: Marlin was set up to hold Azurix assets. It was initially capitalized with 950MM of 144a debt and 125MM of equity (raised from Enron and institutional investors). The debt is supported by the equity and by Azurix' assets. Enron is obligated to cover any deficit at the time the debt becomes due on 3/17/03 (the 'Enron topup' obligation). The 3/17/03 date is accelerated in the event that Enron is rated below-investment-grade by any one of the three major agencies. The primary asset of Marlin is Wessex Water. As long as Wessex is worth at least 2.6Bn, there will be no Enron topup required. If we take a 25% haircut to present book value, Enron will have to provide 650MM in consideration upon retirement of the debt. This 650MM would hit Enron cash, income, and equity balances. Osprey contains energy-related assets and 'other assets'. It was initially capitalized with 2.4Bn of 144a debt and 220MM in equity (ENE and institutionals). As with Marlin, the entity is an asset-backed structure with an Enron topup guarantee. The debt is supported by a) the assets; b) 1Bn of convertible preferred ENE (convertible into 50MM shares of ENE common); and c) additional ENE common as needed for topup. Assuming the same 25% hypothetical haircut to current book value, Enron would have to deliver approx. 600MM of topup funds--which would hit ENE cash, income, and equity. The debt must be retired by 9/17/02, with the same cut-to-junk early trigger provision as Marlin.

Background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Patricia was from Brazil..","output":"When Emily told Patricia they look like Adriana Lima when they were at the beach, it was because Patricia was from Brazil (Option II).  Adriana Lima is a famous Brazilian model who has become a symbol of beauty and success in the fashion world. People from Brazil, and around the globe, admire her breathtaking beauty, charm, and achievements, which have placed her among the industry's top models. In this scenario, Emily, who is quite perceptive and knowledgeable about popular culture, recognized that Patricia bears a striking resemblance to Adriana Lima, the world-renowned Brazilian supermodel. This recognition may have come from various aspects of Patricia's appearance, such as her facial features, body structure, or even her demeanor. When they were at the beach, Emily likely observed these similarities, and being the forthcoming person she is, felt the need to let Patricia know that she sees a bit of Adriana Lima in her. Emily's choice to draw this comparison could have also stemmed from a sense of pride in their shared Brazilian nationality and an acknowledgement of the accomplishments of their compatriots. Since Patricia hails from Brazil, she may have displayed a similar sense of pride and affinity to the country's cultural icons. The beach setting, with its relaxed atmosphere and sunny skies, presented the perfect opportunity for such a light-hearted and upbeat exchange of ideas between Emily and Patricia. Additionally, complimenting someone by comparing them to a famous icon like Adriana Lima could boost their self-esteem and make them feel good about themselves. This comparison could have also emphasized the characteristics and qualities that Patricia and Adriana share beyond appearances, such as determination, confidence, and poise. In making this flattering remark, Emily possibly wanted to encourage Patricia to embrace her beauty and individuality while also reminding her of the strong and empowering nature shared by Brazilian women. In conclusion, Emily told Patricia they look like Adriana Lima when they were at the beach due to Patricia's Brazilian background (Option II). This observation highlights the physical resemblances between the two women, celebrates the achievements of a fellow Brazilian, and fosters a sense of pride, confidence, and empowered identity within Patricia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Montevideo: According to the census survey carried out between 15 June and 31 July 2004, Montevideo had a population of 1,325,968 persons, compared to Uruguay's total population of 3,241,003. The female population was 707,697 (53.4%) while the male population accounted for 618,271 (46.6%). The population had declined since the previous census carried out in 1996, with an average annual growth rate of −1.5 per thousand. Continual decline has been documented since the census period of 1975–1985, which showed a rate of −5.6 per thousand. The decrease is due in large part to lowered fertility, partly offset by mortality, and to a smaller degree in migration. The birth rate declined by 19% from 1996 (17 per thousand) to 2004 (13.8 per thousand). Similarly, the total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 2.24 in 1996 to 1.79 in 2004. However, mortality continued to fall with life expectancy at birth for both sexes increasing by 1.73 years. Please answer a question about this article.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Porky's Context: A group of Florida high school students plan on losing their virginity. They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap.

Perhaps our \\"eh\\" experience was magnified because we arrived at Bomberos right after having dined at Postino for dinner.  The huge difference between the quality of service was hard to miss!  Our group of 6 was quickly seated, and the hostess was kind enough to turn up the heater to make sure we were warm enough.  That was the highlight of the service.  Now, the service was definitely not rude... it wasn't inconsiderate... it was just... well... not very good.  Our waitress (and apparently the chef) could not tell us the ingredients in any of the desserts.  Even though they source their desserts from Tammie Coe, why don't they know what is in them?  For people with allergies, this can make or break a meal.  Since we couldn't confirm the ingredients, my husband had to make do with a coffee, while I indulged in the Creme Brulee.  It was good.  Pleasant, but certainly nothing spectacular.  The few times our waitress came by to check on our group, she seemed to have strange timing... like she didn't really know how to leave... she just sort of stood there a few seconds too long, until it was slightly awkward.  Strange.  Then, we wouldn't see her for large stretches of time... we were getting thirsty with no water refills!

Comparison to another location: The review begins by unfavorably comparing the dining experience at Bomberos to a previous dinner at Postino, setting a negative precedent. 2. Quality of Service: The reviewer states that the service was not very good. Though they mention that it wasn't rude or inconsiderate, they express dissatisfaction with the waitress's lack of knowledge regarding the dessert ingredients and her overall service. 3. Food Allergies Concern: The reviewer's concern about the lack of information regarding the ingredients in the desserts can be seen as a negative point, especially for customers with food allergies. 4. Timing and Absence of the Waitress: The awkward timing of the waitress and her unavailability for large stretches are mentioned as negative aspects of the service. 5. Lack of Water Refills: This hints at inadequate service, thereby adding to the negative tone of the review. Although there are some positive comments about the ambiance and the outdoor patio, these are outweighed by the negatives regarding the service.

Answer a question about this article: Though known since antiquity the commercial growing of cotton in Egypt only started in 1820's, following a Frenchman, by the name of M. Jumel, propositioning the then ruler, Mohamed Ali Pasha, that he could earn a substantial income by growing an extra-long staple Maho (Barbadence) cotton, in Lower Egypt, for the French market. Mohamed Ali Pasha accepted the proposition and granted himself the monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt; and later dictated cotton should be grown in preference to other crops. By the time of the American Civil war annual exports had reached 16 million (120,000 bales), which rose to 56 million by 1864, primarily due to the loss of the Confederate supply on the world market. Exports continued to grow even after the reintroduction of US cotton, produced now by a paid workforce, and Egyptian exports reached 1.2 million bales a year by 1903. When did cotton begin to be commercially grown in Egypt?","output":"Cotton began to be commercially grown in Egypt in the 1820s. This shift toward commercial cultivation was prompted by a proposition from a Frenchman named M. Jumel, who suggested to the ruler at that time, Mohamed Ali Pasha, that growing extra-long staple Maho (Barbadence) cotton in Lower Egypt could yield significant income for the French market. Consequently, Mohamed Ali Pasha embraced the idea, established a monopoly on the sale and export of cotton in Egypt, and even prioritized its cultivation over other crops.

His father, Basil Fanshawe \\"Joe\\" Jagger (13 April 1913 - 11 November 2006), and grandfather, David Ernest Jagger, were both teachers. His mother, Eva Ensley Mary (nee Scutts; 6 April 1913 - 18 May 2000), born in Sydney, Australia, of English descent, was a hairdresser and an active member of the Conservative Party. Jagger's younger brother, Chris (born 19 December 1947), is also a musician. Jagger's relationship with bandmate Keith Richards is frequently described as \\"love/hate\\" by the media. Richards himself said in a 1998 interview: \\"I think of our differences as a family squabble. If I shout and scream at him, it's because no one else has the guts to do it or else they're paid not to do it. At the same time I'd hope Mick realises that I'm a friend who is just trying to bring him into line and do what needs to be done.\\"  The Rolling Stones album Dirty Work (UK No. 4; US No. 4) was released in March 1986 to mixed reviews, despite the presence of the US top five hit \\"Harlem Shuffle\\". With relations between Richards and Jagger at a low, Jagger refused to tour to promote the album, and instead undertook his own solo tour, which included Rolling Stones songs. Richards has referred to this period in his relations with Jagger as \\"World War III\\". As a result of the animosity within the band at this time, they almost broke up. Jagger's solo records, She's the Boss (UK No. 6; US No. 13) (1985) and Primitive Cool (UK No. 26; US No. 41) (1987), met with moderate success, and in 1988, with the Rolling Stones mostly inactive, Richards released his first solo album, Talk Is Cheap (UK No. 37; US No. 24). It was well-received by fans and critics, going gold in the US. The following year 5x5: The Continuing Adventures of the Rolling Stones, a documentary spanning the career of the band was released for their 25th anniversary.  Richards' autobiography, Life, was released on 26 October 2010. According to a 15 October 2010 article published by the Associated Press, Richards described Jagger as \\"unbearable\\" within the book, noting that their relationship has been strained \\"for decades\\". By 2015, Richards' opinion had softened, while still calling Jagger a \\"snob\\" (providing supporting evidence from Jagger's daughter Georgia Mae), he adds \\"I still love him dearly ... your friends don't have to be perfect.\\" what are some of the disputes they had?","output":"Some of the disputes between Mick Jagger and Keith Richards were like a family squabble. They had differences and sometimes shouted and screamed at each other. When the Rolling Stones album Dirty Work was released, their relationship was at a low point, and Jagger even refused to tour to promote the album.

Context: Happened to me while visiting Chicago a few weeks ago. A young couple with a baby in a pram boarded a crowded bus. The bus driver would not pull out of the stop until the pram was secured in the wheelchair chocks, however an elderly women wouldn’t give up her seat (seat needed to be folded up in order to make room for the pram in the wheelchair holding apparatus). We sat there for about 4–5 minutes while the driver, the mother and the elderly lady argued. At the end, my wife and I offered our seats (more like a commanding, cajoling, what-she-wanted-to hear, kind of discourse), and the lady moved into our seats. The young couple locked down their pram, and the bus took off. Meg and I stood for the rest of the trip. She was really annoyed over having to move, and there was some baggage attached to her situation—I hate to have to mention the racial aspects here but it’s an important aspect of the story. Most of the passengers were younger white folks (bus was heading through a neighborhood where re-gentrification had taken place). The elderly woman was at least 75 years and the only black person in the front of the crowded bus. She was sitting in a designated seat reserved for elderly or handicapped, and obviously she had earned her status to claim that seat. Unfortunately, it was also the one seat that needed to be vacated if the wheelchair equipment got used. As the bus rode on, her anger simmered.

The team members are sent down via an old mine shaft operated by the old, mysterious Ed Oswald. The group discovers Rebecca's mutilated body, causing Sarah to have flashbacks of the crawlers and causing Vaines to believe Sarah may be responsible for the girls' disappearance.  While crawling through a tunnel, she attacks Vaines and the others, causing the others to split up. Vaines runs to search for Sarah, and in the process is surprised by a crawler, and fires his gun in a panic, causing a minor collapse in the cavern which traps Cath, separating her from Rios, Dan, and Greg.

I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again. I definitely trust him, and he actually was being playful, but otherwise that has been the only “real” hitch we have come across.

This desire is not shared by Nader, who is concerned for his father, who lives with the family and suffers from Alzheimer's disease. When Nader determines to stay in Iran, Simin files for divorce. The family court judges the couple's problems insufficient to warrant divorce and rejects Simin's application. She leaves her husband and daughter and moves back in with her parents. On the recommendation of Simin, Nader hires Razieh, a young, deeply religious woman from a poor suburb, to take care of his father while he is at work. Razieh has applied for the job without consulting her hot-tempered husband, Hodjat, whose approval, according to tradition, would have been required. Her family is financially dependent on the job, and she takes her daughter to the house with her.

Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November. Dems are just playing games, have no intention of doing anything to solves this decades old problem. We can pass great legislation after the Red Wave!\\" Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Republican representing a majority Hispanic district in the state of Florida, who is not running for re-election, termed the president's tweets \\"schizoid policy making.\\" Another retiring lawmaker, Republican Congressman Mark Sanford of South Carolina, a frequent Trump critic who recently lost his primary election, said Trump's reversal sends \\"a horrifically chilling signal\\" that \\"makes immigration reform that much more unlikely.\\" On Saturday, California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris spoke in Otay Mesa, a community in San Diego, at a rally for revised immigration policies. \\"This is a fight born out of knowing who we are and fighting for the ideals of our country,\\" she said.

Given the question: WASHINGTON — In 2004, Desmond Meade, while serving a 15-year prison sentence for a drug offense in Florida, got a break. An appeals court returned his conviction to the original trial bench, allowing him to plead guilty to a lesser charge and get out of prison in three years, most of which he had already served. But his freedom came with a price, something that didn’t quite register with him at the time: as part of his plea agreement with prosecutors, Meade agreed to give up his civil rights: the right to vote, to serve on a jury and to run for office. “At the time, when I first accepted the plea deal, I didn’t understand the consequences,” Meade says. Fourteen years and a pair of college and law degrees later, Meade, now 50, still can’t vote; his application to regain his civil rights was rejected in 2011. The reason: a new Florida law that requires felons like him to wait for seven years before they could apply for rights restoration. Home to nearly a quarter of the nation's disenfranchised felons, Florida has become a battleground in a national debate over felony disenfranchisement laws. With lawmakers deeply divided over the issue, Meade says he wants the state’s voters to change the system when they head to the polls on Nov. 6. He’s promoting a ballot initiative that would amend the state's constitution, restoring the voting rights of all felons in Florida (except those convicted of murder and sexual assault) after they’ve completed the terms of their sentence. The measure enjoys broad voter support. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in February showed that 67 percent of Floridians were in favor of restoring the voting rights of felons other than those convicted of murder and sexual assault. Another poll showed support at 71 percent. “We’re going to change the system,” Meade says confidently. “What we’re doing is taking the power out of the hands of politicians and we’re allowing the citizens of the state of Florida to decide whether or not folks should have a second chance, to be able to vote.” Who got a law degree?

A series of murders of rich young women throughout the area of Globe, Arizona bear the distinctive signature of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people's homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, who was her then boyfriend. Joan and Paul have a daughter, Danielle, together. Paul, installing equipment at Dr. Sutter's home, proximal to the most-recent murder, is approached by Detective Mendoza-- they have a cordial conversation about sound equipment, but it turns abruptly, when Mendoza asks Paul if he still hunts. Mendoza questions Paul about whether he knew the victim, and then asks him about the tires on his van-- a tread pattern that has been located at the scene of the murder. Mendoza meets with his partner Phil at the police station, where Phil has gathered criminal record information on Paul-- they speculate on what kind of person he might be based on that information.

Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust Answer:","output":"The final step in the process you provided is a phase of the geological process linked to the phenomena of volcanoes and plate tectonics, and is a part of Earth's rock cycle. The process you're describing is essentially the birth of new land - the formation of new crust upon the Earth's surface following a volcanic eruption.  After the previous steps, where magma has risen through cracks in the Earth's crust, caused intense pressure leading to the movement of tectonic plates, and then erupted onto the surface, the next step is cooling and solidification.  The erupting magma, expelled as lava, can flow over a large area depending on the viscosity and quantity of the eruption. As this molten rock is exposed to the Earth's relatively cooler atmosphere and environment, it gradually solidifies. This process is sometimes rapid, resulting in the creation of volcanic glass called obsidian, while at other times it's slower, forming various types of igneous rocks like basalt or pumice.  This formation of new crust essentially extends the Earth's surface, covering the previous landscape with a new layer of solid rock, creating new mountains, plateaus, or filling in valleys depending on the eruption’s magnitude and the surrounding landscape. This fresh layer can eventually become fertile ground for life, as weathering breaks down the rocks and forms soil, capable of supporting plant life, which over eons of time, through the process of life, death, and decay, can transform the sterile landscape created by the volcanic eruption into a vital ecosystem.  As the subsequent eras ensue, this new land will undergo natural processes of weathering, erosion, and plate tectonics, which will in time modify the landscape. It might eventually be buried under sedimentary layers, subjected to the enormous forces and heat at plate boundaries, and potentially be recycled back into the Earth's mantle, where it can melt back into magma, and restart the cycle all over again. So, the final step in the process you've outlined is the solidification and integration of the newly erupted lava into the Earth's crust, leading to the formation of new land landscapes that can support life, contributing to the ever-changing dynamics of the Earth's geological and ecological systems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Question: \\"What was leased from royal landlords?\\"  Context: \\"Various owners leased it from royal landlords and the freehold was the subject of frenzied speculation during the 17th century. By then, the old village of Eye Cross had long since fallen into decay, and the area was mostly wasteland. Needing money, James I sold off part of the Crown freehold but retained part of the site on which he established a 4-acre (16,000 m2) mulberry garden for the production of silk. (This is at the northwest corner of today's palace.) Clement Walker in Anarchia Anglicana (1649) refers to \\"new-erected sodoms and spintries at the Mulberry Garden at S.

A 'road rage' murder suspect has claimed that he was acting in self-defense when he shot dead a 44-year-old mother last month. Erich Nowsch, 19, was arrested last Friday, a little more than a week after Tammy Meyers was fatally wounded by gunfire that police say came from a silver car that pursued the nurse and her 22-year-old son, Brandon Meyers, to the cul-de-sac outside their Las Vegas home. However Nowsch's lawyers, brothers Conrad Claus and Augustus Claus, said after their client's first court appearance on Monday that they  don't believe the case involved road rage. The lawyers plan to review police reports and video evidence before talking more about Nowsch's defense. Scroll down for video. Erich Nowsch Jr. appears in a Las Vegas courtroom for his initial court appearance on Monday in Las Vegas. Nowsch remains jailed following his arrest on Friday on murder, attempted murder and other charges in the February 12 shooting that fatally wounded 44-year-old Tammy Meyers outside her home. Robert Meyers, left, the widower of Tammy Meyers, attends a hearing for his wife's accused killer, Erich Nowsch Jr. in court on Monday. Nowsch's lawyers told ABC that they believe he was acting in self-defense. They later told CNN that Tammy Meyer's son, Brandon, pointed a gun at Nowsch before the shooting began and said that his client had received death threats. However the victim's husband, Robert Meyers, said he thinks his wife realized she was in danger, and was fatally wounded after trying to lure a vehicle and motorist who threatened her away from her home. That's not road rage, that's intentional, Meyers said in an interview  after a court appearance by the suspect, his 19-year-old neighbor, Erich Milton Nowsch Jr. 'My wife was followed home and murdered,' Meyers said. Meyers' theory adds yet another dimension to a case already marked by stunning revelations and conflicting accounts from police and the Meyers family. Initially, the family said Tammy Meyers was shot in the head after a confrontation with another motorist while she drove her teenage daughter home from a late-night driving lesson at a neighborhood school. The public was told that Brandon Meyers grabbed his gun and came out of the house, firing back at the fleeing silver car. Last week, family members and police revealed that Tammy Meyers dropped her daughter at home and went back out with her son and the family's green Buick Park Avenue sedan to find the motorist who frightened her earlier. Erich Nowsch Jr appears in a Las Vegas court on Monday. A March 10 preliminary hearing will determine if he should stand trial. What followed was a tire-squealing confrontation with a silver car and gunfire several blocks from the Meyers home. No one was injured. Then, the fatal shooting on the cul-de-sac several houses from the Meyers home. 'I don't know what she saw,' Robert Meyers said on Monday. 'She's dead. I can't ask her. But this was intentional - to kill the person in the green car.' Mr Meyers said that the story of what happened that night has been so confused as all the facts didn't come out immediately. He told ABC: 'My son was very hurt, thinking I was going to blame him for his mom going down, and he didn’t come forward with all the things.' Mr Meyers said his daughter has helped him get a clearer picture of what went on. According to the widower, a suspect, who is still at large, stood in front of the hood of his wife's car and threatened to kill her and his daughter. Mr Meyers added: 'And after that, my daughter said my wife spun out to get away from this guy right on this street. 'My daughter said my wife was going as fast as she could. ... My wife was as great driver. She came from a good stock of drivers.' Las Vegas police aren't commenting about the changing accounts, and aren't addressing whether Tammy Meyers' death resulted from a random road-rage shooting as it first appeared. Captain Christopher Tomaino told the media Friday that police were still looking for an accomplice who was with Nowsch, and questions about the case will eventually be answered. Robert Meyers, 49, was out of state when the shooting happened. He said on Monday his wife and Nowsch knew each other — well enough for the teen to hitch up his saggy shorts when Tammy Meyers approached him in the neighborhood park, so she wouldn't have to tell him to do so. It's not clear if they recognized each other during the shootings. Robert Meyers said Nowsch was probably familiar with the family's Buick, but might not have seen it since the windows were tinted dark last summer. Nowsch is charged with murder, attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle. He did not speak and did not enter a plea when he appeared in a Las Vegas court on Monday. A March 10 preliminary hearing will determine if he should stand trial. Clark County District Attorney Steve Wolfson would then decide whether to seek the death penalty. 'Nothing is off the table,' he told KTNV. Police said Nowsch told friends he was at the park and became alarmed by a vehicle he thought was following him, so he called a friend to pick him up. Las Vegas police say Nowsch bragged to his friends several hours after the shooting that he 'got those kids, they were after me, and I got them'. Nowsch showed his friends a .45-caliber handgun and told them he fired several shots in the first encounter and 22 shots in the cul-de-sac, according to the police report. Robert Meyers and police said Brandon Meyers fired three shots during the second shooting. It wasn't clear if he hit a silver Audi with Nowsch and at least one other person inside, police said. Nowsch (left) is charged with the murder of Tammy Meyers (left and right), attempted murder and firing a weapon from a vehicle last month. Nowsch lived with his single mother and her one-month-old daughter about a block from the Meyers family home. Tammy Meyers served as a mother figure to youngsters about the same age as her children, now 15 to 22 years old, Meyers said, and two Meyers sons attended high school with Nowsch. Meyers said that at least once, Tammy Meyers gave the teen 20 when he said he was hungry. Meyers also recalled Nowsch earning pocket money washing cars outside the Meyers family home. The teen and the neighborhood mom may have seen each other in passing the weekend of February 7-8, when Tammy Meyers walked the family dogs in the park where Nowsch often sat at a picnic bench with other teens, Robert Meyers said. 'Bunch of troublemakers,' Robert Meyers said. 'I wouldn't allow my kids to hang out with them.' But he denied there was any bad blood. Las Vegas police spokesman Larry Hadfield said investigators are still trying to locate the silver vehicle's driver, who has not been identified. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"19-year-old Erich Nowsch, a road rage murder suspect, claims he was acting in self-defense when he fatally shot a 44-year-old mother last month.

He is also known for \\"Teitlebaum's Window\\" (1970), a comic novel about a Jewish boy growing up in Brooklyn in the 1930s and 1940s. Markfield was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1965 after the publication of \\"To an Early Grave\\".  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Herbert Sargent ( July 15 , 1923 -- May 6 , 2005 ) was an American television writer , a producer for such comedy shows as The Tonight Show and Saturday Night Live , and a screenwriter ( Bye Bye Braverman ) . During his tenure at Saturday Night Live , he and Chevy Chase created Weekend Update , the longest - running sketch in the show 's history , and one of the longest running sketches on television .  - A television set, more commonly called a television, TV, TV set, television receiver, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and loudspeakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as Betamax, VHS and later DVD. It was also the display device for the first generation of home computers (e.g., Timex Sinclair 1000) and video game consoles (e.g., Atari) in the 1980s. In the 2010s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays, especially LED-backlit LCDs, largely replaced cathode ray tubes and other displays.  - NeWS (Network extensible Window System) is a discontinued windowing system developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1980s. Originally known as \\"SunDew\\", its primary authors were James Gosling and David S. H. Rosenthal. The NeWS interpreter was based on PostScript (as was the later Display PostScript, although the two projects were otherwise unrelated) extending it to allow interaction and multiple \\"contexts\\" to support windows. Like PostScript, NeWS could be used as a complete programming language, but unlike PostScript, NeWS could be used to make complete interactive programs with mouse support and a GUI.  - Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912  January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century.  - Sketch comedy comprises a series of short comedy scenes or vignettes, called \\"sketches\\", commonly between one and ten minutes long. Such sketches are performed by a group of comic actors or comedians, either on stage or through an audio or visual medium such as radio and television. Often sketches are first improvised by the actors and written down based on the outcome of these improv sessions; however, such improvisation is not necessarily involved in sketch comedy.  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - Laughter is a physical reaction in humans and some other species of primate, consisting typically of rhythmical, often audible contractions of the diaphragm and other parts of the respiratory system. It is a response to certain external or internal stimuli. Laughter can arise from such activities as being tickled, or from humorous stories or thoughts. Most commonly, it is considered a visual expression of a number of positive emotional states, such as joy, mirth, happiness, relief, etc. On some occasions, however, it may be caused by contrary emotional states such as embarrassment, apology, or confusion such as nervous laughter or courtesy laugh. Age, gender, education, language, and culture are all factors as to whether a person will experience laughter in a given situation.  - Live television is a television production broadcast in real-time, as events happen, in the present. Shows broadcast live include newscasts, morning shows, awards shows, sports programs, and, occasionally, episodes of television series. Live television was more common until the late 1950s, when videotape technology was invented. Because of the prohibitive cost, adoption was slow, and some television show remained live until the 1970s, such as soap operas. To prevent unforeseen issues, live television programs may be delayed, which allows censors to edit the program. Some programs may be broadcast live in certain time zones and delayed in others.  - Entertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight. It can be an idea or a task, but is more likely to be one of the activities or events that have developed over thousands of years specifically for the purpose of keeping an audience's attention. Although people's attention is held by different things, because individuals have different preferences in entertainment, most forms are recognisable and familiar. Storytelling, music, drama, dance, and different kinds of performance exist in all cultures, were supported in royal courts, developed into sophisticated forms and over time became available to all citizens. The process has been accelerated in modern times by an entertainment industry that records and sells entertainment products. Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience.  - Television or TV is a telecommunication medium used for transmitting moving images in monochrome (black-and-white), or in color, and in two or three dimensions and sound. It can refer to a television set, a television program (\\"TV show\\"), or the medium of television transmission. Television is a mass medium, for entertainment, education, news, and advertising.  - A television program is a segment of content intended for broadcast on over-the-air, cable television, or Internet television, other than a commercial, trailer, or any other segment of content not serving as attraction for viewership. It may be a single production, or more commonly, a series of related productions (also called a television series or a television show).  - A variety show, also known as variety arts or variety entertainment, is entertainment made up of a variety of acts (hence the name), especially musical performances and sketch comedy, and is normally introduced by a compère (master of ceremonies) or host. Other types of acts include magic, animal and circus acts, acrobatics, juggling, and ventriloquism. The variety format made its way from Victorian era stage to radio to television. Variety shows were a staple of anglophone television from its early days (late 1940s) into the 1980s.  - Lorne Michaels (born Lorne Lipowitz; November 17, 1944) is a Canadian-American television producer, writer, comedian, and actor, best known for creating and producing \\"Saturday Night Live\\", and producing the \\"Late Night\\" series (since 1993), and \\"The Tonight Show\\" (since 2014).  - The Colbert Report is an American late-night talk and news satire television program hosted by Stephen Colbert that aired four days a week on Comedy Central from October 17, 2005 to December 18, 2014 for 1,447 episodes. The show focused on a fictional anchorman character named Stephen Colbert, played by his real-life namesake. The character, described by Colbert as a \\"well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot\\", is a caricature of televised political pundits. Furthermore, the show satirized conservative personality-driven political talk programs, particularly Fox News' \\"The O'Reilly Factor\\". \\"The Colbert Report\\" is a spin-off of Comedy Central's \\"The Daily Show\\", where he acted as a correspondent for the program for several years while developing the character.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - Stand-up comedy is a comic style in which a comedian performs in front of a live audience, usually speaking directly to them. The performer is commonly known as a comic, stand-up comic, stand-up comedian, or simply a stand-up. In stand-up comedy, the comedian usually recites a grouping of humorous stories, jokes and one-liners typically called a monologue, routine, or act. Some stand-up comedians use props, music, or magic tricks to \\"enhance\\" their acts. Stand-up comedy is often performed in comedy clubs, bars and pubs, nightclubs, neo-burlesques, colleges and theatres. Outside of live performance, stand-up is often distributed commercially via television, DVD, CD and the internet.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - The Tonight Show is an American late-night talk show currently broadcast from the Rockefeller Center in New York City (and previously from various studios in the Los Angeles region) and airing on NBC since 1954. It is the world's longest-running talk show, and the longest running, regularly scheduled entertainment program in the United States. It is the third-longest-running show on NBC, after the news-and-talk shows \\"Today\\" and \\"Meet the Press\\".  - A late-night talk show is a genre of talk show popular in the US, structured around humorous monologues about the day's news, guest interviews, comedy sketches and music performances. The late-night talk show format was popularized, though not invented, by Johnny Carson with \\"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\\" on NBC. Typically the show's host conducts interviews from behind a desk, while the guest is seated on a couch. Many late night talk shows feature a house band which generally performs cover songs for the studio audience during commercial breaks and occasionally will back up a guest artist.  - Political satire is a significant part of satire that specializes in gaining entertainment from politics; it has also been used with subversive intent where political speech and dissent are forbidden by a regime, as a method of advancing political arguments where such arguments are expressly forbidden.  - A cold open (also called a teaser) in a television program or movie is the technique of jumping directly into a story at the beginning or opening of the show before the title sequence or opening credits are shown. On television, this is often done on the theory that involving the audience in the plot as soon as possible will reduce the likelihood of their switching away from a show during the opening commercial. A cold open may summarize events in previous episodes or storylines that will be revisited during the current episode.  - The Daily Show is an American news satire and late-night talk show television program hosted by Trevor Noah. It airs each Monday through Thursday on Comedy Central. Describing itself as a fake news program, \\"The Daily Show\\" draws its comedy and satire from recent news stories, political figures, media organizations, and often uses self-referential humor as well.   - Advertising is an audio or visual form of marketing communication that employs an openly sponsored, nonpersonal message to promote or sell a product, service or idea. Sponsors of advertising are often businesses who wish to promote their products or services. Advertising is differentiated from public relations in that an advertiser usually pays for and has control over the message. It is differentiated from personal selling in that the message is nonpersonal, i.e., not directed to a particular individual. Advertising is communicated through various mass media, including old media such as newspapers, magazines, Television, Radio, outdoor advertising or direct mail; or new media such as search results, blogs, websites or text messages. The actual presentation of the message in a medium is referred to as an advertisement or \\"ad\\".  - In theatre (especially in the illusionistic Western tradition), breaking character occurs when an actor ceases to maintain the illusion that they are identical with the character they are portraying. If the breaking of character is particularly serious, it is considered corpsing, which in film or television would normally result in an abandonment of that take.  - A screenplay or script is a written work by screenwriters for a film, video game, or television program. These screenplays can be original works or adaptations from existing pieces of writing. In them, the movement, actions, expression, and dialogues of the characters are also narrated. A screenplay written for television is also known as a teleplay.  - In theatre, a monologue (from , from  \\"mónos\\", \\"alone, solitary\\" and  \\"lógos\\", \\"speech\\") is a speech presented by a single character, most often to express their mental thoughts aloud, though sometimes also to directly address another character or the audience. Monologues are common across the range of dramatic media (plays, films, etc.), as well as in non-dramatic media such as poetry. Monologues share much in common with several other literary devices including soliloquies, apostrophes, and aside. There are, however, distinctions between each of these devices.  - Duncan \\"Dick\\" Ebersol (born July 28, 1947) is an American television executive and a senior adviser for NBC Universal Sports & Olympics. He had previously been the chairman of NBC Sports, producing large scale television events such as the Olympic Games and National Football League broadcasts.  - Satire is a genre of literature, and sometimes graphic and performing arts, in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be humorous, its greater purpose is often constructive social criticism, using wit to draw attention to both particular and wider issues in society.  - The National Broadcasting Company (NBC) is an American commercial broadcast television network that is the flagship property of NBCUniversal, a subsidiary of Comcast. The network is headquartered in the Comcast Building (formerly known as the GE Building) at Rockefeller Center in New York City, with additional major offices near Los Angeles (at Universal City Plaza), Chicago (at the NBC Tower) and soon in Philadelphia at Comcast Innovation and Technology Center. The network is part of the Big Three television networks. NBC is sometimes referred to as the \\"Peacock Network\\", in reference to its stylized peacock logo, which was originally created in 1956 for its then-new color broadcasts and became the network's official emblem in 1979.  - Weekend Update is a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch that comments on and parodies . It is the show's longest-running recurring sketch, having been on since the show's first broadcast, and is typically presented in the middle of the show immediately after the first musical performance. One or two of the players are cast in the role of news anchor, presenting gag news items based on and acting as hosts for occasional editorials, commentaries, or other performances by other cast members or guests. Chevy Chase has credited Weekend Update, which he started as anchor in 1975, for paving the way for comedic news shows like \\"The Daily Show\\" and \\"The Colbert Report\\".  - Cornelius Crane \\"Chevy\\" Chase (born October 8, 1943) is an American actor, comedian, writer and producer. Born into a prominent New York family, he worked a plethora of strange jobs before moving into comedy and began acting with \\"National Lampoon\\". He immediately became a key cast member in the debut season of \\"Saturday Night Live\\", where his recurring \\"Weekend Update\\" segment soon became a staple of the show.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas. Writers produce various forms of literary art and creative writing such as novels, short stories, poetry, plays, screenplays, and essays as well as various reports and news articles that may be of interest to the public. Writers' texts are published across a range of media. Skilled writers who are able to use language to express ideas well often contribute significantly to the cultural content of a society. The word is also used elsewhere in the arts  such as songwriter  but as a standalone term, \\"writer\\" normally refers to the creation of written language. Some writers work from an oral tradition.  - Meet the Press is a weekly American television news/interview program that is broadcast on NBC. It is the longest-running program in U.S. television history, though its current format bears little resemblance to the one it debuted with on November 6, 1947. Like similar shows that have followed it, \\"Meet the Press\\" specializes in interviews with national leaders on issues of politics, economics, foreign policy and other public affairs, along with panel discussions that provide opinions and analysis. It originates from NBC's Washington, D.C. studios.  - Monochrome describes paintings, drawings, design, or photographs in one color or values of one color. A monochromatic object or image reflects colors in shades of limited colors or hues. Images using only shades of grey (with or without black or white) are called grayscale or black-and-white. However, scientifically speaking, monochromatic light refers to visible light of a narrow band of wavelengths (see spectral color).  - Sidney Arthur Lumet (; June 25, 1924  April 9, 2011) was an American director, producer and screenwriter with over 50 films to his credit. He was nominated for the Academy Award as Best Director for \\"12 Angry Men\\" (1957), \\"Dog Day Afternoon\\" (1975), \\"Network\\" (1976) and \\"The Verdict\\" (1982). He did not win an individual Academy Award, but he did receive an Academy Honorary Award and 14 of his films were nominated for various Oscars, such as \\"Network\\", which was nominated for ten, winning four.  - The history of comics has followed different paths in different cultures. Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia.  - Rockefeller Center is a large complex consisting of 19 highrise commercial buildings covering between 48th and 51st Streets in New York City. Commissioned by the Rockefeller family, it is located in the center of Midtown Manhattan, spanning the area between Fifth Avenue and Sixth Avenue. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1987.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Irony, in its broadest sense, is a rhetorical device, literary technique, or event in which what appears, on the surface, to be the case, differs radically from what is actually the case. Irony may be divided into categories such as verbal, dramatic, and situational. Verbal, dramatic, and situational irony are often used for emphasis in the assertion of a truth. The ironic form of simile, used in sarcasm, and some forms of litotes can emphasize one's meaning by the deliberate use of language which states the opposite of the truth, denies the contrary of the truth, or drastically and obviously understates a factual connection.  - Bye Bye Braverman is a 1968 American comedy film directed by Sidney Lumet. The screenplay by Herbert Sargent was adapted from the 1964 novel \\"To an Early Grave\\" by Wallace Markfield.   - A comedian or comic is a person who seeks to entertain an audience, primarily by making them laugh. This might be through jokes or amusing situations, or acting a fool, as in slapstick, or employing prop comedy. A comedian who addresses an audience directly is called a stand-up comic.  - Saturday Night Live (abbreviated as SNL) is an American late-night live television sketch comedy and variety show created by Lorne Michaels and developed by Dick Ebersol. The show premiered on NBC on October 11, 1975, under the original title NBC's Saturday Night. The show's comedy sketches, which parody contemporary culture and politics, are performed by a large and varying cast of repertory and newer cast members. Each episode is hosted by a celebrity guest (who usually delivers an opening monologue and performs in sketches with the cast) and features performances by a musical guest. An episode normally begins with a cold open sketch that ends with someone breaking character and proclaiming, \\"Live from New York, it's Saturday Night!\\", properly beginning the show.  - Screenwriting, also called scriptwriting, is the art and craft of writing scripts for mass media such as feature films, television productions or video games. It is frequently a freelance profession.  - In a modern sense, comedy (from the , \\"kmidía\\") refers to any discourse or work generally intended to be humorous or amusing by inducing laughter, especially in theatre, television, film, and stand-up comedy. The origins of the term are found in Ancient Greece. In the Athenian democracy, the public opinion of voters was influenced by the political satire performed by the comic poets at the theaters. The theatrical genre of Greek comedy can be described as a dramatic performance which pits two groups or societies against each other in an amusing agon or conflict. Northrop Frye depicted these two opposing sides as a \\"Society of Youth\\" and a \\"Society of the Old\\". A revised view characterizes the essential agon of comedy as a struggle between a relatively powerless youth and the societal conventions that pose obstacles to his hopes. In this struggle, the youth is understood to be constrained by his lack of social authority, and is left with little choice but to take recourse in ruses which engender very dramatic irony which provokes laughter.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Justin and Thomas are two college students conducting an experiment in their chemistry laboratory course.  They are mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium based compounds. Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature, while Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature.  In which person's reaction will the acid and base particles move faster?  Hint: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ). The lower temperature slows the rate of spoilage. A:","output":"In this scenario, Justin and Thomas are conducting experiments in their chemistry laboratory course by mixing together acids and bases to produce sodium-based compounds. Given that Justin conducts his reactions at a high temperature and Thomas conducts his reactions at a lower temperature, it is important to determine in which person's reaction will the acid and base particles move faster. This can be understood by analyzing the relationship between temperature and the rate of reaction. As the provided hint suggests, when the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is generally faster. This is because higher temperatures provide particles of the reactants, in this case, the acid and base particles, with more kinetic energy. This additional kinetic energy allows the particles to move at a faster pace and as a result, they are more likely to collide with one another. Furthermore, when particles have more energy, the collisions that occur have greater force, which increases the likelihood of a successful reaction taking place. Taking the example of food spoilage due to chemical reactions, it is observed that these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures. This is the reason why perishable food items are stored in refrigerators or freezers to slow down the rate of spoilage. By lowering the temperature, we effectively reduce the kinetic energy of the particles involved in the chemical reactions causing spoilage, slowing down the overall rate of the reactions. Applying this principle to the reactions being conducted by Justin and Thomas, it can be deduced that the acid and base particles in Justin's reaction will move faster as he is conducting the reaction at a higher temperature compared to Thomas. Consequently, the increased rate of movement and the likelihood of collisions with greater force will result in a faster reaction in Justin's experiment compared to Thomas'. In conclusion, the acid and base particles in Justin's reaction will move faster due to the higher temperature he is conducting his experiment at, which results in a faster reaction rate compared to Thomas' reaction, which takes place at a lower temperature. This concept of temperature affecting the rate of reaction is observed in various chemical processes, including the spoilage of food, and highlights the importance of understanding and controlling reaction conditions in a laboratory setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Rams began their 2007 campaign at home against the Carolina Panthers.  In the first quarter, St. Louis trailed early as Panthers QB Jake Delhomme completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR Drew Carter.  The Rams would tie the game with QB Marc Bulger completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR Torry Holt.  In the second quarter, St. Louis would take the lead with kicker Jeff Wilkins getting a 42-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the third quarter, Wiklins helped the Rams' lead with a 28-yard field goal.  However, this was all wiped out as Delhomme completed a 68-yard TD pass to WR Steve Smith.  In the fourth quarter, Carolina took over for the remainder of the game as kicker John Kasay nailed a 34-yard field goal, Delhomme and Carter hooked up with each other again on a 9-yard TD pass, and Kasay finished the game with 32-yard field goal. The game was notable when offensive tackle Orlando Pace suffered a season-ending injury. This severely hurt the Rams' offense. Based on the above article, answer a question.

It mentions that the person worked hard and achieved their goals. This statement implies that the person accomplished what they set out to do, which would lead to a feeling of satisfaction and completion. The word \\"fulfilled\\" encompasses this concept, as it refers to the state of being satisfied or happy with the result of one's efforts. Here's a brief explanation of why the other choices are not suitable: - Headache: This option relates to physical pain and is not necessarily associated with the achievement of goals. While working hard might lead to physical stress, the overall context of the question highlights the positive outcome of achieving goals, so \\"headache\\" is not the best fit. - Disappointed: This choice suggests a negative outcome, contrary to the mentioned context. Disappointment arises when someone fails to meet their expectations or desired results, which is not the case in this scenario since the individual achieved their goals. - Celebrated: Achieving goals might indeed lead to celebration, but this option refers to an action and not a personal feeling or state of being. Consequently, \\"celebrated\\" doesn't fully capture the emotional aspect of the individual directly resulting from their success. - Simplicity: This choice doesn't strongly relate to the individual's feelings after achieving their goals. Simplicity refers to the quality or condition of being simple, which doesn't encompass the emotional aftermath of accomplishing what one set out to do.

What is the answer?","output":"The mobile phone company that has the motto \\"Connecting people\\" is Nokia. Nokia Corporation is a Finnish multinational telecommunications, information technology, and consumer electronics company, founded in 1865. Nokia's journey began as a wood pulp mill near the town of Nokia, Finland, and later branched out into electricity generation and rubber production. Over the years, the company transitioned through various industries such as telecommunications cables, televisions, and computer products. However, it wasn't until the advent of mobile communications that Nokia became widely recognized. In the 1980s and 1990s, Nokia cemented its position as one of the dominant forces in the global mobile phone market. The company was known for its reliable and user-friendly devices, as well as its simple, elegant designs. The \\"Connecting people\\" motto was created during this era as part of Nokia's marketing and branding campaign. The slogan and Nokia's famous hands logo aimed to capture the essence of their mission: to use technology to bring people together, enabling them to connect and communicate with ease, no matter where they were in the world. Nokia's mobile phones became immensely popular, and their products—such as the Nokia 3310—are still remembered as iconic devices that shaped the mobile revolution. However, as the smartphone era dawned, Nokia faced challenges from emerging competitors like Apple, Samsung, and other Android-based devices. The company's struggles eventually led to a partnership with Microsoft, and Nokia's mobile phone business was later acquired by Microsoft in 2014. Although Nokia's smartphone efforts encountered various obstacles, the company still has a presence in the telecommunications industry. In recent years, Nokia has primarily focused on providing network solutions, infrastructure, and services for mobile operators, internet service providers, and other large enterprises. Thus, the motto \\"Connecting people\\" still resonates, but in a different context than it did during the days of Nokia's mobile phone dominance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dreamgirls is a 2006 American romantic musical drama film written and directed by Bill Condon and jointly produced and released by DreamWorks Pictures and Paramount Pictures. Adapted from the 1981 Broadway musical of the same name by composer Henry Krieger and lyricist/librettist Tom Eyen, Dreamgirls is a film a clef, a work of fiction taking strong inspiration from the history of the Motown record label and one of its acts, The Supremes. The story follows the history and evolution of American R&B music during the 1960s and 1970s through the eyes of a Detroit, Michigan girl group known as the Dreams and their manipulative record executive. The film adaptation of Dreamgirls stars Jamie Foxx, Beyonce, Eddie Murphy, and Jennifer Hudson, and also features Danny Glover, Anika Noni Rose and Keith Robinson. Dreamgirls premiered on December 4, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, where it received a standing ovation. The film's Los Angeles premiere was held on December 11 at the Wilshire Theater in Beverly Hills.  Similar to the releases of older Hollywood musicals such as The Sound of Music, My Fair Lady, and West Side Story, Dreamgirls debuted with three special ten-day roadshow engagements beginning on December 15, 2006 at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City, the Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles, and the AMC Metreon 15 in San Francisco. Tickets for the reserved seats were 25 each; the premium price included a forty-eight page full-color program and a limited-print lithograph. This release made Dreamgirls the first American feature film to have a roadshow release since Man of La Mancha in 1972. Dreamgirls earned a total of 851,664 from the roadshow engagements, playing to sold-out houses on the weekends. The film's national release, at regular prices, began on December 25. Outside of the U.S., Dreamgirls opened in Australia on January 18, and in the United Kingdom on February 2. Releases in other countries began on various dates between January and early March. Dreamgirls eventually grossed 103 million in North America, and almost 155 million worldwide.  DreamWorks Home Entertainment released Dreamgirls to home video on May 1, 2007 in DVD, HD DVD, and Blu-ray formats. The DVD version was issued in two editions: a one-disc standard version and a two-disc \\"Showstopper Edition\\".

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the pediment adorned by reclining saints?  This is not to say that Sicily was completely isolated from trends elsewhere in Europe. Architecture in the island's major cities was strongly influenced by the family of the sculptor Domenico Gagini, who arrived from Florence in 1463. This family of sculptors and painters decorated churches and buildings with ornate decorative and figurative sculpture. Less than a century after his family had begun to cautiously decorate the island's churches (1531–37), Antonio Gagini completed the proscenium-like arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani. This pedimented arch to the sanctuary has pilasters — not fluted, but decorated heavily with relief busts of the saints; and, most importantly in terms of architecture, the pediment is adorned by reclining saints supporting swags linked to the central shield that crowns the pediment. This ornate pediment, although still unbroken, was one of the first signs that Sicily was forming its own style of decorative architecture. Similar in style is the Chiesa del Gesù (Illustration 14), constructed between 1564 and 1633, which also shows early signs of the Sicilian Baroque. Thus a particular brand of Baroque architecture had begun to evolve in Sicily long before the earthquake of 1693. While the majority of those buildings that can be clearly classified as Baroque in style date from around 1650, the scarcity of these isolated, surviving examples of Sicily's 17th-century architectural history makes it hard to fully and accurately evaluate the architecture immediately before the natural disaster: the earthquake destroyed not only most of the buildings, but also most of their documentation. Yet more information has been lost in subsequent earthquakes and severe bombing during World War II. The earliest example of Baroque on the island is Giulio Lasso's Quattro Canti, an octagonal piazza, or circus, constructed around 1610 at the crossroads of the city's two principal streets.  Around this intersection are four open sides, being the streets, and...","output":"The name of the pediment adorned by reclining saints is the pedimented arch of the \\"Capella della Madonna\\" in the \\"Santuario dell'Annunziata\\" at Trapani.

The doctor then sees Martha who is having a pain in her right arm and who also has hypertension. The doctor talks to Martha about her issues and then heads home for the day.  Which patient will be more likely to be told to exercise more?  Hint: Hypertension , which is also called \\"high blood pressure,\\" occurs when a person’s blood pressure is always high. Hypertension is said to be present when a person's systolic blood pressure is always 140 or higher, and/or if the person's diastolic blood pressure is always 90 or higher. Having hypertension increases a person’s chance for developing heart disease, having a stroke, or suffering from other serious cardiovascular diseases. Hypertension often does not have any symptoms, so a person may not know that he or she has high blood pressure. For this reason, hypertension is often called the \\"silent killer.\\" Treatments for hypertension include diet changes, exercise, and medication. Foods thought to lower blood pressure include skim milk, spinach, beans, bananas and dark chocolate. Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Martha is more likely to be told to exercise more. This is because she has hypertension, which is a risk factor for developing heart disease, stroke, and other serious cardiovascular diseases. Exercise is one of the suggested treatments for hypertension, along with diet changes and medication. On the other hand, Jessie's skin issues are not directly related to the need for exercise, and she was advised to see a dermatologist instead."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Milestone 1 was leaked as? Context: Three milestone releases of Windows 8 leaked to the general public. Milestone 1, Build 7850, was leaked on April 12, 2011. It was the first build where the text of a window was written centered instead of aligned to the left. It was also probably the first appearance of the Metro-style font, and its wallpaper had the text shhh... let's not leak our hard work. However, its detailed build number reveals that the build was created on September 22, 2010. The leaked copy edition was Enterprise edition. The OS still reads as \\"Windows 7\\". Milestone 2, Build 7955, was leaked on April 25, 2011. The traditional Blue Screen of Death (BSoD) was replaced by a new Black screen, although this was later scrapped. This build introduced a new ribbon in Windows Explorer. Build 7959, with minor changes but the first 64-bit version, was leaked on May 1, 2011. The \\"Windows 7\\" logo was temporarily replaced with text displaying \\"Microsoft Confidential\\". On June 17, 2011, build 7989 64-bit edition was leaked. It introduced a new boot screen featuring the same fish as the default Windows 7 Beta wallpaper, which was later scrapped, and the circling dots as featured in the final (although the final version comes with smaller circling dots throbber). It also had the text Welcome below them, although this was also scrapped. The answer is:","output":"Milestone 1, Build 7850, was leaked on April 12, 2011."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines it provides and how to use those guidelines to find the answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, you need to remove all words of a given length in the sentence. The number of letters in a word determine its length, for example, the length of the word \\"apple\\" is 5. Problem:Sentence: 'little boy in pajamas starting to eat his breakfast'. Remove all words of length '6' in the given sentence. Solution:","output":"Task Explanation: The task is asking you to remove all words in a given sentence that have a specific length. In this case, you need to remove words that have exactly 6 letters. Guidelines: 1. Read the given sentence: \\"little boy in pajamas starting to eat his breakfast\\". 2. Identify the specific word length you need to remove: In this case, it is 6. 3. Go through each word in the sentence and check its length. 4. If a word's length matches the specified length (6), remove it from the sentence. Steps to find the answer: 1. Start with the first word of the sentence: \\"little\\" (length: 6)    Since it has 6 letters, remove it from the sentence. 2. Continue with the next words in the sentence, checking their length:    - \\"boy\\" (length: 3)    - \\"in\\" (length: 2)    - \\"pajamas\\" (length: 7)    - \\"starting\\" (length: 8)    - \\"to\\" (length: 2)    - \\"eat\\" (length: 3)    - \\"his\\" (length: 3)    - \\"breakfast\\" (length: 9) 3.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this and answer the question For girls, early maturation can sometimes lead to increased self-consciousness, though a typical aspect in maturing females. Because of their bodies' developing in advance, pubescent girls can become more insecure and dependent. Consequently, girls that reach sexual maturation early are more likely than their peers to develop eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa). Nearly half of all American high school girls' diets are to lose weight. In addition, girls may have to deal with sexual advances from older boys before they are emotionally and mentally mature. In addition to having earlier sexual experiences and more unwanted pregnancies than late maturing girls, early maturing girls are more exposed to alcohol and drug abuse.
