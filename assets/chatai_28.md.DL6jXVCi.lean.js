Movie title: The Name of the Rose Movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (September 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) As an old man, Adso, son of the Baron of Melk recounts how, as a young novice in 1327, he joined his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville on a journey to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ. The abbey also boasts a famed scriptorium where scribes copy, translate or illuminate books. The suspicious recent death of the monk Adelmo of Otranto âa young but famous manuscript illuminatorâ has stirred fears among the abbey's inhabitants. The Abbot seeks help from William, known for his deductive powers. Adelmo's death cannot be a suicide because his body was found below a tower with only a window which cannot be opened. William is reluctant, but also drawn by the intellectual challenge and his desire to disprove fears of a demonic culprit. William also fears the abbot will summon officials of the Inquisition if the mystery remains unsolved. William soon concludes that Adelmo's death was indeed suicide; he fell from a different tower. Nevertheless, Venantius, a Greek translator âand the last to speak with Adelmoâ is found dead in a vat filled with the blood of slaughtered pigs. The translator's corpse bears a black stain on a finger and his tongue. At a loss, William insists that Adelmo killed himself and that the translator's death can be reasonably explained. The other monks suspect a supernatural cause, fears reinforced when the saintly Fransciscan monk Ubertino of Casale warns that the deaths resemble signs mentioned in the Book of Revelation. In the scriptorium, William inspects Adelmo's desk, but is blocked by Brother Berengar, the assistant librarian. Brother Malachia, Head Librarian, denies William access to the rest of the building. William encounters Salvatore, a demented hunchback, and...","output":"Adso and his mentor, Franciscan friar William of Baskerville, went to a Benedictine abbey in Northern Italy where the Franciscans were to debate with Papal emissaries the poverty of Christ."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Benjamin had an unhealthy liver because he drank a lot of beer while Brian drank water.","output":"Benjamin had an unhealthy liver because he drank a lot of beer, whereas Brian, on the other hand, always opted for water. Benjamin's excessive beer consumption ultimately took a toll on his liver health, leading to multiple problems that affected his overall well-being. Even though he enjoyed the buzz he got from drinking beer, he gradually started to realize that this temporary pleasure was causing long-term damage to his body. Brian, who consistently chose water over beer, managed to lead a healthier life in comparison. His liver was in good shape, and he never had to worry about the consequences of alcohol abuse. Water had a positive impact on Brian's health, helping him stay hydrated, detoxifying his body, and nourishing his vital organs. He found the benefits of drinking water and maintaining a toxin-free lifestyle far outweighed the transient high alcohol could provide. Once Benjamin began to notice the difference between his and Brian's health, he started to think more seriously about his own lifestyle choices. He found himself lacking motivation and energy most of the time, while Brian always seemed to be fit and full of zeal. This realization initiated a change in Benjamin, as he finally decided to seek help in overcoming his addiction to beer. Understanding the severity of his alcohol dependence, Benjamin consulted a healthcare professional, who suggested he start attending a rehabilitation program. The goal of this program would be to help Benjamin free himself from his beer addiction, while also teaching him healthier coping mechanisms. He struggled at first, but with time and consistent effort, Benjamin was able to gradually reduce his consumption of beer. Moreover, Benjamin decided to join a support group for people dealing with alcohol dependency. The support group helped him connect with others facing similar issues and understand that he was not alone in his battle against addiction. It offered a network of people who shared their experiences, knowledge, and resources, empowering one another to overcome their addiction. Additionally, Benjamin started making an effort to maintain a healthier diet and exercise regularly to improve his physical well-being. By incorporating fresh fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains in his diet, he began feeling more energetic and focused. As for exercise, he tried various activities such as swimming, jogging, and yoga, eventually finding a mix that he enjoyed and could stick to in the long run. Over time, with a combination of support from his healthcare professional, the rehabilitation program, his support group, diet, and exercise, Benjamin's liver health began to improve. He was no longer plagued by constant fatigue and began noticing some of the other advantages of his newly found sober life. His relationships with friends and family improved, and he gained more clarity and direction in his personal goals and ambitions. Benjamin's journey to liver health and sobriety was not an easy one, but it was a life-altering transformation that taught him the value of taking care of his body and making healthier choices. Meanwhile, Brian continued living his healthy life, providing moral support and encouragement to Benjamin along the way. By sharing their experiences and challenges, both Benjamin and Brian grew stronger in their commitment to maintaining a healthy lifestyle and looking after their physical and emotional well-being. Their story serves as a reminder of the impact our choices have on our bodies and the significance of prioritizing our health in the face of everyday challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Geology (from the Ancient Greek , \\"g\\", i.e. \\"earth\\" and -o, \\"-logia\\", i.e. \\"study of, discourse\\") is an earth science comprising the study of solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which they change. Geology can also refer generally to the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet (such as the geology of the Moon or Mars).  - Luossavaara-Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag (LKAB) is a Swedish mining company. The company mines iron ore at Kiruna and at Malmberget in northern Sweden. The company was established in 1890, and has been 100% state-owned since the 1950s. The iron ore is processed to pellets and sinter fines, which are transported by Iore trains (Malmbanan) to the harbours at Narvik and Luleå and to the steelmill at Luleå (SSAB).   - Narvik is located on the shores of the Ofotfjorden. The municipality is part of the traditional district of Ofoten of Northern Norway, inside the Arctic Circle. The municipality of Narvik borders the municipality of Ballangen to the southwest, Evenes to the northwest, Bardu, Gratangen, Lavangen and Skånland (in Troms county) to the north, and Norrbotten County (Lapland) in Sweden to the south and east.  - Johan Olof Hjalmar Lundbohm ( 25 April 1855 -- 4 April 1926 ) was a Swedish geologist and chemist and the first managing director of LKAB ( Luossavaara - Kiirunavaara Aktiebolag ) in Kiruna . He is regarded as the founder of the city .  - A geologist is a scientist who studies the solid and liquid matter that constitutes the Earth as well as the processes that shape it. Geologists usually study geology, although backgrounds in physics, chemistry, biology, and other sciences are also useful. Field work is an important component of geology, although many subdisciplines incorporate laboratory work.  - A chemist (from Greek chm (ía) alchemy + -ist; replacing chymist from Medieval Latin alchimista) is a scientist trained in the study of chemistry. Chemists study the composition of matter and its properties. Chemists carefully describe the properties they study in terms of quantities, with detail on the level of molecules and their component atoms. Chemists carefully measure substance proportions, reaction rates, and other chemical properties. The word 'chemist' is also used to address Pharmacists in Commonwealth English.  - Iore, often stylized IORE, is a class of 34 electric locomotives built by Adtranz and its successor Bombardier Transportation for the Swedish mining company LKAB's railway division Malmtrafik. The class is a variation of Adtranz's Octeon modular product platform, thus related to Bombardier's later TRAXX platform. The locomotives haul iron ore freight trains on the Iron Ore Line and Ofoten Line in Sweden and Norway, respectively. The 68-car trains are hauled by two single-ended CoCo locomotives, each with a power output of . Each operates with tractive effort and has a maximum speed of . Delivery of the first series of 18 locomotives was made from 2000 to 2004, and they replaced some of the aging Dm3 and El 15 units. In 2007, eight more vehicles (4 double units) were ordered, with production to be completed by 2011, by which time, another four double units were ordered. These units are scheduled to be delivered from 2013 to 2014.  - Pharmacists, also known as chemists (Commonwealth English) or druggists (North American and, archaically, Commonwealth English), are healthcare professionals who practice in pharmacy, the field of health sciences focusing on safe and effective medication use. A pharmacist is a member of the health care team directly involved with patient care. Pharmacists undergo university-level education to understand the biochemical mechanisms and actions of drugs, drug uses, therapeutic roles, side effects, potential drug interactions, and monitoring parameters. This is mated to anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. Pharmacists interpret and communicate this specialized knowledge to patients, physicians, and other health care providers.  - The polar night occurs when the night lasts for more than 24 hours. This occurs only inside the polar circles. The opposite phenomenon, the polar day, or midnight sun, occurs when the Sun stays above the horizon for more than 24 hours. \\"Night\\" is understood as the center of the Sun being below a free horizon. Since the atmosphere bends the rays of the Sun, the polar day is longer than the polar night, and the area that is affected by polar night is somewhat smaller than the area of midnight sun. The polar circle is located at a latitude between these two areas, at the latitude of approximately 66.5 degrees. In the most northern city of Sweden, Kiruna, at 67°51'N, the polar night lasts for around 28 twenty-four-hour periods, while the midnight sun lasts around 50 twenty-four-hour periods.  - The city's vicinity shares a long history with the indigenous Sami people, with evidence of at least 6000 years of settlement. The city of Kiruna was founded in 1900 and quickly became a major centre of iron ore extraction and mining industry. During World War II, large quantities of iron were transported from Kiruna by rail to the east coast, and further down to be sold to Germany. Due to Kiruna's position north of the Arctic Circle the city experiences both midnight sun and polar night throughout the year as well as a very cold climate, even by Scandinavian standards.  - The Sami people (also Sámi or Saami, traditionally known in English as Lapps or Laplanders) are an indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, and the Kola Peninsula of Russia. The Sami are the only indigenous people of Scandinavia recognized and protected under the international conventions of indigenous peoples, and are hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe. Sami ancestral lands are not well-defined. Their traditional languages are the Sami languages and are classified as a branch of the Uralic language family.  - Luleå (Lule Sami \\"Luleju\\") is a city on the coast of northern Sweden, and the capital of Norrbotten County, the northernmost county in Sweden. Luleå has about 75,000 inhabitants and is the seat of Luleå Municipality (with a total population of 75,921).  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets.  - Malmberget (\\"The Ore Mountain\\") is a locality and mining town situated in Gällivare Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden with 5,590 inhabitants in 2010. It is situated 5 kilometres from the municipal seat Gällivare.  - Aktiebolag (\\"stock company\\") is the Swedish term for \\"limited company\\" or \\"corporation\\". When used in company names, it is abbreviated AB (in Sweden), Ab (in Finland), or A/B (for some older companies), roughly equivalent to the abbreviations \\"Ltd\\" and \\"PLC\\". The State authority responsible for registration of aktiebolag in Sweden is called the Swedish Companies Registration Office.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - SSAB AB, earlier \\"Svenskt Stål AB\\" (English: Swedish Steel), is a Swedish-Finnish company, formed in 1978 and specialised in processing raw material to steel. The largest shareholders are Industrivärden and the Government of Finland.  - Alchemy is a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Egypt and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of \\"base metals\\" (e.g., lead) into \\"noble\\" ones (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease; and the development of an alkahest, a universal solvent. The perfection of the human body and soul was thought to permit or result from the alchemical magnum opus and, in the Hellenistic and western tradition, the achievement of gnosis. In Europe, the creation of a philosopher's stone was variously connected with all of these projects.

Pete heated the can without venting it and it exploded, while Dan opened his can and heated it over the fire with no additional problems.  But I can use this background: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  What is an answer for this question: Which camper learned less about kinetic energy?

Wednesday was a very special day for Stanley, because he got out of prison. A judge - that's the person who tries to make fair decisions in court - said that Stanley didn't do the wrong things he was accused of.

A US-UK trade deal would be a priority, Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Bob Corker said after meeting Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson. Barack Obama warned in April that the UK would be at the back of the queue for trade deals if voters chose Brexit. Mr Johnson has been meeting with top Republicans on Capitol Hill. \\"We hear we are first in line to do a great free trade deal with the United States. So, it's going to be a very exciting year for both our countries,\\" he said. Those meeting with the foreign secretary included House speaker Paul Ryan and Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell.

Write highlights for this article: It has been claimed that CIA agents on the ground during the deadly attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi twice asked for permission to help Ambassador Chris Stevens and twice were told to stand down. Furthermore sources present during the deadly six-hour assault have said that a desperate last request for military assistance once the CIA themselves came under attack was denied, even though elite counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. And it has been claimed there was full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military, casting further doubts on the Obama administration's assertion that there wasn't enough information to deploy forces - deepening the crisis over their handling of the attack on September 11th and its aftermath. Scroll down for video. Revelations: It has been claimed today that CIA operatives at the Benghazi consulate compound repeatedly had their requests for help denied during the deadly assault on September 11. The lethal assault which led to the death of Ambassador Stevens and three other U.S. citizens began at 9.40 p.m. as the U.S Consulate came under fire from hostile Libyan forces. According to Fox News, ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who was part of a small team at the CIA annex about a mile from the consulate, asked his superiors if he could go and assist the embattled diplomatic compound. However, they were told to 'stand down' and according to sources who spoke to the news channel were told to 'stand down' again after asking for a second time to help Ambassador Stevens and his staff. Ignoring these orders, Woods and two others heroically made their way to the consulate which by now was ablaze and began firing on the attackers. Knowledge: It is unclear who denied the requests of the CIA for special forces teams. The quick reaction force which Woods was part of helped an evacuation of the main building and recovered the body of State Department staff member Sean Smith who had died in the initial attack. However, the team from the CIA annex could not locate Ambassador Stevens and returned to their own base at around midnight where they came under attack themselves. Immediately calling for assistance from Sigonella Air base in Italy which is two hours away, it is claimed that two separate special operations teams and air support were told to wait - despite the gun battle raging for four hours. It is not known who denied the request for help for the CIA operatives on the ground at Benghazi. If true these claims will radically change the perception of the field agents who were operating on the ground in Benghazi. Previously criticised for providing inadequate security for the consulate staff, the new information shows intelligence operatives repeatedly tried to assist and in fact were denied their own requests for outside help. Killed: Ambassador Christopher Stevens (left) died following smoke inhalation, while agent Sean Smith (right) died in a. desperate battle. Heroic: Former Navy SEALs Glen Doherty (left) and Tyrone Woods (right) were killed in a mortar attack. Refuting the Defense Secretary Leon Panetta's claim yesterday that there simply wasn't enough information to responsibly deploy forces to Libya at the time of the attack, sources on the ground claim that communication was open throughout the attack. Indeed, one member of the CIA team who was on the roof of the annex was in possession of a laser to guide aerial targets including drones and repeatedly requested backup from a Specter gunship to take out an attacker firing mortars. According to sources familiar with the situation, the operative had visual contact with the Libyan mortar team and in addition was able to pinpoint positions from where the consulate attackers were firing from. Yesterday Leon Panetta claimed that he and General Martin Dempsey, chairman of the U.S. military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, and General Carter Ham, head of the U.S. military's Africa Command, felt they couldn't 'put forces at risk in that situation.' A CIA operatives request for an AC-130H gunship to take down a Libyan mortar position was denied. Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior. Siege: The compound came under heavy mortar and gunfire during the attack, which lasted several hours. 'This happened within a few hours and it was really over before, you know, we had the opportunity to really know what was happening,' said Panetta. Furthermore, Fox News has learned that there were two military surveillance drones above the skies of Benghazi during the attack which would have been able to relay real time visuals of the assault to U.S. officials in the White House situation room and the Pentagon. Tyrone Woods and another former Navy SEAL Glen Doherty were killed by a mortar shell at 4 a.m. Libyan time, over six hours after the attack began and just one hour after relief from an American Quick Reaction Force sent from Tripoli had arrive. This new information comes as President Barack Obama's response to the attacks in Libya has become a contentious issue in the hard-fought U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents raising questions about his administration's truthfulness and competence. Obama supporters have in turn accused Republicans of making unfounded accusations in an effort to score political points from the death of a U.S. ambassador and the three others killed in the Benghazi attack. Flames, grenades and gunfire: A burnt-out car in front of the U.S. consulate. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, Republican John Boehner, asked in a letter to Obama on Thursday about whether military options and assets were offered 'during and in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attack.' 'Can you explain what options were presented to you or your staff, and why it appears assets were not allowed to be pre-positioned, let alone utilized?' Boehner asked. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told Pentagon reporters that U.S. forces were on a heightened state of alert already because of the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington by al Qaeda. In the aftermath of the attack, Panetta reminded reporters that the Pentagon deployed a Marine fleet anti-terrorist security team to Tripoli and had Navy ships off the coast. 'And we were prepared to respond to any contingency. And certainly had forces in place to do that,' he said. Elite team: As the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. came under a devastating attack last month, a rescue team of elite. soldiers was denied the opportunity to assist the CIA who had come under attack. The administration initially attributed the violence to protests over an anti-Islam film and said it was not premeditated. Obama and other officials have since said the incident was a deliberate terrorist attack. U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has attributed the shifting explanation to 'the fog of war.' A State Department email made public this week showed that two hours after the attack on the U.S. diplomatic mission compound in Benghazi, the Department's Operations Center advised officials at various U.S. agencies that a militant group called Ansar al-Sharia had claimed credit on Twitter and Facebook for the attacks. U.S. officials, including Clinton, on Wednesday said that such Internet postings did not constitute hard evidence of who was responsible for the attacks. The State Department has set up an independent review board to investigate the background and response to the attacks. The U.S. Senate intelligence committee on Thursday said it will hold hearings in November - after the November 6 presidential election - on security and intelligence issues raised by the September 11 attack in Libya. Highlights:","output":"- CIA agents on the ground during the attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi allegedly asked for permission to help Ambassador Chris Stevens twice but were told to stand down. - Sources claim that a final request for military assistance was denied even though counter-terrorism units were only two hours away. - Full communication between the CIA annex in Benghazi and the U.S. military raises doubts about the Obama administration's claim of insufficient information to deploy forces. - Ex-Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, part of a small team at the CIA annex, was reportedly told to \\"stand down\\" when he asked to help the consulate but ultimately went anyway, resulting in a heroic rescue attempt. - CIA operatives' request for external assistance was allegedly denied, contrary to previous accusations of inadequate security for consulate staff. - The presence of two military surveillance drones during the attack raises questions about the Defense Secretary's statement that there was not enough information to responsibly deploy forces. - The Benghazi attack has become a point of contention in the U.S. presidential race, with Republican opponents questioning the administration's truthfulness and competence. - The U.S. Senate intelligence committee plans to hold hearings on the security and intelligence issues raised by the attack after the November 6th presidential election."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Based on the premise \\"Both old and young take part, attesting to the growing revival of interest in Spain's rich heritage of traditional dance and music.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music any more so it's dying out. \\" is true?","output":"Step 1: Identify the key points in the premise and hypothesis. Premise: Both old and young take part, attesting to the growing revival of interest in Spain's rich heritage of traditional dance and music. Hypothesis: Not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music anymore, so it's dying out. Step 2: Compare the key points in the premise and hypothesis. The premise suggests that there is a growing revival of interest in Spain's traditional dance and music and people of all ages are participating in it. This indicates that the interest in Spanish dance and music is strong and growing across generations. On the other hand, the hypothesis claims that not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music and as a result, it is dying out. This suggests a decline in interest and popularity of Spanish dance and music. Step 3: Determine if the premise supports or contradicts the hypothesis. The premise contradicts the hypothesis by providing evidence of a growing revival of interest in Spain's traditional dance and music, with participation from both old and young people. This growing interest goes against the claim made in the hypothesis that Spanish dance and music is dying out due to lack of interest. Step 4: Draw a conclusion. Based on the premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Not many people are interested in Spanish dance and music anymore, so it's dying out.\\" is not true. The premise, in fact, indicates a growing interest in Spanish dance and music across generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They do not have bridal gowns, just all the extras, including the biggest selection of bridesmaid dresses in the Valley from every designer you've been pinning - it's worth the drive!   If, like the upset bridezillas who gave low ratings for customer service issues, you need to be wooed while picking out an ugly dress you will never wear again, by all means, go somewhere else. It is low frills - and in fact, the first time I went there, I was told to just go home and order online - but again, the biggest selection PLUS the lowest prices.

Please answer the following question: The sighting of a killer whale (or orca) can be rare, but they do love to hunt and play in the waters between Vancouver and Seattle, so one of the activities we absolutely wanted to do (in addition to the harbour seaplane flight) was to go whale watching. Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale’s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington.

Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, the likely Republican nominee in the Wisconsin gubernatorial race, has a new ad in which he says that the presumptive Democratic nominee, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, has been “throwing punches” at him — and Walker shows off his the boxing gloves to fight back. Of course, Barrett was himself a victim of violent crime a year ago.      “You know, Tom Barrett can’t sell his record, so he’s throwing punches at me,” Walker says before attacking Barrett’s positions on such issues as taxes, spending and environmental laws. “I’m Scott Walker, and I took on the political machine in Milwaukee,” Walker adds, revealing that his hands are in boxing gloves which he then punches together, “and ready to go the distance as your next governor.”      A complication in the imagery of this ad: Back in August 2009, Barrett was severely beaten by a man with a tire iron at the Wisconsin State Fair. Barrett intervened to protect a woman who was trying to protect her 1-year-old granddaughter from the girl’s drunk father, who in turn then attacked Barrett. Barrett was hospitalized and has undergone multiple operations on his hand, which doctors say might never fully recover. The assailant was later sentenced to 12 years in prison.      The Associated Press asked Walker spokeswoman Jill Bader whether the ad was in bad taste, in light of Barrett having been attacked. “That was not at all what we’re talking about,” said Bader.      Granted, boxing gloves probably wouldn’t be nearly as bad as the tire iron.      The TPM Poll Average currently gives Walker a lead of 49.0%-42.9%.

I’m focusing on everything I can do to create jobs in the state and to make sure that we’ve got a budget that’s balanced, and that’s where my focus is.\\"      In a new ad, Walker says Barrett is \\"throwing punches\\" with negative ads. At the end of the ad, Walker raises boxing gloves and says, \\"I’m Scott Walker, and I took on the political machine in Milwaukee. And I’m ready to go the distance as your next governor.\\"      Barrett was severely beaten after he intervened in a domestic dispute as he left the State Fair in August 2009.      Barrett is the only major Democrat in the race. Walker faces former U.S. Rep. Mark Neumann in the Sept. 14 Republican primary. Neumann's campaign declined to comment on Walker's ad.      Mike Tate, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, told the Associated Press the ad was \\"tasteless.\\" But Walker’s campaign said the ad was a response to Barrett’s criticisms of him in recent ads and was not meant to raise Barrett’s beating. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker, the likely Republican nominee in the Wisconsin gubernatorial race, has released an ad depicting him as a boxer, stating that presumptive Democratic nominee Tom Barrett has been \\"throwing punches\\" at him.

Initially they were a soul band playing Motown covers and rock-based material. Alan Sandow (ex-Daisy Roots) replaced Taylor on drums by July. Sherbet signed to the Infinity Records label - a subsidiary of Festival Records. The band's debut single was issued in March 1970 as a cover version of Badfinger's \\"Crimson Ships\\" - from that band's January 1970 album Magic Christian Music.  During 1970 the band played a residency at Jonathon's Disco, playing seven hours a night, four days a week for eight months. They were spotted by their future manager, Roger Davies. By March Daryl Braithwaite (Bright Lights, House of Bricks, Samael Lilith) had joined, initially sharing lead vocals with Laughlin who left the band a few months later. Braithwaite's former band mate Bruce Worrall (Bright Lights, House of Bricks, Samael Lilith) took over from Rea on bass guitar. By year's end the group undertook their first national tour. See had left in October to join The Flying Circus and was replaced by New Zealand-born Garth Porter (Samael Lilith, Toby Jugg) who provided Hammond organ and electric piano.  In 1971, Sherbet entered Australia's prestigious national rock band contest, Hoadley's Battle of the Sounds, and won the New South Wales final but lost the national final to Adelaide-based band Fraternity (led by Bon Scott later in AC/DC). They entered again in 1972 and won the national final, previous winners include The Twilights (1966) and The Groove (1968), which went on to achieve major commercial success.  Sherbet's first chart hits on the Go-Set National Top 40 were covers of Blue Mink's \\"Can You Feel It Baby?\\" (September 1971), Delaney and Bonnie's \\"Free the People\\" (February 1972) and Ted Mulry's \\"You're All Woman\\" (September 1972). Most of their early recordings were produced by Festival's in-house producer Richard Batchens, who later produced albums and singles for another Infinity label mate, Richard Clapton.

These individuals suffer from chronic pain and believe that their pain is significantly affecting their lives. In addition to perceiving their pain as highly severe, dysfunctional people also report that their pain interferes with much of their daily activities, leading to a higher degree of psychological distress caused by pain, and they generally report low levels of activity. This classification of chronic pain patients highlights the substantial impact of pain on their overall functioning and mental well-being. Combining the MPI characterization with the patient's IASP five-category pain profile can yield a more comprehensive and useful description of their specific case to better tailor treatment and support strategies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This statement discusses the possible use of harmful economic indicators and mechanisms within an organization or system, which may lead to detrimental consequences for its member states or participants. By limiting the financial contribution of member states to around 1 percent, the possible negative impacts of these mechanisms may be mitigated to some extent. However, this measure may not be enough to avoid creating a system that encourages poor economic practices or takes advantage of the vulnerabilities of its members. To prevent such issues from arising, it is essential for organizations to implement strict regulations and guidelines that promote transparency and fairness among their members. Economic indicators, such as GDP growth, inflation rate, and unemployment rate, can serve as helpful tools to assess the overall health of an economy. However, when misused or manipulated, these indicators can lead to adverse consequences for affected countries or regions. For example, misleading indicators can make an economy appear more stable than it is, resulting in a false sense of security and potentially leading to the exacerbation of pre-existing economic issues. Similarly, certain economic mechanisms, if not regulated properly, can have negative effects on the economies of member states. For instance, currency manipulation can destabilize financial markets, causing sharp fluctuations in exchange rates and investments. This can lead to increased volatility in financial systems and make it more difficult for countries to maintain economic stability. To address these concerns, it would be essential for organizations and institutions to adopt a transparent and fair approach when dealing with economic indicators and mechanisms. By promoting cooperation, enforcing strict regulations, and actively monitoring the use of such tools, member states can work together to create a more stable and equitable economic environment. Additionally, the measure of limiting financial contributions to around 1 percent for member states can serve as a safeguard against potential economic imbalances. However, this approach should not be viewed as a solution in itself, but rather as part of a broader strategy to promote sustainable and equitable economic practices among members. By working together to create a more inclusive and robust economic system, countries can better withstand the challenges arising from harmful economic indicators and mechanisms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Donington le Heath Manor House Museum It was once owned by a relative of one of the group of provincial English Catholics led by who? The answer is:","output":"Donington le Heath Manor House Museum, located in Coalville, Leicestershire, England, is a remarkable relic of history that traces its origin back to the 13th century. Having gone through several renovations and expansions over the centuries, the manor has been carefully preserved and restored as a museum, offering visitors a first-hand glimpse into medieval life in England. The manor was once owned by a relative of one of the group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby. Catesby was an Englishman who became infamous for his involvement and leadership in the failed Gunpowder Plot of 1605. The objective of this conspiracy was to assassinate King James I, who was a Protestant, along with several other members of the English royalty, nobility, and Parliament. Catesby and his co-conspirators sought to replace the existing Protestant government with a Catholic leadership in a bid to restore the rights and privileges of English Catholics, who faced significant social, economic, and political discrimination. Robert Catesby was born around 1573 in Warwickshire, England, into a prominent Catholic family. His father, Sir William Catesby, was a staunch Catholic and a committed supporter of the Spanish Armada's attempts to invade England in 1588. The Catesby family maintained strong connections with fellow Catholic families throughout the English countryside, which would later facilitate the planning and execution of the Gunpowder Plot. The precise relationship between the owner of Donington le Heath Manor House Museum and Catesby remains unclear. However, it is established that this individual was a part of the extensive network of Catholic families that were affiliated with Catesby. This connection highlights the broader importance of examining historical sites, such as Donington le Heath Manor House Museum, to shed light on critical socio-political events and religious tensions that shaped the lives and worldview of individuals who lived during that era. Today, Donington le Heath Manor House Museum serves as a testament to England's rich history and provides valuable insights into the struggles that English Catholics faced in the aftermath of the Reformation. This breathtaking specimen of medieval architecture not only illuminates the daily experiences of a typical 17th-century manor's inhabitants but also acts as a reminder of the complex web of political and religious allegiances that characterized the period. In conclusion, Donington le Heath Manor House Museum was once owned by a relative of one of the group of provincial English Catholics led by Robert Catesby. Catesby, who spearheaded the Gunpowder Plot of 1605, hoped to liberate English Catholics from oppressive religious restrictions by arranging a wide-scale attack against the Protestant establishment. The presence of a family member of his worshipping within the walls of this historic manor provides a tangible connection between this landmark and the broader narrative of England's turbulent religious history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Teacher:In this task, you are given an input list A comprising of numbers and alphabets. You need to extract and sort the unique alphabets in the list. The alphabets in the input list will only be in lowercase. Return -1 if there is no alphabet in the input list. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: ['j', '281'] Student:","output":"Yes, I understand the problem. We are given a list containing a mix of numbers and lowercase alphabets. Our task is to extract all unique alphabets, sort them, and return the sorted list. If there are no alphabets in the list, we need to return -1. Now, let's solve the instance: ['j', '281'] 1. First, we'll initialize an empty set to store unique alphabets. Let's call this set unique_alphabets. 2. Next, we'll iterate through the input list, checking each element. If the element is a lowercase alphabet (using the isalpha() and islower() methods), we'll add it to the unique_alphabets set, which ensures that each alphabet appears only once. 3. Once we've iterated through the entire list, we'll check the size of unique_alphabets set. If the set is empty, it means there were no alphabets in the input list and we return -1. 4. Otherwise, we'll convert the set of unique_alphabets to a list and sort it (using the sorted() function). 5. Finally, we'll return the sorted list of unique alphabets. Here's how this works for the given input ['j', '281']: 1. The unique_alphabets set is initialized as empty: unique_alphabets = set() 2. Iterating through the list:    - 'j' is a lowercase alphabet, so we add it to unique_alphabets -> unique_alphabets = {'j'}    - '281' is not an alphabet, and we skip it. 3. The unique_alphabets set is not empty, so we proceed to sort the unique alphabets. 4. Converting unique_alphabets into a sorted list -> sorted_unique_alphabets = ['j'] 5. The final sorted list of unique alphabets is ['j'], which we return. Thus, the solution for the given input is ['j']."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

(Pulls out her phone and starts searching) Let's see… The official website of the band mentions that tickets can be bought from three different sources: their website, a popular ticketing platform, and the concert venue itself. Ann: Hmm, which option would be the best for us? Natalia: Well, if we buy the tickets from the band's website, there might be exclusive merch available for purchase as well. Plus, we would be directly supporting our favorite band. Ann: That sounds awesome! But what about the ticketing platform? Are there any advantages to using that instead? Natalia: Yes, actually.

A:","output":"A: The Illustrated Man is a science fiction film based on a collection of eighteen short stories published in 1951 by the renowned American author Ray Bradbury. The film adaptation, released in 1969, primarily draws on three of these short stories: \\"The Veldt,\\" \\"The Long Rain,\\" and \\"The Last Night of the World.\\"  Ray Bradbury, born in 1920 and passed away in 2012, was a prolific writer known for his immense contributions to American literature, particularly within the realm of science fiction, fantasy, and horror. Some of his most famous works include Fahrenheit 451, Something Wicked This Way Comes, and The Martian Chronicles. The Illustrated Man's short stories are woven together by an overarching narrative, where a wanderer encounters a man covered in tattoos, known as \\"the illustrated man.\\" Each of these tattoos comes to life, revealing a different tale of humanity's ventures into the cosmos, its impact on Earth, and the implications of technological advancement.  The stories within The Illustrated Man showcase Bradbury's ability to blend poetic prose with thought-provoking concepts and explore the depths of human emotion. Each story delves into various aspects of science fiction, from space travel and time manipulation to artificial intelligence and virtual reality. Throughout the collection, Bradbury's characters are confronted with moral dilemmas, the consequences of their own actions, and the influence of technology on human nature and culture. In both the film and the book, The Illustrated Man serves as a reflection on our collective future and a cautionary tale, urging readers and viewers to consider the potential consequences of unbridled technological advancement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite her outward success, Kim has been struggling with her inner demons - which include depression, anxiety, and a traumatic past. The film opens at the conclusion of the local art fair, where Kim has just won a prestigious award for one of her paintings, titled \\"Beyond the Surface.\\" However, despite the adoration from her friends and the art community, Kim feels increasingly isolated and alone. Act II: The next day, Kim's close friend, Sarah, discovers her lifeless body in her apartment. The news of Kim's suicide reverberates through the small community and devastates everyone who knew her. The main character and Kim's sister, Emily, returns to town after several years of estrangement from their family. Emily's return provokes mixed emotions from her parents, neighbors, and friends as they cope with Kim's death and try to unravel the reasons behind it. As Emily delves deeper into her sister's life, she uncovers the struggles Kim faced in her last days. Emily discovers a series of unsent letters Kim wrote to her, revealing details of her depression, anxiety, and the pressure to maintain her image as an accomplished artist. Together with Sarah, Emily starts to question inconsistencies in the stories shared by people in the community and doubts the sincerity of the condolences received. Act III: The film's turning point occurs when Emily discovers a hidden room in Kim's apartment filled with unfinished paintings, sketches, and journals. In reading the journals and closely examining the artwork, Emily and Sarah put together the puzzle pieces of Kim's untold story, exposing the true depth of her emotional pain and the hidden secrets behind the seemingly perfect facade of their suburban community. As Emily and Sarah dig deeper, they expose relationships fraught with unrequited love, substance abuse issues, and emotional manipulation. They learn that the jealousy and competitiveness within the community may have contributed to Kim's downfall and escalated her emotional distress, making it impossible for Kim to ask for help. Conclusion: In the emotional climax, Emily comes to the heartbreaking realization that she could have been there for Kim had she not let their own unresolved issues keep them estranged. The film concludes with Emily and Sarah advocating for mental health awareness in the community and establishing an art therapy program in Kim's memory, named \\"Beyond the Surface,\\" aimed at helping others coping with depression and anxiety. Through the exploration of the untold stories behind Kim's life and the interconnected lives of her community members, the movie highlights the importance of open conversations about mental health and the need for empathy and support towards individuals trying to navigate the struggles of life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 4 August 1950, with the PRC invasion of Taiwan aborted, Mao Zedong reported to the Politburo that he would intervene in Korea when the People's Liberation Army's (PLA) Taiwan invasion force was reorganized into the PLA North East Frontier Force. China justified its entry into the war as a response to \\"American aggression in the guise of the UN\\".\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The People's Republic of China (PRC) had more people in it than the People's Liberation Army (PLA). The PRC refers to the entire country of China, which had a population of around 551 million people in 1950. On the other hand, the PLA is the armed forces of the PRC, which during the Korean War, had about 3-4 million personnel, including ground forces, navy, and air force. So, the PRC as a whole had a much larger number of people compared to the armed forces (PLA) within it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Control of Galaxy IV was lost on May 19 , 1998 when the satellite 's primary control processor failed . The backup control processor had suffered a previously undetected anomaly , and PanAmSat was not able to regain control of the spacecraft . Galaxy IV was declared a loss on May 20 , 1998 . Failure of the primary control processor was attributed to tin whisker growth , a phenomenon in which tendrils grow from solder , causing an electrical short circuit . Engineers believe that a hole developed in the conformal wax coating over the solder , allowing whiskers to develop . The satellite manufacturer , Hughes , has replaced pure tin plating with nickel to alleviate the problem in newer designs , adding 45 to 90 kg per payload . The loss of this satellite was very disruptive to telecommunications in the United States . Pagers were affected greatly ; service was not restored for days . Wire news services , like Reuters , were also affected . The TV network CBS had to use alternate means of transmitting its programs , as did NPR . At the time of failure , Galaxy IV was in geostationary orbit at 99 ° W. This orbital slot was briefly occupied by Galaxy 4R , and is now occupied by the Galaxy VI satellite . Galaxy IV remains in space .  - An Internet service provider (ISP) is an organization that provides services for accessing and using the Internet. Internet service providers may be organized in various forms, such as commercial, community-owned, non-profit, or otherwise privately owned.  - Univision is an American Spanish language broadcast television network that is owned by Univision Communications. The network's programming is aimed at Latino Americans and includes telenovelas and other drama series, sports, sitcoms, reality and variety series, news programming, and imported Spanish-language feature films.  - In telecommunication, a transponder is one of two types of devices. In air navigation or radio frequency identification, a flight transponder is an automated transceiver in an aircraft that emits a coded identifying signal in response to an interrogating received signal. In a communications satellite, a satellite transponder receives signals over a range of uplink frequencies usually from a satellite ground station, amplifies them, and re-transmits them on a different set of downlink frequencies to receivers on Earth, often without changing the content of the received signal or signals.  - The former PanAmSat Corporation founded in 1984 by Reynold (Rene) Anselmo, was a satellite service provider headquartered in Greenwich, Connecticut. It operated a fleet of communications satellites used by the entertainment industry, news agencies, internet service providers, government agencies, and telecommunication companies. Anselmo got the idea for PanAmSat from Norm Leventhal, a communications lawyer in Washington, D.C., to whom he had turned to for advice regarding difficulties he was encountering in getting reasonably priced satellite transmission for his Spanish International Network (SIN), the current-day Univision. Anselmo financed the entire project himself and Leventhal's law firm, hiring Martin Rothblatt for special satellite technical advice, filed for approval from the Federal Communications Commission and lining up an initial satellite from RCA Astro-Electronics and a heavily discounted launch from Arianespace.  - A communications satellite is an artificial satellite that relays and amplifies radio telecommunications signals via a transponder; it creates a communication channel between a source transmitter and a receiver at different locations on Earth.

Answer:","output":"To find out how many more people of German descent there were than of Irish descent in the county, we need to consider the percentages of both ancestries in the overall population, as stated in the context. The total population of the county was 42,040 people. The percentage of the population of German and Irish descent was 26.4% and 15.4%, respectively. First, calculate the number of people of German and Irish descent by multiplying their respective percentages by the total population: German descent: 42,040 * 26.4% = 42,040 * 0.264 ≈ 11,099 people (rounded to the nearest whole number) Irish descent: 42,040 * 15.4% = 42,040 * 0.154 ≈ 6,474 people (rounded to the nearest whole number) Now, to find the difference in the number of people of German and Irish descent, we simply subtract the number of Irish people from the number of German people: 11,099 (German) - 6,474 (Irish) = 4,625 So, there were 4,625 more people of German descent than of Irish descent in the county."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Whilst they are ridiculously expensive compared with most other nail polishes (AU39), they are still much more affordable than the AU1,000,000,000 a handbag costs (or so I estimate as I have never actually priced one). After seeing swatches of Peridot online, I knew that baby would one day be mine. The other two polishes in the collection - Quartz and Graphite - did not excite me the way Peridot did. That was until I read this review of Graphite on the Polish Police. Suddenly, Graphite was on my radar. It was stuck in my head like an ear worm; another baby, soon to be adopted. I argued with myself for about a month on whether to get these polishes or not. Could I really spend nearly 80 on nail polish. It did seem rather excessive to me.

If Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\", can we conclude that \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\"?","output":"The two phrases, \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\" and \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\" share similarities in their essence, but they have different contexts, implications, and potential consequences. Let's dive deeper into the differences between these two statements: 1. Context: The first phrase, \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\" implies that the person giving the advice is asking someone to convey a particular message to a third person to observe or gauge their reaction or response. It suggests that the information being shared could potentially have an impact on the listener. Consequently, it implies a level of curiosity or anticipation regarding the response, which could be later used to further a conversation or make decisions. On the contrary, the second phrase, \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\" suggests an action that someone should perform without necessarily understanding the rationale behind it. This advice leans more towards trusting someone else's judgment or simply obeying an instruction. Here, the focus is on compliance rather than gaining insight through dialogue or shared experiences. 2. Implications: When someone is encouraged to \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\", it involves a form of communication and interaction with another person. Such an approach acknowledges the value of exchanging thoughts, perspectives, or ideas and can potentially foster open dialogue, understanding, or growth in a relationship. On the other hand, when told, \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\", it might lead to a situation where the person performing the action complies without questioning or opinion. This could result in a one-way, unidirectional relationship where one person orders while the other person blindly obeys. 3. Potential Consequences: Following the advice, \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\", can lead to active engagement in a conversation, better understanding of each other's perspectives, and possibly an improved relationship. Trying to anticipate the outcome or reaction is part of the process and allows the person giving the advice to learn and adapt to the situation. Conversely, acting on the suggestion, \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\" might not always yield positive outcomes. Carrying out an action without understanding the underlying reasons may lead to confusion, miscommunication, or errors. In the long run, such behavior may undermine trust or lead to complacency and stagnation within a relationship. In conclusion, while both phrases suggest acting without complete understanding, their context, implications, and potential consequences differ significantly. \\"Just say that to him, and see what he says.\\" encourages an exchange of ideas and dialogue, while \\"You don't need to understand what it's about. Just do it.\\" pushes for compliance without questioning the rationale behind the action. Thus, we cannot directly conclude that one statement can be replaced by the other without considering the specific circumstances of each situation. It is essential to weigh the possible outcomes, evaluate the context, and seek a balance between open communication and trust in a given relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Write the answer: Which country, the world's fifth-largest, is named after its first export?","output":"Brazil, the world's fifth-largest country by land area, is named after its first major export, which was initially Brazilwood. Covering 8.51 million square kilometers and comprising 26 states and a federal district, Brazil is located in Eastern South America and has borders with several countries, including Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Guyana, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela. The name Brazil is derived from the Portuguese term \\"pau-brasil,\\" which refers to a tree that grows primarily in the country’s eastern coastal region. The \\"pau-brasil\\" tree (Caesalpinia echinata) produces a highly valued reddish-brown wood known for its durability, beauty, and suitability for carving intricate designs. It also yields a vivid red dye used for textile production, which was much sought-after in Europe during the 16th century. Portuguese explorer Pedro Álvares Cabral first landed in Brazil on April 22, 1500, and quickly recognized the potential value of Brazilwood for their overseas trading activities. As such, the exporting of Brazilwood started not long after the arrival of Europeans in the region. The intense trade of Brazilwood rivaled the spice trade in importance to the Portuguese economy at the time. Consequently, \\"ilha de Vera Cruz,\\" the early name given to the land by Pedro Álvares Cabral, was replaced with \\"Terra do Brasil\\" or \\"Land of Brazil,\\" as a reference to its most important natural resource back then. Over time, Brazil's economy diversified, and other commodities, such as sugarcane and coffee, gained prominence in the country's exports. Brazil gained independence from Portugal on September 7, 1822, and its economy has since continued evolving from a primarily agricultural focus to an increasingly industrialized and service-oriented structure. Today, Brazil is the 12th largest economy in the world by nominal GDP and among the leading global exporters of manufactured goods, agricultural products, and minerals. Despite the changes in its economy and the array of products that it now exports, the name Brazil still serves as a reminder of the country's historical roots and the initial export that shaped its development over centuries. Interestingly, the \\"pau-brasil\\" tree's status has, however, changed significantly. Due to excessive exploitation, the Brazilwood tree is now classified as an endangered species and its logging and export are heavily regulated to ensure its survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates.  But I can use this background: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year.  What is an answer for this question: Which student knew more about seafloor spreading? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, Bobby seems to have known more about seafloor spreading, as he learned more about divergent tectonic plates. Seafloor spreading is a process that occurs at divergent plate boundaries, where two plates are moving apart from each other. This is closely related to the concept of continental drift, which involves the movement of the Earth's continents over time. On the other hand, Nate was more confident in explaining convergent plates. Convergent plate boundaries involve two plates moving towards each other, which leads to processes such as subduction, where one plate is forced under another, or mountain building through the collision of continental plates. In relation to the specific topic of seafloor spreading, Bobby's focus on divergent tectonic plates would make him more knowledgeable about the subject. Seafloor spreading is directly related to the movement of oceanic plates at divergent boundaries, where new crust is formed as magma rises to the surface and cools. This process also results in the formation of hydrothermal vents and spreading centers, both of which were mentioned in the given background information. However, it is important to note that both students have valuable insights into different aspects of plate tectonics, and their combined knowledge would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the subject. While Bobby may be better suited to explain seafloor spreading, Nate's expertise in convergent plates is equally important for understanding the overall dynamics and interactions of Earth's tectonic plates."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Elena was excited to try out the hammock that Samantha had bought them, and","output":"as she approached the spot that Samantha had picked to set it up - between two large, sturdy oak trees in their backyard - she couldn't help but feel a sense of warmth and relaxation wash over her. The sun's golden rays filtered through the leaves of the trees, casting dappled patterns on the vibrant green grass. She silently thanked Samantha for choosing an idyllic corner of their yard to hang up the hammock. Samantha watched as Elena approached the hammock and then gave it a cautious, yet excited, glance. Samantha simply smiled, her eyes twinkling with happiness at the sight of her friend. She knew how much Elena had always wanted a hammock, something that could offer a peaceful retreat from the long hours Elena devoted to her work every day. \\"Now, remember to watch your step,\\" Samantha called out gently, her expression filled with mirth. \\"I've heard that hammocks can be treacherous for the uninitiated.\\" Elena let out a soft chuckle before attempting to swing her leg over the edge of the swaying hammock. With more grace than she anticipated, Elena found herself sinking into the soft, fabric embrace. Satisfied, she let out a contented sigh and closed her eyes. The gentle rocking motion and the lulling symphony of rustling leaves and birdsong enveloped her in a cocoon of serenity. Samantha decided that this would be an opportune moment to grab a picnic basket she had prepared earlier. Filled with Elena's favorite sandwiches and beverages, along with a small blanket to spread out on the grass, she hoped this would add an extra touch of relaxation to their afternoon. With the picnic basket in hand, Samantha carefully approached the hammock. She set the basket down on the blanket beside her friend and sat down, her eyes keenly observing Elena's peaceful visage. She delicately unfolded the blanket and spread it over Elena, tucking it around her as the temperature began to dip ever so slightly. As the sun lazily arced across the sky, Samantha could feel her own eyes growing heavy. She gazed at the picnic basket, still filled with untouched food and drink. She would be sure to wake Elena when hunger struck or the sun began to set, she mused. For now, though, they would both enjoy the warmth of each other's company and the healing embrace of nature. Time seemed to slow to a crawl, and when Samantha finally surrendered to her own weariness, she gingerly stretched out her legs and leaned back onto the blanket. Just before her eyes closed, she smiled at the thought that the hammock - an innocent, woven nest of comfort - would become a shared sanctuary for the two of them. The women drifted off into a restorative slumber, the tranquility of their sanctuary working its magic on their minds, bodies, and souls. Their friendship, rooted deeply in the fertile soil of affection, understanding, and loyalty, had blossomed into an enduring bond, as steady and unshakable as the oak trees that held up the hammock. When they eventually awoke, the sun had begun to dip towards the horizon, creating a canvas of warm, glowing hues. As Elena climbed out of the hammock and sank her toes into the refreshing grass, she smiled over at Samantha, her eyes filled with gratitude. Little did they know that this humble hammock would become the centerpiece of countless memories, a warm refuge where laughter, tears, and introspection would be shared between them. The years would pass, and though their lives would evolve and change, the roots of their friendship would only deepen, strengthened by quiet afternoons spent sharing a hammock beneath their backyard oak trees."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   CHAPTER REVIEW 20.1 Structure and Function of Blood Vessels Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to the heart. Arteries transport blood away from the heart and branch into smaller vessels, forming arterioles. Arterioles distribute blood to capillary beds, the sites of exchange with the body tissues. Capillaries lead back to small vessels known as venules that flow into the larger veins and eventually back to the heart. The arterial system is a relatively high-pressure system, so arteries have thick walls that appear round in cross section. The venous system is a lower-pressure system, containing veins that have larger lumens and thinner walls. They often appear flattened. Arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins are composed of three tunics known as the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. Capillaries have only a tunica intima layer. The tunica intima is a thin layer composed of a simple squamous epithelium known as endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue. The tunica media is a thicker area composed of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. It is the thickest layer in all but the largest arteries. The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, although in veins, it also contains some smooth muscle. Blood flow through vessels can be dramatically influenced by vasoconstriction and vasodilation in their walls.   Q: Blood vessels blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to this?   Choices:  - lungs  - feet  - brain  - heart  A: Answer:","output":"Blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of vessels known as arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins before returning to the heart. In the cardiovascular system, blood is transported to various parts of the body by a complex network of blood vessels. After being pumped by the heart, oxygen-rich blood is transported away from the heart through arteries. These arteries gradually branch into smaller vessels called arterioles, which further distribute blood to the capillary beds. Capillary beds are the primary site of exchange between the blood and body tissues, supplying nutrients, oxygen, and other essentials while removing waste products, such as carbon dioxide, from the tissues. Following the exchange at the capillary beds, blood is collected by small vessels called venules, which lead to larger veins. Veins continue to carry the blood, now oxygen-depleted and containing waste products, back to the heart. From the heart, the blood is sent to the lungs to be reoxygenated and remove carbon dioxide, and the cycle starts all over again. Blood vessels, including arteries, arterioles, venules, and veins, are composed of three layers (tunics) known as the tunica intima, tunica media, and tunica externa. Each of these layers plays a specific role in the structure and function of blood vessels. The tunica intima, which is the innermost layer, is comprised of a simple squamous epithelium called endothelium and a small amount of connective tissue. The tunica media, which is thicker than the tunica intima, consists of variable amounts of smooth muscle and connective tissue. This layer is the thickest in all but the largest arteries. The tunica externa is primarily a layer of connective tissue, with the exception of veins where it also contains some smooth muscle. Blood flow through blood vessels can be significantly influenced by the processes of vasoconstriction and vasodilation, which occur within the vessel walls. These processes regulate the diameter of blood vessels and control blood flow to various organs and tissues according to their specific needs. To sum up, blood pumped by the heart flows through a series of blood vessels, including arteries, arterioles, capillaries, venules, and veins, before eventually returning to the heart. This continuous cycle ensures the proper distribution of oxygen and nutrients to the body's cells and the removal of waste products, ultimately maintaining the overall health and functioning of the body's systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The impact weighting of the Research Excellence Framework has been increased for 2021, and more recently the UK Government announced a new funding stream for knowledge exchange. But achieving impact isn’t easy, especially for researchers early in their careers. If you ever have a spare week, or ten, it’s worth reading through some of the 6,637 REF impact case studies on the HEFCE website. There are some brilliant and fascinating examples of how researchers have achieved impact, but what strikes me most is how different impact looks across different subjects. At the risk of being flippant, among many of the medical or technological examples there is a familiar pattern and a clear route to impact: make breakthrough; license drug/technology; save lives/£millions. For social and political science (not to mention economics, languages, education, philosophy, etc.) the route to impact is much more fragmented. Among the 97 sociology case studies, for example, impact comes from numerous briefings of government officials and parliamentarians, before the academics join “networks” and “committees” discussing their research and wider issues. Their research is covered by national media, they meet even more people – practitioners or third sector campaigning organisations to pass on their knowledge. And, after all that, and often a good deal more, sometimes there is a policy or practice change that can be pointed to as a direct impact, sometimes not. Central to much of the impact is “access”. Prominent and experienced academics are more likely to get on the committees, know the right journalists and government officials, and have links into third sector organisations, etc. I worked with Professor Sir John Curtice, of election night fame, for a number of years.

Kirk and crew land on a lonely planet where the sun is about to explode.

Despite trying to get a straight answer from him about everyone's whereabouts, Atoz is indifferent to their questions and insist they must quickly 'make a selection while there is still time'. They have no idea what he's talking about but wander about looking at the hand mirror-like disks on the viewers and they see images of the planet's past. Then, while a disk is in the viewer, Kirk runs through the doorway and is magically transported back in time to what on Earth would look like the time of Louis XIV (the 1660s). When McCoy and Spock follow, a different disk is in the viewer and they are sent to an ice age hell. All too late they realize that the library is a time travel machine and repository. While Kirk's visit is pretty short and not all that exciting, Spock and McCoy's is much more eventful, as Spock falls head over heels for Mariette Hartley--who was sent to this awful place as a punishment.

In the premise, the key components are Julius, not despising, and business instinct. In the hypothesis, the key components are no ill will and businesses.

Since the premise is about Julius not despising business instinct, it could be interpreted as Julius having a positive or at least neutral attitude towards business instinct. However, the hypothesis is broader in scope, addressing the absence of ill will towards businesses in general. Although it is possible that Julius's statement could imply a favorable view on businesses, it is not explicitly addressed in the premise. Conclusion: The hypothesis is not strictly entailed by the premise, as the premise only focuses on Julius's opinion about business instinct and does not explicitly address a general attitude towards businesses.

The term comes from Arabic meaning a \\"report\\", \\"account\\" or \\"narrative\\". Hadith are second only to the Quran in developing Islamic jurisprudence, and regarded as important tools for understanding the Quran and commentaries (\\"tafsir\\") written on it. Some important elements of traditional Islam, such as the five salat prayers, are mentioned in hadith.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \\"sunnah\\", composed of accounts called \\"hadith\\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims.

Their religion, \\"Yazidism\\" is linked to ancient Mesopotamian religions and combines aspects of Zoroastrianism, Islam, Christianity and Judaism. Yazidis who marry non-Yazidis are automatically considered to be converted to the religion of their spouse and therefore are not permitted to call themselves Yazidis. They live primarily in the Nineveh Province of Iraq. Additional communities in Armenia, Georgia, Turkey, Iran, and Syria have been in decline since the 1990s as a result of significant migration to Europe, especially to Germany. The Yazidis' cultural practices are observably Kurdish, and almost all speak Kurmanji (Northern Kurdish).

Massive Category 4 Typhoon Dujuan strikes Taiwan UPDATED Monday 8:45 a.m. ET: Typhoon Dujuan made landfall as a Category 4 storm a bit south of its predicted landfall location, in Yilan County along the island's northeast coast. The storm slammed coastal areas of northern Taiwan with winds gusting to at least 150 miles per hour, based on weather observations and storm chasers who were in the area at the time. According to Twitter reports, the community of Su'ao Township was particularly hard hit by strong winds. Meanwhile, in Taiwan's mountains, torrential rain is falling and will continue to do so through Monday night local time. More than two feet of rain is expected in some areas. 5:40 pm. Some of worst wind I've ever seen. Whiteout. Swirling. Screaming. Trees still up waved like mad, then disappeared in it. #DUJUAN — Josh Morgerman (@iCyclone) September 28, 2015 Because of the southward jump in the storm center as the storm made landfall — a movement that was likely related to frictional forces the storm encountered as its circulation slammed up against the mountainous terrain of north central Taiwan — Taipei was spared the worst winds from the storm, but it is still seeing strong winds and heavy rain. UPDATED Monday 3 a.m. ET: Typhoon Dujuan continued its Category 4 intensity into Monday afternoon local time in Taiwan. With torrential rains and crashing waves battering the northeastern coast, thousands were evacuated from Taiwan's Green Island and Orchid Island. Landfall is predicted at around 11 p.m. local time (11 a.m. ET). In the morning in Taipei, the typhoon had maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour, or 63 meters per second, though this may be a slight underestimate. Heavy rain from the influences of the storm was already falling in parts of Taiwan as Monday dawned. Monstrous waves crashing into small section of Suao port in #Taiwan as #typhoon #Dujuan nears pic.twitter.com/Xu63505moH — James Reynolds (@EarthUncutTV) September 28, 2015 Typhoon warnings as well as warnings for heavy rainfall, which will bring with it the risk of landslides and flooding, have been issued for much of Taiwan, where mountainous terrain squeezed more than 50 inches of rain out of a typhoon earlier this season. The strongest winds and worst coastal flooding is expected to occur along and to the north of where the storm's center comes ashore, while flooding rains can be expected across the entire island. As of Sunday morning, the storm was the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane, with maximum sustained winds of 140 miles per hour, or 63 meters per second. It was still intensifying, and may peak near 150 miles per hour in intensity, which would make it a super typhoon. The storm is likely to weaken to Category 3 or back to Category 4 intensity before it hits the northeast coast of Taiwan, with the potential to produce widespread wind damage, mudslides and flooding from heavy rain as well as a powerful storm surge, depending on the angle with which it approaches the coast and the timing of landfall. The storm will also affect the southern Ryukyu Islands of Japan, which have been pummeled by multiple typhoons so far this year. Taiwan is used to encounters with typhoons, and so far this year the island has been buffeted by at least three other typhoons. Typhoon Soudelor, which made a direct hit on the island nation, dumped upwards of 50 inches of rain, leading to major flooding. Because of Typhoon Dujuan's slow movement — it was moving west at just 8 miles per hour as of Sunday morning eastern time — it too threatens to produce flooding rainfall as well. In addition, the storm has a large eye at least 40 miles in diameter, surrounded by a solid ring of towering thunderstorms. Such typhoons, which are distinguished from storms that have smaller eyes and a more narrow \\"eye wall\\" of storms surrounding the storm's center, are known as annular tropical cyclones. They can be more resistant to rapid weakening than more ordinary typhoons, according to WeatherUnderground. The timing of the storm's landfall in northern Taiwan looks to be during the overnight hours on Monday local time, with the peak of the storm coming during the day on Tuesday. (Taipei is 12 hours ahead of New York.) Computer visualization of the winds spinning around the center of Typhoon Dujuan on Sunday September 27, 2015. The Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan says there is an 85 to 90% chance that areas in northern Taiwan, including Taipei, Keelung and Yilah will see sustained winds stronger than about 40 miles per hour. (In this case, the actual winds are likely to be significantly stronger than that.)

Once the storm passes Taiwan, it is forecast to emerge over the South China Sea as a moderate typhoon, and make its final landfall along the coast of Fujian Province, China.

The main goal is to multiply the odd numbers in each inner list and return a new list with the products of odd numbers. If there are no odd numbers in an inner list, you should output 0 for that list. Here are the steps to solve the problem: 1. Understand the input format: a list of lists with integers inside. For example, the input is given as [[-2, -24], [-10, 45], [33, 21, 19, 42], [-41, 25, 36, -22, 38], [-47, -26, 20], [-29, 38, -48, 42, -15], [31, -6]]. 2. Initialize an empty list called 'result' to store the products of odd numbers for each inner list. 3. Iterate through each inner list in the given input list using a loop. For each inner list:    a. Initialize a variable called 'product' with a value of 1. This will be used to store the product of odd numbers for the current inner list.        b. Iterate through each number in the inner list using a nested loop. For each number:           i. Check if the number is odd. A number is odd if it's not divisible by 2 (the remainder when the number is divided by 2 is not 0). You can use the modulo operator (%) to check for odd numbers. For example, if number % 2 != 0, the number is odd.       ii. If the current number is odd, multiply the 'product' variable by the current odd number.    c. After iterating through all the numbers in the inner list, check if the 'product' variable is still 1. If it is, this means there were no odd numbers in the inner list. Assign 0 to the 'product' variable in this case.    d. Append the 'product' variable to the 'result' list. 4. After iterating through all the inner lists, the 'result' list will contain the products of odd numbers for each inner list. 5. Return the 'result' list as the solution.

Given the question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers? is inside the article: Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;..., can you guess it ? The answer is:","output":"Given the information in the passage provided, the answer to the question, \\"What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers?\\" is Monteux."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Black Death ravaged Europe for three years before it continued on into Russia, where the disease was present somewhere in the country 25 times between 1350 and 1490. Plague epidemics ravaged London in 1563, 1593, 1603, 1625, 1636, and 1665, reducing its population by 10 to 30% during those years. Over 10% of Amsterdams population died in 1623–1625, and again in 1635–1636, 1655, and 1664. Plague occurred in Venice 22 times between 1361 and 1528. The plague of 1576–1577 killed 50,000 in Venice, almost a third of the population. Late outbreaks in central Europe included the Italian Plague of 1629–1631, which is associated with troop movements during the Thirty Years War, and the Great Plague of Vienna in 1679.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that started the National Anthem? from the following article ?  In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,...

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Robert Louis Stevenson was born in Edinburgh in Scotland in 1850. He had to end his college studies because his health was poor. He began to travel, looking for a place that was good for his health. And he wrote about his travels. Inland Voyage(1878) was about journeys by canoe  on the rivers and canals of Belgium and France. Travels with a Donkey in the Cevennes followed it in next year. People loved his travel books, and they also found his poems beautiful. In 1879 he travelled to California in a very uncomfortable ship and then by train across the United States to San Francisco. He married in California, but his poor health made him and his wife travel again. Readers of his travel books and poetry were surprised when Treasure Island came out in 1883. It was not at all like his earlier writing, but both children and grown-ups loved it. Treasure Island was finished in Switzerland. Stevenson then continued to travel. He loved the islands of the southern Pacific Ocean, and he found that his health was better there. In the end, he and his wife made their home in Samoa. It was there that he wrote Kidnapped(1886), the story of David Balfour and Alan Breck. It was followed (but not immediately) by Catriona, which continues the story of David Belfour and tells of other exciting adventures of David and Alan, and of David's love for Catriona Drummond. In between the two stories about David Belfour came another surprising book, the \\"thriller\\" called The Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde. Stevenson died in Samoa in 1894, and he is buried there.

Question: The White House has announced sanctions against 38 Russian individuals and companies, saying the United States is standing up to ongoing \\"malign activity\\" by the Russian government against Western democracies and around the world. At Friday's White House briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the U.S. still wants to work with Russia.  \\"Again, what we would like to see is the totality of the Russian behavior change. We want to continue having conversations and work forward to building a better relationship,\\" Sanders said. The sanctions will be imposed on seven Russian oligarchs — including Oleg Deripaska, an aluminum magnate and close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin — and 12 companies they own or control. Seventeen senior Russian government officials, as well as a state-owned Russian weapons trading company and its subsidiary, a Russian bank, also will be targeted. The group includes key members of Putin's inner circle. Those sanctioned will have their assets blocked in the U.S. and people in the U.S. are barred from doing business with them. Friday, a number of U.S. lawmakers and foreign policy experts welcomed the measure, saying the sanctions are overdue. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democratic member of the House Intelligence Committee, said the move is the strongest action taken by the Trump administration to date for Russia's interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election and \\"its murder of dissidents at home and abroad.\\" \\"The sanctioning of oligarchs like Oleg Deripaska, who is linked to Paul Manafort, Alexander Torshin and Putin's son-in-law, will send a strong message to the Kremlin,\\" Schiff said in a statement.

In December 2005, the two ton Reclining Figure (1969–70) – insured for £3 million – was lifted by crane from the grounds of the Henry Moore Foundation on to a lorry and has not been recovered. Two men were jailed for a year in 2012 for stealing a sculpture called Sundial (1965) and the bronze plinth of another work, also from the foundation's estate. In October 2013 Standing Figure (1950), one of four Moore pieces in Glenkiln Sculpture Park, estimated to be worth £3 million, was stolen. In 2012, the council of the London Borough of Tower Hamlets announced its plans to sell another version of Draped Seated Woman 1957–58, a 1.6-tonne bronze sculpture. Moore, a well-known socialist, had sold the sculpture at a fraction of its market value to the former London County Council on the understanding that it would be displayed in a public space and might enrich the lives of those living in a socially deprived area. Nicknamed Old Flo, it was installed on the Stifford council estate in 1962 but was vandalised and moved to the Yorkshire Sculpture Park in 1997. Tower Hamlets Council later had considered moving Draped Seated Woman to private land in Canary Wharf but instead chose to \\"explore options\\" for a sale. In response to the announcement an open letter was published in The Guardian, signed by Mary Moore, the artist's daughter, by Sir Nicholas Serota, Director of the Tate Gallery, by filmmaker Danny Boyle, and by artists including Jeremy Deller. The letter said that the sale \\"goes against the spirit of Henry Moore's original sale\\" of the work.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways -   suppose less objects for the sound to bounce from happens, how will it affect the bat is unaware of its surroundings.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The perturbation in the described scenario, where there are fewer objects for sound to bounce from, can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. In the echolocation process carried out by bats and other animals, the production and reception of high-pitched tones is crucial for determining the size, shape, and position of objects in their surroundings. When there are fewer objects for the sound waves to bounce off of, the available information for the bat to interpret and analyze is reduced. This is due to the fact that the fewer echoes returning to the bat's ears, the less environmental input it has to assess its surroundings. This situation indirectly impacts the process of echolocation, particularly in the steps where the bat hears the echoed sound and uses the folds in its ears and adaptations in its brain to make sense of the returned sound waves. In a setting with fewer objects for sound to bounce from, the bat might experience difficulties in discerning its surroundings effectively, potentially leading to reduced navigation, foraging, and predator avoidance capabilities. It is worth noting that the aforementioned perturbation does not directly impact any specific step in the echolocation process, as the bat would still be able to produce high-pitched tones and listen to echoes returning from objects that are present. Rather, the perturbation's effect is felt more broadly across the process, as the quantity and diversity of information available to the bat is impacted. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation - having fewer objects for the sound to bounce from - can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the echolocation process, mainly by reducing the complexity and richness of information accessible to the bat in order to navigate its environment. This could lead to challenges in assessing the surroundings and adapting to varying conditions and potential threats, affecting the bat's overall ability to perform necessary behaviors for survival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It was important for them to compromise in order to preserve their friendship and make sure that both of them would have an enjoyable experience. In the end, they agreed that it was best for Felicia to go see a romantic movie so that she could indulge in the emotional journey of the characters and watch their love blossom on screen. These contrasting movie preferences among friends are not unusual, and they showcase the unique tastes that people have in terms of entertainment. Horror movies, which have been popularized with iconic films like \\"Psycho\\" and \\"The Shining,\\" tend to incite fear and suspense in viewers.

As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.'

'Accidental drowning, looks like.' I raised an eyebrow but didn't say anything. 'He's got a bump on the head that could have come off a rock. We'll see what the coroner says.' 'Any idea who he is?'

Virus worms way into webcams It sounds like a sci-fi nightmare, but it could be every teenage geek #39;s dream: a computer worm that can wriggle into bedrooms and secretly hijack webcams to spy on people. Which topic is this article about? Options:  + World.  + Sports.  + Business.  + Science/Tech.","output":"The article is about Science/Tech. The topic of this article falls under the category of Science/Tech as it discusses a computer worm, which is a type of malicious software, that has the ability to infiltrate webcams and secretly spy on people. This technology-related issue tends to raise concerns about privacy, security, and the potential misuse of technology in malicious ways. Computer worms are self-replicating programs that can spread throughout systems and networks without the need for direct user interaction. In this instance, the worm is designed to target webcams, which have become increasingly prevalent in daily life due to their use in communicating with friends, family, and colleagues over video calls. The potential risks posed by such worms could include the unauthorized recording of private conversations and personal moments, the collection of sensitive information, or even illegal surveillance by hackers. The threat of this particular worm emphasizes the need for continued vigilance when it comes to cybersecurity practices, both for individuals and organizations. This includes using strong passwords, regularly updating software and operating systems, and ensuring that protective measures such as firewalls and antivirus programs are in place. In response to the rise in webcam-targeting malware, many manufacturers have started to include security features within their devices, such as physical shutters to cover the lens or indicator lights to signal when the camera is in use. These features can provide users with an added layer of protection against potential privacy invasions. Moreover, this topic also extends to some ethical considerations regarding computer science and technology development. As advancements continue to progress, it becomes the responsibility of engineers, developers, and tech companies to create products that prioritize user security and minimize the risk of exploitation. This can be achieved through comprehensive testing, transparent privacy policies, and collaborations with cybersecurity experts to identify and remedy vulnerabilities.

What emotion might the person be experiencing here ?","output":"The person in the text appears to be experiencing a range of emotions, including fear, discomfort, determination, and urgency. Let us analyze the passage to understand the various emotional cues. Firstly, the description of the environment and physical sensations provides some insight into the emotions felt by the individual. The cold and surprisingly strong force, along with the jagged pieces of metal poking into the person's cheek, indicate that they are experiencing discomfort, and possibly, even pain. This physical sensation of discomfort and pain might evoke feelings of fear or anxiety in the person, as they may worry about the potential harm that the situation may cause to their body. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding the extent of their injury (questioning if their skin is tearing) suggests feelings of vulnerability and insecurity. The person is in a physically compromised situation and is unsure about the consequences of it. This uncertainty adds to the emotions of fear and anxiety, as they feel exposed and helpless in the face of this dangerous environment. Despite these overwhelming emotions, the person manages to pull themselves together and take action - yanking themselves away and shifting the debris to help see better. This behavior demonstrates determination and a sense of urgency. The person seems to be aware of the danger they are in and feels compelled to find a solution or a way out. They are driven by an innate desire to survive and protect themselves from further harm. In conclusion, the person in this passage is most likely experiencing an array of emotions that include fear, discomfort, vulnerability, determination, and urgency. These emotions are intertwined as the person navigates through a hazardous situation, driven by a need to protect themselves and find a solution amidst the chaos. The contrast between their vulnerable state and their determination to take action highlights the complexities of human emotions and showcases the resilience of humans in challenging circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An apostrophe is used to show possession, indicating that the life being discussed belongs to Rachel Proctor. The correct usage would therefore be \\"Proctor's\\". Punctuation can often change the meaning of a sentence, so it's crucial to use it correctly. In this case, without the apostrophe, it isn't clear that the life referred to is owned or associated with Rachel Proctor. The apostrophe helps prevent this confusion. Moreover, the final full stop (.) notates the end of the sentence. It indicates a full stop in thought and a clear break in the text. Using full stops correctly can aid in making the text more comprehensive and easier to read.

Sean Mercer (John Wayne) spots one and moves out with his men to capture it. During the chase which ensues, Little Wolf, the Indian (Bruce Cabot), is gored in the leg and the rhino escapes. Kurt (Hardy Krüger), who was driving the herding jeep, blames himself for the mishap, despite what Sean says, as he feels he was herding too close. Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate. When a young Frenchman with a chip on his shoulder named Charles Maurey (Gérard Blain) comes up to them and asks Sean for the Indian's job, as he was afraid if he waited someone else would get it, the party reacts with indignation and Kurt knocks him down in anger. Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question...where have most fossils of australopithecus been found??","output":"Australopithecus is a group of hominids that inhabited parts of Africa between approximately 4.2 and 2 million years ago. These early ancestors belong to our own human family tree and represent a crucial stage in human evolution. The discovery and study of Australopithecus fossils have played a vital role in understanding our early human ancestors and the environments they lived in. Most fossils of Australopithecus have been found in Eastern and Southern Africa, specifically in the countries of Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa. These regions boast various sedimentary basins that have preserved the fossil remains, facilitating their discovery and study. Some of the most famous and significant sites where Australopithecus fossils have been unearthed are: 1. Great Rift Valley (Eastern Africa): The Great Rift Valley is a massive geological fault system that extends from the Middle East through Eastern Africa, consisting of countries like Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. It is known for its extensive collection of hominid fossils, particularly those belonging to Australopithecus. Some crucial fossil discoveries from this region include:    a. Ethiopia: The Afar Triangle or Afar Depression, located in the northeastern part of the country, is home to the Hadar site. The Hadar site yielded numerous Australopithecus afarensis fossils, including the iconic \\"Lucy\\" skeleton discovered in 1974, and the \\"Selam\\" juvenile specimen found in 2000.     b. Tanzania: The Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli sites in Tanzania have also produced significant Australopithecus fossils. The Laetoli site is particularly famous for the discovery of a set of 3.6-million-year-old hominid footprints, attributed to Australopithecus afarensis, preserved in volcanic ash.    c. Kenya: Important fossil sites in Kenya include West Turkana, specifically the Lake Turkana region and Koobi Fora. Numerous Australopithecus fossils, such as the Australopithecus anamensis and Australopithecus afarensis, have been found in these regions. 2. Cradle of Humankind (South Africa): The Cradle of Humankind site, located near Johannesburg, is one of the most significant paleoanthropological arenas in Africa. Designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it spans over 180 square miles and features several limestone caves. It is best known for Australopithecus africanus fossils. Some of the well-known fossil discoveries from this area include:    a. Taung Child: Found in the Buxton Limeworks near the town of Taung in 1924, this is the first-ever discovery of an Australopithecus fossil. It comprises a partial skull and brain endocast of a young individual, Australopithecus africanus.    b. Sterkfontein Caves: Located near the town of Krugersdorp, the Sterkfontein Caves have contributed significantly to our understanding of early hominids. Notable Australopithecus africanus specimens, such as \\"Mrs. Ples\\" and \\"Little Foot,\\" have been uncovered here.    c. Swartkrans and Kromdraai: These are neighboring sites situated close to Sterkfontein Caves. Numerous Paranthropus (robust australopithecines) and early Homo fossils have been discovered here, offering a broader understanding of hominid diversity in the region. In summary, most fossils of Australopithecus have been discovered in Eastern and Southern Africa at various sites within Ethiopia, Tanzania, Kenya, and South Africa. These fossils have provided significant insights into the early stages of human evolution, helping us construct a better picture of our ancient hominid relatives and the environments they resided in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide more detail regarding each item, AC080 Antifreeze fluids: Antifreeze fluids, also known as coolant, are essential for your vehicle's cooling system. They are designed to lower the freezing point and raise the boiling point of water, which helps prevent your engine from overheating or freezing. This mixture generally contains ethylene glycol or propylene glycol as the primary component, along with water, corrosion inhibitors, and other additives to provide lubrication and prevent corrosion. AC090 Waste from production, formulation, and use of resins, latex, plasticizers, glues, and adhesives: Waste generated during the manufacturing, formulation, and application of resins, latex, plasticizers, glues, and adhesives can have environmental and health impacts. This waste can range from organic chemicals and solvents, leftover product, aerosol containers, and contaminated packaging materials. To minimize these impacts, it's necessary to properly manage, recycle, or dispose of such waste materials according to local regulations and environmental guidelines. Resins: Resins are a type of polymer used in various industries, such as construction, automotive, aerospace, and electronics. They are available as thermosetting or thermoplastic resins, and popular types include epoxy, phenolic, and polyester resins. Latex: Latex refers to a suspension of polymer particles in water, creating a milky substance. Natural latex is derived from the sap of the rubber trees, while synthetic latex is made from petrochemicals. Latex is used in various applications, like making gloves, balloons, mattresses, and paint. Plasticizers: Plasticizers are additives that increase the flexibility, workability, and durability of materials like plastics and rubber. They are added to products such as PVC pipes, vinyl flooring, and electrical cables to make them more pliable and easy to work with. Common plasticizers include phthalates and adipates. Glues and Adhesives: Glues and adhesives are substances used to bond two or more objects together. They are widely used in construction, woodworking, packaging, and other industries.

The decision by the British government to suspend flights to Kenya is regrettable, it plays into the hands of terrorists. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The British government banned flights to Kenya.","output":"Yes, based on the given paragraph, we can quite conclusively determine that the sentence \\"The British government banned flights to Kenya\\" is essentially true. The paragraph does not explicitly use the term 'ban', rather it states that the British government decided to 'suspend' flights to Kenya. While a suspension might technically be temporary and a ban suggests more permanence, in the broad sense, both actions lead to a halt or an interruption of flight services from Britain to Kenya. The implication from the paragraph is clear: the British government has strategically subjected travel to Kenya to an immediate halt. It's important to note that the reason behind the suspension is not stated. The paragraph only expresses regret over this decision, associating it to benefiting terrorists. However, the casual reader would interpret ‘suspension’ as synonimous to 'ban', but there are nuanced differences in wording where suspension might be temporary necessitated by situations such as weather conditions or immediate security threats, while a ban implies a more severe, often politically or safety motivated prohibition, typically for an undisclosed or extended period of time. In this regard, depending on the context and the desired precision of language, one might take issue with equating 'suspend flights' with 'banned flights'. But in terms of surface interpretation, readers would generally regard the two as more or less identical, as both imply an immediate cessation of flight operations between the two points - Britain and Kenya.  Therefore, based on the lack of explicit time frames or detailed context, it is safe to view \\"The British government banned flights to Kenya\\" as an accurate conversion of the original information in the paragraph for a majority of readers, while recognizing that the specific language may imply different things in specialized or official contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts.

Today’s kitchens easily supplant the bathroom as the home’s most dangerous room. While scalds and falls on tile can inflict serious harm in the bathroom, modern kitchen appliances and gadgets offer many more opportunities for injury. Even a seemingly simple kitchen task can result in a devastating injury. Just ask April Stewart Klausner, a New York illustrator and accomplished cook. Recently Ms. Klausner, 56, severed four tendons, multiple nerves and a blood vessel in her hand while pitting an avocado, something she’d done countless times. Gushing blood and unable to feel or move two fingers, she was taken by ambulance to an emergency room. The injury required more than three hours of surgical repair and many months of painful rehab. It will take at least a year for the injured nerves to heal, and Ms. Klausner can only hope her hand will function normally, enabling her to resume her career full-speed. The therapists at Lang Hand Therapy in Manhattan told her she was the fourth “avocado victim” they’d seen that month. “So add that to immersion blenders and mandolines . . . and maybe the bathroom is not the most dangerous room in the house!” Ms. Klausner said in an e-mail. Knowledge and mindfulness are the secrets to kitchen safety. My husband used to say, “From rushing no good can come.” Don’t try to do several things at once, and leave enough time to accomplish your tasks. Use timers, especially for foods that cook a long time. I use them for everything I cook. My favorite is the battery-operated West Bend Kitchen Timer, easily set by punching in the numbers for hours, minutes and seconds — a worthwhile investment. CUTS Knives are the most frequently used of hazardous kitchen tools. Two safety essentials: they must be sharp (dull knives are more likely to slip and cut the user), and they must be stored separately and safely in their own drawer (or divided section of one), in a wooden block or on a wall-mounted magnetic holder. I wash, dry and put away my knives as soon as I’m done using them. They should never be left lying on a countertop or in a sink full of water or other equipment. When slicing or mincing, keep fingers holding the food curled and out of harm’s way. Cut on a sturdy surface, moving the knife’s edge away from your body. Use the right knife for each task: a serrated blade, for example, is best for bread and safer for the person slicing it. Other sharp kitchen objects, like can lids, can cause nasty cuts. Be careful, too, when opening hard plastic packages, which often have sharp edges. Broken glass should be swept up with a broom and dust pan and disposed of posthaste. Do not use your hands; a damp but sturdy paper towel can be used to clean up tiny pieces of glass. BURNS Keep dry oven mitts near the stove and microwave, and always use them. Microwaved dishes can get extremely hot. Do not substitute dish towels for pot holders. Pot handles should be turned in toward the center of the range, away from the cook and passers-by, to prevent accidental tipping. Under a covered pot of boiling liquid, keep the gas flame low. Avoid steam burns by opening lids away from you. When cooking with hot oil, cover the pan with a spatter screen. Do not wear loose sleeves or flowing clothes while cooking, and tie up long hair. Note the shoes worn by professional chefs: clogs protect their feet in case hot water or oil spills on them. If you suffer a burn, immediately hold the injured area under cold water for several minutes. FIRES Do not leave or store flammable materials near the stove or in the oven. Make sure pots on open flames hold enough liquid, and use a trivet when placing a hot pot on a wood or fabric surface. Clean your oven often to keep it free of grease. If fats or oils catch fire, turn off the heat immediately but don’t try to pick up the pan. Never pour water on a grease fire; use salt or baking soda. Better yet, keep a fire extinguisher handy and know how to use it. FALLS Unnecessary climbs are a recipe for disaster. Keep often-used equipment and heavy pots within easy reach, and use high cupboards only for infrequently needed items and food products. Never stand on chairs. Invest in a sturdy stool with wide steps and rubberized foot pads. I used my wooden stool safely innumerable times until one morning it literally let me down. I landed hard on my back and narrowly missed cracking my head on a doorjamb. Wipe up all spills immediately lest they result in a human spill. I keep sponges and microfiber cloths handy for use on floors only. Leave no tripping hazards on the floor, including shoes and loose throw rugs. Though costly, cushioned rubber mats at the sink and food prep area are safer and more comfortable. ELECTRIC SHOCKS Modern kitchens are replete with electric tools that can result in life-threatening shocks if the power plug comes into contact with water. Read all warning labels and obey them. Use polarized plugs, and do not overload outlets. Dry your hands before plugging in and using appliances, and be sure to unplug an appliance before cleaning it. Hold the plug when pulling it from the socket; do not pull on the cord. POISONING Cleaning products should never be stored in the same cabinet as foods, medications or supplements. My grandmother nearly poisoned herself when she mistakenly drank cleaning fluid, thinking it was Milk of Magnesia; both were milky fluids in blue bottles, and she could not read English. Never transfer cleaning supplies to unmarked or emptied food containers. CHILD SAFETY Children are innately curious and can easily get into trouble in the kitchen the minute you turn your back. If you have young children, grandchildren or friends or relatives who visit with children, keep cabinets containing cleaning products and potent seasonings secured with a safety lock. Never cook with a child in your arms or baby carried in a sling. Best to have a safety seat in the kitchen to secure the child while you are cutting food or cooking. Never leave a toddler loose in the kitchen when no adult is present and paying attention. If children want to help with food preparation, give them age-appropriate tasks and supervise the undertaking. A 2-year-old can add cherry tomatoes to the salad; a 6-year-old can be taught how to cut soft vegetables; a 10-year-old may be able to slice meat. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"This article provides essential safety tips and precautions to avoid accidents and injuries in the kitchen, covering aspects like proper knife handling, preventing burns, fires, falls, electric shocks, and poisoning, as well as ensuring child safety during cooking and food preparation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: The first successful light bulb filaments were made of carbon (from carbonized paper or bamboo). Early carbon filaments had a negative temperature coefficient of resistance — as they got hotter, their electrical resistance decreased. This made the lamp sensitive to fluctuations in the power supply, since a small increase of voltage would cause the filament to heat up, reducing its resistance and causing it to draw even more power and heat even further. In the \\"flashing\\" process, carbon filaments were heated by current passing through them while in an evacuated vessel containing hydrocarbon vapor (usually gasoline). The carbon deposited on the filament by this treatment improved the uniformity and strength of filaments as well as their efficiency. A metallized or \\"graphitized\\" filament was first heated in a high-temperature oven before flashing and lamp assembly. This transformed the carbon into graphite which further strengthened and smoothed the filament. This also changed the filament to have a positive temperature coefficient, like a metallic conductor, and helped stabilize the lamp's power consumption, temperature and light output against minor variations in supply voltage. What is the answer to this question: What material were the first light bulb filaments made from?","output":"The first successful light bulb filaments were made from carbon. These carbon filaments were derived from carbonized paper or bamboo. This choice of material played a significant role in the early development of light bulbs, providing the necessary electrical and thermal properties required for the bulbs to function efficiently and effectively.

It bordered on the west with the country of the Helvetii, on the east with Noricum, on the north with Vindelicia, on the west with Transalpine Gaul and on south with Venetia et Histria. It thus comprised the districts occupied in modern times by eastern and central Switzerland (containing the Upper Rhine and Lake Constance), southern Bavaria and the Upper Swabia, Vorarlberg, the greater part of Tirol, and part of Lombardy. Later Vindelicia (today south-eastern Wuerttemberg and south-western Bavaria) formed part of Raetia. The northern border of Raetia during the times of Augustus and Tiberius was the River Danube. Later the Limes Germanicus marked the northern boundary, stretching for 166 km north of the Danube. Raetia linked to Italy across the Alps over the Reschen Pass, by the Via Claudia Augusta. The Romansh people living in Southeast Switzerland are believed to be direct descendants of the Raetians. However, the exact lineage of the Romansh (or Romansch) people remains incomplete.  - Magnus Maximus (ca. 335  August 28, 388) was Western Roman Emperor from 383 to 388.  - The Roman emperor was the ruler of the Roman Empire during the imperial period (starting in 27 BC). The emperors used a variety of different titles throughout history. Often when a given Roman is described as becoming \\"emperor\\" in English, it reflects his taking of the title \\"Augustus\\" or \\"Caesar\\". Another title often used was \\"imperator\\", originally a military honorific. Early Emperors also used the title \\"princeps\\" (first citizen). Emperors frequently amassed republican titles, notably \\"Princeps Senatus\\", \\"Consul\\" and \\"Pontifex Maximus\\".  - Aquileia ( Venetian: Aquieja/Aquiegia, ) is an ancient Roman city in Italy, at the head of the Adriatic at the edge of the lagoons, about from the sea, on the river Natiso (modern Natisone), the course of which has changed somewhat since Roman times. Today, the city is small (about 3,500 inhabitants), but it was large and prominent in Antiquity as one of the world's largest cities with a population of 100,000 in the 2nd century AD. and is one of the main archeological sites of Northern Italy.  - The Cimbri were an ancient people, either Germanic or Celtic who, together with the Teutones and the Ambrones, fought the Roman Republic between 113 and 101 BC. The Cimbri were initially successful, particularly at the Battle of Arausio, in which a large Roman army was routed, after which they raided large areas in Gaul and Hispania. In 101 BC, during an attempted invasion of Italy, the Cimbri were decisively defeated by Gaius Marius, and their king, Boiorix, was killed. Some of the surviving captives are reported to have been among the rebelling Gladiators in the Third Servile War.  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Theodosius I (11 January 347  17 January 395), also known as Theodosius the Great, was Roman Emperor from AD 379 to AD 395. Theodosius was the last emperor to rule over both the eastern and the western halves of the Roman Empire. On accepting his elevation, he campaigned against Goths and other barbarians who had invaded the empire. He failed to kill, expel, or entirely subjugate them, and after the Gothic War, they established a homeland south of the Danube, in Illyricum, within the empire's borders. He fought two destructive civil wars, in which he defeated the usurpers Magnus Maximus and Eugenius at great cost to the power of the empire.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - Constantinople  was the capital city of the Roman/Byzantine Empire (3301204 and 12611453), and also of the brief Latin (12041261), and the later Ottoman (14531923) empires. It was reinaugurated in 324 AD from ancient Byzantium as the new capital of the Roman Empire by Emperor Constantine the Great, after whom it was named, and dedicated on 11 May 330 AD.  - Augustus (23 September 63 BC  19 August 14 AD) was the founder of the Roman Principate and considered the first Emperor, controlling the Roman Empire from 27 BC until his death in AD 14.  - Flavius Eugenius (died 6 September 394) was a usurper in the Western Roman Empire (392394) against Emperor Theodosius I. Though himself a Christian, he was the last Emperor to support Roman polytheism.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.  The largest city on the river Rhine is Cologne, Germany, with a population of more than 1,050,000 people. It is the second-longest river in Central and Western Europe (after the Danube), at about , with an average discharge of about .  - Marcomer ( Marcomeres , Marchomer , Marchomir ) was a Frankish leader ( dux ) in the late 4th century who invaded the Roman Empire in the year 388 , when the usurper and leader of the whole of Roman Gaul , Magnus Maximus was surrounded in Aquileia by Theodosius I. The invasion is documented by Gregory of Tours who cited the now lost work of Sulpicius Alexander . According to this account Marcomer , Sunno and Genobaud invaded the Roman provinces Germania and Belgia in Gaul . They broke through the lines , killed many people , destroyed the most fruitful lands and made the city Cologne panic . After this raid , the main body of the Franks moved back over the Rhine with their booty . Some of the Franks remained in the Belgian woods . When the Roman generals Magnus Maximus , Nanninus and Quintinus heard the news in Trier , they attacked those remaining Frankish forces and killed many of them . After this engagement Quintinus crossed the Rhine to punish the Franks in their own country , however his army was surrounded and beaten . Some Roman soldiers drowned in the marshes , others were killed by Franks , few made it back to their Empire . Nanninus and Quintinus were replaced by Charietto and Syrus , who were again confronted by an attack of unidentified Franks . Later , after the fall of Magnus Maximus , Marcomer and Sunno held a short meeting about the recent attacks with the Frank Arbogastes , who was a general ( magister militum ) in the Roman army . The Franks delivered hostages as usual , and Arbogastes returned to his winter quarters in Trier . A couple of years later when Arbogastes had seized power and the West Roman army was nearly completely in the hands of Frankish mercenaries , he crossed the Rhine with a Roman army into Germania , because he hated his own kin . Marcomer was seen as leader with Chatti and Ampsivarii but the two did not engage . Later we hear from the poet Claudian that Marcomer was arrested by Romans and banned to a villa in Tuscany . His brother Sunno crossed the Rhine and tried to...  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Noricum is the Latin name for a Celtic kingdom, or federation of tribes, that included most of modern Austria and part of Slovenia. In the first century AD, it became a province of the Roman Empire. Its borders were the Danube to the north, \\"Raetia\\" and \\"Vindelicia\\" to the west, Pannonia to the east and southeast, and \\"Italia\\" (\\"Venetia et Histria\\") to the south. The kingdom was founded around 400 BC, and had its capital at the royal residence at Virunum on the Magdalensberg.  - The Battle of Actium was the decisive confrontation of the Final War of the Roman Republic, a naval engagement between Octavian and the combined forces of Mark Antony and Cleopatra on 2 September 31 BC, on the Ionian Sea near the promontory of Actium, in the Roman province of Epirus Vetus in Greece. Octavian's fleet was commanded by Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, while Antony's fleet was supported by the power of Queen Cleopatra of Ptolemaic Egypt.  - The Roman Senate was a political institution in ancient Rome. It was one of the most enduring institutions in Roman history, being established in the first days of the city (traditionally founded in 753 BC). It survived the overthrow of the kings in 509 BC, the fall of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC, the division of the Roman Empire in 395 AD, the fall of the Western Roman Empire in 476 AD, and the barbarian rule of Rome in the 5th, 6th, and 7th centuries.  - Northern Italy is a cultural and geographical region, without any administrative purpose, used to indicate the northern part of the Italian state, also informally referred as \\"Il Nord\\", \\"Settentrione\\" or \\"Alta Italia\\". It consists of 8 regions in northern Italy: Aosta Valley, Piedmont, Liguria, Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, Veneto, Friuli-Venezia Giulia, Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol. According to the 2011 census, its population was 27,213,372. For statistic purposes, the Istituto Nazionale di Statistica (ISTAT) uses the term Northwest Italy and Northeast Italy for identifying two of the five statistical regions in its reporting. These same subdivisions are used to demarcate first level Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) regions (\\"NUTS 1 regions\\") within the European Union, and the Italian constituencies for the European Parliament.  - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC  15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.  - The La Tène culture was a European Iron Age culture named after the archaeological site of La Tène on the north side of Lake Neuchâtel in Switzerland, where thousands of objects had been deposited in the lake, as was discovered after the water level dropped in 1857. La Tène is the type site and the term archaeologists use for the later period of the culture and art of the ancient Celts, a term that is firmly entrenched in the popular understanding, but presents numerous problems for historians and archaeologists. The culture became very widespread, and presents a wide variety of local differences. It is often distinguished from earlier and neighbouring cultures mainly by the La Tène style of Celtic art, characterized by curving \\"swirly\\" decoration, especially of metalwork.  - Marcus Antonius (Latin: ; January 14, August 1, 30 BC), commonly known in English as Mark or Marc Antony, was a Roman politician and general who played a critical role in the transformation of the Roman Republic from an oligarchy into the autocratic Roman Empire.  - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history.  - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany.

Frédéric Chopin Improvisation stands at the centre of Chopin's creative processes. However, this does not imply impulsive rambling: Nicholas Temperley writes that \\"improvisation is designed for an audience, and its starting-point is that audience's expectations, which include the current conventions of musical form.\\" The works for piano and orchestra, including the two concertos, are held by Temperley to be \\"merely vehicles for brilliant piano playing ... formally longwinded and extremely conservative\\". After the piano concertos (which are both early, dating from 1830), Chopin made no attempts at large-scale multi-movement forms, save for his late sonatas for piano and for cello; \\"instead he achieved near-perfection in pieces of simple general design but subtle and complex cell-structure.\\" Rosen suggests that an important aspect of Chopin's individuality is his flexible handling of the four-bar phrase as a structural unit.

Koscielny agrees new Arsenal deal Updated Jul 24, 2012 9:47 AM ET Arsenal defender Laurent Koscielny has agreed a new long-term contract with the Gunners. The 26-year-old France international joined Arsenal from Lorient in 2010 and has since established himself as a key member of Arsene Wenger's side. A statement on Arsenal's website read: \\"Arsenal football club is delighted to announce that Laurent Koscielny has agreed to sign a new long-term contract.\\" No details about the length of Koscielny's new contract were given. Koscielny has started 85 games for Arsenal over the last two years - no other player has started more at the club - and last year he earned his first call-up to the France squad. Since then, the former Guingamp and Tours centre-back has taken his tally of Les Bleus caps to four, the most recent of which came in the Euro 2012 quarter-final defeat to Spain, where he played the full 90 minutes in a 2-0 loss. Wenger said: \\"Laurent has been outstanding for us over the last two seasons.

Summarize the following: If the girl you’ve started chatting with is a stranger to you (or someone that you barely know), it’s important to find topics that you and her both have in common. For example, maybe you both go to the same school, live in the same neighborhood, or both study the same subject. Finding these commonalities will make further conversation more interesting. For example, ask:  “What part of the state did you grow up in?” “What’s your major in college?” Pay attention during your conversation, and note which types of topics the girl seems to enjoy most, or which she expresses an interest in. Then, bring these up again later to continue the conversation and learn more about the girl.  For example, if you know that she likes art, you could deliberately steer the conversation towards famous painters. Or, if the girl mentions an interest in soccer, bring up your own favorite soccer players or teams. The girl you’re speaking to will not enjoy the conversation if her only answers to your questions are “yes” or “no,” as these answers can quickly become repetitive or boring.  Instead, come up with some questions that ask her about her past or make her think, and that will result in a longer, more complex answer. Try asking something like:  “What movie or book character are you most like?” “What are some of your irrational pet peeves?” “What is an unusual fear or phobia that you have?” If you’re in the early stages of chatting with a girl and looking for ways to continue the chat, do not bring up topics that could lead to serious disagreement. Don’t make the girl uncomfortable with probing questions about her exes or past relationships, and also avoid sharing strong opinions on politics. Of course, if you and this girl end up getting to know one another better, these types of topics can lead to important and serious conversation. Summary:","output":"When chatting with a girl who is a stranger or someone you barely know, focus on finding common interests to make the conversation engaging. Pay attention to topics she enjoys and revisit them later in the conversation. Avoid yes/no questions and instead ask open-ended questions that elicit longer, more thoughtful responses. Steer clear of potentially divisive topics and personal probing during early conversations. As you get to know each other better, more serious topics may become appropriate for discussion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Possible answers: did this to get home, did this be prepared, did this to find the suitcase Answer:","output":"Alex did this to be prepared. Step 1: Understand the context - In this situation, Alex and Aubrey seem to be leaving a house. Step 2: Identify the task - Alex packed Aubrey's car. Step 3: Identify the potential reasons for the task - The possible answers provided are: to get home, to be prepared, and to find the suitcase. Step 4: Evaluate each possibility: a) To get home: While packing the car might ultimately lead to going home, packing the car itself doesn't directly indicate that Alex's goal is specifically to get home. b) To be prepared: Since packing a car typically involves being ready for a trip or journey, this answer makes sense given the context. Alex packed the car while Aubrey locked the house, suggesting it's part of their preparation to leave. c) To find the suitcase: There is no mention of a suitcase being lost or searched for in the context provided. Packing the car wouldn't necessarily imply that Alex is looking for a suitcase. Step 5: Select the most likely reason - Based on the context and the evaluation of each possibility, the most likely reason for Alex's action is to be prepared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another. Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Q: Passage: Another Alaskan transportation method is the dogsled. In modern times (that is, any time after the mid-late 1920s), dog mushing is more of a sport than a true means of transportation. Various races are held around the state, but the best known is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, a 1,150-mile (1,850 km) trail from Anchorage to Nome (although the distance varies from year to year, the official distance is set at 1,049 miles or 1,688 km). The race commemorates the famous 1925 serum run to Nome in which mushers and dogs like Togo and Balto took much-needed medicine to the diphtheria-stricken community of Nome when all other means of transportation had failed. Mushers from all over the world come to Anchorage each March to compete for cash, prizes, and prestige. The \\"Serum Run\\" is another sled dog race that more accurately follows the route of the famous 1925 relay, leaving from the community of Nenana (southwest of Fairbanks) to Nome. A:","output":"Task Explanation:  This task requests the creation of a question that appears to be relevant to a provided passage about dog sledding in Alaska, but which cannot be answered based on the information given in the passage. The question must be unanswerable due to one of the following methods suggested in the instructions: needing information outside of the passage, containing constraints not mentioned in the passage, replacing an entity/number/date in the passage with something else, or by manipulating a question that can be answered from the passage via replacing words with antonyms or inserting/removing negation words to make it unanswerable. Solution: Applying the mentioned suggestion iii (replacing an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date and using it in the question), a possible unanswerable question could be:  \\"How many miles is the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race from Anchorage to Fairbanks?\\" This question appears relevant as it talks about a race mentioned in the passage. However, it replaces \\"Nome\\" (the actual endpoint) with \\"Fairbanks\\", making the question unanswerable as the passage doesn't provide the distance of the race from Anchorage to Fairbanks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"From the given sentence, \\"The California State Senate is part of the California State Legislature,\\" we can extract the following data: 1. California State Senate: The sentence identifies a political institution called the \\"California State Senate\\" which is a component within a larger political framework. 2. California State Legislature: This sentence also refers to a broader political institution, the \\"California State Legislature.\\" It signifies that the California State Senate operates within the jurisdiction of this institution. 3. Relationship between California State Senate and California State Legislature: The sentence establishes a relationship between the California State Senate and the California State Legislature. The phrasing \\"is part of\\" indicates that the California State Senate is a constituent element of the California State Legislature. 4. State-level government: The mention of both the California State Senate and California State Legislature implies that these institutions are part of the state-level government in California, specifically dealing with making laws and regulations for the state. 5. Bicameral system: The fact that the California State Senate is mentioned as a \\"part\\" of the California State Legislature suggests that the legislative branch in California may follow a bicameral system, meaning there are two houses or chambers within the State Legislature. One of the chambers is the California State Senate, while the other chamber is not mentioned in the sentence but can be identified as the California State Assembly. 6. Geographical location: The sentence refers to the state of California. This signifies that both the California State Senate and California State Legislature are responsible for governing and making decisions specific to the Californian region within the United States of America. In summary, the sentence provides data about two political institutions, the California State Senate and the California State Legislature, their relationship with each other, and their roles within the state-level government of California.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Bin Laden and his aides did not need a very large sum to finance their planned attack on America. The 9/11 plotters eventually spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. Consistent with the importance of the project, al Qaeda funded the plotters. KSM provided his operatives with nearly all the money they needed to travel to the United States, train, and live. The plotters' tradecraft was not especially sophisticated, but it was good enough. They moved, stored, and spent their money in ordinary ways, easily defeating the detection mechanisms in place at the time. The origin of the funds remains unknown, although we have a general idea of how al Qaeda financed itself during the period leading up to 9/11. General Financing As we explained in chapter 2,  Bin Laden did not fund al Qaeda through a personal fortune and a network of businesses in Sudan. Instead, al Qaeda relied primarily on a fund-raising network developed over time. The CIA now estimates that it cost al Qaeda about 30 million per year to sustain its activities before 9/11 and that this money was raised almost entirely through donations. For many years, the United States thought  Bin Laden financed al Qaeda's expenses through a vast personal inheritance.  Bin Laden purportedly inherited approximately 300 million when his father died, and was rumored to have had access to these funds to wage jihad while in Sudan and Afghanistan and to secure his leadership position in al Qaeda. In early 2000, the U.S. government discovered a different reality: roughly from 1970 through 1994,  Bin Laden received about 1 million per year-a significant sum, to be sure, but not a 300 million fortune that could be used to fund jihad. Then, as part of a Saudi government crackdown early in the 1990s, the  Bin Laden family was forced to find a buyer for Usama's share of the family company in 1994. The Saudi government subsequently froze the proceeds of the sale. This action had the effect of divesting  Bin Laden of what otherwise might indeed have been a large fortune. Nor were  Bin Laden's assets in Sudan a source of money for al Qaeda. When  Bin Laden lived in Sudan from 1991 to 1996, he owned a number of businesses and other assets.

They wanted to see which fire would last longer.  Which group had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction?  Hint: A large log placed in a fire will burn relatively slowly. If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. The answer to this question is:","output":"Group B had a fire with wood that provoked a more intense reaction. Step 1: Analyze the hint provided. The hint states that a large log burns slowly, while small twigs burn much more quickly due to the increased surface area they provide. Step 2: Recall the information about surface area and its effect on reactions. An increased surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction, and smaller particles have more surface area. Step 3: Compare the two groups of scientists and their fires. Group A used a large log and group B used small twigs. Step 4: Apply the hint and the information about surface area to the two groups. Since the small twigs used by group B provide a greater surface area, they will burn more quickly and provoke a more intense reaction than the large log used by group A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The discomfort causes whoever it's pointed at to immediately start moving away. They often scream but the US military says the chance of injury from the system is 0.1%.

John Dorrian, a US military spokesperson, says the kit is now in Afghanistan but no decision has yet been made on its use. There's been much talk about the need to keep civilian casualties in Afghanistan to a minimum. The heat ray gun could help. The beam produced by the ADS can travel more than 500m (1,640ft) and is seen as an important new way to limit unnecessary deaths and minimise war zone casualties.

Answer the following question: In the shadow of the Seattle Space Needle, almost alien crystalline forms wrap their deft tendrils through the Chihuly Garden and Glass. Every single petal, bowl, stem and branch of cascading glass has been handblown under the guidance of Washington State native Dale Chihuly (in fact he grew up in nearby Tacoma), and we couldn’t quite believe our eyes. Having discovered this exhibit through the magic of Jaime’s instagram (she’s a self-named Angloyankophile who grew up in Seattle before moving to London) I knew we would have to visit. My photos don’t do the undulating forms any kind of justice; but they might just convey the incredible scale of the exhibition. I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A. Chihuly’s lifelong fascination for glasshouses has grown into a series of exhibitions within botanical settings. Question: When did the author discover the exhibit Chihuly Garden and Glass?

Without more specific information about the situation, it is difficult to provide an accurate response. However, I can still offer a general perspective on how others might feel as a result of Kendall's actions. If Kendall genuinely identified flaws in a light-related system, design, or concept and effectively provided a solution to fix those issues, then others might feel a variety of emotions as a result: 1. Appreciation: People who were affected by the flaws or those who found them annoying may appreciate Kendall's effort to acknowledge the issue and work towards resolving it. They would likely be grateful for the improvement in their experience or environment. 2. Respect: Some individuals may respect Kendall's skills, dedication, and problem-solving abilities, as solving a problem often requires critical thinking and expertise in a particular area. 3. Inspiration: Observers or teammates might feel inspired by Kendall's actions to address problems proactively and create positive changes when they encounter similar situations in the future. 4. Relief: In some cases, issues with lighting (e.g., flickering, poor color rendering, inadequate brightness) can cause discomfort, inconvenience, or even health issues. If Kendall's solution successfully addressed these concerns, people who were affected may feel relieved. 5. Skepticism or resistance: There might also be individuals who question the necessity or value of the changes Kendall implemented. They may be skeptical about the effectiveness of the solution or worry about potential implications (e.g., costs, adaptability) on a larger scale. It is essential to note that these emotions may vary depending on the context, the nature of the flaws, the proposed solution, and the way Kendall presents their findings and ideas.

Question 1: \\"What is the use of the 'this' keyword in Java?\\" Question 2: Why use super keyword in java? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To answer both questions, let me first explain the keywords individually and then compare them. Question 1: \\"What is the use of the 'this' keyword in Java?\\" Step 1: Understand the keyword. The 'this' keyword in Java is used as a reference to the current object of a class. It helps to differentiate between instance variables and local variables with the same names within a constructor or method. Step 2: Provide examples. For instance: \`\`\`java public class MyClass {     int variable;     public MyClass(int variable) {         this.variable = variable;     } } \`\`\` In this example, 'this.variable' refers to the instance variable, while 'variable' refers to the local variable passed to the constructor. Question 2: Why use the super keyword in java? Step 1: Understand the keyword. The 'super' keyword in Java is used to reference the parent class's methods or variables, especially in cases of overridden methods or constructors. It allows access to the methods or variables of the immediate parent class. Step 2: Provide examples. For instance: \`\`\`java class Parent {     int number;     Parent(int number) {         this.number = number;     } } class Child extends Parent {     int number;     Child(int number, int childNumber) {         super(number);         this.number = childNumber;     } } \`\`\` In this example, the 'super(number)' in the Child class constructor calls the constructor of the Parent class. Now, let's address if questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Step 3: Compare the keywords. While 'this' refers to the current object of a class, 'super' refers to the parent class's methods or variables. Although both keywords serve to differentiate between variables with the same name, they navigate different relationships in the class hierarchy.  Step 4: Provide conclusion. In conclusion, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is related to the usage of the 'this' keyword for current object references, while Question 2 is concerned with the use of the 'super' keyword for parent class references."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Now I had two sets and couldn't wait to see what else I could afford the next weekend. Spring ended, and by then I had accumulated almost every type of electronic equipment I had always wished to have back home. Then this new idea came to mind. I had heard about a man who traveled back home every few months. He drove a truck filled with boxes of new and used stuff that people were sending to  s. So I told my father that I would send as many types of items as I could so that he could start his resale business. Every few months I would gather several boxes of American \\"junk\\" --- televisions, toasters, fans, hair dryers, etc. and send them home. As word got out about my father's \\"trash\\" market, people all came to buy these things. Three years later, when I visited my family for the first time since leaving home, I learned that many of the families in our neighborhood had a piece of \\"trash\\". It proved that I had the responsibility to keep people back home up to date with the latest technology you no longer need.(304words) Question: The author felt he could not miss the offer because   _  . - the second TV set was bigger - the second TV set was color1 TV - the second TV set was very cheap - he wanted two TV sets very much A:","output":"The author felt he could not miss the offer because the second TV set was very cheap."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: For acute (short-term) ovarian cyst pain, a pain medication may be sufficient to relieve the pain until symptoms resolve. If the pain persists for two to three menstrual cycles, if it is large, doesn't look like a functional cyst, or is growing, you will likely be advised to proceed with surgery to have your ovarian cyst(s) removed.  The vast majority of ovarian cysts are benign.  Either just the cyst can be removed from the ovary, or the entire ovary can be removed. The extent of the surgery will depend upon the number of cysts present on the ovary, as well as the age of the patient and reproductive considerations. (The surgery is generally more extensive following menopause.) Fortunately, if the entire ovary needs to be removed surgically, there is still the ovary on the other side, so the woman does not need to lose her fertility by having a surgical procedure performed. if there is any suspicion that it may be cancerous. Another key factor in deciding whether or not surgery is needed as a treatment for ovarian cyst(s) is assessing the cyst(s) for the possibility that they may one day become cancerous. If there is the risk of them developing into a cancer, your doctor will advise that surgery be performed to prevent this from occurring.  When an ovarian cyst(s) is removed due to the possibility of it becoming cancerous, it is advised to have the fallopian tubes and uterus removed in addition to both ovaries. This, of course, has reproductive implications that need to be discussed with your doctor, because having all of these structures removed will make you infertile. If your ovarian cyst(s) is not yet showing signs of persistent pain and/or a risk for cancer, your doctor will likely advise that you try the approach of \\"watchful waiting.\\" This consists of using pain medications as needed to relieve your ovarian cyst pain, while hoping that the cyst ultimately resolves itself without the need for medical intervention. You must, however, commit to thorough follow-up with serial ultrasounds. This will ensure the cysts don't get worse. If the cysts do not improve with time, surgery may be advised. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article discusses the treatment options for ovarian cyst pain, emphasizing that short-term pain can be managed with medication, but if the pain persists or the cyst has potential to become cancerous, surgery may be necessary.

Review: As a kid, I loved computer animation although it was EXTREMELY limited and the tools were almost nonexistent. This movie, as I sat in awe and watched the amazing images and almost-hypnotic music, shaped the desire in me to create moving things in the computer.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"To address these questions, I will first provide answers to each question individually and then determine if they are asking the same thing. Question 1: Why should the sleeping pulse be recorded in hyperthyroidism? Step 1: Understand the question The question asks about the importance of recording the sleeping pulse in cases of hyperthyroidism. Step 2: Gather relevant information Hyperthyroidism is a condition where the thyroid gland produces excessive thyroid hormone, which can lead to various symptoms, including a rapid or irregular heartbeat. Step 3: Analyze the information The sleeping pulse, or resting heart rate, can serve as an indicator of a person's overall health and fitness. In cases of hyperthyroidism, an elevated resting heart rate can be a sign that the body is producing too much thyroid hormone. Step 4: Respond to the question The sleeping pulse should be recorded in hyperthyroidism because it can help reveal if a person's heart rate is abnormally elevated due to the overproduction of thyroid hormone. Monitoring the resting heart rate can assist in diagnosing and managing the condition. Question 2: Has anyone ever used vita pulse? Step 1: Understand the question The question asks if anyone has ever used a product called \\"Vita Pulse.\\" Step 2: Gather relevant information Vita Pulse is a dietary supplement that claims to support heart health and overall well-being by providing antioxidants and other nutrients. Step 3: Analyze the information As Vita Pulse is a dietary supplement available in the market, it's likely that some people have tried it. Step 4: Respond to the question Yes, people have used Vita Pulse, as it is a dietary supplement available for purchase. Comparison: Now, I'll determine if questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing. Step 1: Identify the subjects of each question - Question 1 pertains to recording sleeping pulse in hyperthyroidism - Question 2 refers to the usage of a dietary supplement called Vita Pulse Step 2: Compare the subjects and purpose of each question - The first question is about the importance of monitoring heart rate in a specific medical condition (hyperthyroidism) - The second question is about the usage of a particular dietary supplement Step 3: Draw a conclusion Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing, as they concern different subjects - one is related to a medical condition (hyperthyroidism) and its monitoring, while the other is about a dietary supplement and its usage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kristhielee Caride filed a 3 million lawsuit Thursday in which she demands the return of her crown and the multiple gifts she won, including a car, plastic surgery and a seven-day cruise. She was stripped of her title nearly a month ago. The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and contractual damages. It was filed against PR Crown Entertainment and officials including Desiree Lowry, national director of Miss Universe Puerto Rico. Lowry's attorney, former Puerto Rico Justice Secretary Antonio Sagardia, told The Associated Press that he declined to meet with Caride's attorneys at their request. \\"There's nothing to talk about,\\" he said. \\"Our decision is final.\\" Caride's attorney, Ernie Caban, did not return a call for comment. Caride was stripped of her title after she was criticized for being dismissive and saying she did not love cameras in an interview with a local newspaper. \\"That's like an athlete saying, 'I don't like to train,'\\" Sagardia said. Lowry told reporters at the time that Caride never apologized and said only that she was having personal issues and that such an incident would not happen again. However, Lowry said Caride then canceled other appearances because of a doctor's appointment she refused to reschedule. The lawsuit says Caride underwent an unspecified surgical intervention in late February and needed to rest for a month. It said she then made a required public appearance and did not wear unspecified, required post-operation accessories on Lowry's orders. The lawsuit also states that a friend of Caride's suffered a hemorrhage during that time and it affected her emotional state. The lawsuit says Caride was briefly hospitalized for depression after she was stripped of her title. Caride said in a Facebook post last month that beauty queens are not exempt from bad days and that she allowed her feelings to come before her job. She apologized and said she was turning over her sash even though she disagreed with the decision.

Further recognition came with the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung at the same time included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work ... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity ... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the picture is to be admired for its colour scheme ... The details of the picture disclose untiring care. By the time Summer Breezes was on display, Fuller had returned to Australia, not to her previous home in Melbourne but to Perth in Western Australia, where she joined her sister, Amy Fuller, who was a singer. Although only in her mid-thirties, Fuller's background made her \\"one of the most experienced artists in Western Australia at this time\\". For the next four years, she painted portraits, including one of Western Australian politician James George Lee Steere, undertaken posthumously from photographs and recollections of those who had known him. It was acquired by the gallery whose board he chaired. She also took on students, including French-Australian artist Kathleen O'Connor. Fuller's paintings from this period included A Golden Hour, described by the National Gallery of Australia as \\"a masterpiece ... giving us a gentle insight into the people, places and times that make up our history\\". The painting, an oil on canvas 109 cm (43 in) high and 135 cm (53 in) wide, portrays a woman and a man standing together in a rural setting in late afternoon, surrounded by grass, scattered gum trees, and Xanthorrhoea.

The earliest records of the Games go back to 776 B.C.. These contests were held every four years. They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics.

One day while she was walking in the woods she found two starving songbirds. She took them home and put them in a small cage, caring them with love. Luckily, the birds grew strong little by little. Every morning they greeted her with a wonderful song. The girl felt great love for the birds. One day the girl left the door to the cage open accidentally. The larger and stronger of the two         birds flew from the cage. The girl was so frightened that he would fly away. So as he flew close, she grasped him wildly. Her heart felt glad at her success in capturing him. Suddenly, she felt the bird go weak, so she opened her hand and stared in horror at the dead bird. It was her desperate love that had killed him. She noticed the other bird moving back and forth on the edge of the cage. She could feel his strong desire--needing to fly into the clear, blue sky. Unwillingly, she lifted him from the cage and threw him softly into the air. The lucky bird circled once, twice, three times. The girl watched delightedly at the bird. Her heart was no longer concerned with her loss. What she wanted to see was that the bird could fly happily. Suddenly the bird flew closer and landed softly on her shoulder. It sang the sweetest tune that she had ever heard. Remember, the fastest way to lose love is to hold on it too tight; the best way to keep love is to give it wings! What can we learn from the passage? A) Catch what you can catch on your way to success. B) Going too far is as bad as not going far enough. C) East or west, home is best. D) A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.

This reflects the idea that while the girl's intentions were good, her overbearing love and desire to hold onto the bird were what ultimately caused its demise. The story further emphasizes that love thrives in freedom, as indicated by the second bird's return, and that true love should not be constricting but should give freedom. So the message is that balance is crucial, either too much or too less can lead to adverse outcomes; and love should be selfless, not binding.

Article: Recently a research was carried out in London,Birmingham and Leeds among teachers from different schools about student behavior management. The majority of teachers said that behavior management is the biggest challenge they face in teaching.They are against the idea of a \\"one size fits all\\" approach to behavior management and believe that how they deal with behavior depends on their analysis of what is driving the behavior.Many teachers make the analysis in three steps.First,observe what the student is doing;then look into what drives the behavior and finally identify what is the real problem to deal with,e.g.attention seeking or being unable to follow the lessons etc..However,many teachers felt it sometimes difficult as schools did not always effectively communicate the necessary information about the students for them to do it. The behaviors are generally divided into low,mid and high level.Teachers felt low and high level behavior was easy to analyze and deal with because low level behavior was seen as the least serious of a problem;and there is clear structure in place for dealing with high level behavior. However,there is no clear structure and effective ways to address midlevel behavior,which may cause a sense of failure in some teachers. Teachers also felt that the laws to protect pupils have resulted in a sense of teachers having fewer rights to manage behavior.In case they deal with or be seen to deal with behavior wrongly or improperly,the results could be very serious:damage the child or teacher,especially their career. Question: What can be inferred from the passage? Options: A: A teacher risks losing the job if he/she manages student behavior improperly. B: Teachers in England are not willing to manage student behaviors. C: English laws forbid teachers punishing their students for their behaviors. D: The laws to protect children in England are going to be changed.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"The time people in Silicon Valley wake up varies as it depends on personal preferences and work schedules. While there isn't an exact uniform time for everyone living in the region, patterns can be observed.  Many tech professionals working in Silicon Valley are known for being early risers. Some famous entrepreneurs like Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple, and Jack Dorsey, the former CEO of Twitter, reportedly wake up around 4 or 5 am. This is partly because many of them adhere to the belief that they can be more productive by starting their day early. However, other individuals in the tech industry might prefer to work late into the night and wake up later in the day. Employee schedules will vary depending on the company's culture, the nature of work, and personal preferences. Coming to the second question, the number of start-ups in Silicon Valley is continually changing given the dynamic nature of the tech sector. As a major global hub for innovation, venture capital, and technology, the region has thousands of start-ups operating within its ecosystem. According to a report published in 2021 by Startup Genome, the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley combined form the number one start-up ecosystem worldwide. It is estimated that there are over 14,000 start-ups in this entire area. However, it is important to note that these numbers fluctuate regularly as new companies emerge, while others are either acquired or shut down. Silicon Valley remains an attractive destination where entrepreneurs from around the world come to build and scale innovative businesses. Regarding the similarity of the two questions, while both address aspects of life in Silicon Valley, the questions have distinct meanings. The first question inquires about the typical waking time of people residing in the region, whereas the second question asks about the number of start-ups operating in Silicon Valley. Both questions provide insights into the lifestyle and professional environment of individuals living and working in this world-renowned technology hub, but the focus of each question is different. The first question deals with daily routines and schedules, while the second question pertains more to the entrepreneurial and business landscape of the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Use a gentle shampoo and conditioner as flat-ironing hair may cause damage to your hair. Shampooing and conditioning will remove unwanted oil and product build-up from your hair.  Look for shampoo and conditioner products that are sulfate-free and jam packed with glycerin. Glycerin helps reduce frizz as it penetrates hair follicles, hydrating hair from the inside out. The closer glycerin is to the front of the ingredients list, the more it contains.  Use a gentle shampoo and a smoothing conditioner. Straightening can be damaging to hair, even if your hair is thick and curly, so gentle products are important. When leaving in the conditioner in the shower, use a paddle brush to comb through your hair. This will help with the smoothening process while in the shower. Co-washing means washing your hair with only conditioner. Hair that's thick or curly is prone to more dryness than average hair. If your hair is very dry and frizzy, you should try co-washing your hair before straightening it. Your hair may benefit from being co-washed a few times a week.  Shampoo can remove a lot of the natural moisture from hair. Using conditioner may reduce your hair's dryness. As straightening your hair can cause it to dry out, co-washing may be very helpful for someone with thick or curly hair. To co-wash your hair, saturate your hair with water. Then, massage in your chosen conditioner. Give your hair three to five minutes to absorb the conditioner and then wash it out. Do not rub! Wet hair is very weak and prone to damage. Blot the hair gently, and lightly wring the ends to soak-up moisture. Dry until it is slightly damp.  Pat the hair downwards to promote straightening. Towel-drying in different directions enhances curls.  Allow your hair to dry 90% of the way before you blow-dry. Concentrated hot air can frizz your hair. If you don't have either, use a small amount of the conditioner or a dime-sized amount of olive oil. These coat your hair to prevent the intense heat from causing split ends.  Don’t overdo it. Too much leave-in conditioner can make your hair limp instead of straight. Wash your hair with only conditioner twice a week to keep from washing away natural hair oils. Use argan oil for thick hair. What is a summary?","output":"A summary of the article would be: To protect and care for your hair when flat-ironing, use gentle, sulfate-free shampoo and smoothing conditioner that contain glycerin to reduce frizz and hydrate hair. Try co-washing (washing with only conditioner) a few times a week, especially if your hair is thick or curly, to retain moisture. After washing, gently towel-dry and allow your hair to dry 90% before blow-drying. Use a small amount of leave-in conditioner or olive oil to prevent heat damage and split ends.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery - They process it with millions of tiny nephrons - Remove all the waste - The kidneys return the blood back to the body through the renal artery - Send the urine with the waste to the bladder through the ureters.  Question: suppose the renal artery is obstructed happens, how will it affect nephrons filter more blood.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: less If the renal artery becomes obstructed, it will negatively affect the nephrons' ability to filter blood. The renal artery is responsible for supplying blood to the kidneys, where the blood undergoes filtration through millions of nephrons. Nephrons are the key functional units of the kidneys and are responsible for the filtration, reabsorption, and secretion processes that remove waste products and excess substances from the blood to maintain the body's electrolyte balance and blood volume. When the renal artery is obstructed, the blood flow to the kidneys is significantly reduced. This reduction in blood flow results in less blood reaching the nephrons for filtration. Consequently, the nephrons will not be able to filter blood as efficiently as they would with a normal, unobstructed renal artery. The ability of the nephrons to maintain a proper balance of electrolytes and blood volume in the body will also be compromised. The reduced filtration rate impairs the kidneys' overall function, potentially causing a buildup of waste products and toxins in the blood, which can be harmful to the body. Additionally, the diminished blood flow may lead to renal ischemia, a condition in which the kidney tissues receive inadequate oxygen supply. This decrease in the nephrons' filtration capacity may manifest in various symptoms and complications, including hypertension (due to the kidneys' inability to remove excess fluids), an increased risk of kidney disease, and a higher susceptibility to kidney failure if the obstruction is not addressed promptly. Therefore, it is vital to identify and treat any renal artery obstructions to ensure that the kidneys and nephrons can continue to efficiently filtrate blood, maintaining overall health and body functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In fact, the premise directly contradicts this hypothesis, as it states that Moors were involved in translation work alongside Jews and Benedictine monks. To further understand why this hypothesis is false, let's dive deeper into the historical context. During the Middle Ages, especially during the period known as the Islamic Golden Age (8th to 14th centuries), there was a great exchange of knowledge between different cultures, religions, and languages. Moorish Spain, also known as Al-Andalus, was an important intellectual center where scholars from various religious backgrounds interacted, shared, and translated works in multiple disciplines such as philosophy, science, and medicine. Moors, who were Muslims of North African and Iberian Peninsula descent, played a crucial role in this exchange of knowledge. They translated many works, particularly from ancient Greek and Arabic to Latin, which was the scholarly language of medieval Europe. This allowed European scholars to access previously unavailable knowledge, ultimately contributing to the European Renaissance. Jewish and Christian scholars, such as Benedictine monks, also contributed significantly to the translation efforts. Jewish scholars, who were proficient in Hebrew, Arabic, and Latin, were particularly indispensable as they acted as intermediaries between the Islamic and Christian worlds. Benedictine monks, committed to the preservation and dissemination of knowledge, often collaborated with Jewish and Moorish scholars, transcribing and translating texts into Latin. One of the well-known instances of such collaboration is the School of Translators in Toledo, Spain. Here, translation teams composed of Jews, Moors, and Christians actively exchanged knowledge and engaged in translating important texts. These teams translated works by notable ancient Greek philosophers and scientists, such as Aristotle and Galen, as well as Arab scholars like Al-Farabi and Ibn Sina. To summarize, the hypothesis \\"Moors never undertook any translation work.\\" is not only false, but it is also directly contradicted by the premise \\"Jews, Moors, and Benedictine monks worked alongside each other in translation teams.\\" Historical evidence shows that Moors actively participated in translation work, collaborating with Jewish and Christian scholars. These collaborative efforts were essential in the intellectual development of Europe and laid the foundation for the European Renaissance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

There are several reasons to support this conclusion. First, the text explicitly states that \\"The City Club of Portland is a nonprofit [...] civic organization.\\" Nonprofit organizations operate primarily to fulfill a mission or purpose, rather than generating profit for owners or stakeholders. Nonprofits can, and often do, generate revenue from various sources, but any surplus funds are typically reinvested in the organization to further its mission, rather than being distributed to owners or shareholders. As a nonprofit, the City Club of Portland is aligned with this model and does not have the primary goal of making a profit. Secondly, the City Club of Portland is described as a \\"nonpartisan civic organization.\\" Nonpartisan organizations are those that do not support or oppose any political party or candidate and strive to facilitate civic engagement, dialogue, and debate while remaining politically neutral. As such, the organization's primary focus is on promoting thoughtful discussion and informed decision-making among its members and the broader community, rather than pursuing profit-driven objectives. Lastly, the paragraph mentions that Julia Meier is the current Executive Director of the City Club of Portland. As the leader of a nonprofit, nonpartisan civic organization, Meier's role would typically involve overseeing the day-to-day operations of the organization, setting its strategic direction, and ensuring that it remains true to its mission and vision. While Meier may be responsible for the financial sustainability and overall success of the organization, that success would be measured in terms of how well the City Club of Portland achieves its intended outcomes (e.g., fostering civic engagement and discussion) rather than profit generation. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is accurate to say that the City Club of Portland, led by Julia Meier, does not seek to make a profit. Instead, its primary purpose is to serve as a nonprofit, nonpartisan civic organization dedicated to promoting informed and unbiased discourse on public issues and policies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: With which superhero does Grayson appear to have a negative history? , can you please find it?   While no cohesive plot is apparent from the vignette style of the trailer, it can be pieced together that Batman has been murdered, and his killer remains at large. Dick Grayson is long since retired from his superhero days and raising a family with to his wife Barbara Gordon. After his former mentor's death, however, he decides to resume his crime-fighting days as Robin. Remarkably, Grayson does not take up the Nightwing identity. The filmmakers said they chose this because many people outside the comic book community are unfamiliar with Nightwing and they wanted to appeal to a wider audience.Commissioner Gordon is aware of Grayson's secret identity and assists him by supplying official documents. In addition, Gordon provides the voiceover narration at the beginning of the trailer. The head of the investigation into Batman's death is indicated to be Chief O'Hara, a character from the 1960's Batman TV series, who apparently also knows Grayson's identity (noting that Grayson's \\"crimefighting days are over\\") His role is suspicious since he strongly wants Grayson to not become involved, even to the point of aligning with Selina Kyle/Catwoman to eliminate Robin and shouting at reporter Clark Kent that he wants \\"him [presumably Grayson] out of the equation!\\" O'Hara is also seen rolling up his sleeves, preparing to assault an angry captive Gordon.  Grayson is aware of Superman's secret identity; he addresses him as \\"Clark\\". Superman apparently is also motivated (obviously from O'Hara) to discourage Grayson's return to crimefighting and three angry confrontations between the characters are shown, in and out of costume. Grayson is also angered to violence by the sight of a Superman comic book, suggesting a strongly negative history between the two. Other comic books also appear of characters from the film, including Wonder Woman and Catwoman. Fiorella used his own comic book collection for this scene. A:","output":"Based on the article, Grayson (Dick Grayson) appears to have a negative history with Superman.

It is now realized that being able to work successfully with other people is one of the main keys to success, partly because we need to do it so often. In almost every situation where you're in a group, you will need a skilled leader. All groups need leaders and all successful groups have good leaders. Groups without leaders or with weak leaders almost always break down. Members of a leaderless group often begin to feel disappointed and helpless. Time is wasted and the tasks are not achieved. There are often arguments and nervousness between people as there is nobody to keep the goals clear. Some people are natural leaders. The well-known cook, Antonio Carlucci says, \\"True leaders are born and you see them in kitchens.\\" They're people who are strong, fair, and humorous. Although a lot of people agree that there are some natural-born leaders, most people now know that leadership can also be taught. Experienced teachers can train almost anyone how to be a successful leader. Good leaders don't make people do things in a controlling way. You can learn how to join others, encouraging the whole group to work towards a common goal. Successful leaders also need to be calm and wise. They need to be able to work out good solutions and make perfect judgments* under pressure.

Question: Where does Melvin Udall work? Title: As Good as It Gets Movie plot: Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is a 60 year old misanthrope who works at home as a best-selling novelist in New York City working on his 62nd book. He suffers from obsessive-compulsive disorder which, paired with his misanthropy, alienates nearly everyone with whom he interacts. He avoids stepping on sidewalk cracks while walking through the city due to a superstition of bad luck, and eats breakfast at the same table in the same restaurant every day using disposable plastic utensils he brings with him due to his pathological fear of germs. He takes an interest in his waitress, Carol Connelly (Helen Hunt), the only server at the restaurant who can tolerate his behavior. One day, Melvin's apartment neighbor, a gay artist named Simon Bishop (Greg Kinnear), is assaulted and nearly killed during a robbery. Melvin is intimidated by Simon's agent, Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), into caring for Simon's dog, Verdell, while Simon is hospitalized. Although he initially does not enjoy caring for the dog, Melvin becomes emotionally attached to it. He simultaneously receives more attention from Carol. When Simon is released from the hospital, Melvin is unable to cope emotionally with returning the dog. Melvin's life is further altered when Carol decides to work closer to her home in Brooklyn so she can care for her acutely asthmatic son Spence (Jesse James).

Dear Theresa, When we met in Glasgow on Monday, I wished you well for the negotiations that lie ahead now that you have formally invoked Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. I want to reiterate those good wishes now. I very much hope that you succeed in realising your ambitions for the terms of the UK's future relationship with the EU. A good deal for the UK is clearly in Scotland's interests whatever constitutional future we choose. It is for that reason that I intend that the Scottish government will play a full and constructive role in securing such an outcome. I expressed my frustration on Monday that the process leading up to the invoking of Article 50 had failed to involve the devolved administrations in any meaningful way - a view that I know is shared by the First Minister of Wales. Far from securing a UK-wide approach ahead of invoking Article 50 - as you committed to do last July - the voices of the devolved administrations were largely ignored and all attempts at compromise rejected, in most cases with no prior consultation. As we move forward into a new phase, we need to agree a more direct role and influence for the devolved administrations, reflecting the key interests that are at stake for all of us. However, whatever outcome is secured, it seems inevitable that it will remove the UK, not just from the EU, but also from the single market. As you are aware, that is not an outcome that the people of Scotland voted for. It is also an outcome that will have significant implications for our economy, society and place in the world. In these very changed circumstances, the people of Scotland must have the right to choose our own future - in short, to exercise our right of self determination. Indeed I noted the importance you attached to the principle of self determination in your letter to President Tusk. As you are aware, the Scottish Parliament has now determined by a clear majority that there should be an independence referendum. The purpose of such a referendum is to give people in Scotland the choice of following the UK out of the EU and single market on the terms you negotiate, or becoming an independent country, able to chart our own course and build a genuine partnership of equals with the other nations of the UK. A copy of the motion passed by Parliament on 28 March 2017 is attached. The decision of the Scottish Parliament has been made in line with the tradition of popular sovereignty in Scotland - that the people of Scotland should be able to determine the form of government most suited to their needs - and with the clear commitment in the manifesto on which my government was re-elected last May. I am therefore writing to begin early discussions between our governments to agree an Order under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998 that would enable a referendum to be legislated for by the Scottish Parliament. I have, of course, noted and carefully considered your public position. However, it seems that we are in agreement on the essential matters. For example we agree that now is not the time for a referendum. You confirmed to me on Monday, and repeated in your letter invoking Article 50, that you intend the terms of both the UK's exit from the EU and of a future trade deal to be agreed before March 2019 and in time for ratification by other member states - in other words, between the autumn of next year and the spring of 2019. As you are aware, this is the timescale endorsed by the Scottish Parliament for a referendum. As I have said previously, if the timetable you have set out changes, we will require to consider the implications for the timing of a referendum. However, it seems reasonable at this stage to work on the basis of your stated timetable. We are also in agreement that - unlike the EU referendum - the choice must be an informed one. That means that both the terms of Brexit and the implications and opportunities of independence must be clear in advance of the referendum. It is also worth noting that the clear precedent of the 2012 Edinburgh Agreement should make reaching agreement on this occasion a relatively straightforward process - addressing any concern you may have that discussions would be time-consuming for your government when they are also preparing for EU negotiations. In light of the above, there appears to be no rational reason for you to stand in the way of the will of the Scottish Parliament and I hope you will not do so. However, in anticipation of your refusal to enter into discussions at this stage, it is important for me to be clear about my position. It is my firm view that the mandate of the Scottish Parliament must be respected and progressed. The question is not if, but how. I hope that will be by constructive discussion between our governments. However, if that is not yet possible, I will set out to the Scottish Parliament the steps I intend to take to ensure that progress is made towards a referendum. Again, I wish you well for all that lies ahead and stand ready to discuss both a section 30 order and the Scottish government's role in securing the best outcome for all parts of the UK. I am copying this letter to the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament and to Bruce Crawford, convener of the Parliament's Finance and Constitution Committee.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Process:  - Bats and other animals produce a high-pitched tone - The sound travels in waves, as sound does - The sound 'bounces' off of a nearby object - The sound wave returns to the bat - The bat hears the echoed sound - Folds in the bat's ear and adaptations in the bat's brain enable it to determine the size, shape, and position of the other object via the properties of the returned sound waves - Other animals use echolocation in generally similar ways -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the bat is sick happens, how will it affect WEAKER echolocation.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If a bat is sick, it can potentially affect its echolocation abilities, especially if the sickness weakens the bat. This can happen through several direct or indirect effects: 1. Reduced energy levels, strength, or stamina: When a bat is sick, its energy levels may decline, leading to weaker echolocation calls. Since high-pitched tones require energy to produce, a weak bat might not be able to generate as loud or clear a sound, which may reduce the effectiveness of its echolocation. 2. Impaired hearing: If the sickness affects the bat's hearing capacity, it might have trouble detecting the returning sound waves or interpreting the information they convey. This would impact the bat's ability to navigate and hunt using echolocation. 3. Neurological effects: A sick bat might have impaired brain function due to fever, inflammation, or infection. These issues can affect the bat's ability to process the returned sound waves and determine the size, shape, and position of objects in its environment. 4. Physical malformations: If the bat's sickness results in changes to its ear shape or other body parts involved in echolocation, like its larynx or mouth, this could lead to weaker or distorted echolocation signals. These altered signals may provide less accurate information to the bat about its surroundings. 5. Distraction or disorientation: A sick bat may be more focused on recovery and addressing its illness than on echolocation. Additionally, if the sickness causes disorientation or imbalance, the bat might find it harder to process and interpret echolocation data, leading to decreased accuracy and effectiveness. Overall, if a bat is sick and experiences weaker echolocation due to perturbations related to its illness, it may struggle to navigate, find food, or avoid obstacles, potentially making it more vulnerable to predation or environmental hazards. The extent to which the perturbation affects echolocation will depend on the severity and nature of the illness."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

How will the increase most likely affect the lake? Answer:","output":"Step 1: Identify the factors contributing to the increase in fish population The sudden increase of fish in the lake could be caused by a variety of reasons, such as the introduction of non-native fish species, increased breeding, reduced predation, or favorable environmental factors. Step 2: Assess the impact on the food chain An increase in fish population will have a significant impact on the food chain within the lake ecosystem. The fish will have more competition for existing food resources, such as plankton and smaller aquatic organisms. This may lead to a decline in the populations of these organisms if the increased fish consumption outpaces their reproduction rate. Step 3: Analyze the effect on water quality An increase in fish population could also affect water quality. Higher fish density may result in more fish waste, which could lead to increased nutrient levels in the water, like ammonia and phosphorus. Excess nutrients can result in eutrophication or harmful algal blooms, which can negatively affect overall water quality and oxygen levels. Step 4: Consider the impact on predator populations Predator populations, such as birds and larger fish, may experience changes in response to the increased fish numbers. Initially, predators may benefit from the increase in prey availability, leading to growth in their populations. However, if the prey population becomes too large and depletes resources, it might affect the predators negatively in the long run. Step 5: Assess the overall impact on the lake ecosystem Taking into consideration the impact on the food chain, water quality, and predator populations, the most likely overall effect of a sudden increase in fish population would be a destabilization of the lake ecosystem. The imbalance in species interactions and the potential decline in water quality could lead to long-term negative consequences for the health of the lake and its inhabitants. In conclusion, the sudden increase in the number of fish in a lake will most likely affect the lake ecosystem through changes in food chain dynamics, water quality, and predator populations, potentially leading to long-term instability and negative impacts on the health of the lake and its inhabitants."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Dunn killed Jordan Davis. That's not in dispute, but according to attorneys' opening statements Thursday in Dunn's murder trial, almost everything else is. Assistant State Attorney John Guy, speaking for the prosecution, painted a picture of four innocent teens who stopped at a Jacksonville, Florida, gas station for gum and cigarettes amid a day of \\"mall hopping and girl shopping\\" over  Thanksgiving break in 2012. Dunn asked the teens to turn down their music, and Jordan disrespected him, saying \\"F*** that n****r\\" -- nothing more -- and for that, Dunn opened fire, hitting Jordan three times. It was a markedly different account from that of defense attorney Cory Strolla, who told jurors that the music was so loud, it was rattling the windows of the teens' SUV, and when Dunn politely asked one of them to turn it down, Jordan uttered the three-word explicit phrase, demanded his pal turn the music back up and began jawing with Dunn. Strolla added that it wasn't Dunn who ordered pizza, but","output":"rather his fiancée, Rhonda Rouer, who called from the hotel room they retreated to after the shooting. According to Rouer's testimony, the couple was in shock and unsure of what to do. They believed they were in danger and acted in self-defense, as they claimed they saw what looked like a weapon in the teens' vehicle. However, no weapon was ever found by the police. Strolla insisted that Dunn only fired his gun because he feared for his life and believed he had to protect not only himself but also his fiancée, who was in the car with him. In the courtroom, emotions ran high as witness accounts and evidence were presented. Both the prosecution and defense tried to build their cases, focusing on the actions and intentions of Michael Dunn on that fateful day. The trial would continue, with each side presenting their interpretation of the events, arguments, and perspectives in an attempt to persuade the jury of the truth. The ultimate decision would rest with those 12 individuals, tasked with determining whether Michael Dunn acted out of malicious intent or in genuine self-defense, and consequently, deciding his fate."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

However,. it was a daunting task for Mr Penfold, who, with his disco tribute act,. normally plays in front of a feeble crowd of around 100 people. He spent two years planning and organising the event and faced the prospect of a huge financial loss if his dream failed. It. costs £12,000 to hire the venue and, on top of this, Mr Penfold and. Hidden Agenda would have to pay for all of the lighting, sound and cost. of publicising the event. This. came to more than £26,000.

I was visiting one of my clients, when, suddenly, out of the bushes, two snarling dogs attacked me. They weren’t necessarily mad, as in crazy, but they were very angry. They were large dogs, and they attacked my legs, knocking me down. I knew it was very dangerous to be down on the ground, as I was most vulnerable. I covered my genitalia, my neck and my face, as I struggled to regain my feet. Fortunately, during my fall, I saw a large tree branch on the ground near me. I grabbed it, and starting beating the dogs with it. I managed to land a few good hits. As I was hitting the dogs, their owner (my client) came outside, stood on her porch and laughed at me. When she saw me hitting her dogs with a stick, she called the dogs off of me. I asked her why her dogs attacked me, and why she laughed at me. She said that she had just given her dogs a big steak bone and they were upset when I came near and attacked me. I asked her why she would set me up in this way when she knew I was on the way over. She admitted that she wanted to see what happened, and she said that when she saw what happened she thought that it was funny. I did not keep the appointment with her.

Answer the following question: Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape  — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations.

Input: Passage: Both Surfer Rosa and Steve Albini's production of the album have been influential on alternative rock, and on grunge in particular. Nirvana's Kurt Cobain cited Surfer Rosa as the basis for Nevermind's songwriting. When he first heard the album, Cobain discovered a template for the mix of heavy noise and pop he was aiming to achieve. He remarked in 1992 that he \\"heard songs off of Surfer Rosa that I'd written but threw out because I was too afraid to play them for anybody.\\" Cobain hired Albini to produce Nirvana's 1993 album In Utero, primarily due to his contribution to Surfer Rosa. The Smashing Pumpkins' Billy Corgan described Surfer Rosa as \\"the one that made me go, 'holy shit'. It was so fresh. It rocked without being lame.\\" Corgan was impressed by the album's drum sound, and acknowledged that The Smashing Pumpkins used to study the record for its technical elements. Musician PJ Harvey said that Surfer Rosa \\"blew my mind,\\" and that she \\"immediately went to track down Steve Albini.\\" Cobain listed Surfer Rosa as number 2 of the top 50 albums he thought were most influential to Nirvana's sound in his journal in 1993.People connected with the band were impressed by the record. Ivo Watts-Russell recalled: \\"I remember when I first heard Surfer Rosa thinking, 'I didn't know the Pixies could sound like The Fall.' That was my immediate reaction, in other words, incredibly raw.\\" Gary Smith, who at the time was in a disagreement with the band, admitted he \\"was really happy that they had made such a forceful, aggressive, record.\\" Dinosaur Jr.'s J Mascis, comparing the record to the later Pixies albums Bossanova and Trompe le Monde, said he thought that Steve Albini's production \\"sounded way better than the other ones.\\"In 1991, as Pixies were recording Trompe le Monde, Albini described his impressions of Pixies during the recording of Surfer Rosa to the fan magazine Forced Exposure: \\"A patchwork pinch loaf from a band who at their top dollar best are blandly entertaining college rock. Their willingness to be 'guided' by their manager, their record company and their producers is unparalleled. Never have I seen four cows more anxious to be led around by their nose rings.\\" Albini later apologized for his remarks, saying, \\"to this day I regret having done it.

The Union Chain Bridge - built in 1820 - crosses the River Tweed from Fishwick in Berwickshire to Horncliffe in Northumberland. It has been on Historic England's Heritage at Risk register since 2013. Investigation work starts on 26 June for up to four weeks meaning it will be shut to vehicles from 3 July on weekdays for a fortnight. When it was officially opened nearly 200 years ago, the structure was the longest wrought iron suspension bridge in the world. However, it has become structurally unsafe and can now only be accessed by one light vehicle at a time. Northumberland County Council (NCC), Scottish Borders Council (SBC) and the Friends of Union Chain Bridge  are working together on the project to safeguard the future of the bridge near Berwick-upon-Tweed. It requires urgent conservation and engineering repairs to secure its future. A funding bid for the restoration is now being prepared for the Heritage Lottery Fund, with a maximum of £5m available towards the bulk of the work. The county council's cabinet will meet next month to consider recommendations to contribute funding over three years towards the scheme, which it is hoped can be completed by 2020 - the 200th anniversary of the bridge's opening. Other stakeholders are also expected to make \\"significant contributions\\". The investigation work hopes to provide a greater understanding of the status and condition of the bridge - allowing a \\"more robust bid\\" to be submitted to the HLF. Diversions will be in place for traffic on weekdays while the bridge will be open to pedestrians and cyclists at all times and to vehicles at weekends. Glen Sanderson, cabinet member for environment and local services at NCC, said: \\"The Union Chain Bridge is of international significance but its condition has been of growing concern for a number of years. \\"Along with our colleagues in Scotland we are committed to safeguarding its future and status, both as a key transport link and as a contributor to the local tourism economy. \\"The site investigation work is vital ahead of any major project starting and engineers will be working to keep disruption to a minimum throughout.\\" His counterpart with SBC, Gordon Edgar, also welcomed the move forward. He said: \\"I am pleased we are seeing progress in the bid to retain the Union Chain Bridge as the world's oldest single span suspension bridge still used by traffic. \\"The iconic crossing has provided a vital link between Scotland and England for almost 200 years, and we want that to remain the case. \\"The short-term closure of the bridge to vehicles will cause some inconvenience but will provide important information for its long-term future.\\" Robbie Hunter, who chairs the Friends of the Union Chain Bridge, said it was pleased with the \\"significant financial support\\" of both councils. He said they would continue to \\"lobby hard\\" for HLF funding. \\"It would be an unforgivable tragedy if we failed to save this engineering icon,\\" he said.

Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Black Sheep Movie plot: A young Henry Oldfield (Nick Fenton) lives on a sheep farm in New Zealand, with his father and older brother, Angus. After witnessing his father's pride on Henry's natural ability at farming, Angus plays a cruel prank on him involving the bloody corpse of his pet sheep, just moments before Mrs. Mac, the farm's housekeeper, comes to tell the boys that their father has been killed in an accident. The combined shock of these two incidents leads Henry to develop a crippling phobia of sheep. Fifteen years later, Henry (Nathan Meister) returns home to sell his share of the family farm to Angus (Peter Feeney). Unknown to Henry, Angus is carrying out secret genetic experiments that transform sheep from docile vegetarians into ferocious carnivores whose bite can transform a human into a bloodthirsty demonic half-sheep monstrosity. While trying to expose Angus's experiments, a pair of environmental activists named Grant (Oliver Driver) and Experience (Danielle Mason) accidentally release a mutant lamb. As Grant and Experience flee from the scientists, the lamb bites Grant and infects him. The lamb then escapes into the fields and infects the flocks of sheep. Meanwhile, Henry and an old friend, Tucker (Tammy Davis), decide to take a drive on the farm. Tucker sees a sheep that refuses to run away. At the same time, Experience steals a rifle from the car to try to shoot them. They eventually team up with each other to investigate a farm house that has smoke pouring out of it. Inside they find the mutilated body of a farmer. Henry sees a sheep in the hallway and, because of his phobia, he quietly shuts the door and locks it. The sheep tries to crash through the door. Tucker shoots the sheep. On the other end of the farm, Angus is driving around when he sees Grant. Grant bites Angus and runs off. Back in the car, Tucker, Experience, and Henry leave to warn Angus about the killer sheep, but a sheep hiding in the car bites Tucker. After the car is destroyed, they seek refuge in the laboratory. Henry and Tucker finally realize... My question: What does Tucker's foot become?

First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of   your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints   due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take action that helps to bring back the heartbeat and breathing.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the names of the three people who are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich?, using the article: As the musical prelude climaxes, Woglinde and Wellgunde are seen at play in the depths of the Rhine. Flosshilde joins them after a gentle reminder of their responsibilities as guardians of the gold. They are observed by the Nibelung dwarf Alberich who calls out to them: \\"I'd like to draw near if you would be kind to me\\". The wary Flosshilde cries: \\"Guard the gold! Father warned us of such a foe\\". When Alberich begins his rough wooing the maidens relax: \\"Now I laugh at my fears, our enemy is in love\\", says Flosshilde, and a cruel teasing game ensues. First, Woglinde pretends to respond to the dwarf's advances but swims away as he tries to embrace her. Then Wellgunde takes over, and Alberich's hopes rise until her sharp retort: \\"Ugh, you hairy hunchbacked clown!\\" Flosshilde pretends to chastise her sisters for their cruelty and feigns her own courtship, by which Alberich is quite taken in until she suddenly tears away to join the others in a mocking song. Tormented with lust, Alberich furiously chases the maidens over the rocks, slipping and sliding as they elude him, before he sinks down in impotent rage. At this point the mood changes: as a sudden brightness penetrates the depths, a magical golden light reveals, for the first time, the Rhinegold on its rock. The maidens sing their ecstatic greeting to the gold, which rouses Alberich's curiosity. In response to his question Woglinde and Wellgunde reveal the gold's secret: measureless power would belong to the one who could forge a ring from it. Flosshilde scolds them for giving this secret away, but her concerns are dismissed—only someone who has forsworn love can obtain the gold, and Alberich is clearly so besotted as to present no danger. But their confidence is misplaced; in his humiliation Alberich decides that world mastery is more desirable than love. As the maidens continue to jeer his antics he scrambles up the rock and, uttering a curse on love, seizes the gold and disappears, leaving the Rhinemaidens to dive after him  bewailing their loss., what would be the answer ?

Using a truck modified as a battering ram, the group break into a security depot in London and steal a large amount of money before the police arrive.

The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Given the background: When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster.

For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ). This is why we store foods in the refrigerator or freezer (like the bread on the right in the Figure below ).

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Alien Abduction: Incident in Lake County Movie plot: The footage, interspersed with \\"expert\\" interviews, begins with the McPherson family gathered for Thanksgiving dinner. The power goes out, so Kurt and Brian go outside to check the fuses; Tommy follows with his camera. After finding the fuses charred and partially melted, they head into the woods to investigate a transformer which is throwing sparks. They find a UFO in a nearby field. As they watch from the treeline, two aliens exit the ship and use a ray-gun on a cow. Despite their attempt to remain hidden, the three men are spotted. One of the aliens raises its weapon and burns Brian's hand. They rush back to the house and try to convince their incredulous family to flee while there is still time. They see lights in the sky and a furtive figure outside a window, but the family refuses to believe the brothers' story until Tommy plays them the tape. Suddenly, a high-frequency screech incapacitates everyone but five-year-old Rose. When it stops, Kurt straps a flashlight to his shotgun and decides to get everyone in his truck and leave. The truck will not start. The battery has melted so they return to the house. As they take stock of the situation they hear scrabbling sounds from the roof and discover that an alien has made its way in through an open window. Kurt leads the way up the stairs and begins to search. Tommy takes the opportunity to go into his bedroom and change his soiled pants when he is ambushed by an alienâit (apparently) puts him in a trance, investigates his camera, and slips away, leaving Tommy with no memory of the encounter. Tommy is awakened by the shouts of Kurt, who has trapped an alien in an adjacent room. They are greeted by a laser shot and Kurt responds with his shotgun. Everyone retreats downstairs. A ball of light floats into the house and puts Renee into a coma. Kurt and Brian go outside to try to swap out the truck battery in a final attempt to get the family to safety and take Renee to a hospital. Seemingly minutes after they leave, gunshots are heard outside and the lights... My question: Why do they race back to the house? Answer:","output":"They race back to the house for several reasons: 1. Safety: After witnessing the alien's abilities and aggressive actions, such as the use of a ray-gun on a cow and burning Brian's hand, the brothers understand the potential danger they and their family are in. Going back to the house provides a familiar environment where they can regroup, gather their family, and plan their next move. They instinctively feel that the house offers better protection than being out in the open with the alien threat looming. 2. Convincing the family: The brothers know that their family is skeptical about their claims of alien encounters. Racing back to the house allows them to show their agitated and fearful state, reinforcing the urgency of the situation. They need to convince their family to flee, and being physically present gives them a better chance to persuade them. 3. Sharing evidence: Tommy has captured the alien encounter on tape, which serves as concrete evidence to back up their story. By racing back to the house, they can play the footage for their incredulous family, removing any doubt about the authenticity of their claims. This would encourage the family to take the threat seriously and act accordingly. 4. Protecting the family: As the situation escalates, the brothers are concerned for the safety of their family members, especially since the aliens are now aware of their presence. By returning to the house, they can be close to their loved ones and try to defend them from any possible harm. 5. Group decision-making: Being together as a family allows for collective discussion and decision-making in the face of the unknown threat. By racing back to the house, the brothers aim to keep everyone informed and involved in determining the best course of action for their survival. In summary, the decision to race back to the house stems from the brothers' instinct to protect their family, share their experience and evidence with them, and to strategize together on their best chance of escaping the alien threat."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What effect will AI have on the job market and other ways of life in the future?","output":"These two questions have some similarities, but they are not the same. While both questions touch upon the topic of job elimination and automation technology, they approach the subject from different angles and ask for different types of information. The first question, \\"What are the jobs Quora has eliminated?\\", is asking specifically about the jobs that have been eliminated by Quora, the question and answer website company. This question is focused on a specific company and its impact on the labor market. To answer this question, one would need to research and discuss any instances where Quora has implemented technology or strategies that led to the elimination of certain positions within the company or any direct consequences its platform has had on people's employment. The scope of this question is limited to Quora alone, and doesn't widely ask about the effect of automation on the job market in general. The second question, \\"We've seen how automation has eliminated jobs in certain markets. What effect will AI have on the job market and other ways of life in the future?\\", is a broader enquiry that explores the larger ramifications of artificial intelligence and automation technology on the overall job market and other aspects of human life. While the question acknowledges that automation has already eliminated jobs in some markets, it seeks insights into future implications that AI may bring, both in terms of employment opportunities and daily life. To address this question, one could discuss several possible effects of AI on job market, which may include: 1. Job displacement: The automation of routine tasks may lead to the reduction or elimination of certain job positions, especially those that require low-skilled labor. This can result in people losing their jobs or needing to acquire new skills to adapt to the changing job market. 2. Job creation: AI may generate new jobs that didn't previously exist, such as AI specialists, data analysts, and robotics engineers. These new roles will require expertise in AI technology and its various applications, which could boost job opportunities for skilled individuals. 3. Changing nature of work: As artificial intelligence continues to develop, it may facilitate a transformation in the nature of work itself. Jobs may become more focused on creativity, emotional intelligence, and critical thinking skills, which are not easily replicated by AI. 4. Societal impact: Adoption of AI could lead to improved efficiency and productivity in various industries, potentially leading to economic growth and improved standard of living. However, it may also exacerbate income inequality, as the benefits of AI technology might not be equally distributed among the population. In conclusion, while the two questions revolve around the theme of job elimination and automation technology, they approach it from different perspectives. The first relates to the specific impact of Quora on job elimination, while the second delves into the broader implications of AI on the job market and other aspects of life in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  There is a rain cloud in the sky - Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other - The collisions create electrical charge - Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud - Heavier, negatively charges particles rise to the top Answer:","output":"The final step of the process described above is the creation and discharge of lightning due to the separation of charges within a storm cloud.  Here is a more detailed and long explanation of the process leading up to lightning formation: 1. There is a rain cloud in the sky: Storm clouds, also known as cumulonimbus clouds, form when warm, moist air rises and cools, causing water vapor in the air to condense into visible water droplets or ice particles. 2. Small bits of ice within the cloud bump each other: As the cloud continues to grow taller, ice particles within the cloud collide with each other due to turbulent air currents.  3. The collisions create electrical charge: When ice particles collide in the cloud, a charge separation occurs. The lighter, positively charged particles transfer protons (positive charge) to the heavier, negatively charged particles during these collisions. 4. Lighter, positively charged particles sink to the bottom of the cloud: The positively charged particles, sometimes called \\"graupel,\\" are lighter and get carried to the lower parts of the cloud by updrafts. 5. Heavier, negatively charged particles rise to the top: The larger, negatively charged ice crystals and particles are heavier and tend to be concentrated towards the upper part of the cloud. Now we arrive at the final step of the process: 6. Formation and discharge of lightning: The separation of charges within the cloud creates a strong electric field. The positive charges at the bottom of the cloud induce negative charges on the ground beneath it. When the electric field becomes strong enough, it overcomes the insulating properties of the air, causing a rapid discharge of electricity known as lightning. Lightning can occur within the cloud, between two different clouds, or between the cloud and the ground. It seeks to equalize the charge difference between the cloud and the ground or between separate clouds. The sudden release of electrical energy produces a bright flash of light and generates a tremendous amount of heat, causing the surrounding air to expand explosively.

Pervez Musharraf misses court date for treason trial Pakistan's former military ruler Pervez Musharraf failed to appear at a treason trial his lawyers have described as biased and illegitimate, after explosives were found near his house on the outskirts of Islamabad. Musharraf had been asked to attend the hearing on Wednesday at the grand national library building in the heart of the capital, where if he is found guilty of treason could see the 70-year-old former general sentenced to death. But his lawyers said he was unable to attend after police found an explosive device along the route Musharraf would have taken to the historic hearing – the first time a former chief of Pakistan's powerful army has ever been put on trial. It was the third time that small bombs have been found near the luxurious residence of the former general, who the Pakistani Taliban have repeatedly vowed to kill. Musharraf failed to turn up to the first hearing of three-judge special court on 24 December when a bomb and weapons were discovered along the road.

The whole thing is just completely managed so they can play delaying tactics and avoid coming to the court,\\" he said during a break during proceedings at a complex in the country's administrative centre. \\"The brave soldier is afraid of three unarmed judges.\\" Police and commandos surrounded the national library, where the case is being heard in a chilly auditorium. Despite major security precautions the police told judge Faisal Arab they could only provide protection \\"within the available resources\\", which did not include a bombproof vehicle to convey the former president. The defence team warned that the entire building was at risk of being bombed. Anwar Mansoor Khan, a lead defence lawyer, told the court that his car was rammed shortly after the last hearing by an unidentified four-wheel drive vehicle. But the judge appeared unimpressed by the arguments over security fears, noting that courts continue to operate during times of war. And he indicated that he could order the arrest of Musharraf, forcing him to attend the court under armed guard. He said he had not yet taken that step to avoid any embarrassment to a former president and army chief. Musharraf's lawyers argued the case against their client flouted the constitution, was being heard by judges who could not be considered neutral and had been triggered by prime minister Nawaz Sharif's quest for \\"vengeance\\". Although Musharraf toppled Sharif from power in 1999 when he seized power in a coup d'état, the treason trial only relates to his activities in late 2007 when he introduced a period of emergency rule and suspended senior judges. The case is the most serious of the legal difficulties that have beset the former general since his return to Pakistan last March, when he was put under house arrest for various cases, including his alleged involvement in the death of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. He has since been bailed on all the private prosecutions, which most legal experts say he can expect to win. However, the government-initiated treason trial is considered to be a far trickier legal battle. Musharraf has claimed he still has significant support from the army, and many analysts still believe a way will be found to spare his life and send him back into exile abroad. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's former military ruler, failed to appear at his treason trial after explosives were discovered near his house on the outskirts of Islamabad. Musharraf had been asked to attend the hearing, where, if found guilty of treason, he could face a death sentence. This marks the first time a former chief of Pakistan's powerful army has ever been put on trial. The legal case presents the most serious challenge for the former general since his return to Pakistan and some speculate that the trial may result in Musharraf being sent back into exile abroad."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Teacher Isabelle Graham pictured hand-in-hand with her husband Andrew Wilkie days after being struck off for romping with teen pupil at school prom DISGRACED former teacher Isabelle Graham has been pictured walking hand in hand with her husband – just days after being struck off for bedding a 17-year-old lad in a hotel on his prom night. Graham – who was engaged at the time of the incident — denied the allegations and partner Andrew stood by her. But the General Teaching Council for Scotland barred her from the job following a probe. Their panel found she had “repeatedly engaged in sexual activity” with the boy after giving him booze and sharing a bed with him. Graham — mum to a baby boy — had argued that her drink had been spiked and she couldn’t remember what had happened. She described herself as a “victim”, and referring to the photo said: “The person in the bed is clearly not in control of the situation.” Pictures of the couple have now emerged showing them putting on a united front and holding hands as they emerged from their Hampshire home. The disgraced former Miss has since started a new life — helping to spread religion among squaddies. She resigned from her job as a French teacher at Whitburn Academy, West Lothian, after the shocking allegations emerged and has since set up home down south in Aldershot, Hants. And the devout Christian — who gave birth to her first child last week — now goes by her middle and married names Shona Wilkie. Shamed Graham and her husband, both 28, are working together for the Soldiers’ and Airmen’s Scripture Readers Association (SASRA), based near military barracks. She is in the ‘donor relations’ department of the organisation — which describes itself as introducing squaddies to Jesus — while Andrew is a support officer. Last night a source said: “Maybe this is her way of repenting for her guilt. “SASRA brings Jesus to squaddies and she’s part of the head office staff. “She’s using her middle and married name to get away from her past but a few folk know. “She’s very recently had a baby too so she must be all over the place.” Graham romped with the teenager at a Travelodge in Edinburgh following his prom at the city’s Carlton Highland hotel. A probe was launched after a photograph emerged on social media showing the lad holding what appears to be a bottle of bubbly at the door of a hotel room while a blonde woman sleeps in the bed. The image was captioned by one student with the words: “Poor show from Miss Graham. “I had higher respect for my teacher than this! Disgusting.” A lawyer for the General Teaching Council for Scotland dismissed her drink spiking claim as “speculation”. She was judged unfit to teach and barred from the profession. Carla Roth, presenting the case for the GTCS, told the panel there was a “public nature” to Graham’s actions on the night in June 2014 since they happened around pupils and the photo was shared on social media. She said the incident had left pupils “uncomfortable” and “somewhat shocked” and added: “You would have to question what sort of role model was provided in this instance.” Turning to the teacher’s claim that her drink had been spiked, Ms Roth described it as “essentially no more than a speculation”. She added: “We simply have no evidence of exactly why she may have had a memory loss.” Mrs Roth said Graham was “only willing to consider one version of events”, that her drink had been spiked, rather than that she had drunk too much. The lawyer added: “She cannot be said to have shown any insight into her conduct.” A police investigation was also launched after the photo emerged but the case was not brought to court because of a lack of evidence. Detective Sergeant Keith Mailer, who was part of the probe, described CCTV which showed Graham and the student kissing. He said: “Throughout the footage there’s no sign that Mrs Graham is under the excessive influence of drugs or alcohol.” He added: “The way she moved and conducted herself suggested someone who was making conscious decisions.” The SASRA is a highly respected organisation which has the Queen as its patron and former Army chief General Lord Dannatt as president. Its website says: “Our mission is one of personal evangelism. “Uniquely we are permitted, subject to Chaplain’s permission and Commanding Officers’ permission, to visit soldiers and airmen in their accommodation work and recreation areas. “This is done with a view to befriending them and introducing them to the Lord Jesus Christ.” A West Lothian Council spokesperson said: “Ms Graham is no longer employed by West Lothian Council and it would not be appropriate to comment further.” SHAMED Isabelle is the latest professional to throw away her career by bedding a pupil. Aberdeen-born maths teacher Jeremy Forrest, 30, was jailed for 5½years in 2013 after fleeing to France with his 15-year-old schoolgirl lover. Eppie Sprung Dawson, 27, who taught English at St Joseph’s College, Dumfries, romped with pupil Matthew Robinson, 17, losing her marriage and career. And mum-of-three Bernadette Smith, 36, a history teacher at Stirling’s Bannockburn High, was struck off for stripping down to her bra and jeans and kissing a boy of 16 on his bed. Educational psychologist Dr Jack Boyle tells ANNA GAULT why teachers and pupils move their relationship out of the class and into bedroom. BOOZE and spur-of-the-moment recklessness can see a teacher risk everything to romp with a pupil, according to Dr Boyle. He said: “The vast majority of teachers are not the slightest bit interested in their pupils sexually. “In this day and age, the risks and penalties for acting on this are enormous — particularly for a teacher as people expect more and they are held to a high standard. “It’s very rare and there is no common thread to a relationship forming. “But sometimes alcohol is involved and of course alcohol will lower inhibitions — it devastatingly impairs judgments. “There is a high degree of impulsivity and recklessness on the part of the teacher. The consequences will ruin their life but because they are often acting on impulse they don’t think that far ahead. “By and large a teacher will indulge in this behaviour because they think they will get away with it.” PUPILS risk ridicule for getting in- olved with a teacher, Dr Boyle said. He went on: “Typically a 17-year-old boy would regard a 27-year-old woman as an older lady and would not be attracted to her. “Children are very conscious of age differences — for instance, a 14-year-old would not play with a 12-year-old. A boy getting involved with an older teacher would be mocked by his friends but, again, alcohol can be a factor. “Adolescent girls can often have a crush on one of their teachers but only a very small number moves into intimacy — and, of course, the teacher has to welcome it.” Dr Boyle said social media opened up more opportunities for teachers and their pupils to chat outside the classroom. He added: “A pupil is taking a risk to have a relationship with a teacher and immaturity is a factor. But they are young and won’t be thinking at an age appropriate level or of how it will affect their future.” We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

To do this, we add the coefficients of both r terms. (-54*r) + (43*r) = -54r + 43r = -11r Now, our equation is: 0 = -11r + 33 Step 2: Isolate the r term Next, we want to isolate r by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. We can do this by subtracting 33 from both sides of the equation. 0 - 33 = -11r + 33 - 33 This simplifies to: -33 = -11r Step 3: Solve for r Now, we want to solve for r by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of r, which is -11. -33 / -11 = (-11r) / -11 This simplifies to: 3 = r So, the solution to the equation 0 = -54*r + 43*r + 33 is r = 3."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Infection by human T-lymphotropic virus can lead to tropical spastic paraparesis and adult T-cell leukaemia. Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of cancers of cervix, skin, anus, and penis. Within the Herpesviridae, Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus causes Kaposi's sarcoma and body-cavity lymphoma, and Epstein–Barr virus causes Burkitt's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Merkel cell polyomavirus closely related to SV40 and mouse polyomaviruses that have been used as animal models for cancer viruses for over 50 years.  Paragraph: The Jones family had a history of chronic viral infections. Jenny got human papillomavirus, while her brother Josh got infected with the Epstein–Barr virus. They were both under treatment.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sibling had a higher risk of developing skin cancer? Answer:","output":"Jenny, who got infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), had a higher risk of developing skin cancer compared to her brother Josh, who got infected with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Human papillomaviruses are an established cause of various cancers, including skin cancer. HPV can cause cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma, one of the most common skin cancer types. In addition, HPV is known to cause cancers of the cervix, anus, and penis, highlighting its significant role in carcinogenesis. On the other hand, Josh got infected with the Epstein-Barr virus, which is primarily associated with lymphomas (such as Burkitt's lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma), B lymphoproliferative disorder, and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. While EBV has a significant role in the development of these cancers, it is not a primary cause of skin cancer. As a result, based on the viral infections the siblings acquired, Jenny had a higher risk of developing skin cancer than her brother Josh. However, it's essential to note that risk factors are multifaceted and can be influenced by various genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. The presence of these infections may increase the risk of cancer, but an individual's unique circumstances will ultimately determine their overall risk level."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: It’s always interesting to read back on why people do things, especially people who end up making a career or a fortune out of the seemingly benign choices they make. Thelma Schoonmaker, the film editor whom my previous post was about was one of those people; she got into editing after seeing an ad in the New York Times. I’m in no way suggesting I’m going to make a fortune, nor that I’m a Thelma Schoonmaker in the making, but I certainly do make a lot of benign choices. Art blogging, for me, was one of those benign choices. I made the decision to start an art blog very randomly, so randomly I’m not even sure where the idea came from. At the time I had been studying a bachelor of psychology for about two years and found myself interested in the subject, but underwhelmed with the lack of creative ideas and media I was being exposed to. I’d always been interested in art and most creative mediums, often recording music or taking photographs on the side. But the pages and pages of white and black scientific journal articles must have got to me, because I found myself yearning for splashes of colour, moving imagery, challenging concepts and undefinable ideas. The next thing I knew I had started an art blog aptly titled: Artistic Expansion and I began spending hours a day searching through the internet for content, often finding my best pieces in the most random places, often not even defined intentionally as ‘art’. Over the last two years I must have blogged hundreds of multi-coloured, multi-textured and multi-layered images, accumulated over 2000 followers and consumed more art than I ever had in my entire life. I find it interesting not because of it’s success, but because before I started my art blog, I really had no idea how much I did or could love art and once I had made my art blog I  couldn’t imagine how I ever functioned without it. How long has the author been writing an art blog?  A. less than a year  B. more than two years  C. not enough information  D. between  one and two years Answer:","output":"B. more than two years"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you live near a water park, you might think about getting a season pass. This way you can go as often as you like. Check to see if there are any water parks around you. Many are indoor facilities. So even if it isn't warm enough where you live to swim outdoors, you can enjoy swimming in a temperature controlled area. The prices are usually good. For example, one ticket to Water World, a water park, is only 5. Some teens like to get a part time job over the summer to make some pocket money. Older teens shouldn't have much trouble finding jobs. An idea is to get some teens together to form your own summer job business. You can walk dogs, bring in the newspapers, feed the cats, collect rubbish, water flowers, etc. Being that it's summer, many people go on vacation and could use someone to look after their houses while they're away. You can also think about other jobs you can do for them. Teens love freedom. Sure you would like to get to such places as the small, movie theaters, the zoo, the beach, picnic, bowling and local amusement park instead of staying home all summer. Then a summer bus pass will be helpful. Check to see if your area has one for you teens. Such a pass costs only 10 for the whole summer. The price is reasonable  and also your parents don't have to always drive. Question: Who is the text written for?

In baseball, to tag up is for a baserunner to retouch or remain on their starting base (the time-of-pitch base) until (after) the ball either lands in fair territory or is first touched by a fielder. By rule, baserunners must tag up when a fly ball is caught in flight by a fielder. After a legal tag up, runners are free to attempt to advance, even if the ball was caught in foul territory. On long fly ball outs, runners can often gain a base; when a runner scores by these means, this is called a sacrifice fly. On short fly balls, runners seldom attempt to advance after tagging up, due to the high risk of being thrown out. can you tag up on an infield fly?","output":"In an infield fly situation, the infield fly rule is applied. The infield fly rule states that if there are less than two outs, and there are runners on first and second base (or bases loaded), and the batter hits a fly ball that can be caught by an infielder with ordinary effort, the batter is automatically out (regardless of whether the ball is caught or not). This rule is in place to prevent easy double or triple plays. As for tagging up in an infield fly situation, here is a step-by-step analysis: 1. Infield fly rule is called: When the umpire calls an infield fly, the batter is automatically out. At this point, the runners on base should be aware of the situation. 2. The ball is in play: Even though the batter is out, the ball is still considered in play until it is touched by a fielder or lands on the ground. 3. Runners can tag up: Since the ball is in play, the baserunners can tag up just as they would in any other fly ball situation. Once the ball is touched by a fielder or lands on the ground, they must retouch or remain on their starting base. 4. Advancing is risky: Although runners can technically tag up on an infield fly, it is usually not a good idea to try to advance. Infield fly balls are typically easy for fielders to catch, and the baserunners would be susceptible to being thrown out if they attempt to advance. In conclusion, while baserunners can tag up on an infield fly, it is generally not recommended due to the high risk of being thrown out at the next base. Instead, baserunners should focus on safely returning to their original base after tagging up."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

This definition involves intentionality with the committing of the act itself, irrespective of the outcome it produces. However, generally, anything that is excited in an injurious or damaging way may be described as violent even if not meant to be violence (by a person and against a person). Globally, violence resulted in the deaths of an estimated 1.28 million people in 2013 up from 1.13 million in 1990. Of the deaths in 2013, roughly 842,000 were attributed to self-harm (suicide), 405,000 to interpersonal violence, and 31,000 to collective violence (war) and legal intervention. In Africa, out of every 100,000 people, each year an estimated 60.9 die a violent death. Corlin, past president of the American Medical Association said: \\"The United States leads the worldin the rate at which its children die from firearms.\\" He concluded: \\"Gun violence is a threat to the public health of our country.\\" For each single death due to violence, there are dozens of hospitalizations, hundreds of emergency department visits, and thousands of doctors' appointments. Furthermore, violence often has lifelong consequences for physical and mental health and social functioning and can slow economic and social development. In 2013, assault by firearm was the leading cause of death due to interpersonal violence, with 180,000 such deaths estimated to have occurred. The same year, assault by sharp object resulted in roughly 114,000 deaths, with a remaining 110,000 deaths from personal violence being attributed to other causes.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who had his appendix removed in April 1927? ?  After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...

But it is unlikely any past president would envy the legal challenges facing Trump, from the Russia investigation to Stormy Daniels to the scrutiny law enforcement is giving his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen. On Tuesday it was a night of pomp and glamor at the White House as President Donald Trump and Mrs. Trump welcomed French President Macron and his wife for a state dinner. The two presidents got along famously during their White House meetings. The only damper on the day came when both men were in the Oval Office and a reporter asked Trump about the legal difficulties facing his longtime personal attorney, Michael Cohen. \\"Mr. President, what about Michael Cohen? Are you considering a pardon for Michael Cohen?\\" asked ABC correspondent Jonathan Karl. After a pause, the president responded. \\"Stupid question,\\" he said dismissively. Cohen is under scrutiny for a payment to an adult film star. Stormy Daniels says it was hush money to keep her quiet about a brief affair she had with Trump in 2006, a claim the president has denied.

Born Florence Annie Bridgwood in Hamilton, Ontario, she was youngest of three children of George Bridgwood, an English-born carriage builder and Charlotte \\"Lotta\\" Bridgwood (nee Dunn), a vaudeville actress. Charlotte Bridgwood had emigrated to Canada from Ireland after the Great Famine with her family as a child. She was known professionally as Lotta Lawrence and was the leading lady and director of the Lawrence Dramatic Company. At the age of three, Lawrence made her debut onstage with her mother in a song and dance routine. Also at Vitagraph was a young actor, Harry Solter, who was looking for \\"a young, beautiful equestrian girl\\" to star in a film to be produced by the Biograph Studios under the direction of D.W. Griffith. Griffith, the most prominent producer-director at Biograph Studios, had noticed the beautiful blonde-haired woman in one of Vitagraph's films. Because the film's actors received no mention, Griffith had to make discreet inquiries to learn she was Florence Lawrence and to arrange a meeting. Griffith had intended to give the part to Biograph's leading lady, Florence Turner, but Lawrence managed to convince Solter and Griffith that she was the best suited for the starring role in The Girl and the Outlaw. With the Vitagraph Company, she had been earning 20 a week, working also as a costume seamstress over and above acting. Griffith offered her a job, acting only, for 25 a week.  After her success in this role, she appeared as a society belle in Betrayed by a Handprint and as an Indian in The Red Girl. In total, she had parts in most of the 60 films directed by Griffith in 1908. Toward the end of 1908 Lawrence married Harry Solter. Lawrence gained much popularity, but because her name was never publicized, fans began writing the studio asking for it. Even after she had gained wide recognition, particularly after starring in the highly successful Resurrection, Biograph Studios refused to publicly announce her name and fans simply called her \\"The Biograph Girl\\". During cinema's formative years, silent screen actors were not named, because studio owners feared that fame might lead to demands for higher wages. She continued to work for Biograph in 1909. Her demand to be paid by the week rather than daily was met, and she received double the normal rate.  She achieved great popularity in the \\"Jones\\" series, filmdom's first comedy series, in which she played Mrs. Jones in around a dozen films. More popular still were the dramatic love stories in which she co-starred with John R. Cumpson, as Mr. Jones, and Arthur Johnson. The two played husband and wife in The Ingrate, and the adulterous lovers in Resurrection. Lawrence and Solter began to look elsewhere for work, writing to the Essanay Company to offer their services as leading lady and director. Rather than accepting this offer, however, Essanay reported the offer to Biograph's head office, and they were promptly fired. Is there anything else I should know about Florence Lawrence during this time?","output":"During this time, Florence Lawrence and her husband, Harry Solter, decided to join Carl Laemmle's Independent Moving Pictures Company of America (IMP) in 1910. Laemmle, the founder of the future Universal Studios, was determined to challenge the monopoly of the Motion Picture Patents Company, which had previously controlled the film industry.  Laemmle recognized the potential in Florence Lawrence and devised a clever publicity stunt to promote her, making her the first publicly named movie star. He spread a rumor that \\"The Biograph Girl\\" had been killed in a streetcar accident, and after a few days, he took out an advertisement in various newspapers revealing that she was alive and well, and that she would soon appear in IMP films. As a result, Florence Lawrence became widely known and very popular, enjoying significant stardom in the early days of Hollywood. She starred in more than 50 films for IMP throughout 1910, including director Harry Solter's debut film, Love's Sweet Quarrel.  Unfortunately, her fame was short-lived as she suffered a series of personal and career setbacks, ultimately losing her star status by the late 1910s.

Glenn O'Neill (Dad, Donor and President of Cure Sanfilippo Foundation) curesff@gmail.com (anytime)      ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------            Our Story            It all started back in 2014, with this 3 minute video:            Now, we truly believe we are witnessing a miracle. What else can explain more than 36,000 people already donating more than 2 million dollars, over the past 2 years, to fund a chance at life for our daughter Eliza and other children. Diagnosed 3 years ago with Sanfilippo Syndrome —a terminal disease sometimes called “Childhood Alzheimer's”— Eliza has now become the first child in the world to have been given this new treatment! The second child has also been treated and in the coming months & through next year, a few handful more children around the world will be part of this groundbreaking gene therapy clinical trial that is already showing promising results.            The WORLD decided to rally around our little girl for this greater cause, and she’s become the face of this disease…a symbol for Sanfilippo parents everywhere not to give up HOPE.            And we’re not giving up on them either.            Many more children are still fighting, and we won’t stop until every last one of them is afforded a chance at life. There are more children that need this treatment than there are available spots in clinical trials, and these precious little ones can’t wait. Given the rapidly degenerative nature of Sanfilippo Syndrome, not receiving a treatment, and soon, is a death sentence. Can you imagine being one of these parents?            Since treatment, we see a new light in Eliza’s eyes— she is connecting with us in a way we thought was gone forever. She is working to regain the skills the disease stripped away in the 6 and half years it tore through her body. She is a fighter! Other Sanfilippo children deserve this chance too. At this stage, funding is one of the only things that will accelerate research to give these children a chance. Money doesn’t make the world go round, but it does bring medical treatments faster to children who are dying.            Our goal is to reach 4M here to help make this happen. Please donate TODAY to give these beautiful Sanfilippo children a rightful chance at life. Please share so the world can hear their collective voices.            Our hearts are forever thankful for giving our daughter Eliza and others a chance at life. We are reminded of one quote from a special supporter that has helped us through the hard days: “Keep the faith, and the faith will keep you”. We believe!

Sign up for our newsletter and other special offers: sign me up Thank you for signing up!      While Americans debate whether a handful of Ebola cases here should lead to stricter quarantine rules , a family in Columbia, South Carolina, have been living in self-imposed quarantine for nearly five months – all to protect their daughter.Eliza O'Neill, 4, suffers from a rare, ultimately fatal genetic disorder called Sanfilippo syndrome , type A.Since she was diagnosed in 2013, the usually energetic and fearless Eliza has been slowly losing her ability to speak. Over time, doctors tell her family, she will lose the ability to walk, eat and ultimately breathe.Her parents, Glenn, 42, and Cara, 39, are racing to raise 2.5 million they need for a clinical trial that is their only chance to find a possible treatment to save Eliza and help other children who suffer from the disorder.As tough as that mission has been with their end-of-the-year deadline soon approaching , they have made another tough decision: To self-quarantine their family of four so as not to expose Eliza to potential illnesses in her vulnerable state.\\"For Eliza to be a great candidate for the trial we don't want her to come down with any sickness or virus at all,\\" Glenn tells PEOPLE. \\"We have heard stories from families of older kids with Sanfilippo where a sickness at this stage started the downward slide even faster and they never fully recovered.\\"The O'Neills believe that the only way to ensure she doesn't catch anything is for the entire family to avoid contact with the outside world.\\"It's beyond hard, but this is what you do for someone you love,\\" says Glenn, a consultant at Symantec ; the company has allowed him to work from home.Cara had to quit her job as a pediatrician and the couple now try to homeschool Eliza and her big brother, Beckham, 7. They get their groceries delivered to the front door and clean every door handle, countertop and package with antibacterial wipes.They haven't had friends or family over for five months. They are now 150 days into their self-imposed isolation and plan to continue it until the clinical trial's hoped-for start date early next year.\\"Sometimes we drive around in the car, and now I consciously avoid the roads that take us by playgrounds, parks and schools with kids playing outside. It's not just hard for her, it's also torture for me knowing she wants to be out there,\\" Cara writes in a blog post about their experience If they have to stop for gas, only Cara and Glenn will get out of the car.\\"We wear masks and gloves and we don't go inside any stores,\\" says Glenn. \\"I know we look crazy, but we are just trying to save our daughter's life.\\"They don't have the diversion of television because her parents believe Eliza communicates better without it around.\\"With our decision to not go out, we are in essence, taking experiences away from her. We're doing all of this in hopes that we will actually be giving her the best chance at a full future, but it is still very hard to reconcile in our minds,\\" Cara writes. \\"Our lives have become completely 'virtual.' \\"Eliza and Beckham won't see friends on their birthdays that are coming up, they won't trick-or-treat on Halloween, and there will be no visit to Santa at the mall this Christmas.As young as he is, Cara and Glenn have explained the restrictions to Beckham – and he seems to understand. \\"It's not worth it to go out where people are,\\" he writes on the blog. \\"I wouldn't take the risk.\\"At times, Glenn says, the family goes a bit stir crazy being stuck inside. But they never forget why they are doing this.\\"The first few weeks were very hard, but it has become the new normal,\\" Glenn writes. \\"[One hundred and fifty days] is a long time, but we will go to any lengths. We'll do this as long as it takes.\\" ||||| Sanfilippo syndrome is an inherited condition, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an autosomal recessive trait.      Sanfilippo syndrome occurs when the substances (enzymes) needed to break down the heparan sulfate sugar chain are missing or defective.      There are 4 main types of Sanfilippo syndrome, also called MPS III. The type a person has depends on which enzyme is affected. ||||| Courtesy Glenn O’Neill The O’Neill family in Colombia, S.C., have placed themselves on self-quarantine for the past 160 days to protect sickly little girl Eliza.      A South Carolina family has lived the past 160 days under self-quarantine and would know better than anyone the challenges facing Ebola medical workers under mandated quarantines.      But Glenn O'Neill told the Daily News his family's situation was much different than the health care professionals returning home from West Africa, because the O'Neills can decide to leave their house whenever they want.      Instead, they choose to stay away from other people as a precaution to protect the health of Glenn's 4-year-old daughter, Eliza, who has Sanfilippo syndrome.      Children with the extremely rare disease typically start developing deficiencies in muscle growth, speech and brain functions by age 5. Many of the victims are confined to a wheelchair as the disease starts to spread.      Mandated Quarantines      States including New York, New Jersey and Illinois established policies madating that workers who treated Ebola patients in West Africa must put themselves on 21-day quarantines.      People placed under the mandates have resisted the protocols and medical experts have decried the regulations as unnecessary — though politicians say they're in the public's best interest.

She remained under supervision, despite testing negative for the disease, until Monday night, when she was allowed to serve her 21-day quarantine at her home in Maine.      The O'Neills say their situation is less intense than a government-issued quarantine. They do leave their house once every other week, but only to places they are sure there will not be any other people, such as a deserted beach or an open field.      And the only time Glenn O'Neill has gone somewhere with people, he might have gotten arrested.      He needed to go to a bank to sign a form for the family's Saving Eliza Foundation. The 42-year-old was as cautious as he could be, informing the bank members ahead of time he that would walk in, sign the papers and leave without touching anything.      As he pulled into the parking lot, he started to put on his protective mask and gloves — and scared a fellow motorist who spotted him.      People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter how can you use that word?      \\"He pulled back real slowly and had a look on his face like, 'what the heck?'\\" O'Neill said. \\"He thought I was going to rob the place. I called the bank and said 'I'm coming in with gloves and a mask. Just making sure there won't be any trouble.'\\"      Making the Decision      In May the children, Eliza and her brother, Beckham, 7, were pulled out of school and Glenn's wife, Cara, left her job as a pediatrician for special needs children. Glenn now works from home as a purchasing consultant.      \\"People say we're being overprotective, but when it comes to protecting your daughter, how can you use that word?\\" he said.      Eliza, who turns 5 next month, is at a crucial stage at which simple colds and illnesses could accelerate her deterioration.      The measure has worked. Eliza has not gotten sick and is doing as well as could reasonably be expected for the time being, Glenn said.      Steven J.

Previous Next      Enlarge      The family is raising money to fund a clinical trial that will hopefully cure the disease. The plan is to continue the quarantine until the procedure is available, possibly by early next year, Glenn said.      Family's Adjustment      The family does not have a TV and spendsa limited amount of time on the computer because Eliza's condition lends to more addictive characteristics. If she is in front of a screen it will affect her speaking ability.      Cara said they appreciated the time they could spend with their kids.      \\"You don't have that rush of a typical life where you say we have to stop reading right now because we have something to do,\\" she said. \\"We're OK. We do what we can do. Sometimes we get overwhelmed, but it's just life. We have bad moments and good ones.\\"      The family doesn't get visitors, but they will Skype their relatives and Eliza's speech therapist.      Glenn jokes the house has felt smaller over time.      \\"My wife says after this we're going to get a bigger house,\\" he said. \\"I said, 'Sounds good to me.'\\"      jlandau@nydailynews.com Follow on Twitter @joelzlandau ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A new campaign aims to continue supporting the fight for children with Sanfilippo Syndrome.

Should I validate this answer? A:","output":"The answer provided does not accurately address the question about versions of Windows that do not have PowerShell. Instead, the answer focuses on the integration of graphical interface-based management applications with Windows PowerShell. To accurately answer the question, you should provide information on the versions of Windows that do not include PowerShell by default. Here is a detailed answer: PowerShell was first introduced with Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista. Before these versions, Windows systems used other scripting technologies and command tools, such as CMD.exe and VBScript, to manage various system tasks. The versions of Windows that do not have PowerShell by default include: 1. Windows XP: This version of Windows was released in 2001 and does not come with PowerShell pre-installed. However, you can manually install PowerShell 2.0 on Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (SP3). 2. Windows Server 2003: Another version without PowerShell by default, Windows Server 2003, can also be updated to support PowerShell 2.0 with the installation of Service Pack 2 (SP2) and .NET Framework 2.0. 3. Windows 2000: This server and workstation edition was released in 2000, and it does not have PowerShell, nor can it be updated to support it. 4. Windows NT, Windows 98, and Windows ME: These versions also do not support PowerShell as they predate the technology. In summary, versions of Windows prior to Windows Server 2008 and Windows Vista do not come with PowerShell by default. Some of these older versions, such as Windows XP and Windows Server 2003, can be updated to support PowerShell 2.0 by manually installing it along with the necessary service packs and .NET Framework updates.

Article: Every four years athletes from the world take part in the Olympic Games. Both the Summer and Winter Olympic Games are held every four years. The Winter Olympic Games are usually held two years before the Summer Olympic Games. The ancient Olympic Games began around the year 776 BC in Greece. Many of the sports were the same as they are now. Some of the games in which the young men competed were: running, jumping, and wrestling. Women were not allowed to take part in the games. After about the year 393 AD the Olympic Games stopped. For centuries there were no Olympic Games. But they were not forgotten.  The first Olympic Games in modern times happened in 1896. They were held in Greece--the country in which the Games were born. in the Games there were 311 competitors from 13 countries. After that more and more countries joined in the Games. In 2000, over 10,000 athletes from 227 countries went to Sydney; Australia, for the 27th Olympic Games! There are 300 different events in the Games. Horse riding, hammer throw and shooting are some of the more unusual events. Question: According to the passage, which Olympic Games will be held in 2012.

Founded in 1805 alongside the Middle and West Branches of Nimishillen Creek, Canton became a heavy manufacturing center because of its numerous railroad lines. However, its status in that regard began to decline during the late 20th century, as shifts in the manufacturing industry led to the relocation or repositioning of many factories. After this decline, the city's industry diversified into the service economy, including retailing, education, finance and healthcare.  - Lake Erie is the fourth-largest lake (by surface area) of the five Great Lakes in North America, and the thirteenth-largest globally if measured in terms of surface area. It is the southernmost, shallowest, and smallest by volume of the Great Lakes and therefore also has the shortest average water residence time. At its deepest point Lake Erie is deep. Lake Erie's northern shore is bounded by the Canadian province of Ontario, with the U.S. states of Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New York on its southern and easternmost shores and Michigan on the west. These jurisdictions divide the surface area of the lake by water boundaries. The lake was named by the Erie people, a Native Americans people who lived along its southern shore. That Iroquoian tribe called it \\"\\"Erige\\"\\" \\"(\\"cat\\")\\" because of its unpredictable and sometimes violently dangerous nature. It is a matter of conjecture whether the lake was named after the tribe, or if the tribe was called \\"\\"Erie\\"\\" because of its proximity to the lake.  - Downtown Cleveland is the central business district of the City of Cleveland and Northeast Ohio, United States. It is the economic and symbolic center of the Cleveland-Akron-Canton, OH Combined Statistical Area. As of 2000, 100,000 people worked in the district; as of 2012, it contained more than 16 million square feet of rentable office space.  - The Lettermen is an American male pop vocal trio. The Lettermen's trademark is close-harmony pop songs with light arrangements. The group started in 1959. They have had two Top 10 singles (both #7), 16 Top 10 singles on the Adult Contemporary chart (including one #1), 32 consecutive Billboard Magazine chart albums, 11 gold records, and five Grammy nominations.  - Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll or rock 'n' roll) is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s, from African-American musical styles such as gospel, jazz, boogie woogie, and rhythm and blues, with country. While elements of rock and roll can be heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, the genre did not acquire its name until the 1950s.  - In music, an arrangement is a musical reconceptualization of a previously composed work. It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble. Arranging \\"involves adding compositional techniques, such as new thematic material for introductions, transitions, or modulations, and endings... Arranging is the art of giving an existing melody musical variety\\".  - A county seat is an administrative center, seat of government, or capital city of a county or civil parish. The term is used in the United States, Canada, Romania, China and Taiwan. In the United Kingdom and Ireland, county towns have a similar function.  - The vibraphone (also known as the vibraharp or simply the vibes) is a musical instrument in the struck idiophone subfamily of the percussion family.  - Cleveland is a city in the U.S. state of Ohio and the county seat of Cuyahoga County, the most populous county in the state. The city is located on the southern shore of Lake Erie, approximately west of the Pennsylvania border. It was founded in 1796 near the mouth of the Cuyahoga River, and became a manufacturing center owing to its location on the lake shore, as well as being connected to numerous canals and railroad lines. Cleveland's economy has diversified sectors that include manufacturing, financial services, healthcare, and biomedical. Cleveland is also home to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.  - Soul music (often referred to simply as soul) is a popular music genre that originated in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s. It combines elements of African-American gospel music, rhythm and blues and jazz. Soul music became popular for dancing and listening in the United States; where record labels such as Motown, Atlantic and Stax were influential in the civil rights era. Soul also became popular around the world, directly influencing rock music and the music of Africa.  - The O'Jays are an American R&B group from Canton , Ohio , formed in 1958 and originally consisting of Eddie Levert ( born June 16 , 1942 ) , Walter Williams ( born August 25 , 1943 ) , William Powell ( January 20 , 1942 -- May 26 , 1977 ) , Bobby Massey and Bill Isles . The O'Jays made their first chart appearance with \`\` Lonely Drifter '' in 1963 , but reached their greatest level of success once Gamble & Huff , a team of producers and songwriters , signed them to their Philadelphia International label in 1972 . With Gamble & Huff , the O'Jays ( now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey ) emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with \`\` Back Stabbers '' ( 1972 ) , and topped the Billboard Hot 100 the following year with \`\` Love Train '' . Numerous other hits followed through the 1970s and into the 80s and 90s , and The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 , and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005 .  - Philadelphia soul, sometimes called Philly soul, the Philadelphia sound or Sweet Philly, is a genre of soul music characterized by funk influences and lush instrumental arrangements, often featuring sweeping strings and piercing horns. The subtle sound of a vibraphone can often be heard in the background of Philly soul songs. The genre laid the groundwork for disco and what are now considered quiet storm and smooth jazz by fusing the R&B rhythm sections of the 1960s with the pop vocal tradition, and featuring a slightly more pronounced jazz influence in its melodic structures and arrangements.  - Smooth jazz is a popular genre of music that grew out of jazz and is influenced by rhythm and blues, funk, rock and roll, and pop music styles (separately, or, in any combination). Musicians such as Kenny G, Ramsey Lewis, Dave Koz, and Spyro Gyra have had hits with instrumental recordings, while singers such as Anita Baker, Sade, Sting and Norah Jones have found success with vocal releases. George Benson remains a popular Smooth Jazz artist as both a singer and guitar player.  - Funk is a music genre that originated in the mid- 1960s when African American musicians created a rhythmic, danceable new form of music through a mixture of soul music, jazz, and rhythm and blues (R&B). Funk de-emphasizes melody and chord progressions used in other related genres and brings a strong rhythmic groove of a bass line played by an electric bassist and a drum part played by a drummer to the foreground. Funk songs are often based on an extended vamp on a single chord, distinguishing them from R&B and soul songs, which are built on complex chord progressions. Funk uses the same richly-colored extended chords found in bebop jazz, such as minor chords with added sevenths and elevenths, or dominant seventh chords with altered ninths.  - Quiet storm is a radio format and a subgenre of contemporary R&B music that is characterized by understated, mellow dynamics, slow tempos, and relaxed rhythms. It was pioneered in the mid-1970s by Melvin Lindsey, while he was an intern at the radio station WHUR-FM in Washington, D.C.. This style of R&B music is named for Smokey Robinson's 1976 single \\"Quiet Storm\\".   - Back Stabbers is a studio album by Philadelphia soul group The O'Jays, released in August 1972 on Philadelphia International Records. Recording sessions for the album took place at Sigma Sound Studios in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1972.  - The Vocal Group Hall of Fame (VGHF) was organized to honor outstanding vocal groups throughout the world by Tony Butala, also the founder (and now only surviving original member) of The Lettermen. Headquartered in Sharon, Pennsylvania, United States, it includes a theater and a museum.  - North Coast Harbor is a district in downtown Cleveland, Ohio on the shore of Lake Erie. The district serves as the home of the Great Lakes Science Center, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, FirstEnergy Stadium, the Steamship William G. Mather Maritime Museum, the USS \\"Cod\\", Burke Lakefront Airport, Voinovich Bicentennial Park, and the Cleveland-Cuyahoga County Port Authority. It is served by the West 3rd and North Coast stations on RTA's light rail Waterfront Line.  - Rhythm (from Greek , \\"rhythmos\\", \\"any regular recurring motion, symmetry\\" ) generally means a \\"movement marked by the regulated succession of strong and weak elements, or of opposite or different conditions\\" . This general meaning of regular recurrence or pattern in time can apply to a wide variety of cyclical natural phenomena having a periodicity or frequency of anything from microseconds to several seconds (as with the riff in a rock music song); to several minutes or hours, or, at the most extreme, even over many years.  - Disco is a genre of dance music containing elements of funk, soul, pop, and salsa. It achieved popularity during the mid-1970s to the early 1980s. Its initial audiences in the U.S. were club-goers from the gay, African American, Italian American, Latino, and psychedelic communities in Philadelphia and New York City during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco can be seen as a reaction against both the domination of rock music and the stigmatization of dance music by the counterculture during this period. It was popular with both men and women, from many different backgrounds.  - Philadelphia International Records (PIR) is an American record label based in Philadelphia. It was founded in 1971 by the writer-producer duo, Kenneth Gamble and Leon Huff, along with their long time collaborator Thom Bell. It was famous for showcasing the Philadelphia soul music genre (also known as Philly soul) that was founded on the gospel, doo-wop, and soul music of the time. This Philly Soul sound later became a prominent and distinct era within R&B itself. During the 1970s the label released a string of worldwide hits which emphasized lavish orchestral instrumentation, heavy bass, and driving percussion.   - \\"Love Train\\" is a hit single by The O'Jays, written by Kenny Gamble and Leon Huff. Released in 1972, it reached number one on both the R&B Singles and the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100, in February and March 1973 respectively, number 9 on the UK Singles Chart and was certified gold by the RIAA.  - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home.

Over its first 20 years of operation, Atlantic Records earned a reputation as one of the most important American recording labels, specializing in jazz, R&B and soul recordings by African-American musicians including Aretha Franklin, Ray Charles, Wilson Pickett, Sam and Dave, Ruth Brown and Otis Redding, a position greatly enhanced by its distribution deal with Stax Records. In 1967, Atlantic Records became a wholly owned subsidiary of Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, now the Warner Music Group, and expanded into rock and pop music with releases by bands such as Led Zeppelin and Yes.    What is the relationship between 'the o'jays' and 'rhythm and blues'? Answer:","output":"The O'Jays are an American R&B (Rhythm and Blues) group that originated from Canton, Ohio. Formed in 1958, they were primarily known for their contributions to the R&B genre, which combined elements of African-American gospel music, jazz, and rhythm and blues. The relationship between The O'Jays and Rhythm and Blues can be seen in their music style, which mainly features soulful melodies, emotive and powerful vocals, and strong rhythmic elements derived from gospel and blues. Their work became synonymous with the often danceable, groovy sounds of R&B, with songs that showcased deeply emotional themes or narrated impactful stories. The O'Jays' partnership with the songwriting and producing duo Gamble & Huff at the Philadelphia International Records transformed their music and took them to greater heights. Their breakthrough came with songs like \\"Back Stabbers\\" (1972) and \\"Love Train\\" (1973), which not only incorporated their R&B roots but also blended elements of Philadelphia soul. This musical fusion helped define their sound for years to come and secured their place as influential artists within the R&B genre. Throughout their career, The O'Jays have been recognized for their significant contributions to R&B by being inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004 and the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. Their enduring impact on rhythm and blues music solidifies their legacy as one of the genre's defining and influential groups."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So how did England's players fare overall? Chief football writer Phil McNulty runs the rule over those on duty. Barely in action. Has had plenty of quiet matches in this Euro 2016 campaign - might have been a night for Jack Butland to get a taste of the action. Had plenty of time to get forward and deliver some crosses but actually had a fairly quiet game. Barely needed defensively. Useful outing for the Southampton defender but very much down the pecking order of England left-backs. Competent. Not much to do but elegant on the ball and one excellent clearance that could easily have been an own goal with poor technique. Solid in defence but once again a night where he was never fully tested by an average Estonia side. Tireless as ever but restricted by his role as a holding midfield player. Hodgson's Mr Reliable. A dazzling, unpredictable talent. Still has flaws in decision-making but a real England game-changer and superb pass for Theo Walcott's goal. Busy without making a serious impact on the game. Did not do enough to suggest he will be a starter when it matters. Good night for the Arsenal striker as he got on the scoresheet. An increasingly reliable performer and offers England pace and adaptability. Quiet night for the Spurs striker but has proved before he can get goals for England. Good performance. Busy and showed real pace. Good for his confidence to get on the scoresheet with a simple late finish. Very quiet cameo. No rating but on long enough to set Sterling's goal up with a very unselfish pass. A pointless substitution on Alli's debut.

The government said an extra Â£1bn already promised for mental health services in England will fund the scheme.

In 2016, the government committed Â£1.3bn to transform mental health services in England, with a pledge to treat an extra one million patients by 2020-21. These plans set out how some of that money will be spent - mostly on recruiting staff, with the main focus being on child and adolescent mental health services, therapists delivering talking therapies for adults and nurses working in crisis care. The plans also include improving staff training, encouraging those who have left the profession to return, and addressing a high dropout rate among trainees. However, data published last week showed that even before this latest recruitment drive, many thousands of nursing posts remain unfilled.

Summarize this article: A Rapa Nui Rock Garden, or agricultural field, with Poike volcano in the background. Credit: Christopher M. Stevenson (Phys.org)—A team of researchers with members from the U.S., Chile and New Zealand has uncovered evidence that contradicts the conventional view of the demographic collapse of the Rapa Nui people living on Easter Island, both before and after European contact. In their paper published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the team describes how they conducted obsidian hydration dating of artifacts from the island to trace the history of human activity in the area and what they found in doing so.      For many years, Earth scientists and others have used Easter Island and its inhabitants, the Rapa Nui, as a lesson in what can happen when a parcel of land is overpopulated and thus overused—resources diminish and the people starve to death (or resort to cannibalism as some have suggested). But now, the researchers with this new effort suggest that thinking may be wrong.      Scientists believe Polynesians first settled on Easter Island sometime around 1200 AD—over the course of the next several hundred years the settlers became the Rapa Nui, famous for the massive maoi statues that were erected. Over that time period, the people cut down most of the trees on the northern part of the island and a lot of the other vegetation. That led to the loss of nutrient rich topsoil due to erosion and the idea that the people began to starve to death.      To better understand what actually occurred both before and after Europeans arrived in the 1700's, the researchers used a technique known as obsidian hydration dating on artifacts found at various sites on the northern part of the island where the Rapa Nui lived. That allowed them to gain insights into how the land in that area had been used during different time periods. From that they were able to construct a timeline that showed where the people were living over the course of hundreds of years. And that, the researchers report, showed that rather than a population crash due to starvation, there were population shifts that reflected changing weather patterns. Some areas did see population losses before European contact, and some actually saw initial gains afterwards. The population did see a dramatic decline, of course, sometime thereafter as the Rapa Nui people became exposed to European diseases such as smallpox and syphilis and as many were taken and sold into slavery. This means, the team concludes, that there is little evidence of population collapse prior to European contact.      Explore further: Genomic data support early contact between Easter Island and Americas      More information: Variation in Rapa Nui (Easter Island) land use indicates production and population peaks prior to European contact, Christopher M. Stevenson, PNAS, DOI: 10.1073/pnas.1420712112      Abstract      Many researchers believe that prehistoric Rapa Nui society collapsed because of centuries of unchecked population growth within a fragile environment. Recently, the notion of societal collapse has been questioned with the suggestion that extreme societal and demographic change occurred only after European contact in AD 1722. Establishing the veracity of demographic dynamics has been hindered by the lack of empirical evidence and the inability to establish a precise chronological framework. We use chronometric dates from hydrated obsidian artifacts recovered from habitation sites in regional study areas to evaluate regional land-use within Rapa Nui. The analysis suggests region-specific dynamics including precontact land use decline in some near-coastal and upland areas and postcontact increases and subsequent declines in other coastal locations. These temporal land-use patterns correlate with rainfall variation and soil quality, with poorer environmental locations declining earlier. This analysis confirms that the intensity of land use decreased substantially in some areas of the island before European contact.       ||||| The downfall of Easter Island may have had more to do with preexisting environmental conditions than degradation by humans, according to a new study of the remote speck of land made famous by its enormous stone-head statues.      Easter Island, also known as Rapa Nui, was first settled around A.D. 1200, and Europeans landed on its shores in 1722. The circumstances surrounding the collapse of the indigenous population of Rapa Nui are hotly debated both in academia and popular culture. Scientist and author Jared Diamond argued in his 2005 book \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed\\" (Viking Press) that prior to European contact, the indigenous people of the island degraded the environment to the extent that they could no longer thrive.      The new study suggests that Easter Island's people were, indeed, suffering before Europeans came along. The story of their downfall, however, may be less about environmental degradation than the pre-existing environmental constraints of the 63-square-mile (163 square kilometers) isle. [Image Gallery: The Walking Statues of Easter Island]      \\"The results of our research were really quite surprising to me,\\" said study co-author Thegn Ladefoged, an anthropologist at the University of Auckland in New Zealand. \\"Indeed, in the past, we've published articles about how there was little evidence for pre-European-contact societal collapse.\\"      Collapse of civilization?      The new study challenged Ladefoged and his colleagues' view. Changes on Easter Island have been well documented, archaeologically. Over time, elite dwellings were destroyed, inland agricultural fields were abandoned, and people took refuge in caves and began manufacturing more and more spear points made out of volcanic glass called obsidian, perhaps suggesting a period of war and upheaval.      The problem with pinning down the island's history, according to the researchers, is that the dates of all these events and abandonments remain murky. Going into the study, the researchers expected to find that most of the disaster occurred after Europeans arrived, Ladefoged told Live Science.      To clarify the timeline, the researchers analyzed more than 400 obsidian tools and chipped-off obsidian flakes from six sites scattered around the island, focusing in particular on three with good information on climate and soil chemistry.      Obsidian absorbs water when exposed to air. By measuring the amount of water absorption in the surfaces of the obsidian tools and flakes, the research team was able to gauge how long those surfaces have been exposed, thus revealing when the tools were made. A greater number of tools from a certain time period indicates heavier human use of that area during that time. [History's 10 Most Overlooked Mysteries]      Natural challenges      The obsidian dates varied widely across the sites. Site 1, on the northwestern coast of the island, saw a steady increase in use between about 1220 and 1650, with a fast decline starting after 1650 — long before Europeans arrived on the island.      Site 2, an interior mountainside site, saw a rapid increase in land use between about 1200 and 1300, a slower increase until about 1480, and then constant use until a decline that started between 1705 and 1710, also before European contact. By the time Europeans came along, coastal Site 1 was at about 54 percent of its peak land use, and mountainous Site 2 was at only about 60 percent.      Site 3 told a different story. This near-coastal area saw a slow increase in human activity between 1250 and 1500, and then a faster increase until about 1690, after which settlement remained fairly constant until after European contact. In fact, the decline in use of this site didn't begin until 1850 or later, the researchers found.      The differing climates of the sites may explain the uneven decline, the researchers said. Site 1 is in the rain shadow of the volcano Ma'unga Terevaka, making it prone to droughts. Site 2 is wetter, but its soil fertility is low. Site 3, the longest-lasting spot, is both rainy and fertile.      What this means is that the people of Easter Island may have been struggling against natural environmental barriers to success, rather than degrading the environment themselves, the researchers reported Monday (Jan. 5) in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.      \\"It is clear that people were reacting to regional environmental variation on the island before they were devastated by the introduction of European diseases and other historic processes,\\" Ladefoged said. The next step, he said, would be to take a detailed look at the archaeological remnants of dwellings on the island over time to better understand how humans and the environment interacted.

(Gregory Boissy/AFP/Getty Images)      In 1722, Dutch explorer Jacob Roggeveen was in the middle of a bad career move.      The year before, at 62, the successful notary and Dutch East India Company employee had ditched it all to follow his father’s dream of discovering Terra Australis, a mythical continent in the Southern Hemisphere thought to be as large as the vast land masses that crowded the Northern Hemisphere.      The problem: Terra Australis didn’t exist. Sure, Australia and Antarctica are down under somewhere, but these measly continents are nowhere near large enough to balance out the great expanses of terra firma north of the Equator, an equilibrium thought necessary by Age of Exploration theorists.      So Roggeveen — a bit of a Don Quixote on a fool’s errand — wandered about the seas. He rounded Cape Horn. He battled ice and bad weather up the coast of Chile. Then he turned left into the great, largely empty unknown. And on Easter Sunday, he made his most significant discovery: a land mass of about 60 square miles notable for its giant statues and lack of large trees that he named Easter Island, now called Rapa Nui.      He stayed for a week. His crew killed some Rapa Nui locals. And then he split, sailing northwest into obscurity.      Not long after this first encounter between the Old World and the New, Easter Island’s population began to decline. Some scholars blamed a dwindling food supply resulting from Rapa Nui residents’ abuse of the environment. Others blamed Europeans. Did the meandering Dutch notary discover a remote civilization later undone by invaders, or was it already on the brink of collapse?      A new paper provides evidence that, for the Rapa Nui, depleted resources were not a problem — leaving Europeans as a possible culprit.      “Our paper evaluates a long-standing debate and examines whether the prehistoric population of Rapa Nui experienced a significant demographic collapse prior to European contact,” researchers led by Christopher M. Stevenson of Virginia Commonwealth University wrote. “… This analysis demonstrates that the concept of ‘collapse’ is a misleading characterization of prehistoric human population dynamics.”      The so-called collapse of Rapa Nui’s food supply, which resulted in starvation and cannibalism, is a long-held theory and, on occasion, a parable for the dangers of abusing the environment. After coming to the island in about 1200 A.D., the story goes, Polynesian settlers stripped it bare of trees, eroding nutrient-rich topsoil. Jared Diamond presented this case in his book “Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed.”      “They had the misfortune to be living in one of the most fragile environments, at the highest risk of deforestation, of any specific people,” he wrote. “… Easter’s isolation makes it the clearest example of a society that destroyed itself by overexploiting its own resources.”      Investigating this thesis for the study, which appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers tried to figure out how people on Rapa Nui used their land — and whether they had enough to eat. Their technique: good old obsidian hydration dating, which allowed them to figure out when artifacts discovered in different parts of the island were used.      Their conclusion: Yes, food production probably declined on Rapa Nui before Roggeveen’s arrival. But that wasn’t a disaster.      “We propose that precontact declines in the intensity of land use (and presumably population) in dry and infertile regions of Rapa Nui better reflect a framework of environmental constraint than of environmental degradation,” they wrote.      As Phys.org translated: “Rather than a population crash due to starvation, there were population shifts that reflected changing weather patterns.”      There’s no doubt that Rapa Nui was devastated not long after Roggeveen‘s visit. Its population was in the thousands when the Dutchman made landfall in 1722. By the time British navigator Captain James Cook arrived in 1774, it was about 700.      The reason for the decline? The new paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences did not speculate. But other writers pointed to sexually-transmitted disease — and slavery — brought to Rapa Nui by Europe.      “Some areas did see population losses before European contact, and some actually saw initial gains afterwards,” Phys.org noted. “The population did see a dramatic decline, of course, sometime thereafter as the Rapa Nui people became exposed to European diseases such as smallpox and syphilis and as many were taken and sold into slavery.” ||||| Summary:","output":"A team of researchers from the U.S., Chile, and New Zealand has discovered evidence that contradicts the popular view of the collapse of the Rapa Nui people living on Easter Island, both before and after European contact.

Almost his sole champion in the years after his death was his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das Englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \\"the most talented Gothicist of his day\\". From the later twentieth century to the present a renaissance has occurred in the study of Victorian art, architecture and design and Crook contends that Burges's place at the centre of that world, as \\"a wide-ranging scholar, an intrepid traveller, a coruscating lecturer, a brilliant decorative designer and an architect of genius,\\" is again appreciated. Crook writes further that, in a career of only some twenty years, he became \\"the most brilliant architect-designer of his generation,\\" and, beyond architecture, his achievements in metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass place him as Pugin's only \\"rival [.] as the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival.\\" Answer:","output":"The full name of Pullen's brother-in-law, whose work he hoped would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated by both his professional brethren as well as \\"all men of educated taste throughout Europe and America,\\" is William Burges.

Answer:","output":"Tension is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is a natural emotional response when someone is knowingly engaging in a dishonest or illegal act, such as committing perjury. Perjury is the act of intentionally providing false information or lying under oath, usually in a legal setting like a court trial or a deposition. This is a serious offense that can lead to legal consequences, including criminal charges. When someone is consciously lying or providing false information, they are likely aware of the potential consequences of their actions. This awareness can create a sense of tension, as the individual may be nervous, stressed, or anxious about being caught or exposed. This tension may manifest in various physical symptoms such as sweating, increased heart rate, or difficulty maintaining eye contact. Moreover, the individual might experience a feeling of unease and discomfort while lying, making it even more difficult for them to keep calm and composed. In addition to the legal ramifications of committing perjury, the person may also be aware of the moral and ethical implications of their actions. Most people are raised with an understanding that lying and dishonesty are not acceptable behaviors, and knowingly engaging in such activities can lead to feelings of guilt or shame. This emotional turmoil can exacerbate the tension experienced by the individual as they struggle to reconcile their actions with their personal values. The innate human desire to maintain a positive reputation and be viewed as honest and trustworthy also contributes to the tension that one might feel when committing perjury. The fear of being exposed as a liar can damage both personal and professional relationships, leading to potential social isolation and loss of credibility. In summary, the answer \\"tension\\" is aligned with human common sense because it reflects a natural emotional response to performing an act contrary to one's morals and ethical standing, as well as the awareness of potential legal and social consequences that may arise from committing perjury. This tension arises due to the combination of guilt, fear, and stress that can accompany engaging in dishonest and illegal behavior."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

The play group was designed not only to introduce Prince George to other children his age but also to give his parents, Prince William and Kate Middleton, the opportunity to interact with other parents and their children in a more relaxed setting. It is without a doubt that the presence of the world's media added extra pressure on Prince George and his parents. However, it is essential to remember that, despite his royal status, Prince George is still a young child who is learning and experiencing new things like any other child of his age. By describing him as \\"very intrepid,\\" it reflects that he showed courage and was able to adapt well to his new environment, despite the additional pressures surrounding him. Prince George is growing up in a unique situation, constantly monitored by the public and the media, expected to behave exceptionally well at all times. In this play group, he demonstrated that he could adapt to new situations and be well-behaved in the presence of others. This is a time of learning and growth for not just Prince George, but also his parents, who are relatively new to parenthood as well. The play group allowed them to interact with other parents and form bonds, as well as learning from one another, which is an essential part of the parenting journey. In conclusion, while the presence of the global media is an added challenge for the young royal family, Prince George's behavior at the play group shows that his parents are doing their best to provide him with a normal upbringing and to teach him how to navigate and adapt to his high-profile life. The incident of theft can be seen as a typical childhood exploration, demonstrating that, like any other child his age, Prince George is curious and learning from his surroundings."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person whose family name needed restoring? is inside the article: Ireland, 1905: Percy Fawcett is a young British officer participating in a stag hunt on an Irish baronial estate for the benefit of the visiting Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria.

Question: suppose There is lake nearby happens, how will it affect more chemicals are released.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"A: More Step 1: Understand the concept of acid rain Acid rain is formed when chemicals, specifically sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), are released into the atmosphere. These chemicals react with water, oxygen, and other substances in the air to form sulfuric acid and nitric acid. These acids then fall to the ground through rain, snow, fog, or as dry particles. Step 2: Consider the location of the lake In the given scenario, there is a lake nearby the area where acid rain is occurring. Step 3: Analyze the effect of acid rain on the lake When acid rain falls onto the ground, it can wash off into nearby bodies of water, like lakes. This can make the water in the lake more acidic. Step 4: Consider what will happen if more chemicals are released If more chemicals (SO2 and NOx) are released into the atmosphere, this will lead to an increase in the amount of sulfuric acid and nitric acid being formed. Step 5: Analyze the consequences of an increased load of chemicals With more chemicals being released into the atmosphere, the subsequent increase of sulfuric acid and nitric acid will result in more acid rain. As a result, more acidic water will flow into the lake. This will increase the acidity of the lake and could cause harm to the ecosystem. Step 6: Choose the appropriate answer Based on the above analysis, if more chemicals are released into the atmosphere, it will affect the lake by increasing the acidity of its water.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Zubeidaa is the story of Riyaz's (Rajit Kapoor) search to understand his mother, who is not known to him, as he was brought up by his maternal grandmother in the absence of his mother.

Zubeidaa acts in films secretly, but when her father finds out he forbids her to carry on and quickly arranges her marriage to Mehboob Alam (Vinod Sharawat). Things seem happy for her when she gives birth to Riyaz. However, a disagreement arises between Suleman and Mehboob's father, and Mehboob divorces Zubeidaa few days after she gives birth. Heartbroken Zubeidaa then meets Maharaja Vijayendra Singh of Fatehpur (Manoj Bajpayee). Vijayendra is already married to Maharani Mandira Devi (Rekha) and is the father of two children. Nevertheless, he falls in love with Zubeidaa and they get married, but there is continuous turmoil in their relationship. Riyaz learns through Zubeidaa's journal that though she loved Vijayendra dearly, she was unable to follow the stifling customs of the palace. She was also uncomfortable because of her brother-in-law Uday Singh's sexual advances towards her, and his demands of her to have an extra-marital affair with him. Riyaz travels to Fatehpur and asks many people about his mother. However, all except Mandira, whom Zubeidaa called \\"Mandy Didi\\", either deny that his mother ever existed, or say that she was a horrible woman who seduced their king and caused his death in a plane crash. On reading the journal, Riyaz finds out that Vijayendra had become a politician, and was about to go to Delhi for an important meeting.

Sometimes they try to remember a solution from the last time they had a similar problem. They often accept the opinions or ideas of other people. Other times they begin to act without thinking. They try to find a solution by trial and error. However, when all these methods fail, the person with a problem has to start analyzing. There are six stages in analyzing a problem. First the person must recognize that there is a problem. For example, Sam's bicycle is broken, and he cannot read it to class as he usually does. Sam must see that there is a problem with his bicycle. Next the thinker must define the problem. Before Sam can repair his bicycle, he must find out the reason why it does not work. For instance, he must determine if the problem is with the gears, the brakes, or the frame. He must make his problem more specific. Now the person must look for information that will make the problem clearer and lead to possible solutions. For instance, suppose Sam decided that his bike does not work because there is something wrong with the gear wheels. At this time, he can look in his bicycle repair book and read about gears. He can talk to his friends at the bike shop. He can look at his gears carefully. After studying the problem, the person should have several suggestions for a possible solution. Take Sam as an illustration. His suggestions might be: put oil on the gear wheels; buy new gear wheels and replace the old ones; tighten or loosen the gear wheels. Eventually one suggestion seems to be the solution to the problem. Sometimes the final idea comes very suddenly because the thinker suddenly sees something new or sees something in a new way. Sam, for example, suddenly sees that there is a piece of chewing gum between the gear wheels. He immediately realizes the solution to his problem: he must clean the gear wheels. Finally the solution is tested. Sam cleans the gear wheels and finds that afterwards his bicycle works perfectly. he has solved the problem.

After its acquisition of satellite television service DirecTV, telephone giant AT&T Inc. might be setting its sights on an even bigger prize, Time Warner Inc.      Bloomberg News reported Thursday afternoon that AT&T and Time Warner executives have engaged in preliminary talks about a potential merger or other partnerships.      Time Warner shares jumped on news of the talks, closing up 3.75, or 4.7%, to 82.99. The New York media company owns HBO, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS and Hollywood’s largest film and TV studio, Warner Bros.      Representatives of AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment.      Such a combination would transform AT&T, based in Dallas, into a communications and entertainment colossus with multiple distribution outlets — including one of the nation’s largest mobile phone networks — and some of the most prestigious television channels in the business. Warner Bros. also has a rich library of characters, including DC Comics and such cartoon characters as Scooby-Doo and the Looney Tunes zoo, including Bugs Bunny and Sylvester the Cat.      In some ways, AT&T-Time Warner would resemble cable giant Comcast, which owns NBCUniversal — but AT&T would be even bigger with its mobile phone operations. AT&T already operates the nation’s largest pay-TV service with more than 25 million customers.      Like other telecommunications companies, AT&T has been eager to expand into the entertainment business as its mobile phone market matures. Owning content has become more valuable as more consumers, especially younger ones, watch entertainment on their phones.      AT&T completed its 49-billion acquisition of DirecTV, based in El Segundo, in July 2015. Later this year the company plans to roll out a streaming service of TV channels to compete with traditional TV operators.      AT&T has been working with an executive with considerable chops in Hollywood, former News Corp. President Peter Chernin, who now runs his own entertainment company. He and AT&T have partnered on several ventures, including Otter Media, suggesting that Chernin might play a role in the talks with Time Warner.      Such a massive merger, however, would probably trigger significant antitrust concerns. It would come during a changing of the guard in Washington and it’s unclear whether regulators within a Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton administration would consent to such a dramatic consolidation.      The discussions come two years after Time Warner warded off a hostile takeover bid from Rupert Murdoch and his sons at 21st Century Fox. That deal valued Time Warner at more than 75 billion, but it collapsed amid resistance from Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Bewkes and Time Warner’s board. In addition, Fox investors got nervous about the acquisition, sending its shares down.      Time Warner is currently valued at 65 billion. AT&T’s market capitalization is 238 billion.      Time Warner, in recent years, has accelerated its push into digital media, launching HBO Now nearly 18 months ago. This summer, Time Warner took a 10% stake in the streaming service Hulu, which is owned by NBCUniversal, 21st Century Fox and Walt Disney.      AT&T shares closed down 73 cents, or 1.8%, to 38.65 in Thursday trading.

An AT&T; Logo is pictured on the side of a building in Pasadena, California, January 26, 2015. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni      A deal would be one of the largest in recent years in the sector as telecom companies make a land grab for media firms in order to get hold of valuable content.      Time Warner shares jumped 4.7 percent in regular trading and slightly extended gains after hours. AT&T; shares slipped 1.8 percent.      Neither side has yet hired a financial adviser, Bloomberg said. (bloom.bg/2enqBF9)      AT&T; and Time Warner declined to comment.      Time Warner is attractive because of its premium cable channel HBO, the CNN news network, film studio Warner Bros and other media assets.      AT&T;, which sells wireless phone and broadband services, may be looking to emulate cable company Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), which acquired NBCUniversal and DreamWorks Animation in a bid to become a massive force that controls how television shows and movies are made and how they are delivered to viewers.      Owning more content gives cable and telecom companies more leverage as customers demand smaller, hand-picked cable offerings or are cutting the cord altogether and watching online.      AT&T; has already made moves to turn itself into a media powerhouse, buying satellite TV provider DIRECTV last year for 48.5 billion.      Time Warner Chief Executive Jeff Bewkes has not been willing to sell in the past. The company rejected an 80 billion offer from Twenty-First Century Fox Inc (FOXA.O) in 2014.      While Bewkes, 64, was not open to a deal two years ago, the pace of consolidation in the media sector may urge him to reconsider, especially as two competitors, Viacom Inc (VIAB.O) and CBS Corp (CBS.N) have been exploring a potential merger at the request of controlling shareholder Sumner Redstone.      Talk of a deal comes as another potential bidder, Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), is busy with its purchase of internet company Yahoo Inc YHOO.O, which has been set back by news of a massive hacking breach into Yahoo customers’ email accounts.      Time Warner has a market value of about 65 billion. AT&T; has a market value of about 238 billion.      Any merger of that size in a sensitive market would get a close look from regulators, analysts said, but that would not necessarily derail a deal.      “Whoever the next president’s pick for the Federal Communications Commission is will have a significant say,” said Recon Analytics analyst Roger Entner.      Entner said Comcast’s purchase of NBCUniversal set a precedent and there is “a strong argument to say the FCC should approve” a deal between AT&T; and Time Warner. ||||| LISTEN TO ARTICLE 3:43 SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email      Senior executives at AT&T Inc. and Time Warner Inc. have met in recent weeks to discuss various business strategies including a possible merger, according to people familiar with the matter.      The talks, which at this stage are informal, have focused on building relations between the companies rather than establishing the terms of a specific transaction, the people said, asking not to be identified as the deliberations are private. Neither side has yet hired a financial adviser, the people said.      Acquiring Time Warner would give AT&T, one of the biggest providers of pay-TV and of wireless and home internet service in the U.S., a collection of popular programming to offer to subscribers, from HBO to NBA basketball to the Cartoon Network. AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson has been looking to add more content and original programming as part of his plan to transform the Dallas-based telecommunications company into a media and entertainment giant.      “There’s a lot that’s attractive about Time Warner,” media industry veteran Peter Chernin, who runs an online video joint venture with AT&T, said in an interview Thursday on CNBC. “I think they’re both great companies.” He said he didn’t know anything about a deal.      Time Warner Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bewkes is a willing seller if he gets an offer he thinks is fair, said one of the people. Bewkes and his board rejected an 85-a-share approach in 2014 from Rupert Murdoch’s 21st Century Fox Inc., which valued Time Warner at more than 75 billion.      For a Gadfly take on AT&T’s media ambitions, click here      Time Warner rose 4.7 percent to 82.99, valuing the company at about 64.5 billion. AT&T fell 1.9 percent to 38.65.      Representatives for AT&T and Time Warner declined to comment.      Telecom Powerhouse      Time Warner shares had gained about 23 percent this year through Wednesday, boosted by sales gains at both its HBO premium channel and Turner cable-TV unit. AT&T is up 12 percent in 2016, valuing the Dallas-based company at about 238 billion.      AT&T has transformed itself over the last decade from a regional phone company to a national telecommunications powerhouse. Its plan to focus on media and entertainment targets include companies worth 2 billion to 50 billion, people familiar with the plans said earlier this month.      Last year, AT&T paid 48.5 billion to acquire satellite-TV provider DirecTV, its biggest deal in at least 10 years, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. AT&T has been developing an internet-based version of the pay-TV service, called DirecTV Now.      “With the pending launch of the DirecTV Now OTT app, it might make sense to move onto content ownership, but Time-Warner is an awfully big first step into the content world,” said John Butler, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, in an e-mail.      The results are mixed with blockbuster deals that bring outsiders into the media industry. Comcast Corp. has had a largely successful run since acquiring control of NBCUniversal in 2009. But Time Warner itself had one of the most disastrous mergers of all time when it combined with America Online Inc. in 2000.      With 7.2 billion of cash on hand, AT&T doesn’t have enough firepower to make a big deal with cash alone. In the wake of the DirecTV purchase and the 18 billion it spent in the federal airwave auction last year, AT&T’s net debt was 120 billion at the end of June.      Moody’s Investors Service calculates the company’s adjusted leverage at 3.1 times earnings and says the company’s rating, three levels above junk, could be downgraded if it doesn’t stay on track to fall below 3 times.      — With assistance by Lucas Shaw, Gerry Smith, and Scott Moritz ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Telecoms company, AT&T Inc and media conglomerate, Time Warner, have reportedly been engaging in preliminary discussions regarding a possible merger or partnership.

Ride the Lightning is the second studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, released on July 27, 1984, by the independent record label Megaforce Records. The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985. The band performed at major music festivals such as Monsters of Rock and Day on the Green later that year. Two months after its release, Elektra Records signed Metallica to a multi-year deal and reissued the album. Ride the Lightning peaked at number 100 on the Billboard 200 with no radio exposure. Although 75,000 copies were initially pressed for the American market, the album sold half a million by November 1987. It was certified 6× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in 2012 for shipping...

Rudolph Van Gelder (November 2, 1924 - August 25, 2016) was an American recording engineer who specialized in jazz. Regarded as the most important recording engineer of jazz by some observers, Van Gelder recorded several thousand jazz sessions, including many recognized as classics, in a career which spanned more than half a century. Van Gelder recorded many of the great names in the genre, including John Coltrane, Miles Davis, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins, Art Blakey, Joe Henderson, Freddie Hubbard, Wayne Shorter, and Horace Silver, among many others. He worked with many record companies but was most closely associated with Blue Note Records. In 1967, Alfred Lion retired from running Blue Note, and the company's owners, Liberty Records (from 1965), began to use other engineers more regularly. Prestige, too, had started to use other studios a few years earlier. Van Gelder remained active in music recording, working as the engineer for most of Creed Taylor's CTI Records releases, a series of proto-smooth jazz albums that were financially successful, but not always well received by critics.  Though his output slowed, Van Gelder remained active as a recording engineer into the new century. In the late 1990s he worked as a recording engineer for some of the songs featured on the soundtrack to the TV Show Cowboy Bebop. From 1999, he remastered the analog Blue Note recordings he made several decades earlier into 24-bit digital recordings in its RVG Edition series and also a similar series of remasters of some of the Prestige albums he recorded for its current owners, Concord Records. He was positive about the switch from analog to digital technology. He told Audio magazine in 1995:  The biggest distorter is the LP itself. I've made thousands of LP masters. I used to make 17 a day, with two lathes going simultaneously, and I'm glad to see the LP go. As far as I'm concerned, good riddance. It was a constant battle to try to make that music sound the way it should. It was never any good. And if people don't like what they hear in digital, they should blame the engineer who did it. Blame the mastering house. Blame the mixing engineer. That's why some digital recordings sound terrible, and I'm not denying that they do, but don't blame the medium.

IOC reportedly strips Armstrong of Olympic medal LONDON – The IOC has stripped Lance Armstrong of his bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Olympics because of his involvement in doping, officials familiar with the decision told The Associated Press on Thursday. Two officials said the IOC sent a letter to Armstrong on Wednesday night asking him to return the medal. The move came after the International Olympic Committee was notified by cycling's governing body that Armstrong had not appealed the decision to disqualify him. The officials spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity because the decision hasn't been announced. The IOC executive board discussed revoking the medal last month, but delayed a decision until cycling body UCI formally notified Armstrong he had been stripped of his seven Tour de France titles and all results since 1998. He then had 21 days to appeal. Now that the deadline has expired, the IOC decided to take the medal away. The letter to Armstrong also was sent to the U.S. Olympic Committee. The move was confirmed to the AP on the same day that Armstrong's admission of using performance-enhancing drugs -- after years of denials -- is to be broadcast in an interview with Oprah Winfrey. The timing of the IOC move, however, was not related to the TV interview. Two months after winning his second Tour de France title in 2000, Armstrong took bronze in Sydney in the road time trial behind winner and U.S. Postal Service teammate Vyacheslav Ekimov of Russia and Jan Ullrich of Germany. The IOC opened a disciplinary case in November after a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency report detailed widespread doping by Armstrong and his teammates. The report called it the most sophisticated doping program in sports. The IOC will not reallocate Armstrong's bronze medal, just as the UCI decided not to declare any winners for the Tour titles once held by the Texan. Spanish rider Abraham Olano Manzano, who finished fourth in Sydney, will not be upgraded and the bronze medal placing will be left vacant in Olympic records. In August, the IOC stripped Tyler Hamilton, a former Armstrong teammate, of his time-trial gold medal from the 2004 Athens Olympics after he admitted to doping. In that case, Ekimov was upgraded to gold. The IOC also is investigating Levi Leipheimer, a former Armstrong teammate who won the time-trial bronze at the 2008 Beijing Games. The American confessed to doping as part of his testimony against Armstrong in the USADA case. The IOC is looking into the details of Leipheimer's admitted doping, including when the cheating took place, before moving to strip his medal. Finishing fourth behind Leipheimer in 2008 was Alberto Contador, the Spaniard who was stripped of the 2010 Tour de France title after testing positive for clenbuterol. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has reportedly stripped Lance Armstrong of his bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Olympics due to his involvement in doping.

A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? OPTIONS: 1). yes. 2). no.","output":"1). yes. The question is answered in a satisfactory fashion because it provides a general time frame (10,000 years ago) and a more specific estimated date (9000 BC) for when copper was first known to have been used. Additionally, it gives an example of an ancient copper artifact (a pendant) found in northern Iraq, dating back to 8700 BC, which further supports the provided information. The answer given is therefore informative, precise, and relevant to the question. 2). no. - This option is incorrect because the response given does indeed answer the question in a satisfactory manner, as explained in option 1."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please write a short summary for the following article: Robin Thicke’s ‘Get Her Back’ is an example of how not to do a song about an ex On Monday, Robin Thicke released the video for “Get Her Back,” the first single from his forthcoming album “Paula.” The album, named for Thicke’s estranged wife, actress Paula Patton, is slated to drop on July 1, but Thicke has already received some criticism for its concept — a very public attempt at reconciliation with Patton — and tracklist, which hit the Internet last week. The video has only added to the backlash. Thicke appears with a bloody face in some scenes and stares solemnly into the camera as text messages appear across the screen. Examples: “I wrote a whole album about you.” “I hate myself.” “You embarrassed me.” “You’re reckless.” There’s a lot that’s unclear about the video — why Thicke is bleeding, for one. Nor is there any context for the text messages, so we can only guess as to whether they’re being sent or received. In a particularly troubling moment, Thicke points a finger at his temple. The video ends with a text that reads — rather ominously, following the video’s imagery — “This is just the beginning.” Thicke is no stranger to controversy around his songs or music videos. (Ahem, “Blurred Lines.”) But if we’re buying – literally – into the idea that Thicke wants his wife back, the general consensus is that he’s going about it the wrong way. “What rhymes with desperate?” asked Jezebel. “This might be how you sell a few albums, but it’s certainly not how you reconcile with your estranged wife,” wrote Vulture. If Thicke’s “Paula” offers a look at how not to do a song about someone you love(d), it’s worth taking a look at what goes into making a great song (or even an entire album) about an ex — without it being creepy or anticlimactic. In-laws, am I right? In 2001, Outkast nailed the complexities of shared custody with “Ms. Jackson,” widely understood to be about Andre 3000′s relationship with Erykah Badu. Written as an apology to the mother of an ex, the song gives a detailed — and respectful — look at a relationship that started with good intentions on the part of two people in love. Do we know for sure that it’s about Badu? Of course not. Which brings us to… It’s been more than 40 years since Carly Simon released “You’re So Vain” and we still don’t know who paired a strategically placed hat with an apricot scarf. Simon whispered a clue in a 2009 re-recording of the song, but it didn’t give us the answer, just a qualifier. “You probably think this song is about you” — if your name is David. Alas, David is a very common name. Taylor Swift is arguably the queen of writing about her real-life relationships. Love or loathe her, she keeps it pretty consistent with her breakup-inspired hits. So consistent, in fact, that the liner notes of her most recent albums included coded clues for fans to over-analyze. Swift’s last album “Red,” had fans guessing which songs were about Jake Gyllenhaal. It’s a pretty safe bet that the well-reviewed ballad, “All Too Well” is Gyllenhaal-inspired. And it’s a classic Swift narrative – detailed, but relatable. Kanye West’s genre-eschewing 2008 album, “808s and Heartbreak,” was recorded on the heels of his mother’s death and his breakup with fiance Alexis Phifer. As a result, the album’s lyrics are raw and revealing. Not everyone loved the trip down misery lane, but it was a breakthrough for West, who has only gone on to take more artistic risks (see: “Yeezus“). It’s worth noting that in his review of “808s and Heartbreak,” Washington Post pop music critic Chris Richards called it “an album so exquisite, so assured, it threatens to invent an entirely new strand of urban pop music.” Bethonie Butler is a producer and a reporter on The Post’s engagement team.

To make it plural, you add \\"ler\\" at the end, resulting in \\"ülkeler\\" for \\"countries.\\" To denote possession, \\"our\\" in \\"our countries\\" is expressed with the suffix \\"imiz\\".

Let's discuss each option: 1. At a friend: Throwing garbage at a friend is disrespectful and can lead to conflicts. Besides being a rude action, it does not contribute to proper garbage disposal. 2. Ground: This is one of the incorrect places to throw garbage. Throwing garbage on the ground leads to littering, which can cause land pollution, attract pests, and harm both humans and animals. It also makes public spaces unsightly and dirty. 3. Television: While it might not seem like an obvious choice, throwing garbage at a television set is not appropriate. It could damage the appliance or cause accidents, and it still wouldn't be a proper waste disposal method. 4. Trashcan: This is the correct place to throw garbage. Trash cans are specifically designed to collect waste materials so that they can be disposed of properly, avoiding littering and pollution. 5. Floor: Throwing garbage on the floor is another incorrect option. Like the ground, this can lead to clutter and pollution, posing potential health hazards and creating an unsightly environment.

Jackson explored genres including pop, soul, rhythm and blues, funk, rock, disco, post-disco, dance-pop and new jack swing. Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery. AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine noted this on the songs \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\". In \\"Billie Jean\\", Jackson depicts an obsessive fan who alleges he has fathered her child, and in \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" he argues against gossip and the media. \\"Beat It\\" decried gang violence in a homage to West Side Story, and was Jackson's first successful rock cross-over piece, according to Huey. He also observed that the title track \\"Thriller\\" began Jackson's interest with the theme of the supernatural, a topic he revisited in subsequent years.

Background: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov (; Russian: Vladimir Vladimirovich Nabokov, pronounced [vla'djimjIr na'bok@f] ( listen), also known by the pen name Vladimir Sirin; 22 April [O.S. 10 April] 1899 - 2 July 1977) was a Russian-American novelist, translator and entomologist. Context: In March 1922, Nabokov's father was fatally shot in Berlin by the Russian monarchist Piotr Shabelsky-Bork as he was trying to shield the real target, Pavel Milyukov, a leader of the Constitutional Democratic Party-in-exile. This mistaken, violent death would echo again and again in Nabokov's fiction, where characters would meet their deaths under accidental terms. (In Pale Fire, for example, one interpretation of the novel has an assassin mistakenly kill the poet John Shade, when his actual target is a fugitive European monarch.) Shortly after his father's death, Nabokov's mother and sister moved to Prague.  Nabokov stayed in Berlin, where he had become a recognised poet and writer within the emigre community and published under the nom de plume V. Sirin (a reference to the fabulous bird of Russian folklore). To supplement his scant writing income, he taught languages and gave tennis and boxing lessons. Of his fifteen Berlin years, Dieter E. Zimmer has written: \\"He never became fond of Berlin, and at the end intensely disliked it. He lived within the lively Russian community of Berlin that was more or less self-sufficient, staying on after it had disintegrated because he had nowhere else to go to. He knew little German. He knew few Germans except for landladies, shopkeepers, the petty immigration officials at the police headquarters.\\"  In 1922, Nabokov became engaged to Svetlana Siewert; she broke off the engagement in early 1923, her parents worrying that he could not provide for her. In May 1923, he met a Russian-Jewish woman, Vera Evseyevna Slonim, at a charity ball in Berlin and married her in April 1925. Their only child, Dmitri, was born in 1934.  In 1936, Vera lost her job because of the increasingly anti-Semitic environment; also in that year the assassin of Nabokov's father was appointed second-in-command of the Russian emigre group. In the same year, Nabokov began seeking a job in the English-speaking world. In 1937, he left Germany for France, where he had a short affair with Russian emigree Irina Guadanini. Yet the family followed him to France, making enroute their last visit to Prague, then spent time in Cannes, Menton, Cap d'Antibes, and Frejus and finally settled together in Paris. In May 1940, the Nabokov family fled from the advancing German troops to the United States on board the SS Champlain, with the exception of Nabokov's brother Sergei, who died at the Neuengamme concentration camp on 9 January 1945. Question: Did Vera go with him. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Vera went with Vladimir Nabokov. They first met at a charity ball in Berlin, got married, and had a child named Dmitri. When they left Germany for France, Vera and Dmitri followed Vladimir.

Police have released two surveillance camera images of a dark Ford Mustang in the hope of catching the two thugs who broke into a reality TV director's Los Angeles home and shot him dead. James Marcus Howe, 42, had worked on such successful shows as 'America's Next Top Model,' 'A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila' and 'Cake Boss: The Next Great Baker.' He was gunned down and his wife was wounded when two men forced their way into his house in the Glassell Park neighborhood of the city on November 27 - the day before Thanksgiving. The LAPD hopes that the images of the. suspected getaway car, combined with a 75,000 reward from community. leaders will lead to tips about who killed Howe, KTLA reports. Howe's wife, Danae Howe, survived and was able to describe the suspects to police. Police said they are looking for two men in their late teens or early 20s who committed the robbery and shootings. A woman of the same age was spotted in the getaway car. This Ford Mustang convertible was seen fleeing the scene of the murder. Police released this surveillance image in the hopes of tracking down the suspects. Police say the three robbers were posing as door-to-door salesmen. The brazen robbery took place in broad daylight, just before 11am. LAPD Detective Harold Dicroce told CBS 2 that Howe and his wife recently moved to the neighborhood with their 6-year-old son. The child was not home at the time of the shooting and is being cared for by his aunt. Survivor: Danae Howe, James Howe's wife, was shot and wounded - but was later able to describe the attackers. Successful: Howe worked on more than a dozen reality TV shows - including 'Shot at Love with Tila Tequila' and 'America's Next Top Model' Howe had worked on at least a dozen reality shows since 2008 - usually as assistant director or first assistant director. He worked on the 2012 season of the CW's 'America's Next Top Model' and also oversaw 17 episodes of 'A Shot at Love with Tila Tequila.' Among the other shows he helped direct were: 'Cake Boss: The Next Great Baker,' 'Celebrity Fit Club,' Cartoon Network's 'Destroy Build Destroy' and TLC's 'I Didn't Know I Was Pregnant.'

Hoping to snap a two-game losing streak, the Broncos remained on home ground for an AFC West duel against the Oakland Raiders. The Broncos grabbed the early lead, with quarterback Peyton Manning throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen. The Raiders responded, with a 38-yard field goal by placekicker Sebastian Janikowski, but the Broncos countered, with a 21-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater at the end of the first quarter. A 24-yard field goal by Janikowski just before halftime was the only scoring play of the second quarter. The Broncos' offense exploded in the third quarter, with Manning connecting on a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Eric Decker, followed by a 2-yard touchdown run by running back Willis McGahee and a 14-yard touchdown pass from Manning to running back Lance Ball. Prater added field goals of 43 and 53 yards in the fourth quarter. With the win, the Broncos snapped a four-game home losing streak against the Raiders. Center J. D. Walton suffered a dislocated ankle late in the second quarter, and was placed on the season-ending injured reserve the following day (October 1). Answer this question based on the article: How many is the difference in the yards of the TD pass to Decker and the yards of the TD run by McGahee?","output":"Okay, little buddy! So, there was a football game, and some players did some really cool things! There was a player named Manning who threw the ball to Decker, and they scored a touchdown with a 17-yard pass. Then, another player named McGahee ran with the ball for 2 yards and scored another touchdown. Now, to find the difference in yards between these two plays, we need to subtract the smaller number (the 2 yards McGahee ran) from the bigger number (the 17 yards Decker received the pass). So, let's do it like this: 17 yards - 2 yards = 15 yards. And there you have it! The difference in yards between the two plays is 15 yards."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Question: I can use this background: Figure B above shows an important relationship between the wavelength and frequency of a wave. The top wave clearly has a shorter wavelength than the second wave. However, if you picture yourself at a stationary point watching these waves pass by, more waves of the first kind would pass by in a given amount of time. Thus the frequency of the first waves is greater than that of the second waves. Wavelength and frequency are therefore inversely related. As the wavelength of a wave increases, its frequency decreases. The equation that relates the two is  Now, I have a new situation: Bill is working in a sound studio recording sound effects for a short film that he is working on.

Please answer the following question: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation.  The extensive grazing in Tibet lead to carbon and nitrogen loss, subject to desertification, while Nepal adopted a different approach to food production, putting nature and biodiversity first.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Revised ObamaCare sign-up deadline Tuesday President Obama speaks during his end-of-the-year news conference at the White House in Washington, Friday, Dec. 20, 2013.(AP) While millions of Americans make a last-minute rush to stores to find one more Christmas present Tuesday, Americans in 36 states are getting one more opportunity to sign up for ObamaCare after the White House extended Monday's deadline by 24 hours. The deadline to sign up for insurance in order to have coverage by Jan. 1 was supposed to be Tuesday at midnight. But the administration has programmed its systems so that anyone who got in line Monday but takes until Tuesday night to enroll will still get covered by Jan 1. However, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services tried to downplay the change. A spokeswoman continued to stress that the deadline is technically Monday, even while confirming it would be pushed back to Tuesday. \\"The deadline for signing up for coverage to start January 1 is today,\\" spokeswoman Julie Bataille said. \\"We recognize that many have chosen to make their final decisions on today's deadline and we are committed to making sure they can do so. Anticipating high demand and the fact that consumers may be enrolling from multiple time zones, we have taken steps to make sure that those who select a plan through tomorrow will get coverage for Jan 1.\\" CMS confirmed the change after The Washington Post first reported it. The acknowledgement came as applicants encountered site problems on Monday, with users being placed in a virtual waiting line when the system was overloaded. But the agency compared the tweak to Election Day, when people in line when the polls close would still get to vote. Still, the ObamaCare rollout has been marked by a series of delays, both minor and major. Another, letting those whose plans were canceled sign up for bare-bones coverage, was announced right before the holiday break. A Republican National Committee spokesman called the latest delay an \\"opaque move\\" from an administration that vowed to be transparent. In Ohio, Republican Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor called the deadline extension \\"a clear sign Healthcare.gov continues to struggle.\\" \\"Consumers are already confused and insurers are overwhelmed with the administration's last-minute changes, yet there seems to be no end in sight,\\" said Taylor, who heads Ohio's insurance department, said. The administration claimed that the site was running well Monday afternoon, saying Healthcare.gov received a record 850,000 visits, five times the number logged by the same time last Monday. Bataille said the system was handling the volume with error rates of less than 1 in 200 and response times of less than one second. Obama said on Friday that more than 1 million Americans had enrolled for coverage since Oct. 1. The administration's estimates call for 3.3 million to sign up by Dec. 31, and the target is 7 million by the end of March. After that, people who fail to buy coverage can face tax penalties. Minnesota, one of the states running their own insurance exchanges, extended its Monday deadline to Dec. 31 amid problems with its website and extra-long hold times to reach its help center. Maryland pushed back its cutoff date to Dec. 27. New York extended its deadline to midnight Tuesday. The Associated Press contributed to this report. Summary:","output":"The Obama administration extended the deadline for Americans in 36 states to sign up for healthcare coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) by 24 hours, giving them an additional opportunity to sign up for insurance and have coverage by January 1st. The original deadline was Tuesday at midnight, but the extension allowed those who started the process on Monday to enroll until Tuesday night. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) downplayed the change, with spokeswoman Julie Bataille stressing that the deadline was still technically Monday. However, the extension was put in place to account for higher demand and users in multiple time zones. The ACA, commonly known as ObamaCare, faced several delays in its rollout, leading to criticisms from Republican representatives who accused the administration of being opaque in their decision-making."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I having been going in to get quick trims, and I usually like to be there at 9 in the morning. At that time, there are rarely other patrons around. I usually get Nena, as she probably is the first to arrive there, along with the owner (who sticks to nails, I think). Nena is very nice, not too talkative and very assertive. She is one of the few people who gets how to trim bangs for 20-somethings, without making them look lame or like \\"emos\\". The price for these types of trims is about 15, and the service will take about 15 minutes.   I have also gone in for pedicures, and have been satisfied though you could probably get the same service elsewhere (is there any stripmall in Vegas without a nail salon?) for about 5 dollars less.   One of the worst things here is the fact that they recently decided to not accept tips with your credit card bill. This means that you have to bring cash in, or you will have to forgo leaving a tip, which I consider quiet rude. I do not really know why they did this, though I'm thinking it has to do with cutting back on expenses (i.e., paying bank fees). Whatever the reason, I think this policy makes the client uncomfortable, and she or he will likely leave the salon feeling akward. However, since they implemented this policy, I have gone in about four times, and I have never had cash with me. They go ahead and run my card, and the bill includes a \\"tip ____\\", which I have proceeded to add, despite the annoyed look I get from the receptionist, as well as the \\"this is the last time miss, we are no  longer accepting tips like this\\" statement.   So, bring cash to tip your stylist, and if you can, choose either Nena or Mai, they are both nice and good at what they do.","output":"The following review can be considered a mixed one, with aspects of both positive and negative feedback regarding the salon experience. Positive aspects: 1. The reviewer was pleasantly surprised by the salon. 2. The salon's close proximity to the reviewer's home was convenient. 3. Nena, the stylist who the reviewer usually gets, is described as very nice, not too talkative, and assertive. 4. Nena has a good understanding of how to trim bangs for 20-somethings and does not make them look lame or \\"emo.\\" 5. The pricing for trims is reasonable, at around 15 for a 15-minute service. 6. The reviewer is satisfied with the pedicures they received at the salon. 7. Nena and Mai are mentioned as good choices for stylists due to their pleasant demeanor and skill. Negative aspects: 1. The reviewer feels that the pedicures offered at the salon could also be found elsewhere for about 5 less. 2. The salon's recent policy of not accepting tips with credit card payments is seen as inconvenient and makes the client feel uncomfortable. 3. This change of policy may be due to cutting back on expenses, such as bank fees, which the reviewer finds inconsiderate towards clients. 4. The reviewer has encountered an annoyed receptionist and a warning statement regarding the new tipping policy, which may cause further discomfort for clients. In summary, while the reviewer has had overall positive experiences with the salon's services and stylists, there are concerns regarding tipping policies and the value of specific services, such as pedicures. This results in a review with mixed feedback, highlighting both the salon's strengths and areas that could be improved."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It would appear that living organisms are remarkably inefficient (in the physical sense) in their use of the energy they receive (chemical energy or radiation), and it is true that most real machines manage higher efficiencies. In growing organisms the energy that is converted to heat serves a vital purpose, as it allows the organism tissue to be highly ordered with regard to the molecules it is built from. The second law of thermodynamics states that energy (and matter) tends to become more evenly spread out across the universe: to concentrate energy (or matter) in one specific place, it is necessary to spread out a greater amount of energy (as heat) across the remainder of the universe (\\"the surroundings\\").[note 3] Simpler organisms can achieve higher energy efficiencies than more complex ones, but the complex organisms can occupy ecological niches that are not available to their simpler brethren. The conversion of a portion of the chemical energy to heat at each step in a metabolic pathway is the physical reason behind the pyramid of biomass observed in ecology: to take just the first step in the food chain, of the estimated 124.7 Pg/a of carbon that is fixed by photosynthesis, 64.3 Pg/a (52%) are used for the metabolism of green plants, i.e. reconverted into carbon dioxide and heat. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What are remarkably efficient in their use of the energy they receive?","output":"Some examples of systems or organisms that are remarkably efficient in their use of the energy they receive include: 1. Photosynthetic bacteria and algae: These organisms can convert sunlight into chemical energy with an efficiency of up to 6%, which is higher than the efficiency found in many higher plants. 2. Electric cars: They convert electrical energy to mechanical energy with an efficiency of around 85-90%, making them more energy-efficient than traditional gasoline-powered cars, which have efficiencies around 20-30%. 3. Combined heat and power (CHP) systems: These systems generate electricity and useful thermal energy in a single, integrated system, thus capturing and using the waste heat from electricity generation, reaching efficiencies of up to 80% or more. 4. Gibbons: These arboreal primates can swing through trees at high speeds using relatively little energy due to their specialized anatomy and energy-efficient locomotion technique called brachiation. It's important to note that these examples are context-specific, and their energy efficiency may not be universally applicable or comparable across all situations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Samuel, on the other hand, had the luxury of attending college full-time because of the scholarship he received. The friends had grown up together and dreamt of pursuing similar careers in the field of computer programming. They each had their unique strengths: Neil took on practical projects to learn on the job, while Samuel would dive into the depths of theory and experiment with intricate algorithms. They made a spectacular team, often working on assigning freelance tasks to each other whenever they had free time. Every evening, as the sun set and the shadow of twilight danced across the city's buildings, Neil would hop onto his old but trusty bicycle and pedal his way to the community college. The autumn air was growing cooler – a signal of the upcoming winter – but nothing would deter Neil from attending his classes. He knew their shared passion would ultimately lead them to their dream careers side by side. The ride to the college would typically take Neil about thirty minutes, giving him ample time to reminisce on past memories with Samuel and muse about the future they both aspired to. There were always a few moments of sadness, as he couldn't help but feel envious of Samuel's privileged position. But Neil was determined and optimistic, knowing that hard work, grit, and sheer determination would eventually pay off. As he rode through the dimly lit streets, the city came to life with the hustle and bustle of nocturnal activities. Street vendors and food trucks lined the edges, tempting him with their delicious aromas. Musicians played their hearts out in small, poorly lit venues, their creativity spilling out into the streets for all to enjoy. And amongst the chaos, Neil found solace and motivation. The night classes were tough, pushing Neil to his limits as he tried to balance his day job and learning of new coding languages. His classmates were a mixed bunch – people from different walks of life, who had come together under the same roof for the same purpose, each with their story to share. Neil found inspiration in their stories and made new friends who understood the unique struggles of balancing work and education. One evening, midway through the semester, Neil was working on a group project tasked with designing a software that could help optimize the city's waste management system. His group was comprised of Gavin, a middle-aged man who had been laid off from his factory job; Emily, a young mother eager to return to the workforce to support her family; and Jess, a young whiz-kid with no formal education but had a remarkably intuitive grasp of coding. The group was incredibly supportive of each other as they worked long, caffeine-fueled nights trying to perfect their prototype. It wasn't long before Neil began to notice the uniqueness of their individual talents and perspectives blending to create something truly spectacular. They had their fair share of disagreements, but in the end, they always managed to find common ground. Towards the end of semester, their software was submitted for grading and eventually chosen to be presented at a tech conference - an opportunity for funding and potential market entry. The excitement reverberated among the group members as they prepared their presentation. Neil knew that this project was something special, and the chance to showcase their hard work was a taste of what he and Samuel had always dreamt about. Neil's hard work finally paid off when their project received massive applause at the conference, won the admiration of their professors, and attracted the interest of venture capitalists willing to put forward funding to turn their prototype into a full-fledged product. As Neil stared into the auditorium filled with applause, his thoughts drifted towards Samuel. He knew that Samuel would be proud of him, but there remained the lingering fear that their divergent journeys might eventually drive them apart. Neil decided then and there that their friendship was of utmost importance. He vowed to ensure that despite their different paths, they would never forget their shared dreams and the moments they spent working together. In the years that followed, Neil and Samuel pursued their separate ways, occasionally collaborating on joint projects and always encouraging one another. Eventually, their unwavering friendship and determination would lead them to cofound a successful start-up, achieving the very dream they had envisioned during their childhood. Their days of night classes and scholarships, of jealousy and envy, would just be anecdotes to recount during late-night programming sessions and company-wide team-building events. And that is how Neil's journey through night classes, a result of his determination and resilience, catalyzed not only his success but also the transformation of his friendship with Samuel and many others. His story will live on as a testament to the power of hard work, friendship, and the human spirit."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Along the dark street, he comes to the residence of a creature named The Once-ler, a being who is never seen, except for his long green arms. He takes up an audience with the boy, and begins to explain the tale regarding the Lorax.The land once thrived with truffula trees when the Once-ler first came to the area in a horse-drawn cart. Living among the foliage are the brown Bar-ba-Loots, who eat truffula fruit from the local trees. In the nearby pond live the Humming Fish, and overhead fly the Swomee Swans. The trees amaze the Once-ler with their texture and scent, and he soon builds a small shop in the area. After cutting down a truffula tree, the Lorax pops out of it's stump. The Lorax claims to speak for the trees, and demands to know what the Once-ler is doing. The Once-ler explains that he is using the truffula tree's tufts to make something called a Thneed...a fine thing that all people need.The multi-purpose item soon attracts the attention of many customers, and the Once-ler continues to cut down more truffula trees. When it seems that the business is growing too big for just one Once-ler, he calls his relatives to help him with his thriving business.The business keeps growing and growing, until finally the Lorax demands an audience with the Once-ler, explaining that with the number of trees having been cleared, the Bar-ba-Loots have run out of truffula fruits, and have left to find new sources of food.The Once-ler ignores this, but is then met by the Lorax again, who explains that the smog from the factories has overwhelmed the Swomee Swans. Unable to sing because of the smog, the Lorax sends them off. The Once-ler claims he will 'think about it,' but this answer does not sit well with the Lorax. The Lorax then reveals that the factory's pollution is gumming up the Humming Fish's pond.

A:","output":"In the movie plot of \\"The Lorax,\\" the brown Bar-ba-Loots are the creatures that eat truffula fruit from the local truffula trees. These creatures coexist in the environment with the Humming Fish and the Swomee Swans, all dependent on the truffula trees for their livelihood. The story revolves around the Once-ler, who initially comes to the area and is mesmerized by the beauty and uniqueness of the truffula trees. He decides to establish a business by cutting down the trees and using their tufts to create a multipurpose item called Thneed. As the demand for Thneeds grows, the Once-ler's business expands, harming the environment and causing devastating consequences for the local ecosystem.  The Lorax, who claims to speak for the trees, tries to warn the Once-ler of the damage he's causing. He points out the consequences, such as the Bar-ba-Loots running out of truffula fruits to eat, the Swomee Swans being unable to sing due to the smog from the factories, and the pollution in the Humming Fish's pond. Despite the Lorax's attempts to save the environment and the creatures living there, the Once-ler is consumed by the success of his business and fails to take immediate action. The story serves as an allegory for environmental conservation and the importance of recognizing the consequences of our actions on the environment and other living beings.

The like terms are -14*o and 4*o. Subtract 4o from -14o to yield -10o. Thus, the simplified equation becomes 0 = -10*o - 40. Step 2: Re-arrange the equation  This gets all the 'o' terms on one side and the constants on the other side. Adding 10*o to both sides gives 10*o = - 40. Step 3: Divide by coefficient of o In this equation, the coefficient of 'o' is 10. So you divide by 10 on both sides. Hence, the solution of the equation is o = -40 / 10. Step 4: Compute the result By doing the division, the solution for 'o' becomes o = -4.  So, the solution for the equation 0 = -14*o + 4*o - 40 is o = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Advantage will be taken of his offer.","output":"The sentence \\"Advantage will be taken of his offer\\" is linguistically acceptable, though it may sound somewhat formal and less common in everyday conversation. It is a passive construction, meaning the action is emphasized rather than the person or entity performing the action. It is also a future construction, indicating that the action of taking advantage of the offer has not yet occurred.  Let's break down the sentence structure and components to better understand its linguistic acceptability: 1. Subject: In this passive construction, the subject is \\"advantage,\\" which serves as the entity that the action is applied to or affected by. 2. Auxiliary verb: \\"will\\" is used to indicate the future tense in English and implies that the action has not yet taken place, but is expected to at a later point in time. 3. Main verb: \\"be taken\\" is the passive form of the verb \\"take\\"; it is conjugated in the passive voice to place emphasis on the action (taking advantage) rather than on the person or entity performing the action. In this case, it is not specified who will be taking advantage of the offer. 4. Prepositional phrase: \\"of his offer\\" is a prepositional phrase that provides specific information about the source or object related to the taking of advantage in this sentence.  Although linguistically acceptable, this sentence might sound quite formal and may not be the most common way people would express the same idea in everyday spoken English. An alternative and more common way to phrase the same meaning would be: \\"We will take advantage of his offer.\\" This revised sentence is more direct, as it is in the active voice and clearly identifies the person or entity doing the action. However, both sentences convey the same essential meaning. In conclusion, the sentence \\"Advantage will be taken of his offer\\" is linguistically acceptable as it follows the rules of grammar and syntax within the English language, though it may not be the most common way to express the idea in everyday conversation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Dec. 3, 2014      AUSTIN, Texas — A preliminary university investigation has revealed that UT environmental health and safety officials disposed of multiple brain specimens in approximately 2002 in accordance with protocols concerning biological waste.      This was done in coordination with faculty members who determined that the specimens had been in poor condition when the university received them in the 1980s and were not suitable for research or teaching. Faculty members then maintained possession of other brain specimens in the collection that the university continues to own.      This occurred prior to the renovation of the Animal Resources Center, where the specimens had been stored in a secure location. We believe the workers disposed of between 40 and 60 jars, some of which contained multiple human brains, and worked with a biological waste contractor to do so safely.      We are continuing to investigate reports that additional brain specimens were separately sent to other universities or health institutions. Thus far, we have not found any records or documentation to corroborate accounts that some specimens were shared with the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio in the 1990s.      We have no evidence at this time that any of the brain specimens came from Charles Whitman, though we will continue to investigate those reports.      The university will also investigate how the decision was made to dispose of some of these specimens and how all brain specimens have been handled since the university received its collection from the Austin State Hospital in the 1980s.      University officials will appoint a broader investigative committee to examine these issues. As researchers and teachers, we understand the potential scientific value of all of our holdings and take our roles as stewards of them very seriously.      University statement from earlier in the day on Dec. 3, 2014:      As researchers and teachers, we understand the potential scientific value of all of our holdings and take our roles as stewards of them very seriously.      We are committed to treating the brain specimens with respect and are disheartened to learn that some of them may be unaccounted for.      The university plans to investigate the circumstances surrounding this collection since it came here nearly 30 years ago.      The brains that are now on campus are actively used as a teaching tool and are carefully curated by faculty. As our investigation proceeds, we will seek to confirm whether the specific details that have been reported about the other specimens are accurate.

Hours later, that school denied receiving them, suggesting the brains might have gone to another, separate facility, the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio. A spokesman there said they were investigating. ||||| The University of Texas statement said the health and safety officials were thought to have disposed of 40 to 60 jars, some of which contained multiple human brains.      Photo      “As far as we know, that accounts for all of them,” said Gary Susswein, a spokesman for the university. “But we’re continuing our investigation to make sure that none went to other institutions.”      Mr. Hannaford said he was skeptical of the university’s conclusion that the 100 brains had all been disposed of.

According to the statement, the university will investigate why some of the specimens were disposed of and how all of them had been handled since the university received the collection.      Last year in Indianapolis, David Charles, 21, was charged with stealing 60 human brains from the Indiana Medical History Museum. The police were tipped off by Brian Kubasco of San Diego, who had bought six of the brains on eBay for 600, and suspected they were stolen. About 48 of the brains were returned to the museum, which is on the grounds of a former state psychiatric hospital. All of the brains were from the autopsies of mental patients over roughly a half-century through the 1940s.      “These brain collections go back to the mid-1800s, and it’s not uncommon for their whereabouts to be unclear,” said Brian Burrell, a University of Massachusetts, Amherst, professor and author of “Postcards From the Brain Museum: The Improbable Search for Meaning in the Matter of Famous Minds.”      Disposing of such a collection can be awkward, he said, since it may not be possible to give away the brains. Sometimes, he said, an institution does not even know it has them.      EBay policy prohibits the sale of human remains, with the exception of hair and skulls, as well as skeletons sold for medical use. But enforcement is not air tight, as evidenced by the Indiana case.      While a federal law protecting the burial sites of Native Americans prohibits trade in Indian funeral objects and human remains, it is generally left to the states to regulate the trade of remains.      Some extensive collections of brains have simply vanished.      “There was one collection of 600 brains, by a Philadelphia anatomist, and no one knows where they are,” Mr. Burrell said. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"This article talks about a university in Texas that had some human brain specimens.

It is a very different vehicle from the starships he captained in Star Trek. William Shatner has revealed plans to drive across America in a unique vehicle. The 83 year-old actor, who usually drives a 2002 Aston Martin DB7 Vantage, will ride from Chicago to Los Angeles this summer on the Rivet, a custom made tricycle he helped design. Scroll down for video. The finished trike will be a two seater powered by a V8 engine, and will transport Shatner across America this summer. Shatner helped design the trike, which will go on sale later this year. Shatner says the design is inspired by an aircraft wing from the B-17 bomber. 'The finest line I can ever remember seeing was on a wing,' he said. 'Bombardier had lend me an aeroplane, and I remember the sweeping stainless steel part of the wing. 'If design can move you emotionally, that did - and I want to see that in the bike' To make the trike a reality, Shatner is working with Illinois company American Wrench, a motorcycle fabrication firm that's provided frames to Orange County Choppers among others. He has worked with the firm on the design, requesting many of the features - and rejecting a few others. 'To me, flame throwers are a little excessive,' he tells them in one meeting. The two seater trike will have a canopy to protect riders, and, crucially for shatner, will also be able to wheelie. 'This will do a wheelie in 4th gear,' he says. 'I've been across this country in sport cars, in trucks, with a dog, with a my family, and I want to do it on a motorcycle - and I'm going to do it on the rivet.' The bike is covered in rivets to keep with the aircraft wing design. Although thse mockups show a one seater, the finished trike will have two. The firm says: 'Rivet is a type of vehicle we call 'Landjet'. Designed from the ground up as a 3 wheeled vehicle, with its exposed cockpit and command centre, seating fit only for a captain and the harmonious roar of its brute V8, piloting it gives you the feeling of flying on the open road. Rivet's intent is not only to draw attention to the pilot or the vehicle itself, but to the art and craft of hand built machines, done in the spirit of keeping America's 'routes' alive. The B-17 was primarily employed by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) in the daylight precision strategic bombing campaign of World War II against German industrial and military targets.

Premise: \\"Therefore, the impact of the rule varies based on the type of business and its place in the chain of production and distribution.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"This rule has little to no impact at all, with no real exceptions or variances.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"Therefore, the impact of the rule varies based on the type of business and its place in the chain of production and distribution\\" is true, it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"This rule has little to no impact at all, with no real exceptions or variances.\\" This is because the premise suggests that the rule's impact differs among different businesses and their positions within the production and distribution chain, implying that the rule has significant and varying effects on businesses. On the other hand, the hypothesis implies that the rule does not have any genuine impact, with no significant variations or exceptions. To analyze this contradiction further, we can break down both statements and compare their implications: Premise: The impact of the rule varies based on the type of business and its place in the chain of production and distribution. - There are different types of businesses, such as manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers, and service providers. - The production and distribution chain can be understood as a sequence of stages, from producing a good or service to distributing and selling it to the end customer. - The rule in question, according to this premise, has differing effects on businesses depending on their type and position within this chain. - This implies that there are varying degrees of impact (e.g., high impact on manufacturers but low impact on retailers) or different consequences (e.g., the rule might affect pricing strategies for wholesalers but labor practices for manufacturers). Hypothesis: This rule has little to no impact at all, with no real exceptions or variances. - The impact of the rule is minimal or nonexistent, suggesting that it does not significantly affect the way businesses in the chain of production and distribution operate. - There are no real exceptions or variances, meaning that the rule consistently has little to no effect across all types of businesses and their positions within the production and distribution chain. - This implies that the rule does not play a meaningful role in influencing business operations, strategies, or overall outcomes for any organization. Based on this analysis, it becomes clear that the premise and the hypothesis present opposing perspectives on the impact of the rule. If the premise is assumed to be true, it would indicate that the rule has a range of effects on businesses depending on their type and place in the production and distribution process. In contrast, the hypothesis claims the rule has minimal to no impact across the board, with no significant variations. Consequently, since both statements cannot be accurate simultaneously, the truth of the premise would negate the validity of the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: At first, it can help to blot your kitty dry with a towel before you wrap him in a towel. This will help get off some of the dampness and will keep him from feeling like you're trapping him in a wet enclosure. Just gently blotting his face, body, and fur can make your kitty feel a bit more relaxed before you place him in a towel.  Some people even use hair dryers on the lowest setting to  help dry their kittens. You have to do what works best for your cat. Some are fascinated by the dryer and some are are terrified of it. If your kitty is okay with the hairdryer, then place it on the lowest heat setting and gently dry his fur just as you would with your hair, only taking a bit more care not to scare your kitty or harm him. Once you manage this, you should quickly dry the cat to get most of the dampness off. Be aware that small animals can lose a great deal of body temperature through damp fur so dry the kitten as much as possible, before providing a heat source for him/her to dry in front of. The towel may make the kitty feel a little claustrophobic and he may panic a little, but it's important to dry him off as much as you can. Your kitty will likely also shake the water off himself, like a dog.

Even if your kitty will get used to the baths, the initial experience is likely to have been a bit upsetting, and you should acknowledge that.

Here is a news article: WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey said on Thursday the agency paid more to get into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino shooters than he will make in the remaining seven years and four months he has in his job.      The Apple logo is pictured at its flagship retail store in San Francisco, California January 27, 2014. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith      According to figures from the FBI and the U.S. Office of Management and Budget, Comey’s annual salary as of January 2015 was 183,300. Without a raise or bonus, Comey will make 1.34 million over the remainder of his job.      That suggests the FBI paid the largest ever publicized fee for a hacking job, easily surpassing the 1 million paid by U.S. information security company Zerodium to break into phones.      Speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in London, Comey was asked by a moderator how much the FBI paid for the software that eventually broke into the iPhone.      “A lot. More than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months for sure,” Comey said. “But it was, in my view, worth it.”      The Justice Department said in March it had unlocked the San Bernardino shooter’s iPhone with the help of an unidentified third party and dropped its case against Apple Inc (AAPL.O), ending a high-stakes legal clash but leaving the broader fight over encryption unresolved.      Comey said the FBI will be able to use software used on the San Bernardino phone on other 5C iPhones running IOS 9 software.      There are about 10 million 5C iPhones in use in the United States, according to estimates from research firm IHS Technology. Eighty-four percent of iOS devices overall are running iOS 9 software, according to Apple.      The FBI gained access to the iPhone used by Rizwan Farook, one of the shooters who killed 14 people in San Bernardino, California on Dec. 2.      The case raised the debate over whether technology companies’ encryption technologies protect privacy or endanger the public by blocking law enforcement access to information.      (This version was officially corrected to change active U.S. 5C iPhone estimates to 10 million from 16 million in paragraph 8 after analyst IHS corrects figure.) ||||| FBI Director James Comey suggested Thursday that the bureau paid more than 1 million to access an iPhone belonging to one of the San Bernardino attackers, the first time the agency has offered a possible price tag in the high-profile case.      While speaking at a security forum in London hosted by the Aspen Institute, Comey would not offer a precise dollar figure, saying only that it cost “a lot” to get into the phone.      He said the cost of the tool was “more than I will make in the remainder of this job, which is seven years and four months, for sure.” As he made his remark, Comey, a former federal prosecutor who speaks precisely in public settings, paused as if to consider the math he was performing in his head.      The FBI director serves a 10-year term, though Comey’s predecessor, Robert S. Mueller III, served for 12 years after Congress approved a request from President Obama to extend his tenure.      Comey was confirmed July 2013 and took office in September of that year, so he has more than seven years left in his term. According to the federal statute detailing his salary, Comey is paid the rate set for Level II of the executive salary schedule. That means he makes 185,100 a year, under the pay schedules that went into effect this year.      As a result, Comey’s remarks strongly implied that the bureau paid at least 1.3 million to get onto the phone, which had belonged to Syed Rizwan Farook, who, with his wife, killed 14 people during the Dec. 2 terror attack in San Bernardino, Calif.      “But it was, in my view, worth it,” the FBI director said of what it cost to access the phone’s data.      [The San Bernardino case is already changing Apple’s arguments over another locked iPhone]      An FBI spokesman said the bureau would not comment on Comey’s remarks.      Federal authorities have not publicly revealed who helped the FBI unlock the San Bernardino iPhone, which was at the center of an extended fight between the government and Apple. The Justice Department had maintained that only Apple could help it access the phone without erasing all of its data before abruptly saying it had gotten help from an outside party and no longer needed Apple’s assistance.      According to people familiar with the issue, the FBI cracked the phone with the help of professional hackers who were paid a one-time flat fee. Law enforcement officials have said recently that the FBI has found no links to foreign terrorists on the phone, though they are still hoping that geolocation data on the device could help reveal what the attackers did during an 18-minute period after the shooting.      Earlier this month, Comey had said that the government was considering telling Apple how it accessed the phone, though he acknowledged that if that happened, the technology giant would fix the flaw and close off that avenue. But he said the tool would only work on a “narrow slice” of devices, saying he was “pretty confident” it would not work on newer models.      Comey conceded Thursday that the tool would work only on an iPhone 5c running iOS 9. In part because of the price tag, Comey said he hoped the government could figure out a solution to access other, more current phones without having to make mass appeals to the tech industry for some kind of hack.      He noted that there were 18,000 law enforcement agencies across the U.S. that might want to access phones and could not afford what the FBI paid to access the San Bernardino phone. The FBI’s total budget for fiscal year 2016 was more than 8.7 billion, and the bureau requested more than 9.5 billion for fiscal year 2017.      “I’m hoping that we can somehow get to a place where we have a sensible solution, or set of solutions, that doesn’t involve hacking, it doesn’t involve spending tons of money in a way that’s un-scaleable,” Comey said.      Further reading:      Justice Dept. still wants to force Apple to help it unlock an iPhone in a New York drug case      The FBI has weighed whether the San Bernardino tool can help state and local law enforcement      The Justice Department said tech companies have accessed phones for it before. So the ACLU tried to find all the cases. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A man named James Comey is in charge of the FBI. The FBI needed help to get information from a locked iPhone that belonged to a man who did something very bad. The FBI paid a lot of money to people who know how to unlock iPhones.

Question: Years back, following a transition inside a large company where many people got fired and moved around, the decision was made to give the remaining people more work. Now, let me pause here, when I say, “more work” did not mean more of the existing work they already did. “More work” did not mean work of what they already knew, or signed up for when they were hired. More work meant incorporating a completely different role. For me, I’m a programmer. And “management” decided they wanted programmers to also do BA work. Now, mind you, nowhere on my employment contract does it state I’d have to take a BA role. And nowhere on my employment contract did it state taking a BA role would also require me doing all of my programming work. So, after being pushed a few times to attend BA meetings, I got fed up. So I pulled my manager into a meeting and explained this to him. I said, you have two choices: I do two roles, BA and programmer, and I get a new salary to account for the role. When he asked how much, I said, take my salary and multiply by 1.6. Option 2, I go back to programming, and you never pull me into a meeting again on BA work. It’s not what you hired me for, and it’s not what you pay me for. When my boss replied, “Our company is not in the position to pay for two roles”, I told him, then it sounds like Option 2. And by the way, I don’t ever want to have this discussion again. If you want Superman performance, you cannot pay Clark Kent wages. 1 year passed and I was never bothered again about BA roles. Takeaways: Middle managers are one step above one-celled organisms. They can, and will try to get you to do non-role work, with no intention of ever paying you more. They key is to cut it off at the pass. Immediately after the end of this text, the narrator is - Happy he spoke up - not enough information - a new BA manager - trains other employees on BA work Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the narrator is happy he spoke up. After discussing his concerns with his manager about being asked to perform two roles without proper compensation, he successfully managed to return to his original programming role without having to attend BA meetings or take on additional work. This experience emphasizes the importance of advocating for oneself and setting clear boundaries in the workplace, as well as standing up for fair compensation and sticking to the designated roles and responsibilities agreed upon when being hired."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The nicotine in tobacco can also be dangerous. Dogs can get it by scavenging in garbage or ashtrays; eating cigars and cigarettes. Signs can be vomiting of large amounts (e.g., from eating cigar butts) or diarrhea. Some other signs are abdominal pain, loss of coordination, collapse, or death.

Question: What is the full name of the person who states his doubt that the audience ever believed he and Isabel Bigley were deeply in love?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going. The lyricist thought for a second, then said \\"I hate that show.\\" According to Bill Hayes in his autobiography Like Sands Through the Hourglass published in 2005 he states We played nearly five hundred performances, however, all to full houses. Production costs were paid off and substantial profits... Answer:","output":"The full name of the person who stated his doubt that the audience ever believed he and Isabel Bigley were deeply in love is Bill Hayes.

Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\"  At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water.  In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed.  While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself.  In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry.","output":"This text is about John D.

The new Governor, Sir Richard (Cecil Parker), arrives with his charming and cheery but indolent nephew, the Honorable Charles Adare (Michael Wilding). Charles, who is hoping to make his fortune, is befriended by gruff Samson Flusky (Joseph Cotten), a prosperous businessman who was previously a transported convict, apparently a murderer. Sam says that because he has bought the legal limit of land, he wants Charles to buy land and then sell it to him for a profit so that Sam can accumulate more frontier territory. Though the Governor orders him not to go, Charles is invited to dinner at Sam's house. Charles discovers that he already knows Sam's wife, Lady Henrietta (Ingrid Bergman), an aristocrat who was a good friend of Charles' sister when they were all children in Ireland. Lady Henrietta is now a alcoholic who is socially shunned. Sam invites Charles to stay at his house, hoping it will cheer up his wife, who is on the verge of madness. The housekeeper, Milly (Margaret Leighton), has completely taken over the running the household, and is the one who secretly feeds Lady Henrietta alcohol, hoping to destroy her and win Sam's affections. Gradually, Charles restores Henrietta's self-confidence. They become closer and closer, and eventually they share a passionate kiss.

Answer this question, making sure that the answer is supposed by the text: can you access the ocean from the great lakes?","output":"Yes, you can access the ocean from the Great Lakes. The waterway mentioned connects the inland port of Duluth on Lake Superior, which is part of the Great Lakes system, to the Atlantic Ocean. The total distance of this waterway is 2,340 miles (3,770 km), allowing the passage of ships between the Great Lakes and the Atlantic Ocean. Additionally, the waterway also extends to Chicago on Lake Michigan, with a distance of 2,250 miles (3,620 km). This connection is made possible by a network of canals, locks, and channels that have been constructed to facilitate shipping between the Great Lakes Basin and the Atlantic Ocean. Key components of this network include the Welland Canal, which bypasses the Niagara Falls between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, and the St. Lawrence Seaway, which is a series of canals and locks that enable navigation between Lake Ontario and the Atlantic Ocean. The St. Lawrence Seaway, in particular, plays a crucial role in connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean. Inaugurated in 1959, the seaway is jointly managed by Canada and the United States, and it has facilitated the movement of millions of tons of cargo between the lake ports and global markets. In summary, the waterway system connecting the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean allows for navigation and access between these two major water bodies. Through the use of canals, locks, and channels, ships are able to travel from the Great Lakes Basin to the Atlantic Ocean, enabling trade and transportation between these regions and their ports."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

He also states that Chinese writers of the early 20th century described Tibet as a feudal dependency of China, not an integral part of it. Sperling states that this is because \\"Tibet was ruled as such, within the empires of the Mongols and the Manchus\\" and also that \\"China's intervening Ming dynasty ... had no control over Tibet.\\" He writes that the Ming relationship with Tibet is problematic for China’s insistence of its unbroken sovereignty over Tibet since the 13th century. As for the Tibetan view that Tibet was never subject to the rule of the Yuan or Qing emperors of China, Sperling also discounts this by stating that Tibet was \\"subject to rules, laws and decisions made by the Yuan and Qing rulers\\" and that even Tibetans described themselves as subjects of these emperors.Josef Kolmaš, a sinologist, Tibetologist, and Professor of Oriental Studies at the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, writes that it was during the Qing dynasty \\"that developments took place on the basis of which Tibet came to be considered an organic part of China, both practically and theoretically subject to the Chinese central government.\\" Yet he states that this was a radical change in regards to all previous eras of Sino-Tibetan relations.P.

(CNN)Boko Haram laughed off Nigeria's announcement of a ceasefire agreement, saying there is no such deal and schoolgirls abducted in April have been converted to Islam and married off. Nigerian officials announced two weeks ago that they had struck a deal with the Islamist terror group. The deal, the government said, included the release of more than 200 girls whose kidnapping at a boarding school in the nation's north stunned the world. In a video released Saturday, the Islamist group's notorious leader fired off a series of denials. \\"Don't you know the over 200 Chibok schoolgirls have converted to Islam?\\"  Abubakar Shekau said. \\"They have now memorized two chapters of the Quran.\\" Shekau slammed reports of their planned release. \\"We married them off. They are in their marital homes,\\" he said, chuckling. The group's leader also denied knowing the negotiator with whom the government claimed it worked out a deal, saying he does not represent Boko Haram. \\"We will not spare him and will slaughter him if we get him,\\" he said of the negotiator. It wasn't clear when the video was made. Mike Omeri, a government spokesman, said these assertions contradict those made in the group's talks with  the Nigerian government. Omeri said the government will do everything possible to verify the claims made in the video. \\"We've heard about the video, and we can say the road to peace is bumpy -- and you cannot expect otherwise,\\" Omeri said. \\"Nigeria has been fighting a war, and wars don't end overnight.\\" Nigeria said officials met with Boko Haram in Chad twice during talks mediated by Chadian President Idriss Deby. The ceasefire deal announced on October 17 followed a month of negotiations with representatives of the group, said Hassan Tukur, an aide to Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan. After the deal was announced, the aide said final negotiations on the girls' release would be completed at a meeting a week later in Chad. That day passed without any signs of the girls. Boko Haram a growing challenge. In the video, Shekau talked not of peace but of more violence -- promising more \\"war, striking and killing with gun.\\" This strategy appears to be playing out in parts of Nigeria, where Boko Haram fighters have continued deadly attacks on villages despite government claims of a ceasefire. More people have been abducted and scores killed in recent weeks, including one attack a day after the ceasefire that left eight dead. Days later,  the Islamist terror group abducted at least 60 young women and girls from Christian villages in northeast Nigeria. Heavily armed fighters left 1,500 naira, or about 9, and kola nuts as a bride price for each of the women abducted, residents said. For its part, Nigeria isn't backing down. It is stepping up its military campaign against militants and criminals in some parts of the West African nation, Nigeria's defense ministry said Saturday. The military said  its airstrikes and ground operations have repelled attacks against civilians in Adamawa and Borno, two states in the northeast that have been strongholds and frequent targets for Boko Haram. Officials are \\"studying\\" the latest video, even as the military continues to recognize the talks aimed at assuring the release of the kidnapped schoolgirls, the ministry said. Boko Haram, whose name translates to \\"Western education is sin\\" in the Hausa language, is trying to impose strict Sharia law across Nigeria, which is split between a majority Muslim north and a mostly Christian south. Like ISIS, it has ambitions for a caliphate, or religious state. The group's attacks have intensified in recent years in an apparent show of defiance for the nation's military onslaught. Its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the government. As part of its insurgency, it has bombed schools, churches and mosques, kidnapped women and children, and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike. CNN's Isha Sesay, Lillian Leposo, Christabelle Fombu, Greg Botelho and Nana Karikari-apau contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","output":"Boko Haram, a group in Nigeria that doesn't want kids to go to school and does bad things, has said that they are not going to stop doing these things.

This group kidnapped many school girls earlier this year and now say these girls have been made to follow their religion and married to men in their group. The leader of the group also threatened to harm a man who was said to help make the deal with the Nigerian government. The Nigerian government is trying to check if what the group is saying is true and is still trying to bring the kidnapped girls back. Even though the group is causing harm, the Nigerian government is fighting back and trying to protect its people. Boko Haram wants the whole of Nigeria to follow its rules and is ready to do more harmful things.

Here's an explanation: 1. Original statement:  \\"The team founded in 1906 won the first American \`double\` when it took the National Association Football League and the American Cup title in 1912.\\" In this sentence, the main focus is on the team that was founded in 1906, and its winning of the first American \\"double\\". The information about the team winning both titles in the National Association Football League and the American Cup is situated at the end of the sentence. The structure of the sentence maintains a chronological order, as it begins with the founding of the team in 1906 and ends with its accomplishments in 1912. 2. Paraphrased statement:  \\"The team, founded in 1906, took the first American \`double\` when in 1912 the National Association Football League and the American Cup won.\\" In this paraphrase, the information is presented differently. The founding year of the team is placed within commas, indicating that it is ancillary information.

Without their work we should never have noticed these particular shapes and colors, or have felt the delight which they brought to the artists.

To reach this conclusion, let us first analyze the information provided in the context: 1. St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral is a Coptic church situated in the Abbassia District in Cairo, Egypt. 2. The cathedral serves as the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, the head of the Coptic Orthodox Church. 3. Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria was the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church around the time the cathedral was built. 4. The cathedral was inaugurated by Pope Cyril VI in 1969. From points 1 and 2, it is clear that the cathedral is closely connected to the Coptic Orthodox Church, which is an Egyptian Christian tradition. Thus, the cathedral's location in Egypt, and it being the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope, implies a strong link to Egyptian culture and religious leadership. Point 3 identifies Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria as the Pope of the Coptic Orthodox Church when the cathedral was constructed. In the Coptic Orthodox tradition, the Pope of Alexandria is the highest spiritual authority within the church. Since Alexandria is a city in Egypt, it can reasonably be assumed that Pope Cyril VI was an Egyptian leader within the church. Finally, point 4 confirms that Pope Cyril VI indeed inaugurated St. Mark's Coptic Orthodox Cathedral. Combining this fact with the previous information, we can confidently conclude that the cathedral was inaugurated by a Pope from Egypt – in this specific case, Pope Cyril VI of Alexandria.

The principle of sufficient reason holds that for every fact, there is a reason that is sufficient to explain what and why it is the way it is and not otherwise.

The","output":"crash echoed throughout her small cottage, causing her to sit up abruptly in her bed, heart pounding in her chest. The room was awash in silvery moonlight, the pale beams casting eerie shadows on the walls. Betty's disheveled brown hair, tangled from the restless night, fell in front of her blue fearful eyes as she stared cautiously into the darkness. She blinked, trying to adjust to the dim surroundings, and her gaze fell upon the tumbled blind. Cautiously, Betty slipped from beneath the cozy warmth of her quilt and tiptoed over to the window. The night air swirled in around her, cold and crisp, as she peered out into the densely wooded background that surrounded her little home. The trees were swaying slowly, their limbs dancing in the moonlight. Betty's breath fogged the window, blurring the world outside with each exhale. Betty couldn't help but feel a shiver run down her spine. She sensed that there was something unusual about the night, something that made the hairs on the back of her neck stand on end. The wind whispered softly, carrying secrets it refused to tell. Her heart began to beat faster, a rhythm of primal fear that drummed through her veins. As she moved to close the window, Betty noticed a flicker of movement from the corner of her eye. She froze in place, her gaze drawn to a figure standing at the edge of the woods, shrouded in the night like a phantom. The figure was tall and featureless, its head slightly tilted as if regarding her curiously. Instinctively, Betty's hand flew to her throat, her stomach twisting with a mixture of dread and fascination. The figure took a step closer and although Betty's mind screamed at her to flee, she remained rooted to the spot. She watched, her eyes widening as the moonlight revealed a pair of piercing green eyes staring at her, entreating her to come closer. Something about those eyes was eerily mesmerizing, and despite every fiber of her being telling her to shut the window and lock the door, it was too late. She inadvertently took a step towards the figure, her curiosity overriding her terror. Suddenly, a howl broke the silence of the night, its intensity shattering the spell that held Betty captive. She gasped in horror, forcefully shutting the window and catapulting herself back into the safety of her bed. Heart pounding deafeningly in her ears, she rubbed her eyes, wondering if she had been dreaming. When she peered out the window once more, the figure was gone. Betty spent the remainder of the night gripped by fear, jumping at every sound and shadow that played at the edge of her thoughts. As the first rays of morning light crept in through her window, she wondered if she had imagined it all. The haunting presence she had felt, the ethereal figure lurking at the edge of the woods - could any of it have been real?  That morning, Betty decided to investigate her surroundings. As she traversed the edge of the woods, she discovered a set of mysterious footprints near the spot she'd seen the figure standing. Frightened by her discovery, she rushed home and found herself unable to shake the memory of those green eyes. Her earlier questions about reality and sanity became replaced with a burning desire to uncover the truths the night held, and each passing day brought with it a growing obsession to unravel the identity of her nocturnal visitor.  What Betty did not know was that her encounter would be the start of a journey that would lead her down a path of ancient magic, forbidden love, and long-lost secrets. The wind that night had not only knocked the blind from her window, but also, inexorably, the course of her life, guiding her toward a destiny she could never have imagined. From that night on, Betty's life was forever changed: a new chapter began, as each darkness gave way to mysteries and strange encounters, propelling her into a realm where things that go bump in the night held startling truths, and where the boundaries separating the mundane from the magical no longer held sway."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question Why was Mike unable to get a good night of sleep ?","output":"Based on the passage provided, Mike was unable to get a good night of sleep due to multiple factors which primarily revolved around his health. To provide a detailed analysis for the question, let's break down the contributing factors individually: 1. 100-degree fever: Mike was suffering from a high fever, which is a natural response of the body to fight off infections or other potential threats. A fever of 100 degrees Fahrenheit is considered significant and can be the primary reason for causing discomfort and disturbing sleep. Elevated body temperature can lead to increased restlessness, sweating, and difficulty in finding a comfortable sleeping position. 2. Chills: The passage mentions that Mike experienced chills, which is a common symptom accompanying fever. Chills typically involve involuntary muscle contractions, making the person feel cold and shiver. This sensation can cause further discomfort and restlessness during the night, making it difficult for Mike to get a good night's sleep. 3. Pain everywhere: When Mike's entire body was in pain, finding a comfortable sleeping position or staying asleep would have been difficult. Pain can cause significant distress, interfere with one's ability to relax, and prevent the person from falling asleep or staying asleep for an extended duration. 4. Waking up twice: The combination of fever, chills, and pain could have led to Mike waking up multiple times during the night. Disrupted sleep patterns due to such interruptions would have made it even more challenging for Mike to get a good night's sleep and recover. Moreover, Mike's health was being supported with interventions such as vitamin C pills, Tylenol for fever reduction, and plenty of water to combat dehydration often associated with fever. Though these interventions aimed to alleviate the symptoms, Mike's body was still coping and fighting off the underlying issue. Despite the efforts of providing him with medical support, Mike's body was still working hard to recover, leaving him feeling sore and sleepy the following morning. Consequently, the combination of Mike's 100-degree fever, chills, body pain, and waking up multiple times during the night resulted in him being unable to get a good night's sleep."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It was the verdict of the US Central Intelligence Agency on Labour back in 1985, in a memo for the agency's director on the early phase of Neil Kinnock's leadership. This memo is one of millions of the CIA's historical records which have just been made available online. Previously researchers had to actually visit the US National Archives in Maryland in order to access this database of declassified documents. The records reveal the deep level of concern inside the CIA about the strength of the Left within Labour in the early 1980s, a political force which the agency regarded as anti-American. A report written in the run-up to the 1983 general election states that \\"a Labor majority government would represent the greatest threat to US interests\\". The agency was particularly worried by Labour's then policy of opposition to nuclear weapons, which included cancelling plans for the Trident submarine programme. This report was especially scathing about leading figures on the traditionally pro-nuclear Labour right who had compromised with this stance. It said that \\"most disheartening from the viewpoint of US interests\\" was the position of the party's deputy leader, Denis Healey. It reported that he still had ambitions to lead the party and as a result \\"he apparently has decided to appease the left by attacking US arms control policy, denouncing Trident, and denying he ever supported the NATO INF [Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces] program\\". The report added that the growing power of the Left meant that \\"even moderates like Healey have been forced to ape anti-American rhetoric\\". Entitled \\"The British Labor Party: Caught between Ideology and Reality\\", the document is a detailed account of the balance of power between left and right in the party and trade unions, as seen by the CIA. It also records that leading Labour politicians had told US officials they did not take all of the party's policy programme seriously. The CIA was also concerned by what it saw as Europe's large centre-left and socialist parties (including Labour) being too sympathetic to the Soviet Union. One 1982 report concluded \\"We have long contended that Moscow's most effective allies in Western Europe are not the Communist Parties, but self-styled Social Democrats who have betrayed the original tenets of social democracy.\\" Another newly accessible document is a record of a 1981 meeting between delegations led by the US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger and Margaret Thatcher, who was on a prime ministerial visit to Washington. The meeting discussed the controversial American plans for an Enhanced Radiation Weapon (ERW), more commonly known as the \\"neutron bomb\\", a weapon which was said to be able to kill very large numbers of people while leaving buildings standing. Also present at the meeting was Mrs Thatcher's Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, who told the Americans that \\"it is considered unsporting in Europe for a weapon to kill people only\\". The database contains just two references to the current Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn. One noted his support in 1986 for an El Salvadoran trade union federation, Fenastras, which was linked to Marxist guerrillas during the country's civil war, while the Americans backed the military government. This is just a small immediate selection from millions of pages covering a wide range of American and international issues which reveal the CIA's analyses and preoccupations in the past. Records relating to more recent events have not yet been declassified. The CIA's decision to make all these documents searchable and accessible followed a legal case brought by MuckRock, a US organisation that promotes access to public records.","output":"A long time ago, in 1985, the United States Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was worried about a group called the Labour party in the United Kingdom. The CIA thought that this group had too much power and that they were not friendly towards America. Recently, a lot of old CIA documents, like this one, were put online so everybody can read them. These documents show some secrets from the past and help us understand what the CIA thought about different countries and people, like the Labour party."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is hinted that Darcy didn't have a normal family or childhood by how she constantly goes on about Rachel being the sister she never had and the mother she always wanted. Ethan is Rachel's best guy friend, who also has known Darcy since childhood. There is a history shown that for the 6th grade dance Ethan went with both Rachel and Darcy, presumably because Darcy couldn't let Rachel have a date when she didn't. He is annoyed with Darcy's treatment of Rachel. Darcy has spent years with Rachel always acquiescing to her way because of Darcy's overbearing attitude, to the point where 6 years earlier, Rachel pretty much handed her crush from law school, Dex, over to Darcy. This resulted in them getting together and now they are engaged.The Story: Rachel is about to enter a very stylish nightclub with a look of trepidation. She walks in to be greeted by a surprise party being given to her by Darcy. Of course Darcy is so into herself that even though it is Rachel's birthday, she makes the night about her, doing a picture PowerPoint of her and Rachel's friendship through the years, including 6th Grade and Ethan taking them both to the dance, although Ethan is clearly looking at Rachel, and some showy images of Darcy and Dex, who Darcy credits Rachel with them getting together. Darcy starts to dance on the stage, with an embarrassed Dex coaxing her down. Part of the way through the party, Darcy has gotten excessively drunk, so Dex is leaving with her. He points out to Rachel it was kind of her to act surprised despite him knowing she wasn't.

Context: Back in middle school, at least I think it was, I had art class. I didn’t particularly love it but it was interesting enough at the least to hold my attention. We got to class and the teacher pulled up a list of instructions on the projector. She had each of us follow the instructions and she gave us 20 minutes to complete all of them. It may even have been a bit of a race too, to see who finished it first. This becomes a lot more evident in a second. I can’t recall the exact details of the instructions, except that clearly it had to do with art such as having to draw a bunch of things. Anyways, we all went one by one down the instructions getting increasing nervous as to try to be the first one to finish. The class goes quiet while we work. Then I get to the last instruction which reads something along the lines of: “Step 15: Skip steps 1–14 and put your pencil down.” You gotta be freaking kidding me. We’re all so confused and mad at ourselves for not reading the whole of the instructions first. She turned this into a lesson for how we need to learn to read all the instructions first and then start, which was pretty clever. She got us! I remember this vividly to this day. But I look back now on this “prank” and I realize that she was kind of…wrong. Sure if the instructions are short like 15 steps it might be good to glance through before you start. But what about a whole load of instructions? Who the hell is going to read through the instructions for how to build their Death Star LEGO set before even starting to build it.

Answer the following question: Article: The United States is one of the few countries in the world that has an official day on which fathers are honored by their children. On the third Sunday in June, fathers all across the United States are given presents, treated to dinner or otherwise made to feel special. However, the idea for creating a day for children to honor their fathers began in Spokane, Washington.  A woman by the name of Sonora Smart Dodd thought of the idea for Father's Day while listening to a Mother's Day sermon  in 1909. Having been raised by her father, Henry Jackson Smart, after her mother died, Sonora wanted her father to know how special he was to her. It was her father that made all the parental sacrifices  and was, in the eyes of his daughter, a selfless and loving man. Sonora's father was born in June, so she chose to hold the first Father's Day celebration in Spokane, Washington on the 19th of June, 1910. In 1924 President Calvin Coolidge declared the third Sunday in June as Father's Day.  Roses are the Father's Day flowers: red to be worn for a living father and white if the father has died. When children can't visit their fathers or take them out to dinner, they send a greeting card. Traditionally, fathers prefer greeting cards that are not too sentimental(, ). Most greeting cards are too special so fathers laugh when they open them. Some give heartfelt thanks for being there whenever the child needed Dad. Question: How many years has passed before Father's Day became an official day since the father's day was celebrated? Yes or no, is the answer \\"14\\"? Answer:","output":"Father's Day was first celebrated in 1910 in Spokane, Washington. It became an official day when President Calvin Coolidge declared the third Sunday in June as Father's Day in 1924.

Instead of addressing the issue or discussing their feelings towards Robin, Aubrey chose to retaliate by selling Robin's clothes on eBay. This behavior reflects impulsiveness, a lack of self-control, and a desire to cause harm or inconvenience to Robin. Additionally, the fact that Aubrey took such a drastic measure over something characterized as \\"petty\\" further reinforces the notion that they possess a short temper and easily become consumed by anger. The other two options do not fit the description of Aubrey's actions. A: a kind person - A kind person would be more supportive, understanding, and empathetic towards their friend's feelings. Instead of reacting out of anger and trying to cause harm, they would try to work through the issue constructively and calmly. Aubrey's actions do not align with this description.

Movie title: The Craft Context: Sarah Bailey (Robin Tunney), a troubled teenager, has just moved from San Francisco to Los Angeles with her father and stepmother. At her new school, she forms a friendship with a group of girls rumored to be witches, Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Nancy (Fairuza Balk) and Rochelle (Rachel True). At the same time, Sarah becomes attracted to the popular Chris (Skeet Ulrich). Bonnie, Nancy and Rochelle worship a powerful deity named \\"Manon\\". Sarah exhibits supernatural powers from the onset of the film (revealed to being a \\"natural witch,\\" i.e. born of a parent who practiced witchcraft) and her new friends believe that she will complete their coven, making them all-powerful. When Sarah is harassed by a vagrant with a snake (whom she had encountered before in her new house), he is immediately hit by a car and the girls believe that together they willed it to happen. After a date with Chris, Sarah is upset to learn that he has spread a false rumor that they had sex. When Sarah confronts him, he treats her disrespectfully in front of his friends. Sarah casts a love spell upon him; Rochelle casts a revenge spell on a hateful racist bully, Laura Lizzie (Christine Taylor); Bonnie casts a spell for beauty; and Nancy for liberation from working-class poverty. It becomes clear that the spells have been successful: Chris becomes infatuated with Sarah, scars that Bonnie has on her back are completely healed by an experimental gene therapy, Laura loses her hair, and Nancy's abusive stepfather has a heart attack and dies, leaving a large insurance policy which makes her mother rich. Nancy lusts for more power and encourages the others to join her in a rite called \\"Invocation of the Spirit\\".

Summarize this article: This can be time before you will see your mother-in-law, or even during a family event. Take some time to be by yourself and reflect on how the relationship feels in the moment.  At a difficult family gathering, you can excuse yourself for a short walk around the block, or to make a phone call to a trusted friend. Before you see your mother-in-law, spend some time by yourself. You can use this time to reflect and relax so that you’ll have an easier time when you do see your mother-in-law. You may need to vent to a friend after spending time with your mother-in-law. Have someone on hand whom you can call if you need to. This step can seem drastic, but if your mother-in-law is truly abusive, moving may be the only viable option. Many couples do move based on proximity to in-laws. Living farther away can prevent meddling and unwanted visits.  If your mother-in-law’s abuse affects your children, moving away can help assure their safety from her. You can choose whether you and your spouse will be honest about the reason for moving or not. Sometimes, a spouse isn’t willing or able to admit that their mother is abusive. This can cause a rift between partners, and sometimes causes the relationship to end.  If your spouse can’t admit that their mother is abusive, offer to see a couple’s therapist together before deciding to end the marriage. Leaving a marriage is a big decision that shouldn’t be taken lightly. However, you should never tolerate abuse in order to preserve a marriage. If your mother-in-law has caused trauma for you or your children, you may want to see a therapist even after your mother-in-law is out of your life. Abuse can take years to recover from, even when the abuser is no longer a threat.  Even if your spouse doesn't see the abuse, you may still need to deal with its effects on you. Children can be affected by abuse even if they are not consciously aware of it. Make sure they have someone safe to talk to if they've been exposed to abusive behavior.","output":"The article suggests taking time for oneself and reflecting on the relationship with a mother-in-law, especially during difficult family gatherings. It recommends excusing oneself for a short walk or talking to a trusted friend to vent frustrations. If the mother-in-law is abusive, moving away might be a necessary step to protect oneself and the children. If the spouse denies the abuse, couples therapy could be considered before ending the marriage. Seeking therapy for oneself and children can help recovery from potential trauma caused by the abusive mother-in-law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film is set in the home of a mad scientist called Professor Noodle. Professor Noodle has just developed a rejuvenation solution that reverses the aging process. Stan and Oliver are chimney sweeps and arrive to sweep the chimney. Oliver goes on to the roof and Stan stays below at the fireplace. Stan begins to shove the sweep up the chimney and knocks Oliver backwards and down through the skylight. Oliver comes back on to the roof and begins to pull the sweep up. Stan has hung on to the sweep and arrives at the roof. Oliver drops him back down through the chimney. Stan doesn't have enough extensions for the sweep and decides to use a rifle to shove the sweep the last part of the way. The gun goes off nearly shooting Oliver. Stan decides to go up to the roof and as he opens the skylight he knocks Oliver off the roof and down onto a greenhouse. Hardy finally falls down the chimney dislodging many bricks, sending a cloud of soot all over the living room and onto the butler, and damaging the piano. The butler says something about an electric chair, and stalks out. Stan and Oliver start to clean up the soot around the fireplace. They become distracted and Stan shovels the soot into Oliver's trousers. Professor Noodle decides to test his rejuvenation solution. He puts a duck in a vat of water and adds a drop of his solution. The duck turns into a duckling. The professor is excited and decides to show Stan and Oliver his discovery. He puts another drop of his solution into the vat and the duckling turns into an egg. Stan and Oliver decide to test the solution for themselves when the professor leaves the room to fetch and rejuvenate the butler. Stan accidentally knocks Oliver and the solution into the vat. Oliver emerges as a chimpanzee. Despite being rejuvenated—de-evolved, even—into a chimp by the massive overdose of the solution, he is able to say what he has said multiple times throughout, \\"I have nothing to say\\". A:","output":"Based on the context provided, it is Professor Noodle who puts a duck in a vat of water.

At 42, she had never been married, or even seriously dated. All she could think about, night and day, was her ultimate goal. And her dream finally came true, thanks to the death of 74-year-old Porter Strickley. She could not deny that she had learned the job well, working for that old pain-in-the-butt. He was 57 when she interviewed for the position of Assistant District Attorney. At the time, she thought he was 70. Two months ago, she had become the District Attorney. She loved seeing her name on the door. And she felt a rush of adrenaline every time a judge referred to her as 'The District Attorney' in open court. The D.A.'s office would be better than ever--now that she was running the show. There was a soft knock, and Andrea Newly opened the door just enough to peek in. \\"Come in, Andrea.\\" Angela sometimes wondered if she had made a mistake two weeks ago when she hired this timid young lady as her assistant. Angela had been impressed with her resume. But in person, Andrea was quiet, and seemed to be rather intimidated by Angela. But Andrea was enthralled with every word Angela spoke. And the new D.A. couldn't resist the prospect of being god to her assistant. She had hired her on the spot, even though she knew Andrea would stress her patience. But Angela was confident the 25-year-old could be molded into her mentor's image. And thereby, become a powerful force for justice in the D.A.'s office. Andrea took a chair across from the D.A. The furniture in the District Attorney's office was similar to that found in most old government offices-largely unchanged since the 1950s. Yet the hardwood chairs and desks were of such good quality that an exact replacement would be cost prohibitive in today's market. Angela planned to upsize her diminutive desk as soon as possible, even if the money came out of her own pocket.

Heat - Heat can increase evaporation in a lake, which would decrease the amount of water rather than increase it. 4. Nutrients - Nutrients can affect water quality and support life in a lake but do not directly increase water volume. 5. Watershed - A watershed is an area of land that drains water into a specific body of water, like a lake. An increase in water within a watershed can lead to an increase in water volume in the connected lake. 6. Storms - Storms can produce excess rainfall, which can directly increase the volume of water in a lake. 7. Flooding - Flooding, often caused by heavy rainfall, can cause water from rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water to overflow, leading to an increase in lake volume. 8. Lift - Lift does not have a direct relationship with the increase in water volume in a lake. Considering all the options, the best answer is: Storms.

Katherine Anne \\"Kitty\\" Pryde was born in Deerfield, Illinois, to Carmen and Theresa Pryde. Of Jewish descent, her paternal grandfather, Samuel Prydeman, was held in a Nazi concentration camp during World War II. Kitty started to have headaches at age thirteen, signaling the emergence of her mutant powers. She was approached by both the X-Men's Charles Xavier and the Hellfire Club's White Queen, Emma Frost, both of whom hoped to recruit her for their respective causes. Kitty was unnerved by Frost, observing that the White Queen looked at her as if she were \\"something good to eat.\\" She got along better with Xavier and the three X-Men who escorted him, quickly becoming friends with Ororo Munroe. Ororo told Kitty who she really was and about the X-Men, which made the teenager even more enthusiastic about attending Xavier's school.  Their conversation was cut short when they (along with Wolverine and Colossus) were attacked by armored mercenaries in the employ of Frost and the Hellfire Club. The X-Men defeated their assailants, but were subdued by the White Queen's telepathic powers immediately after. In the confusion, Kitty was separated from the X-Men, and not captured along with them. She managed to contact Cyclops, Phoenix, and Nightcrawler. With the help of Dazzler and Pryde, those X-Men rescued their teammates from the Hellfire Club.  The White Queen appeared to perish in the battle, which meant she was no longer competing with Xavier for the approval of Kitty's parents. Kitty's parents had not heard from her in more than a day, because during that time she was first being pursued by the Hellfire Club's men and then working with the X-Men to save their friends.

Therefore, they were angry at Xavier when he finally returned with Kitty in tow. At first, it seemed like there was no chance of Kitty being allowed to attend the school and join the X-Men. Phoenix then used her considerable telepathic power to erase the memories of Kitty's parents and plant false ones, resulting in a complete shift in their attitude towards Xavier.

The tablet shows that Babylonians were using sophisticated geometric principles to track the path of Jupiter in the sky, says researcher Mathieu Ossendrijver of Humboldt University in Berlin, who deciphered the tablet and published his findings in Science. What's intriguing is that these early astronomers wrote their calculations sometime between 350BC and 50BC—at least 1,400 years earlier than the European mathematicians who currently get credit for inventing the technique, reports NPR. The upshot is that the Babylonians were dabbling in abstract principles dealing with Jupiter's velocity and position relative to other stars in the sky, and they described that movement using a \\"sort of precalculus,\\" in the words of the New York Times. \\"It is an application in astronomy that was totally new,\\" says Ossendrijver. He calls it \\"truly an astonishing find,\\" and while he may be biased, others in the field seem equally wowed. \\"I think it's quite a remarkable discovery,\\" says a professor at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World. The Times has a layman's explainer: \\"The Babylonians were calculating the distance Jupiter traveled in the sky from its appearance to its position 60 days later. Using the technique of splitting a trapezoid into two smaller ones of equal area, they then figured out how long it took Jupiter to travel half that distance.\\" Babylonians were known to be talented astronomers and mathematicians, but the small tablet takes them far above previous estimations, observes National Geographic. \\"This geometrical trick rewrites the history books.\\" (Scientists are getting closer to unraveling an ancient Incan technique as well.) Expand this summary.","output":"A newly deciphered clay tablet from ancient Babylon shows that Babylonians were using sophisticated geometric principles to track the path of Jupiter in the sky, according to researcher Mathieu Ossendrijver of Humboldt University in Berlin.

Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts.  Two villages were situated on different sides of the hill. Each village has its own approach to agriculture. East village decided to clear the land, by felling many trees and bushes, and set up a vast irrigation system. West village too a more natural approach to food production and applied the edible forest method, and all the permaculture principles over the years.  Which village had more problems with groundwater salinization? A:","output":"The East village, which decided to clear the land by felling many trees and bushes and set up a vast irrigation system, would have more problems with groundwater salinization. This is because vegetation clearance and extensive irrigation practices can lead to increased salinity levels in groundwater. Vegetation clearance removes the natural root systems and evapotranspiration processes that help maintain the groundwater balance. As a result, the water table rises, increasing the chances of salts being mobilized and eventually reaching the soil surface. This process is further exacerbated by extensive irrigation, which raises the water table and further contributes to salt mobilization. On the other hand, the West village took a more natural approach to food production by applying the edible forest method and permaculture principles. These methods encourage the preservation and maintenance of natural vegetation and promote efficient water use. As a result, the risk of groundwater salinization is reduced in the West village, as the vegetation helps to maintain the water table balance and prevent the mobilization of salts."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In the paleolithic, people did not normally live in permanent constructions. In the neolithic, mud brick houses started appearing that were coated with plaster. The growth of agriculture made permanent houses possible. Doorways were made on the roof, with ladders positioned both on the inside and outside of the houses. The roof was supported by beams from the inside. The rough ground was covered by platforms, mats, and skins on which residents slept.

Title: Quadrophenia Movie plot: The film, set in 1964, follows the life of Jimmy Cooper (Phil Daniels), a young London Mod. Disillusioned by his parents and a dull job as a post room boy in an advertising firm, Jimmy finds an outlet for his teenage angst by taking amphetamines, partying, riding scooters and brawling with Rockers, accompanied by his Mod friends Dave (Mark Wingett), Chalky (Philip Davis) and Spider (Gary Shail). One of the Mods' rivals, the Rockers, is in fact Jimmy's childhood friend, Kevin (Ray Winstone). An attack by hostile Rockers on Spider leads to a retaliation attack on Kevin. Jimmy participates in the beating, but when he realises the victim is Kevin, he doesn't help him, instead riding away on his scooter. A bank holiday weekend provides the excuse for the rivalry between Mods and Rockers to come to a head, as they both descend upon the seaside town of Brighton. A series of running battles ensues. As the police close in on the rioters, Jimmy escapes down an alleyway with Steph (Leslie Ash)Â â a girl on whom he has a crushÂ â and they have sex. When the pair emerge, they find themselves in the middle of the melee just as police are detaining rioters. Jimmy is arrested, detained with a volatile, popular Mod he calls 'Ace Face' (Sting), and later fined the then-large sum of Â£50. When fined Â£75, Ace Face mocks the magistrate by offering to pay on the spot with a cheque, to the amusement of the fellow Mods. Back in London, Jimmy becomes severely depressed. He is thrown out of his house by his mother, who finds his stash of amphetamine pills. He then quits his job, spends his severance package on more pills, and finds out that Steph has become the girlfriend of his friend Dave.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which process would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, process A or process B?  John is a biologist, who studies animal species of tundra biome. He noticed that they behave in certain way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' cortex. On the other hand, they behave some other way when they secrete hormones from adrenal glands' medulla. He termed the first process as process A and latter process as process B.  Hint: The two adrenal glands are located above the kidneys. Each gland has an inner and outer part. The outer part, called the cortex, secretes hormones such as cortisol, which helps the body deal with stress, and aldosterone, which helps regulate the balance of minerals in the body. The inner part of each adrenal gland, called the medulla, secretes fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline, which prepare the body to respond to emergencies. For example, adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles. You can see an animation of this response at the link below. The answer to this question is:","output":"Process B would cause more oxygen and glucose going to the muscles.  The paragraph provides information about two processes, process A and process B, related to hormone secretion from different parts of the adrenal glands.  Process A involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' cortex. The cortex releases hormones such as cortisol (helps the body deal with stress) and aldosterone (regulates the balance of minerals in the body). Although cortisol helps the body handle stress, its primary effect is not on increasing oxygen and glucose supply to the muscles.  Process B, on the other hand, involves the secretion of hormones from the adrenal glands' medulla. The medulla secretes fight-or-flight hormones like adrenaline, which prepares the body to respond to emergencies. Adrenaline increases the amount of oxygen and glucose going to the muscles, allowing them to operate at a higher capacity and respond rapidly during emergency situations. Considering both processes, process B would cause more oxygen and glucose to be directed to the muscles as it directly involves the secretion of adrenaline, which is responsible for preparing the body for physical exertion and emergencies by increasing oxygen and glucose availability to the muscles."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Therefore, a polyhedron must have at least 4 faces. - Hence, statement A is incorrect because a polyhedron has at least 4 faces, not 3. **Statement B: A geometric solid with 2 parallel faces and the rest trapezoidal faces is a prism.** - A prism is defined as a solid geometric figure whose two end faces are similar, equal, and parallel rectilinear figures, and whose sides are parallelograms. - If the lateral faces are trapezoidal and the extensions of the lateral edges do not intersect at a point, then it does not meet the definition of a prism. - Therefore, statement B is incorrect because having trapezoidal faces does not necessarily make a geometric solid a prism. **Statement C: A quadrangular prism with all side faces being squares must be a cube.** - A quadrangular prism has a quadrilateral as its base. If all side faces are squares, it suggests that all sides are equal in length. - However, the base can be a rhombus, which also has sides of equal length but does not require all angles to be 90 degrees, unlike a cube. - Therefore, statement C is incorrect because a quadrangular prism with all side faces being squares can be a right prism with a rhombus base, not necessarily a cube. **Statement D: The lateral edges of a prism are equal in length, and the lateral faces are parallelograms.** - By the definition of a prism, its lateral edges are parallel and equal in length. - This implies that the lateral faces, which are bounded by the lateral edges, must be parallelograms. - Therefore, statement D is correct as it accurately describes the properties of a prism's lateral edges and faces. **Conclusion:** Given the analysis above, the correct statement about the properties of geometric figures is: boxed{text{D}}"},{"instruction":"A triangular region is bounded by the two coordinate axes and the line given by the equation 2x + y = 6.

First, let's calculate the angle advanced by the hour hand. Since there are 12 hours on a clock, each hour represents an angle of 360°/12 = 30°. By 3 o'clock, the hour hand has moved 3 * 30° = 90° from the 12 o'clock position. However, by 15 minutes past 3, the hour hand has moved a bit further. Since each minute represents 1/60 of an hour, the hour hand moves 30°/60 = 0.5° per minute. At 15 minutes past the hour, the hour hand has moved an additional 15 * 0.5° = 7.5°. So, the total angle for the hour hand from the 12 o'clock position is 90° + 7.5° = 97.5°. Next, let's calculate the angle for the minute hand. Since there are 60 minutes on a clock, each minute represents an angle of 360°/60 = 6°. At 15 minutes past the hour, the minute hand has moved 15 * 6° = 90° from the 12 o'clock position. Now, we find the difference between the two angles to get the angle between the minute and hour hands: Angle between hands = |Angle of hour hand - Angle of minute hand| Angle between hands = |97.5° - 90°| Angle between hands = |7.5°| So, the angle between the minute and hour hands at 15:15 is boxed{7.5}  degrees."},{"instruction":"The proposition complementary angles of the same angle are equal can be rewritten as if ______, then ______.","output":"To rewrite the proposition \\"complementary angles of the same angle are equal\\" in an \\"if ldots, then ldots\\" format, we start by identifying the condition and the conclusion based on the given proposition. **Condition**: Two angles are complementary to the same angle.

Assume ( P(x) ) is a polynomial of non-zero degree, and without loss of generality, take its leading coefficient to be positive. 2. Analyze the behavior of ( P(x) ) for large values of ( x ):    - If ( P ) is an odd-degree polynomial, as ( x to infty ) and ( x to -infty ), ( P(x) ) will take both positive and negative large values. Hence, it can only take specific values more than once for a finite number of integer points. Thus, the degree of ( P ) must be even. 3. With ( P ) being an even-degree polynomial:    - For sufficiently large positive ( x ), ( P(x) ) increases.    - For sufficiently large negative ( x ), ( P(x) ) decreases.    - Consequently, large values that ( P(x) ) attains more than once must occur exactly twice. 4. Arrange these repeated values ( a_1, a_2, ldots ) in an increasing sequence and denote by ( x_k ) and ( y_k ) the two integer points such that ( P(x_k) = P(y_k) = a_k ). 5.

Examine the implications for large ( x ):    - If ( c > c_0 ), then ( P(x) - P(c-x) ) has a positive leading coefficient, implying for large ( x ), values are positive. This results in:      [        x_k + y_k < c_0 + 0.1      ]    - If ( c < c_0 ), then ( P(x) - P(c-x) ) has a negative leading coefficient, implying for large ( x ), values are negative. Thus:      [        x_k + y_k > c_0 - 0.1      ] 7. Since ( x_k + y_k ) are integers, it follows that from some point onwards, all these sums must be equal:    [      x_k + y_k = c    ]    with ( c ) being an integer. 8. Therefore, for ( P(x) ) and ( P(c-x) ) to have equal integer values at large ( x ), the graph of ( y = P(x) ) must be symmetric around ( x = c/2 ). 9.

Correspondingly, the face of the cube visible from above will alternate between faces corresponding to blue vertices and faces corresponding to red vertices. 4. **Restoring the Initial State:**     - Since the cube returns to its original position, it must land back on the same black square, restoring the initial condition and making the color pattern of the checkerboard consistent with the starting position. 5. **Top Face Orientation:**     - If the cube's top face was rotated by 90^circ, this would result in a different configuration from the initial one despite the cube returning to its original position. This discrepancy arises because:         - A 90^circ rotation would change the relative positions of the cube's vertices in relation to the plane.         - This alteration means that the face orientations and vertex alignments would no longer correspond to their initial state.

We need to prove that these triangles together cover the entire base. 2. **Congruence and Positioning:**    Since ( triangle X_iA_iA_{i+1} ) is congruent to ( triangle SA_iA_{i+1} ), the sides and angles of these triangles are equal. This implies that ( X_i ) is positioned such that ( angle X_iA_iA_{i+1} = angle SA_iA_{i+1} ) and ( angle X_iA_{i+1}A_i = angle SA_{i+1}A_i ). 3. **Convexity of the Base:**    The base ( A_1A_2A_3ldots A_n ) is convex, meaning that for any two points on the boundary of the polygon, the line segment connecting them lies entirely within the polygon. 4. **Covering the Base:**    To show that the triangles ( X_iA_iA_{i+1} ) cover the entire base, consider the following:    - Each triangle ( X_iA_iA_{i+1} ) shares the side ( A_iA_{i+1} ) with the base.    - Since ( X_i ) is positioned such that ( triangle X_iA_iA_{i+1} ) is congruent to ( triangle SA_iA_{i+1} ), the triangles ( X_iA_iA_{i+1} ) are positioned around the base in a manner that they collectively cover the entire base. 5. **Handling Obtuse Triangles:**    If ( triangle A_{i+1} A_i H ) is an obtuse triangle, it means that one of the angles is greater than ( 90^circ ). However, since the base is convex, the sum of the internal angles of the polygon is ( (n-2) times 180^circ ), and each internal angle is less than ( 180^circ ). Therefore, the obtuse angle does not affect the overall coverage of the base by the triangles ( X_iA_iA_{i+1} ). 6. **Conclusion:**    By the properties of congruence and the convexity of the base, the triangles ( X_iA_iA_{i+1} ) together cover the entire base ( A_1A_2A_3ldots A_n ).

In geometry, if a direction vector of a line is parallel to the normal vector of a plane, the line is perpendicular to the plane. Therefore, we conclude that lbot alpha. Hence, **statement A is correct**. **Option B:** To check if the line l with a direction vector overrightarrow{a}=(1,-3,0) is parallel to the plane alpha with a normal vector overrightarrow{n}=(6,2,5), we compute the dot product overrightarrow{a}•overrightarrow{n}. The calculation follows: [ overrightarrow{a}•overrightarrow{n} = (1)(6) + (-3)(2) + (0)(5) = 6 - 6 + 0 = 0. ] Since the dot product is zero, overrightarrow{a} and overrightarrow{n} are orthogonal (overrightarrow{a}⊥overrightarrow{n}). However, this orthogonal relationship does not necessarily imply that the line is parallel to the plane (l∥alpha). A line orthogonal to a plane's normal can still lie within the plane or intersect it.

Choosing x=1 for simplicity, we get y=-1 and z=0. Thus, the normal vector overrightarrow{m} can be expressed as (1, -1, 0). Given overrightarrow{n}=(1,u,t) as another expression for the normal vector of plane alpha, we can equate components to find u=-1 and t=0. Therefore, u+t=(-1)+0=-1, contradicting the statement that u+t=1. Hence, **statement C is incorrect**. **Option D:** For point A=(1,1,2) to be inside plane alpha with a normal vector overrightarrow{n}=(-2,3,1), and considering point B=(2,1,4), we find the vector overrightarrow{AB} as follows: [ overrightarrow{AB} = B - A = (2-1, 1-1, 4-2) = (1,0,2). ] Computing the dot product of overrightarrow{AB} and overrightarrow{n} gives: [ overrightarrow{AB}•overrightarrow{n} = (1)(-2) + (0)(3) + (2)(1) = -2 + 0 + 2 = 0. ] Since overrightarrow{AB}•overrightarrow{n}=0, point B is on the plane alpha.

Find real numbers (x) that satisfy the equation ({x} + left{frac{1}{x}right} = 1). 2. Prove that none of the (x) satisfying the above equation are rational numbers. Let us dissect the reference solution step-by-step. # (1) Finding Real Numbers (x) 1. Let (x = m + alpha), where (m in mathbb{Z}) and (0 leq alpha < 1). Similarly, let (frac{1}{x} = n + beta), where (n in mathbb{Z}) and (0 leq beta < 1). 2. From the given equation:    [    {x} + left{frac{1}{x}right} = 1    ]    We substitute for ({x}) and (left{frac{1}{x}right}):    [    {m + alpha} + {n + beta} = 1 quad Rightarrow quad alpha + beta = 1    ] 3. Since (alpha + beta = 1), add (x) and (frac{1}{x}):    [    x + frac{1}{x} = (m + alpha) + (n + beta) = m + n + 1    ] 4. We know (m) and (n) are integers, hence (m + n + 1) is also an integer.

Check (k = 3):    - For (k = 3):      [      x = frac{3 pm sqrt{5}}{2}      ] 8.

The domain of h(x) is (1, +infty). The derivative of the function h(x) is given by h'(x) = 2x - a - frac{a}{x-1} = frac{2x(x-frac{a+2}{2})}{x-1}.  Since a ge 1, we have frac{a+2}{2} ge frac{3}{2}. Therefore, for x in (1, frac{a+2}{2}) the derivative h'(x) < 0, and for x in (frac{a+2}{2}, +infty), the derivative h'(x) > 0. That is, when x = frac{a+2}{2}, the function h(x) attains its minimum value, which is also the absolute minimum value h(frac{a+2}{2}) = -frac{a^2}{4} + 1 - alnfrac{a}{2}. Define G(a) = h(frac{a+2}{2}) = -frac{a^2}{4} + 1 - alnfrac{a}{2}. G(a) is a decreasing function on [1, +infty). Consequently, the maximum value of G(a) occurs at G(1) = frac{3}{4}+ln2. Thus, the minimum value of h(x), h(frac{a+2}{2}), is at most frac{3}{4}+ln2. For the case x^2 - ax - aln(x-1) > b, we have b < frac{3}{4}+ln2.

The original revenue derived from the tax is then T * C. After the tax is diminished by some percentage, let's call this percentage X, the new tax rate becomes T * (1 - X/100). The consumption is increased by 15%, so the new consumption is C * 1.15. The new revenue derived from the tax is then T * (1 - X/100) * C * 1.15. We are given that the decrease in the revenue is 25.25%, which means the new revenue is 100% - 25.25% = 74.75% of the original revenue. So, we can set up the equation: T * (1 - X/100) * C * 1.15 = T * C * 0.7475 Now, we can cancel out T and C from both sides since they are non-zero: (1 - X/100) * 1.15 = 0.7475 Now, let's solve for X: 1.15 - 1.15 * (X/100) = 0.7475 1.15 - 0.7475 = 1.15 * (X/100) 0.4025 = 1.15 * (X/100) Now, divide both sides by 1.15: 0.4025 / 1.15 = X/100 X/100 = 0.4025 / 1.15 X = (0.4025 / 1.15) * 100 X ≈ 35 Therefore, the tax is diminished by approximately boxed{35%} ."},{"instruction":"The graph of a function f(x) is given by parts: for 4 leq x leq 2, f(x) = x^2  2x + 6; for 2 < x leq 2, f(x) = x + 4; and for 2 < x leq 4, f(x) = x^2  4x + 8.

Consider sums like (0 mod 20 ), by placing (0, 0, 0,ldots)        b.

How many calories does James lose in a week from dancing and swimming combined?","output":"First, let's calculate the calories James loses per hour while dancing. Since he loses twice as many calories dancing as he did walking, and he burned 300 calories an hour walking, he loses: 2 * 300 calories/hour = 600 calories/hour dancing. He dances twice a day for 0.5 hours each time, so in one day, he dances for: 2 * 0.5 hours = 1 hour. Since he does this 4 times a week, the total hours he spends dancing in a week is: 4 days/week * 1 hour/day = 4 hours/week. Therefore, the total calories he loses from dancing in a week is: 600 calories/hour * 4 hours/week = 2400 calories/week from dancing. Now, let's calculate the calories James loses per hour while swimming. Since he loses 1.5 times as many calories swimming as he did walking, he loses: 1.5 * 300 calories/hour = 450 calories/hour swimming. He swims for 1 hour each day on the remaining 3 days of the week, so the total hours he spends swimming in a week is: 3 days/week * 1 hour/day = 3 hours/week. Therefore, the total calories he loses from swimming in a week is: 450 calories/hour * 3 hours/week = 1350 calories/week from swimming. Finally, to find the total calories James loses in a week from both dancing and swimming, we add the two amounts together: 2400 calories/week (dancing) + 1350 calories/week (swimming) = 3750 calories/week.

Let's expand the expression (Ax + y)(Bz + w): (Ax + y)(Bz + w) = ABxz + Awx + Byz + yw Now, let's compare this with the given equations. We can see that ABxz corresponds to the term 4xz in the first equation, and yw corresponds to the term yw in the first equation. Similarly, Awx corresponds to the term xw in the second equation, and Byz corresponds to the term yz in the second equation. So, we can write: ABxz = 4xz Aw = x By = y yw = yw Since we are looking for the number that multiplies x and z, we are interested in AB. From ABxz = 4xz, we can see that AB must be equal to 4 because the xz terms must be equal.

First, we express sinleft(x + frac{pi}{3}right) as frac{1}{2}sin x + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos x: [ f(x) = sin x left(frac{1}{2}sin x + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos xright) - frac{1}{4} ] Next, we apply the double angle formulas, sin 2x = 2sin xcos x and cos 2x = 1 - 2sin^2 x, to further simplify: [ f(x) = frac{1}{2}times frac{1-cos 2x}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2}times frac{1}{2}sin 2x - frac{1}{4} ] This simplifies to: [ f(x) = frac{1}{2}sin left(2x - frac{pi}{6}right) ] 2. **Determining the Domain and Range:** Given that the domain of f(x) is left[m, nright] (m < n), we can express the argument of the sine function in terms of m and n: [ 2x - frac{pi}{6} in left[2m - frac{pi}{6}, 2n - frac{pi}{6}right] ] Since the range of f(x) is given as left[-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{4}right], and knowing that the sine function oscillates between -1 and 1, we can deduce that the argument of the sine function must cover at least one full period to achieve the minimum and maximum values in the given range. 3. **Calculating the Minimum Value of n - m:** To cover the range left[-frac{1}{2}, frac{1}{4}right], the argument of the sine function, 2x - frac{pi}{6}, must span from its minimum to its maximum value within the domain. The minimum span that includes both the maximum and minimum values of the sine function is frac{2pi}{3}, which corresponds to a third of the sine function's period. Therefore, the minimum value of n - m is calculated as follows: [ n - m = frac{1}{2}left(2n - 2mright) = frac{1}{2}left(frac{2pi}{3}right) = frac{2pi}{3} ] Thus, the minimum value of n - m that satisfies the given conditions is boxed{frac{2pi}{3}}, which corresponds to option boxed{D}. **Analysis:** This problem required an understanding of trigonometric identities and properties of the sine function to simplify the given function and determine the minimum span of the domain that covers the specified range. The key steps involved simplifying the function using trigonometric identities and analyzing the function's range to deduce the minimum necessary domain span."}]`),W={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"search-container"},Y={class:"card-container"},H={key:0,class:"empty-state"},F=["disabled"],E={key:0},_={key:1};function D(n,e,h,m,o,s){const f=g("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",M,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",Y,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(a(),k(f,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",H,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
