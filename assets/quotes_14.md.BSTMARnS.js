You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer: The USA purchased Alaska in 1867 from which country?","output":"The United States of America purchased Alaska in 1867 from the Russian Empire. This historical event, known as the Alaska Purchase, took place during the tenure of U.S. Secretary of State, William H. Seward, during President Andrew Johnson's administration. The Russian Empire had experienced financial strains and was struggling to preserve and maintain its extensive territories. Facing an imminent threat of being possibly overpowered by the British Empire, which already had interests in the North American Pacific Coast, Russia decided to sell Alaska to the USA. This decision was driven by the belief that pitching the sale to the USA would be a strategic move to counter Britain and avoid engaging in a high-stakes military conflict. In this context, the Russian Tsar Alexander II initiated negotiations with the United States, which culminated in William H. Seward's agreement to purchase the vast territory for 7.2 million, an amount that equated to approximately two cents per acre. The treaty, signed on March 30, 1867, was largely facilitated by the Russian Minister to the United States, Eduard de Stoeckl. The Alaska Purchase was a subject of controversy and criticism in the United States at the time. Many detractors referred to the acquisition as \\"Seward's Folly\\" or \\"Seward's Icebox,\\" implying that the new territory was a colossal waste of resources. However, subsequent valuable discoveries of gold, timber, fish, and later, oil, proved these initial reactions to be short-sighted. Over time, Alaska's strategic geographical location proved to be advantageous for the United States, particularly during World War II and the Cold War. In January 3, 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a proclamation admitting Alaska as the 49th state of the United States of America. To sum up, the USA purchased Alaska in 1867 from the Russian Empire, in a historic agreement known as the Alaska Purchase. The decision to sell Alaska was mainly driven by Russia's willingness to counter Britain's influence and its own financial challenges. The acquisition turned out to be a valuable long-term investment for the United States, which benefitted not only from Alaska's abundant natural resources but also from its strategic geographical position."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Attach crochet thread to your crochet hook using a slipknot, then work up 21 chain stitches.  Check the \\"Tips\\" section for information on making slip knots and chain stitches. You can vary the length of this foundation chain, but make sure that your chains equal a number divisible by your intended groupings plus one. A standard grouping will be five stitches, so your chain count should be a multiple of five plus one extra: 21, 26, 31, 36, etc. The extra chain will be your turning chain. You won't work into it, so in essence, it only exists to make the edge of  the lace look smoother. Crochet thread will give your lace a light, delicate appearance. If you want to crochet thicker lace, though, you can use a lightweight or worsted weight yarn instead of thread. Keep in mind that a heavier yarn will require a larger crochet hook, as well. Insert the hook into the second chain from the hook, wrap the yarn over the hook, and draw the loop back through to the front of the stitch. Slide the tip of a knitting needle or dowel into this loop. The size of your knitting needle or dowel will determine how large your loops are and how big your rows will be. A larger circumference will create bigger lace rows. Draw up loose loops in the remaining 19 stitches of your foundation chain. Slide the needle across the chain and into each loop, gathering all 20 loops onto the handle of the needle at the same time. For each stitch, insert the hook into stitch, yarn over it, and draw a loop up through to the front. Insert the knitting needle into that loop before moving onto the next stitch. Slide your crochet needle underneath the first five loops. Make one chain stitch through the top of this grouping to close it. You can either remove the knitting needle as you work on your groupings or keep it in. Do whichever option feels easiest for you. Work five single crochets into the middle of all five loops in your grouping.  See the \\"Tips\\" section for instructions on single crocheting. Note that the number of single crochets you make will depend on the number of loops in your grouping. Five loops in your grouping means five single crochets; four loops in your grouping would mean four single crochets, and so on. This step completes your first grouping. Insert your hook through the next five loops, chain one, then single crochet through the centers five times.  Continue this step until you have created groupings for all of your original loops across the row. For a set of 20 loops, you will have four groupings. The single crochets you worked up in your first row will provide the base for your second row. Draw up loose loops from each of these single crochet stitches to start your second row, using the same technique used for the first row.  Insert the crochet hook through the stitch, yarn over, and pull the loop through to the front. Slide this loop onto the knitting needle before moving onto the next stitch. This row should have the same number of loops in it as your first row. As before, you need to gather the loops into groupings and single crochet into each grouping. Do this across the row until you run out of loops.  Insert your crochet hook into five loops, chain one, then single crochet five times into the middles of all the loops on your hook. Repeat across the row. Follow this same pattern to create as many rows of broomstick lace you need. Draw up loose loops from the stitches in the previous row and form groupings from those loops. When you reach the end of your lace piece, cut the yarn, leaving a 2-inch (5-cm) tail. Pull this tail through the loop on your hook to fasten off the crochet thread. Any remaining excess should be carefully woven into the back of the piece to hide it from sight and further secure the thread. Summary:","output":"This article teaches you how to make broomstick lace by creating chain stitches, forming loop groupings, and single crocheting them together using a crochet hook and a knitting needle or dowel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Boys' Life is the official youth magazine of the Boy Scouts of America, first published in 1911. It serves as a platform for the scouts to learn about outdoor activities, personal development, and citizenship. Boys' Life features a mix of adventure stories, comics, articles on scouting, hobbies, and sports. It has aimed to educate and entertain young boys for generations. Galaxy Science Fiction, on the other hand, was a popular American science fiction magazine first published in 1950. Its founding editor, H. L. Gold, intended it to be a magazine that showcased high-quality socio-political science fiction stories. Galaxy Science Fiction published works of many famous authors, such as Isaac Asimov, Ray Bradbury, and Frederik Pohl. It played a significant role in shaping American science fiction during the mid-20th century. Though the print run ceased in 1980, it later resurfaced as an online magazine.

Add 1868*t to both sides to eliminate the t term from the left side: -1868*t + 1868*t - 33748 = -334*t + 1868*t This results in: -33748 = 1534*t Step 3: Solve for t Now that we have isolated the variable term, we can solve for 't'.

Article: Many times when children make a mistake,starting with breaking a window while playing football or skipping classes and ending with stealing something or fighting with another child,parents are always blamed by the society for not having known how to educate their offsprings .The situation is not that easy to explain. Parents always look for the best interest of their children and many times they are ready to take measures only for their sake.They know their children are suffering when they are forced to stay indoors or when they have no money,but they have to teach them a lesson so that they won't repeat the same mistakes over and over again.When a child realizes that his father is talking seriously about him not being allowed to do something,he understands the seriousness of his deeds and he knows he will think twice before making the same mistake again. These are the cases of the responsible parents,who suffer when they see that their children are not happy but who resist the temptation of forgiving them so easily so that they realize the gravity of their actions not only at present but also in the future. On the other hand there are parents who always find excuses for their children's behavior,who never consider they make mistakes or if they just do what they call \\"childish\\" things. When you buy your children everything he has ever dreamt of or when you tell him he can wear a necklace even if he is only 13,he will become so spoiled that he won't take into consideration anything of what you are telling him later on.He will get to the point where he steals from the house or from a shop so that he can afford to buy cigarettes or drugs.

It refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive, and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness. In both incarnations of Madame White snake, the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful. Toyoo, her human lover in \\"Lust of the White Serpant\\" cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her, and finds himself \\"disturbed and agitated\\" by her \\"ethereal beauty\\". In \\"Eternal Prisoner,\\" Madame White Snake's bewitching beauty follows her lover Hsü into his dreams, and the next morning \\"he was so distracted that he could not concentrate on doing business.\\" Both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty, suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction. In addition to distracting sexuality, the irregular characterization of Madame White Snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale. In her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective, Christine Gledhill writes \\"Not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver, but the heroine's characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the [femme fatale] stereotype or not\\".

Scott Brown by a slight margin, a Public Policy Polling survey concluded Tuesday.      Brown, attempting to retain the seat he won in a 2010 special election against Attorney General Martha Coakley, is facing Democratic competition from Warren, Middleton immigration attorney Marisa DeFranco and corporate lawyer James Coyne King.      The poll of 936 Massachusetts voters conducted between March 16-18 showed Warren carrying a 5 percentage point lead over Brown, with 46 and 41 percent respective support. The poll, conducted by the Democratic polling company, has a 3.2 percent margin of error.      Several nonpartisan polls over the past month, including one conducted by Western New England University through a partnership with The Republican and MassLive, have showed Brown holding a solid lead over Warren.      This poll concluded that voters are split as to whether Brown is the independent voice for the Bay State he says he is with 41 percent saying he is and another 41 percent saying he is “a partisan voice for the national Republican Party.\\"      Warren's overall favorability rating sits at 46 percent with 33 percent holding an unfavorable view of her.      Brown's job approval was 45 percent with 42 percent of those surveyed saying they disapprove of what he is doing in the U.S. Senate.      Among voters according to party affiliation, Brown has 89 percent support from Republicans, 17 percent from Democrats and 48 percent of independents, the poll concluded. Warren's support came from 72 percent of Democrats, 36 percent of independents and three percent of Republicans.      “Scott Brown’s still strong with independents, but not nearly as strong as he was in 2010,” said Dean Debnam, president of Public Policy Polling in a statement. “Elizabeth Warren’s doing 20 points better with those voters than Martha Coakley did, and that’s why she has a small early lead in this race.”      And despite Republican attempts to paint Harvard University, Warren's place of employment, as elitist, the poll concluded that a majority of people have a favorable impression of the school. Of those asked, 57 percent said they have a positive impression of Harvard while only 19 percent said they hold an unfavorable view.      Public Policy Polling Mass.

A routing number consists of a five digit transit number (also called branch number) identifying the branch where an account is held and a three digit financial institution number corresponding to the financial institution. The number is given as one of the following forms, where XXXXX is the transit number and YYY is the financial institution number: Can we conclude that is the transit number the same as a routing number?","output":"No, we cannot conclude that the transit number is the same as a routing number, as these terms refer to different concepts within the banking system, although they are related and sometimes used interchangeably. It is important to distinguish between the two correctly to avoid confusion. Transit Number: The transit number, as you mentioned, is a five-digit number (also called a branch number) that identifies the specific branch where an account is held. This number is unique to a particular branch within the same bank and helps in streamlining transactions and operations. Transit numbers are used primarily within a country's banking system for domestic transactions, especially in countries like Canada. Routing Number: On the other hand, a routing number is a combination of a transit number and a financial institution number, which is typically a nine-digit code used in the United States and some other countries. It is used to identify a financial institution and its branch location to facilitate electronic funds' transfers, including wire transfers, ACH transfers (Automated Clearing House), direct deposits, bill payments, and other transactions. The routing number consists of two parts: 1. Transit Number (or Branch Number): As mentioned before, this is a five-digit code that identifies the specific branch of a financial institution where the account is held. 2. Financial Institution Number: This is a three-digit code that represents the financial institution or bank itself. In the U.S., routing numbers can also be found in the format XXXXYYYYZ, where XXXX is the Federal Reserve Routing Symbol, YYYY is the financial institution number, and Z is the check digit. The Federal Reserve Routing Symbol consists of a 4-digit code representing the Federal Reserve Bank district and the Federal Reserve Bank that serves the financial institution. To summarize, while the transit number forms a part of the routing number and is crucial in identifying a specific branch within a bank, it is not the same thing. The routing number provides a more comprehensive identification by including both the transit number and the financial institution number, allowing for smoother and error-free electronic transactions. So, it is essential to differentiate between these two numbers and use them only for their intended purpose within the banking system."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Sundance Film Festival has long been a platform for indie filmmakers to showcase their most unique and thought-provoking works. One such film that left a lasting impression in 2015 was \\"6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia\\" directed by Mark Cousins. A filmmaker known for his visually stimulating and experimental style, Cousins takes viewers on an exploration of the connection between D.H. Lawrence and the Mediterranean island. Body: :Discuss Cousins' approach to telling the story, which includes blending travelogue, literary analysis, and personal diary. :Analyze the primary source materials Cousins uses—the novel \\"Sea and Sardinia\\" and Lawrence's letters. :Describe the challenges the film faced, including disconnect between the viewers and the content, as well as the disjointed narrative. :Tease out the intended meaning of the film's title and how it relates to both Lawrence and Cousins. Cousins approaches the task of telling this story by employing a blend of travelogue, literary analysis, and streams of consciousness. The film is grounded in the primary source materials of Lawrence's novel \\"Sea and Sardinia\\" and his personal letters, which reveal a deeply personal and intimate connection with Sardinia. However, the film is not without its challenges. As Cousins dives headfirst into the thoughts and emotions of Lawrence during his time in Sardinia, the viewer must be prepared for a disjointed narrative. It's often difficult to connect to the film's subject matter, as the audience is left feeling that the true essence of the story lies hidden beneath layers of abstraction. The title of the film, \\"6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia,\\" is intended to reflect the six separate journeys undertaken by Lawrence and his wife, Frieda, during their stay on the island. As such, viewers might expect to find the same number of desires within each segment. However, what becomes clear is that the film's true focus is not only on Lawrence's encounters but also on Cousins' own personal journey. This duality serves to blur the lines between the characters, resulting in a more immersive experience for the audience. Conclusion: :Discuss the overall impact of the film and the emotions it evokes. :Describe how the film shines a light on the lesser-known aspect of Lawrence's life and work. :End with a nod to the unconventional filmmaking techniques employed by Cousins. Though it may leave some viewers feeling lost and struggling to engage with its content, \\"6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia\\" is ultimately a unique and thought-provoking exploration of the lesser-known aspects of one of the world's greatest literary figures. As with any experimental endeavor, some may question its merit or coherence, but the film remains a testament to the power of unconventional storytelling. Cousins' unconventional filmmaking, coupled with the beautiful and haunting imagery of Sardinia, invites viewers to reconsider the life and work of D.H. Lawrence through a new lens. Undoubtedly, \\"6 Desires: DH Lawrence and Sardinia\\" is a true Sundance standout, even if it leaves some viewers lost somewhere over The Rainbow."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A new study published today by the scientific journal Addiction shows that alcohol consumption of individuals appears to increase with the number of friends in their drinking group. The impact of drinking group size on alcohol use is stronger for men than women.      Most alcohol use among young people occurs in a social context, and peer substance use has long been established as an important predictor of alcohol and other substance use among youngsters. Past research suggests that the mere presence of others seems to have an effect on drinking behaviour, but most of those studies relied on data gathered from experiments performed in artificial laboratory settings or from surveys conducted after drinking sessions have ended, which are notoriously inaccurate.      This new study used internet-based questionnaires that study participants completed on their own smartphones to survey almost 200 young adult drinkers in Switzerland every hour while they were drinking in real-life situations, asking them to report the number of friends present and number of drinks they had consumed.      Results showed that as the number of friends present increased, so did the number of drinks an individual consumed per hour. This suggests that messages aimed at reducing risk among young drinkers should aim to combat this tendency. The arrival of more drinking buddies at the college bar on a Friday night may be cause for delight, but not necessarily a call for another round of drinks.      #      Addiction is a monthly international scientific journal publishing peer-reviewed research reports on alcohol, illicit drugs, tobacco, and gambling as well as editorials and other debate pieces. Owned by the Society for the Study of Addiction, it has been in continuous publication since 1884. Addiction is the number one journal in the 2013 ISI Journal Citation Reports Ranking in the Substance Abuse Category (Social Science Edition).

Doctors are seeing a growing number of cases of alcohol misuse among the elderly and this finding supports concerns that older people might be abusing alcohol.      Teenagers favour bouts of irregular heavy drinking episodes, only drinking once or twice a week, but as we grow older we shift into a regular drinking pattern. A substantial proportion of older men drink daily or most days of the week, while a majority of women tend to drink monthly or on special occasions.      In the UK, the majority of the adult population consume alcohol and the harm associated with alcohol affects all society. Lead author, Dr. Annie Britton, from University College London said \\"Understanding how drinking behaviour fluctuates throughout life is important to identify high risk groups and trends over time. Research on the health consequences of alcohol needs to incorporate changes in drinking behaviour over the life course. The current evidence base lacks this consideration. Failure to include such dynamics in alcohol is likely to lead to incorrect risk estimates.\\"      This is the first attempt to harmonise data on drinking behaviour from a wide range of population groups over their lifespan with repeated individual measures of consumption. The findings show how drinking behaviour changes over our lifetimes, from adolescence through to old age, and could be used to design public health initiatives and sensible drinking advice.      The researchers looked at both the average amount of alcohol consumed per week and the frequency of drinking. The findings were based on over 174,000 alcohol observations collected over a 34 year period, spanning from 1979 to 2013, from participants born in different eras.      Drinking patterns change more for men than for women, but both follow a similar pattern; a rapid increase in alcohol intake during adolescence leading to a peak in early adulthood, followed by a plateau in mid-life, and then a decline into older ages.      For men, mean consumption of alcohol rose sharply during adolescence, peaked at around 25 years at 20 units (160g) per week, roughly the equivalent of drinking 10 pints of beer. This declined and plateaued during mid-life, before dropping to 5-10 units, approximately 3-5 pints of beer per week, from around 60 years. Women followed a similar pattern, but reached a lower peak of around 7-8 units per week, around 4 pints of beer.      Previous studies linking alcohol consumption with associated harm typically used just one measure of alcohol intake. \\"We have shown that people change the way they consume alcohol as they age, and as such, studies reliant on a single measure of alcohol intake are likely to be biased. It is essential that the dynamic nature of exposure to alcohol over the life span is incorporated into the estimates of harm.\\"      #      Media Contact      Alanna Orpen      PR Assistant      BioMed Central      T: +44 (0)20 3192 2054      E: alanna.orpen@biomedcentral.com      Notes to editors      1.

New research shows how your social circle can affect your alcohol habits. (Photo: Getty Images)      Hitting the town this weekend? The bigger your posse, the more you’ll end up drinking, a new study suggests.      Results of a small study, published in the journal Addiction, show an association between the number of people present in the group while out on the weekend and the number of alcoholic beverages consumed in an hour.      The study included 183 young adults in Switzerland with an average age of 23, about half of whom were women. Researchers had them complete cell phone questionnaires on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday evenings over the course of five weekends. The questionnaires asked how much alcohol they consumed and the number of friends present at different hours of the evening (8 p.m, 9 p.m., 10 p.m., 11 p.m., and midnight).      Related: Which Is Healthier: Marijuana or Alcohol?      Number of friends present in the group seemed to decrease throughout the course of the night on Thursdays, stay stable throughout the course of the night on Fridays, and increase from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturdays. The average number of friends ranged from 1.9 to 6.4 for the men, and 1.8 to 5.7 for the women.      Overall, researchers found that the more friends present in the group, the more alcohol a person consumed (this effect was stronger for men than for women). Researchers also found that drinking pace accelerated as the evening went on, especially on Fridays and Saturdays. (The researchers posited this is due to the “school night” effect of Thursdays.)      “It appears that other factors, such as decreasing self-control as levels of inebriation increase or being increasingly involved in nightlife activities, such as dancing or playing drinking games, may be responsible for the acceleration in drinking pace,” the researchers write.      Related: Alcohol Poisoning Kills 6 Americans Daily: You’ll Be Surprised By Who      Even though the study was conducted only in French-speaking young adults in Switzerland, the researchers said the findings may still be generalizable to people of similar age elsewhere in the world (though they said more research is needed to confirm this). And since the study only looked at drinking at 8 p.m. and onward, more research is also needed to see how drinking earlier in the evening — also known as “pre-drinking” — could affect results.      Alcohol consumption is incredibly common among young adults, with some data suggesting more than three-quarters of people ages 21 to 24 are “current drinkers.” However, many young people drink more than health experts recommend — more than half of young men and more than two-fifths of young women drink more than the daily recommended limit (one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men).

Tropical Storm Manuel has swept onto Mexico's Pacific coast while Hurricane Ingrid swirls offshore on the other side of the country, and heavy rains and landslides caused at least 24 deaths and led authorities to evacuate thousands. Stormy conditions led some communities in affected states to cancel Independence Day celebrations planned for Sunday and Monday. The U.S. National Hurricane Center said Manuel began to weaken as soon as it made landfall near the port of Manzanillo on Sunday afternoon, but remains a threat to produce flash floods and mudslides. It is predicted to dissipate by Monday. Scroll down for video. Torrential: A couple wades in a flooded street in Acapulco following tropical storm Manuel which landed on the Pacific coast of Mexico on September 15. Destruction: Residents try to repair a broken bridge in Chilpancingo, Guerrero state, Mexico following the passage of Tropical Storm Manuel on September 15. Evacuated: Inhabitants leave an area affected by floodings of Guamol river at Itsmo de Tehuantepec, Oaxaca, Mexico. In the southern coastal state of Guerrero, authorities said a landslide on the outskirts of Acapulco buried a house and killed six family members. Three people were swept to their deaths by a river, also on the edge of the resort city. A collapsing wall killed one person in the city. Elsewhere in Guerrero, six people died when their pickup truck skidded on a rain-swept highway in the mountains, and landslides killed two more people. The rains caused some rivers to overflow, damaging hundreds of homes and disrupting communications for several hours. Manuel had maximum sustained winds of about 40mph (65kph) and was moving to the northwest at 9mph (15kph) late Sunday afternoon. Its center was about 35 miles (60 kilometers) northwest of Manzanillo. Man power: Army soldiers work to pull their vehicle out of a flooded portion of road caused by Tropical Storm Manuel in the city of Chilpancingo, Mexico on Sunday. Rains from Ingrid caused landslides that killed three people in the central state of Puebla, and a woman died when a landslide buried her house in Hidalgo state. In the southern state of Oaxaca, which was affected by both storms, authorities said a child died after being swept away by a swollen river and a teenager was killed by a landslide. The hurricane center said Ingrid, the second hurricane of the Atlantic storm season, could reach the Mexican mainland by Monday morning. Manuel was expected to dump 10 to 15 inches of rain over parts of Guerrero and Michoacan state, with maximums of 25 inches possible in some isolated areas. Authorities said those rains would present an especially dangerous threat in mountains, where flash floods and mudslides were possible. Extreme weather: Rain water pours into the beach due to heavy rains caused by Tropical Storm Manuel. Mayhem: A car lies on its side after a portion of a hill collapsed due to heavy rains in the Pacific resort city of Acapulco. Helpless: Mexican marines carry an elderly woman to a shelter after her home was flooded by rains caused by tropical storm Manuel. Ingrid also was expected to dump very heavy rains. It had maximum sustained winds of 75mph (120 kph) and was centered about 125 miles (200 kilometers) east-northeast of the port city of Tampico as it moved northwest at 3mph (6kph). A hurricane warning was in effect from Cabo Rojo to La Pesca. From all angles: This image taken Sunday at 2:45am EDT shows Hurricane Ingrid in the Gulf of Mexico approaching the coast and Tropical Storm Manuel just off the western coast of Mexico. In Tamaulipas state to the north, where Ingrid was expected to come ashore, the government said in a statement that Independence Day festivities were cancelled in the cities of Tampico, Madero and Altamira. The September 15 and 16 celebrations commemorate Mexico's battle of independence from Spain. Officials in the Gulf state of Veracruz began evacuating coastal residents Friday night, and civil protection authorities said more than 6,600 people have been moved to shelters or the homes of family and friends. More than 1,000 homes in Veracruz state had been affected by the storm to varying degrees, and 20 highways and 12 bridges had damage, the state's civil protection authority said. A bridge collapsed near the northern Veracruz city of Misantla on Friday, cutting off the area from the state capital, Xalapa. A week ago, 13 people died in the state when a landslide buried their homes in heavy rains spawned by Tropical Depression Fernand. Officials in Tamaulipas state said 700 people have been evacuated from coastal communities.

(CNN)  -- Argentina's star-studded line-up began their World Cup campaign with a 1-0 victory over Nigeria in their Group B opener in Johannesburg on Saturday. A goal from defender Gabriel Heinze after six minutes was all that separated the two teams after an inspired display from Nigeria goalkeeper Vincent Enyeama. But South Korea ended the day on top of the group following a 2-0 victory over Greece in Port Elizabeth earlier on Saturday. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung gave the 2002 semifinalists a comfortable win over the 2008 European cvhampions. Argentina 1-0 Nigeria. Enyeama could do little to stop Heinze's powerful early header from a Juan Sebastian Veron corner, but he kept his team alive with a string of acrobatic saves to deny World Player of the Year Lionel Messi. Diego Maradona was delighted to secure his first victory as a World Cup coach, but critical of his strikers for failing to make the game safe. \\"When you don't kill things off in front of goal you can pay a heavy price. They almost got a draw -- we missed loads of chances,\\" Maradona told AFP. \\"Players such as Leo Messi and Higuain knocked in around 60 goals last season between them, yet today it was almost as if they couldn't set their sights on goal. \\"But the win means we can be calm -- we are in the right track.\\" Enyeama's tip over from a Messi shot led to the early corner from which the unmarked Heinze scored to spark scenes of wild celebration on the Argentina bench, led by Maradona. Messi and Gonzalo Higuain might both have had hat-tricks as Argentina's attacking flair was evident, but at the other end Nigeria also had opportunities to salvage a point. Midway through the second half, Taye Taiwo found space to toe-poke a shot from the edge of the area which went just wide of Sergio Romero's left-hand post. CNN's World Cup twitter.buzz. As the clock ticked down, Enyeama blocked Messi as he looked certain to score but in a swift counter attack Nigeria then had their best chance of the match as Aiyegbeni Yakubu crossed from the right and Kala Uche made a hash of his volleyed attempt from 10 meters out. At the final whistle it was a deserved victory for Argentina, but they will face a sterner test in their next match in five days' time against South Korea. Nigeria, who have lost five and drawn once since their last World Cup finals victory in 1998, will be looking to break that winless run against the Greeks, who also have a poor record in football's global showpiece. South Korea 2-0 Greece. Goals from Lee Jung-Soo and Park Ji-Sung earned South Korea a comfortable 2-0 win against a poor Greek side, who never looked like getting on the score sheet. Central defender Lee opened the scoring in the seventh minute, volleying home from close range from a well directed free-kick delivered by Ki Sung-Yong. South Korea should have gone 2-0 up after 23 minutes when Monaco striker Park Chu-Young was sent through on goal by a defense-splitting pass from the boot of Park Ji-Sung, but goalkeeper Alexandros Tzorvas saved to send the ball onto the roof of the net. The second half carried on where the first finished off, and it was no surprise when Park Ji-Sung added a second goal after 52 minutes. Latching on to a mistake made by Loukas Vyntra, the Manchester United midfielder swept forward into the penalty area before coolly slotting past a helpless Tzorvas. The goal did seem to finally wake Greece from their slumber, and striker Theofanis Gekas forced a fine save from Jung Sung Ryon in the 80th minute, but it was a rare moment of skill in a woeful display. Moments later, Lee Chung-Young nearly added a third for South Korea at the other end. The result means Greece continue their winless World Cup finals record.

With these objectives in mind, let's analyze each option: A. Office: While placing the floor lamp in the office could be a suitable choice, it does not necessarily guarantee that it will be out of the way. Depending on the size and layout of the office, the lamp could still obstruct the room's flow or take up valuable space. B. Desktop: Placing the floor lamp on a desktop is an impractical option. Floor lamps are typically tall and meant to stand on the ground rather than elevated surfaces like a desktop. This may not only be an inefficient use of space but could also pose a safety hazard. C. Corner: Corners are often the ideal location for placing floor lamps. They provide a discrete area that is out of the way while ensuring that the light shines evenly across the room. Additionally, corners typically do not obstruct pathways or clutter valuable floor space. D. Next to the bed: Although placing a lamp next to the bed might be a convenient option for reading or illuminating the bedside, it does not guarantee that the lamp is adequately out of the way.

Carlos Condit explains why he returned to fight Demian Maia after hinting at retirement It was less than nine months ago that Carlos Condit was contemplating retirement after dropping a very close split decision to former welterweight champion Robbie Lawler at UFC 195. In the days following the loss, Condit spoke honestly about the long-term damage fighting inflicts on an athlete's mind and body, especially considering he's been competing professionally for more than 13 years with nearly 40 fights on his record. As recently as June, Condit stated that it would probably take a rematch with Lawler or a second bout with former foe Nick Diaz to get him committed to even taking another fight inside the Octagon. So when Condit was announced as the opponent for Demian Maia in the main event for FOX UFC Fight Night this Saturday in Vancouver it came as a shock to many, especially considering how close he seemed to calling it a career just a few months earlier. \\"It is a number of things, but Demian Maia for all intents and purposes is definitely a contender,\\" Condit said when explaining to FOX Sports why he decided to take this fight. \\"I feel like if his style was a little more exciting, he would definitely be the No. 1 contender with all the wins that he has and the guys that he's beaten. \\"So I feel like — no, I don't feel like, I know — this is basically a No. 1 contender eliminator, which kind of doesn't mean a whole lot these days because people are coming and jumping in line and whatever. But I think beating Demian without a doubt gives me legitimacy to give me another title shot very quickly.\\" As much as Condit hinted at retirement after the loss to Lawler, the one thing he makes clear ahead of his return to action is that he never actually lost the desire to fight again. Condit still loves the feeling of stepping into the cage and dueling with another human being in the ultimate form of combat, but he also understands that there will come a day when it's time to walk away. In Condit's mind, he'd prefer to make that decision than to have that decision made for him. \\"It never really went away. I still have it,\\" Condit said about the fire that fuels him to fight. My thoughts on this are I want to be done with the sport before the sport is done with me. I want to quit with a little bit of fire left. I don't want to be just doing this and going through the motions. While Condit never truly closed the door on fighting again, he did seem resigned to sit out the rest of 2016 to focus on some family commitments like the birth of his new baby that's due in September. But when UFC president Dana White came calling with this opportunity and a fight that could put him back into the Octagon with the welterweight title on the line, Condit just couldn't resist. \\"As far as the timing, it was kind of out of left field,\\" Condit explained. \\"I got a call from Dana (White) and he wanted me to do this fight late summer and I wasn't planning on fighting until January. I've got a new baby going to be born in September so I was going to kick back and wait to fight until after that, but it also kind of made sense to go ahead and get a fight out of the way right before the baby's born so I don't have to worry about doing another camp for a while and just focus on my family.\\" Condit knew when he got offered the fight with Maia he knew this could possibly be the toughest stylistic matchup he could face in the UFC right now. Maia is a superb grappler, who rarely looks to engage with an opponent on the feet and instead prefers to drag them to the mat where he can apply his world-class Brazilian jiu-jitsu skills. Fellow welterweight Matt Brown recently found out as a knockout striker just how tough it can be to even land a shot on Maia after the Brazilian wrapped him up like a boa constrictor for three rounds before earning the submission win in the final moments of the bout. On paper, Condit knows that Maia is probably the worst possible fighter for him to face while searching for his signature highlight reel knockout, but that's exactly why this was the perfect matchup to prove he deserves another shot at the gold. \\"He is a stylistic nightmare for a lot of guys, even good grapplers. Because he's just so good in that realm. Hey, if I could get an easier stylistic matchup to get to the No. 1 contender's spot, hell yeah, I'd definitely want to go that route. But it's Demian Maia who they wanted me to fight and I'm excited to try and solve this puzzle,\\" Condit said. \\"I know I have the tools to beat him. If I do the things I've trained how to do, I know I'm going to beat Demian Maia.\\" With five rounds and 25 minutes to work, Condit knows he'll eventually find a home for the perfect punch or a flying knee or any of the other combination of strikes he'll use to finally earn the knockout on Saturday night. Whether it's in the first minute or the last, Condit plans on finishing Maia and sending a strong message to the rest of the welterweight division that \\"The Natural Born Killer\\" is back and he's gunning for gold. \\"Without a doubt. It depends on how I win and I plan on winning in spectacular fashion,\\" Condit said. \\"That's how it's going to go down. Everybody knows that I'm one of the best. I can beat anybody on any night. \\"I'm not going anywhere and I feel like I'm only getting better. I plan on showing that on August 27.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text mainly revolve around Carlos Condit's decision to return to fighting and his upcoming match against Demian Maia. Key points include: 1. Carlos Condit's contemplation of retirement after losing a close split decision to Robbie Lawler at UFC 195, and his concerns about the long-term damage fighting can inflict on an athlete's body and mind. 2.

Now comes President Obama in his State of the Union Address, hoping to do more than just talk about it. The President tackles this perennial conundrum by proposing that the tax code be changed in two very distinct directions: 1) Provide extra money to low- and middle-income families in the form of tax credits for children and working couples. 2) raise taxes on upper-income taxpayers, especially the fabled \\"one percent\\" through various cutbacks and increased restrictions on savings. It is certainly easy to dismiss his suggestions given the makeup of the new Congress, which is controlled by Republicans, but stranger concoctions have been enacted when major tax overhauls are undertaken. So what does the President suggest? In any case, the \\"step-up in basis\\" rule was effectively repealed in 1976, but OPTIONS: - CNN then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - Congress then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - Obama then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - Republicans then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - Richard Kaplan then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. - State of the Union Address then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively.","output":"The \\"step-up in basis\\" rule fundamentally adjusts the baseline value, or 'basis', of an inherited property or asset for tax purposes. Prior to 1976, the rule underwent an effective repeal. However, this situation was short-lived as Congress then responded to the ensuing backlash by reversing this repeal retroactively. The step-up in basis rule is pivotal because it directly impacts the capital gains tax incurred when an inherited asset or property is sold. Specifically, it 'steps up' the asset's basis value to its market value at the time of the prior owner's death. From a tax perspective, this means that heirs only pay capital gains tax on the asset's appreciation after they've inherited it, not from the time the original owner acquired it. Without the step-up in basis rule, the cost basis of an asset stays locked at its original purchase price. Consequently, without this rule, heirs would be liable to pay taxes on the full increase in value from the original purchase price to its sale price, potentially resulting in substantial capital gains tax liabilities. Therefore, the retroactive reversal of its repeal by Congress in 1976 was a momentous decision. In the situation given, President Obama's intention was to address income inequality through a reevaluation of the tax code. His proposal had two main thrusts: to provide lower and middle-income families with additional funds via tax credits, and to increase taxes on high-income taxpayers, specifically the renowned one percent, via cutbacks and enhanced limitations on savings. This strategy aimed to re-distribute wealth and thus reduce income disparity. Raising taxes on the upper echelons of society, however, is typically met with resistance, particularly in a Republican-controlled Congress, making it challenging to pass such legislation. Despite this, precedent suggests that major tax reforms have been accomplished under unlikely conditions. Thus, Obama's proposal may not have been an impossibility. Considering these complexities, the president's proposition, and Congress's past responses to taxation policies such as the step-up in basis rule, show the intricate interplay between attempts to address income inequality and the political context within they are proposed and potentially enacted. In the future, it will be crucial to continuously evaluate the tax system and make adjustments as necessary to ensure it supports broader fiscal policy goals, including those related to income inequality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: A shifting South Bend forecast Tommy Rees turned 18 on May 22, which means he should be focused on the nuances of shaving. Instead, late Saturday afternoon, he will be carrying the hopes of millions of people, many whose last names begin with a capital O and an apostrophe. He will be in hostile territory, in a marvelous old stadium whose name conjures up images of lions chasing Christians. He will have thousands there in person yelling for him, and many thousands more yelling against him. A national telecast makes that millions. Rees is Notre Dame's quarterback. If this is how youth is served, let us pray for youth. Rees was nine years from being born when Notre Dame began its 11-game winning streak in its cherished rivalry with USC in 1983. He was 9 years old the last time the Fighting Irish actually won a fight on the football field with the Trojans. That was 2001, nine seasons and four coaches ago. Where have you gone, Bob Davie? A nation of desperate Irish fans turns its lonely eyes to you. The enormity of the situation might be too much to comprehend for somebody Rees' age. Notre Dame-USC is not a football game, it's a head-on collision. It thrives in the tradition of Knute Rockne's Gipper speeches and John McKay's one-liners. Its imagery pits the hard winters of the Midwest against the eternal summers of Hollywood. It matches guys who drive tractors against guys who drive convertibles. Opposites are supposed to attract. These opposites attack. Sports love rivalries, and this has been a passion for 84 years. Of course, in recent years, Pete Carroll made the game more like somebody giving a timeout to a 5-year-old. The biology students in blue and gold would take the field and get their horn-rimmed glasses broken. Carroll's teams were always too big, fast and good for the offerings of Tyrone Willingham and Charlie Weis, who left Notre Dame with, for Irish fans, the worst asterisk imaginable next to their records: *Never Beat USC. Now Carroll is gone, USC is without its usual NFL ranking, and some are even giving the Fighting Irish a fighting chance. Into this convergence of alumni hopes and dreams, clashing story lines and university aspirations steps Rees. He is three games into his stewardship of his team, having taken over for an injured Dayne Crist three weeks ago early in the game against Tulsa and solidifying his spot in victories over Utah and Army. Summary:","output":"Tommy Rees, an 18-year-old Notre Dame quarterback, will be carrying the hopes of millions of fans in a game against USC, marking the latest face-off in a longstanding rivalry between the two football teams.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Democrats now critical of Rice's Benghazi explanation, amid more damaging evidence Congressional Democrats on Sunday distanced themselves from the Obama administration’s explanation of the Benghazi, Libya, attacks in the immediate aftermath of the fatal strikes, amid mounting evidence that suggests the information was revised to intentionally mislead Americans. The original explanation of the Sept. 11, 2012, attacks on the U.S. outpost in Benghazi, Libya, was written by CIA officials, then revised by State Department and White House officials, according to news reports and witness testimony made available to Fox News. Removed from the CIA's so-called talking points were references to “Islamic extremists” and Al Qaeda in Libya. And five days later, Susan Rice, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, made the Sunday talk show rounds to say the attacks were “demonstrations” sparked by protests in Egypt over an anti-Islamic video on YouTube. However, the video is never mentioned in the numerous talking-points drafts, according to a Weekly Standard story last week, based in part on a 43-page House report and records of official emails. “Well, it was scrubbed,” Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Steve Lynch told “Fox News Sunday.” “It was totally inaccurate. There's no excuse for that. It was false information. And what they try to do is harmonize what happened in Benghazi with what happened everywhere else across the Middle East.” Lynch also acknowledged the talking points were likely revised to reflect President Obama’s decry – with his re-election bid in the balance -- that “Al Qaeda is on the run.” Maryland Democratic Rep. Dutch Ruppersberger, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, also acknowledged Sunday the facts as told by Rice were wrong. “At the time, as it turns out” the information was incorrect, he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation” Ruppersberger, who was briefed by the CIA about the attacks in immediate aftermath, asked agency officials what congressional leaders could tell the public, according to The Weekly Standard story. On Sunday, he also said he welcomes a House Oversight and Government Affairs Committee hearing this week in which Greg Hicks, the deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Libya at the time of attacks, is expected to say Rice said the attacks didn’t appear to be “pre-meditated or pre-planned,” despite having information suggesting they were. “That's what an investigation is about,” Ruppersberger told CBS. “Let's get the facts.”","output":"Congressional Democrats have become critical of the Obama administration's explanation of the Benghazi, Libya attacks in 2012, amid evidence suggesting the information was revised to mislead Americans.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health. What can we learn from the text? A) Eating fatty food has immediate effects on your heart. B) The EPA conducted many studies on air quality. C) Moderate air quality is more harmful than smoking, D) Stricter regulations on pollutants should be made.

In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

The NAACP argued that although schools were not legally segregated, the city of Detroit and its surrounding counties had enacted policies to maintain racial segregation in public schools. The NAACP also suggested a direct relationship between unfair housing practices and educational segregation, which followed segregated neighborhoods. The District Court held all levels of government accountable for the segregation in its ruling.

Article:","output":"Title: A Fun Guide to Understanding Regulations Hi there, little friend! Today, we are going to learn about regulations. Regulations are like rules that help us know what to do and how to do things the right way. We can find these regulations in big books called the Code of Federal Regulations (or CFR for short). The CFR can help us learn about the rules that are important for many things, like the environment, health, and safety. Now, let's say you found a really cool regulation while exploring the pages of a CFR book and you want to share it with your friends. But how do you tell your friends where to find this regulation? Well, that's where we come in to help. First, start by telling them the name of the regulation. This is like the title of your favorite storybook. This is important because it will help them find the right regulation easily. Next, tell them the CFR title number and the year when the regulation was published. The CFR title number is like the number on the spine of your storybook. The year of publication is like when you first got your favorite storybook. Together, they help your friends know which book to look for and when it was made. Now, you also need to tell them the page numbers where the regulation appears. Just like you tell your friends which page to find your favorite picture in your storybook, this will help your friends know where to find the regulation when they open the book. But, what if your friends don't have the big CFR book? No worries! You can give them a direct URL (like a magic address that takes them to the right place on the internet). This way, they can look at the regulation online! One last thing, remember when you're writing down this information, use commas (,) instead of periods (.) in footnotes. Footnotes are little notes at the bottom of a page that give extra information. Here's an example: \\"Super Cool Regulation, Title 5, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 890, 2019, pp. 200-205, www.supercoolregulationwebsite.com\\" Remember, when you find a cool regulation and want to share it with your friends, follow these steps: tell them the title, title number and year, page numbers, and the URL. And don't forget to use commas in your footnotes! Now you're all set to help your friends explore and learn about the world of regulations. Keep reading, asking questions, and learning more.

Question: suppose Bread is left out in the elements happens, how will it affect Bread is exposed to the air.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"A detailed analysis of the effects of bread being exposed to the elements can be observed through various steps. Let's first discuss each of the mentioned factors and their impacts before discussing the overall effect on bread being exposed to the air. 1. Bread is exposed to the elements: When bread is left out in the open, it becomes exposed to various environmental factors such as air, water vapor, temperature changes, and dust particles. These elements can directly influence the quality and shelf life of the bread. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air: As the bread is exposed to the elements, it starts absorbing water from the air. The water is absorbed by the bread crumbs, making it softer over time. This process is known as hygroscopicity. If the bread gets too moist, it could become a breeding ground for bacteria and fungi, leading to spoilage and mold growth. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: Bread absorbs warmth from its surroundings, which can accelerate the various chemical reactions happening within the bread, resulting in the degradation of its quality. The warmth also plays a significant role in providing a conducive environment for mold growth as most molds thrive in warm conditions. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: Dust particles containing mold spores can fall on the bread exposed to the elements. These mold spores can be carried through the air or come from nearby surfaces. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: As the mold spores come in contact with the bread, they begin to consume the nutrients present in the bread and use them as a source of energy for their growth. This process further contributes to the quick spoilage of the bread. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: Over time, the mold colonies will grow in size and multiply, resulting in visible mold spots on the surfaces of the bread. Now, let's address the effect of the supposed perturbation (bread being left out in the elements) on the second factor mentioned (bread absorbing water from the air). When bread is left out in the elements and exposed to the air, the effect on bread absorbing water from the air is increased. This is because the bread gets subjected to varying levels of humidity present in the surroundings. As the humidity levels change, the bread absorbs more or less water, depending on the amount of moisture in the air. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation (bread being left out in the elements) has a direct and significant effect on the second effect, which is bread absorbing water from the air. The increased exposure to the elements leads to an increase in the rate at which the bread absorbs moisture from the air, which accelerates the spoilage process and the growth of mold."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 1: How good is China's communism? Question 2: How bad is China's communism? Select from the following. a. no b. yes Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"China's communism is an interesting and complex system, with both positive and negative aspects. This answer will fully explore both the advantages and the drawbacks. Question 1: How good is China's communism? China's communist system has been in place since 1949, when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) led by Mao Zedong came to power. Throughout this period, China's communist system has evolved and gone through numerous transformations, which has had both positive and negative impacts on the country. Pros of China's communism: 1. Economic Growth: Under communist rule, China has experienced tremendous economic growth. It is now the world's second-largest economy and has lifted millions of people out of poverty in the past few decades. Centralized economic planning and state-owned enterprises have driven this growth. 2. Infrastructure Development: The Chinese government has overseen the rapid development of infrastructure projects, such as building roads, highways, bridges, high-speed railways, and airports, which has greatly improved accessibility within the country and helped expand its economic potential. 3. Healthcare and Education: China's communist system has allowed for the establishment of state-funded healthcare and education systems. This has improved access to these services for the majority of the population, raising literacy rates and contributing to the country's better overall health. Question 2: How bad is China's communism? Despite some achievements, China's communist system also has several shortcomings and negative aspects: Cons of China's communism: 1. Human Rights Violations: China's communist regime has been criticized for its strict control over various aspects of citizens' lives, leading to several human rights violations. Censorship and persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, as well as the detention of political dissidents, are evidence of this. 2. Lack of Political Freedom: Under its communist system, China has a single-party rule, which means that there is no room for opposition. Citizens don't have the right to elect their leaders or influence government policies, which can make the government less accountable and transparent. 3. Income Inequality: Despite the economic advances, income inequality in China has substantially increased, which has created a wide gap between the wealthy and the poor. While the communist ideology focuses on equality and wealth redistribution, the reality in China contradicts these principles. 4. Environmental Degradation: China's rapid industrialization and urbanization have led to severe environmental problems. Air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination, and deforestation caused by the communist government's focus on rapid economic growth have had detrimental effects on the country's environment and public health. As for the \\"Select from the following. a. no b. yes\\", the answer to these two questions wouldn't be the same since the first question focuses on the achievements and strong points of China's communism, while the second question addresses the system's drawbacks and negative aspects."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Kentucky... (Associated Press)      Anthony Davis and top-seeded Kentucky will play for the national title Monday night after finally putting away pesky Louisville 69-61 in the Final Four on Saturday night.      It will be Kentucky's first appearance in the title game since winning a seventh NCAA crown back in 1998 and gives coach John Calipari another shot at the title that has eluded him. The Wildcats (37-2) will face the winner of Kansas-Ohio State.      As the final seconds ticked down, Davis pointed to the court and screamed twice \\"This is my stage!\\"      Yes, yes, it is.      With Davis, everybody's player of the year, leading a star-studded roster, Kentucky was the top seed in the tournament and the heavy favorite to cut down the nets when the whole tournament was done. And Calipari wouldn't let his young players consider anything else, saying repeatedly this was \\"just another game.\\"      But playing in-state rival Louisville (30-10) is never just that, and the Cardinals made Kentucky work deep into the second half to grind this victory out.      Louisville outrebounded Kentucky 40-33, including a whopping 19-6 advantage on the offensive glass _ the sole reason the Cardinals were able to make a game of this.      \\"I just said John, \`I'll be pulling for you, bring the trophy back home to Kentucky,'\\" Louisville coach Rick Pitino said. \\"Sometimes there's a lot of talk about these guys fighting, dialysis, there's also really a lot of people that get along. ... For those that have brains, they root for each other.      \\"We like their basketball team; we hope they bring it home for the state.\\"      Bigger, bulkier and with the 19-year-old freshman Davis having a wider wingspan than some small airplanes, the Wildcats looked like playground bullies as they pushed Louisville around on their way to a 13-point lead early in the second half. But the Cardinals know a thing about rallies after coming from 11 points down to beat Florida in last weekend's West Regional final, and they sure made Kentucky sweat.      Russ Smith made back-to-back buckets to start a 15-3 run, and Peyton Siva capped it with a 3-pointer from NBA range that tied the game at 49 with 9:11 to play. But Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, who played just 23 minutes because of foul trouble, made back-to-back buckets to give the Wildcats some breathing room.      After Siva made a pair of free throws, Terrence Jones scored on a jumper and Darius Miller drilled a 3 _ only Kentucky's second of the game _ to give the Wildcats control for good.      \\"I'm proud of this team. They're coming together,\\" Calipari said. \\"They've taken on shots and runs like Louisville did today, and they've held their own, so I'm proud of them.\\"      Just to make sure Louisville didn't get any wild notions about another late comeback, Kidd-Gilchrist threw down a monstrous dunk with 1:05 to play that had Kentucky fans on their feet and assistant coaches from Kansas and Ohio State scrambling to try and find a way to stop this juggernaut.      Kentucky shot a dazzling 57 percent _ yes, that's right _ with Davis leading the way. He missed just one of his eight shots and finished with 18 points and 14 rebounds. Miller added 13 points, and Doron Lamb had 10. Kidd-Gilchrist had nine, all in the second half.      \\"We're one game closer to our dream and our goals,\\" Davis said.      Siva led the Cardinals with 11 points, and Gorgui Dieng had 12 rebounds.      The Kentucky-Louisville rivalry caused tempers to flare even in December when, in the grand scheme of things, games really don't mean much. Heck, it took government intervention just to get the two schools to play on a regular basis back in the 1980s.      With the NCAA title game on the line, the latest skirmish in basketball's version of the civil war so divided the small hoop-crazed state that senior citizens actually came to fisticuffs and made for must-see TV. The game was such a big deal that No. 1 Kentucky fan Ashley Judd wasn't even the biggest celeb in the house, with Jay-Z taking a prime seat behind the Kentucky bench.      \\"It's our fans; our fans are great to us,\\" Davis said. \\"Our fans travel a long way. We want to go out here and give them a show and give them what they want, which is a national championship.\\"      Bragging rights in the state is sure a nice way to start.      Kentucky is 19-11 since the teams resumed playing in 1983-84, with the Wildcats winning four straight, including a 69-62 victory at Rupp Arena on Dec. 31 _ almost the exact score as Saturday night's win.      \\"They made runs, and we made our runs. That's what coach always says,\\" Jones said. \\"We never get rattled.\\"      The Wildcats know they're talented _ there are three, maybe as many as five NBA lottery picks on the Kentucky roster _ but they play without ego or cockiness, choosing instead to let their superior play overwhelm their opponents.      That was certainly the case with Louisville.      The Cardinals had skidded into the Big East tournament with four losses in their last six games, including back-to-back defeats to end the regular season. Pitino told his players they could either go home after the first week of the tournament or they could do something special, their choice.      The Cardinals chose the latter, ripping off four wins in four days to win the Big East tournament and ousting No. 1 seed Michigan State in the West Regional semifinals. Then came that comeback against rough-and-tumble Florida.      Those games hardened the Cardinals, and they promised they weren't simply happy to reach the Final Four. But they sure looked it early on, getting off to a slow, sloppy start. It didn't help that Dieng looked petrified of Davis and Siva was playing at hyperspeed, a pace Pitino has been trying to get him to tone down all year.      When they tried to go inside, Davis was less forgiving than a bouncer at a Hollywood club. When the Cardinals went outside, the Wildcats swarmed and forced them to take off-balance shots. Meanwhile, on the other end, Kentucky scored at will, repeatedly picking on Siva and Dieng.      But there's a reason Pitino has taken three teams to the Final Four. He pulled out every trick he had, switching strategies, begging the refs for calls and finding a way _ finally _ to calm his team down.      \`'Any time you don't know whether a team is better offensively or defensively, you know you've got a great basketball team,\\" Pitino said. \\"And Anthony Davis is incredible.\\" ||||| Same story, new night for Kansas.

(Associated Press)      Tyshawn Taylor made two big free throws late, and Thomas Robinson finished with 19 points and eight rebounds Saturday night to lift the Jayhawks to a come-from-behind 64-62 win over Ohio State in the Final Four _ a game Kansas led for a grand total of 3 minutes, 48 seconds.      After scoring the first bucket, Kansas didn't lead again until Travis Releford made two free throws with 2:48 left. That lasted for 11 seconds, but the Jayhawks (32-6), who trailed by as many as 13, overcame another deficit and finally held on against the Buckeyes (31-8).      The game played out sort of the way the whole season has in Lawrence.      Early in the year, coach Bill Self wondered if this team was even tournament material. The Jayhawks trailed most of the night against Purdue in the regional semifinals and were no better than North Carolina for most of the next game.      One win. Then another. This latest one came on the biggest stage _ in the Superdome.

Each element of the phrase sheds light on different aspects of the sentiment being communicated. Let's break down each part to better understand the overall sentiment: 1. Heavy-handed: This term implies that an action or behavior has been carried out in a forceful, clumsy, or overly assertive manner. It can also indicate a lack of sensitivity and subtlety in dealing with a delicate or significant subject. In the context of a sentiment, \\"heavy-handed\\" would suggest that the expressed emotion or opinion is overly forceful, possibly to the point that it comes across as too intense, pushy, or lacking in tact. 2. Phoney-feeling: The term \\"phoney\\" is derived from the word \\"phony,\\" which suggests something false, counterfeit, or inauthentic. By describing a sentiment as \\"phoney-feeling,\\" the speaker implies that the expressed emotion or opinion comes across as insincere or fake. Essentially, this portion of the phrase suggests that the sentiment is not genuine and may be seen as an attempt to manipulate or deceive others. 3. Sentiment: In general, sentiment refers to a personal feeling, emotion, or opinion, often influenced by an individual's personality, experiences, or values. In the context of the given phrase, \\"heavy-handed phoney-feeling sentiment\\" indicates that the sentiment being expressed or discussed is somehow flawed in its intensity, sincerity, or authenticity, which would create a negative perception of the sentiment as a whole.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of general climate change has a direct and indirect effect on the process. Climate change can exacerbate the intensity and frequency of forest fires, which leads to a greater loss of habitat for animals. The loss of habitat forces animals to search for shelter and resources in an increasingly limited area, potentially leading to greater competition for resources, higher predation rates, and higher stress levels. Warmer waters due to climate change can also negatively impact fish populations, as they may struggle to adapt to changing temperatures and face challenges with finding food and shelter.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If \\"The trailer is white\\", can we conclude \\"The trailer is not all black.\\"?","output":"Yes, if \\"The trailer is white,\\" we can logically conclude that \\"The trailer is not all black.\\" This conclusion is derived from the understanding and definition of colors, specifically how white and black are opposites on the color spectrum. Colors are the result of the wavelengths of light that are reflected, absorbed, or transmitted by objects. When an object appears to be a specific color, it is because the object reflects that particular color's wavelengths and absorbs the others. In the case of white, all visible wavelengths of light are being reflected, while in the case of black, all visible wavelengths of light are being absorbed. Given that white and black represent opposite ends of the color spectrum, it is impossible for an object, in this case, a trailer, to be both entirely white and entirely black simultaneously. When the statement \\"The trailer is white\\" is presented, it means that the trailer primarily reflects all visible wavelengths of light, which directly contradicts the characteristics required for an object to be considered black. Therefore, deducing that \\"The trailer is not all black\\" when given the information that \\"The trailer is white\\" is a valid and logical conclusion. It's important to note that this conclusion is based on our current understanding of color perception and the basic principles of how colors work. In abstract or hypothetical scenarios, these principles may not hold true. However, based on the information provided and under normal circumstances, we can confidently assert that a white trailer cannot be all black."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Every weekend, the two friends would work on their respective lawns side by side.

Donald would smile, taking in the smell of freshly cut grass and the sound of the lawnmower humming steadily. In Donald's mind, yard work was not just a chore, but a form of meditation that allowed him to be present in the moment and take a break from the stresses of everyday life. He believed there was something inherently rewarding in transforming his lawn into a neatly trimmed masterpiece. Step 4: Describe Donald's perspective on yard work. - Meditative - Present in the moment - A break from normal stress - Rewarding accomplishment However, Nick's disdain for yard work wasn't entirely misguided. He had a demanding full-time job, a mortgage, and a family of four to support. This left him with limited time and energy to enjoy recreational activities on the weekend.

Step 5: Explain Nick's reasons for disliking yard work. - Demanding full-time job - Mortgage - Family of four - Limited time for recreation One day, while taking a well-deserved break from the relentless mowing, Nick shared his thoughts with Donald. Donald empathized with Nick's situation and suggested that they split the chores. He proposed that Nick could take care of the smaller tasks like trimming bushes or raking leaves, while he tackled the more time-consuming mowing. Step 6: Develop a resolution to the conflict. - Friends discuss the issue - Donald offers to help with the mowing By splitting the tasks, the friends were able to finish their yard work faster, allowing Nick to spend more quality time with his family and truly enjoy his weekends. Moreover, Donald's enthusiasm for yard work rubbed off on Nick, as he began to find solace in the smaller gardening tasks, gaining a newfound appreciation for the beauty and therapeutic benefits of working outdoors. In the end, their mutual respect and understanding brought them even closer as friends. Step 7: Describe the outcome. - Yard work finished faster - More quality time with family - Mutual appreciation for each other's perspective - Stronger friendship bond"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this statement, the person in question was indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) in October 2003. The accusations brought against him included crimes against humanity and breaching the laws and principles that govern warfare. The specific actions attributed to the accused were the killing, deportation, and committing other inhumane acts against the ethnic Albanian population during the conflict that took place in Kosovo between 1998 and 1999. The conflict in Kosovo was a highly controversial and complex event, with various ethnic, political, and religious factors contributing to the violence that engulfed the region. The primary antagonists were the government forces of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, which was primarily composed of Serbian forces, and the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an ethnic Albanian paramilitary organization. The conflict resulted in a significant number of casualties, extensive property damage, and the displacement of a large number of people, predominantly from the ethnic Albanian community. The atrocities committed during the conflict have been classified as ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity by various international organizations, including the United Nations and the ICTY. The indictment by the ICTY serves as an important mechanism to hold those responsible for the violations of international law during the conflict accountable for their actions. The Tribunal was established to prosecute individuals for serious violations of international humanitarian law committed in the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991. As part of its mandate, the ICTY focuses on genocide, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. By indicting and prosecuting individuals responsible for these crimes, the ICTY aims to bring justice to the victims, promote peace and reconciliation in the affected regions, and deter future instances of such violations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem.  I am facing a new situation today: Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which uncle doesn't take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, we should first identify which uncle is taking the statin drug and which is not. From the provided information, Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and Uncle Sam is not. Recall from the background article that statin drugs are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), which is the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis.  Since Uncle Tom is the one taking statin drugs, he is the one taking an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Thus, Uncle Sam is the uncle who does not take an inhibitor of the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. Answer: Uncle Sam."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Abu Yahya al-Libi, al Qaeda's No. 2 man, was killed in Pakistan on Monday, according to U.S. officials.  Al-Libi's death was \\"another serious blow to core al Qaeda,\\" White House spokesman Jay Carney said.  Al-Libi, 49, was a well-regarded figure in jihadist circles and had emerged as one of the terrorist network's most important clerics and propagandists, appearing in countless videos in recent years.  He was killed by a CIA drone strike, according to U.S. officials. Drone strikes remain a highly contentious issue between the United States and Pakistan.  Who is Abu Yahya al-Libi?  By most accounts, al-Libi was effectively al Qaeda's deputy leader.  A Libyan citizen and an Islamic scholar, al-Libi bolstered his credibility within jihad groups after escaping from U.S. custody in Afghanistan in 2005.  He became the public face of al Qaeda and used his religious training to justify the organization's actions. As one of the group's chief ideologues and propagandists, al-Libi appeared in numerous recruitment videos in which he cast himself as a sheikh with the legitimacy to issue fatwas.  Other than his appearances in propaganda videos, it's unclear which plots against the West al-Libi was involved in. A wanted ad from the U.S. State Department described him as a \\"key motivator in the global jihadi movement,\\" and said that \\"his messages convey a clear threat to U.S. persons or property worldwide.\\"  What does his death mean for al Qaeda?  This is a \\"very serious blow\\" to al Qaeda, according to Noman Benotman, a former senior member of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group who spent significant time with al-Libi in the 1990s. No one else within the group rivals his legitimacy as a religious scholar nor has the credibility in the Arab world to provide Islamic justifications for al Qaeda's global campaign of terrorism, he said.  1.

Question: suppose less rock is broken apart happens, how will it affect LESS vegetables.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less To fully understand the relationship between the process of breaking apart rocks and the growth of vegetables, let's examine each step in the process of growing plants and understand the role of natural elements like rocks. 1. Get some seeds: Seeds are the starting point of any plant, and in the case of vegetables, you would want to select specific seeds that provide your desired vegetable variety. 2. Pick a spot to plant them: A suitable location is critical, as different plants have distinct requirements for sunlight, moisture, and soil composition. In choosing the spot, one often considers the soil fertility, access to sunlight, and water drainage. 3. Dig a hole in the dirt: Holes must be dug for seeds or seedlings to be planted, which also helps with aeration and water penetration. 4. Put the seed in the hole: Seeding depth and spacing are crucial for the proper germination and growth of plants. 5. Pour some water on the seed and hole: Adequate water supply is essential for germination, as seeds require moisture content to break dormancy and initiate the process. 6. Cover up the hole: Soil helps provide stability, warmth, and holds in moisture to aid in seed germination. 7. Press down on it: Pressing down on the soil around the seed ensures good contact with the soil and prevents air pockets. 8. Spray some plant food on it: Plant food or fertilizers supply essential nutrients needed for the plant's growth and development. Now let's consider the less rock breaking apart scenario. As rocks break down, they provide critical minerals and nutrients required for plants to grow. Fewer rocks breaking apart means that there will be a decrease in the availability of these vital nutrients within the soil. This reduction in nutrient availability will affect the growth of vegetables adversely. Consequently, there will be less overall vegetable production. Plants may struggle to grow and develop as expected due to insufficient access to essential nutrients. So, the correct answer is B: Less. If less rock is broken apart, it would generally lead to a decrease in vegetable production as plants may struggle to access the essential nutrients required for their healthy growth and development."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Effigy of 'Lost Prince' Henry Stuart to go on show at National Portrait Gallery Funeral effigy of Henry, Prince of Wales. Photograph: Westminster Abbey A bundle of old sticks, which frankly will look very odd exhibited among treasures of paintings, miniatures, manuscripts and armour by artists including Rubens, Holbein and Inigo Jones, is all that remains of a funeral effigy that 400 years ago reduced crowds lining the streets of London to \\"an ocean of tears\\". The National Portrait Gallery is preparing to stage the first exhibition anywhere on one of British history's great what ifs – what if Henry, the now almost forgotten handsome, sporty, clever – and devoutly Protestant – son of James I, big brother of the feeble and sickly Charles, had not died of typhoid in 1612 aged just 18. Would he have reigned in peace and prosperity and had a brood of healthy children, or would he too have plunged his country into civil war and lost his head on a scaffold in Whitehall? For curator Catharine MacLeod, the ugliest and most battered object in the autumn exhibition will also be one of the most striking. The headless, armless, wooden torso once completed with a wax portrait head modelled from life, and dressed in the prince's own magnificent robes, is being loaned by Westminster Abbey, where it has not been exhibited for at least 200 years. \\"I find it very poignant, a tremendously moving symbol of the decline into which his memory has fallen,\\" she said. In 1612, the effigy laid on top of his coffin was so lifelike it had a devastating impact on viewers. A witness described \\"an innumerable multitude of all sorts of ages and degrees of men, women and children … some weeping, crying, howling, wringing of their hands, others halfe dead … passionately betraying so great a losse with rivers, nay with an ocean of teares.\\" The wonderful clothes were stolen within a few years, the head was gone by the early 19th century, and the arms, probably originally sacking stuffed with straw, have long since rotted away. It will be shown among more conventionally splendid objects, including loans from the royal collection and museum and private collections, including a spectacular suit of armour, and designs for a court masque by Inigo Jones in which the handsome youth appeared as the fairy king Oberon. Trinity College Cambridge is sending his copy book, showing one page of beautifully transcribed Latin poetry and one of touchingly teenage doodles, squiggles, and trial signatures. At the age of 16 he was already building up a spectacular art collection, including the superb Holbein drawings now among the most precious works in the Windsor Castle library. He was also so interested in shipbuilding that Sir Walter Raleigh, imprisoned in the tower, wrote him a treatise on the subject. His death also sealed the fate of his younger brother Charles, so feeble and sickly he was left behind in Scotland for years when his father became king on the death of Elizabeth I and moved south with his family. The Royal Collection is loaning a small bronze horse, a sculpture dating from 1600 by Pietro Tacco, which both princes obviously regarded as a particular treasure. When Henry lay on his deathbed, the 12-year-old Charles sent for the horse and gave it to his brother hoping it would cheer him up - but it was too late. Charles was chief mourner at the funeral, which his father could not bear to attend. Months later, in the middle of a conversation with diplomats, the king suddenly collapsed, sobbing: \\"Henry is dead, Henry is dead.\\" • The Lost Prince: the life and death of Henry Stuart, National Portrait Gallery.

It is winter and Johnathan's car won't start, so he needs to walk to work. Even though it's sunny outside he's going to have to bundle up due to the cold temperature. In his closet there is a large black coat and a large white coat. He can't decide which coat to wear.  Hint: Light may transfer its energy to matter rather than being reflected or transmitted by matter. This is called absorption . When light is absorbed, the added energy increases the temperature of matter. If you get into a car that has been sitting in the sun all day, the seats and other parts of the car’s interior may be almost too hot to touch, especially if they are black or very dark in color. That’s because dark colors absorb most of the sunlight that strikes them. The answer is:","output":"The large black coat will absorb more sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The most sensical answer is the \\"grassy field\\". From the information given in the scenario, it's stated that there was less heat generation when Milo plunged the fence posts into the grassy field as opposed to the dirt field.

In this case, the mention of the book comes earlier within the sentence, and the information about who is being referred to (Davey) is provided at the end.  This shifting or rearrangement of different elements within a sentence, without changing the overall meaning, is a common technique in paraphrasing. Oftentimes, the intention behind paraphrasing is to clarify a point, stress certain elements of the information more than others, avoid repetition, or simply to make the text more varied and interesting.

Passage: Some theories developed in the 1970s established possible avenues through which inequality may have a positive effect on economic development. According to a 1955 review, savings by the wealthy, if these increase with inequality, were thought to offset reduced consumer demand. A 2013 report on Nigeria suggests that growth has risen with increased income inequality. Some theories popular from the 1950s to 2011 incorrectly stated that inequality had a positive effect on economic development. Analyses based on comparing yearly equality figures to yearly growth rates were misleading because it takes several years for effects to manifest as changes to economic growth. IMF economists found a strong association between lower levels of inequality in developing countries and sustained periods of economic growth. Developing countries with high inequality have \\"succeeded in initiating growth at high rates for a few years\\" but \\"longer growth spells are robustly associated with more equality in the income distribution.\\" Question: When were theories developed suggesting inequality may have some negative effect on economic development?","output":"False"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: Passage: Although the publicity generated by Five Leaves Left was minor, Boyd was keen to build on what momentum there was. Drake's second album, 1971's Bryter Layter, again produced by Boyd and engineered by John Wood, introduced a more upbeat, jazzier sound.Disappointed by his debut's poor commercial performance, Drake sought to move away from his pastoral sound, and agreed to Boyd's suggestions to include bass and drum tracks. \\"It was more of a pop sound, I suppose,\\" Boyd later said. \\"I imagined it as more commercial.\\" Like its predecessor, the album featured musicians from Fairport Convention, as well as contributions from John Cale on two songs: \\"Northern Sky\\" and \\"Fly\\". Trevor Dann noted that while sections of \\"Northern Sky\\" sound more characteristic of Cale, the song was the closest Drake came to a release with chart potential. Cale used heroin during this period, and his older friend Brian Wells suspected that Drake was also using.Boyd and Wood were confident that Bryter Layter would be a success, but it sold fewer than 3,000 copies. Reviews were again mixed: while Record Mirror praised Drake as a \\"beautiful guitarist—clean and with perfect timing, [and] accompanied by soft, beautiful arrangements\\", Melody Maker described the album as \\"an awkward mix of folk and cocktail jazz\\".Soon after its release, Boyd sold Witchseason to Island Records, and moved to Los Angeles to work with Warner Brothers to develop film soundtracks. The loss of his mentor, coupled with the album's poor sales, led Drake into further depression. His attitude to London had changed: he was unhappy living alone, and visibly nervous and uncomfortable performing at a series of concerts in early 1970. In June, Drake gave one of his final live appearances at Ewell Technical College, Surrey. Ralph McTell, who also performed that night, remembered: \\"Nick was monosyllabic. At that particular gig he was very shy. He did the first set and something awful must have happened. He was doing his song 'Fruit Tree' and walked off halfway through it.\\"In 1971, Drake's family persuaded him to visit a psychiatrist at St Thomas's Hospital, London. He was prescribed antidepressants, but felt uncomfortable and embarrassed about taking them, and tried to hide the fact from his friends. He worried about their side effects and was concerned about how they would react with his regular cannabis use.Island Records urged Drake to promote Bryter Layter through interviews, radio sessions and live appearances. Drake, who by this time was smoking what Kirby described as \\"unbelievable amounts\\" of cannabis and exhibiting \\"the first signs of psychosis\\", refused. Disappointed by the reaction to Bryter Layter, he turned his thoughts inwards, and withdrew from family and friends. He rarely left his flat, and then only to play an occasional concert or to buy drugs. His sister recalled: \\"This was a very bad time. He once said to me that everything started to go wrong from [this] time on, and I think that was when things started to go wrong.\\".

How would one describe the sentiment of this tweet? @mommyisrocknrol awe thank you","output":"To describe the sentiment of the tweet \\"@mommyisrocknrol awe thank you\\", I would follow the given steps: 1. Understand the Basic Tone: I start by reading the tweet to myself, taking into account the words used and their standard meanings. In this tweet, the user is thanking another user. The word \\"thank you\\" is traditionally associated with positive emotions such as gratitude or appreciation. 2. Analyze the Context: Here, the context is a simple expression of thanks to a user with the handle @mommyisrocknrol. However, the tweet doesn't provide specific details about what they are being thanked for.  3. Check for Emotional Indicators: Now, I look for any emotional indicators like emojis, punctuation or capitalization which can intensify the sentiment. There are no such indicators in this tweet. However, the word 'awe' is being used, which generally connotes a mild surprise and pleasant emotion-- adding a touch of positivity to the message. 4. Overall Sentiment: After assessing the tone, context and emotional indicators, I'd define the overall sentiment of this tweet as positive. The user shows gratitude and amiability, which are both positive emotions. Without any negative words or indications, the most reasonable conclusion is to classify this sentiment as positive.  This step-by-step analysis helps to ensure an accurate understanding of sentiment, considering multiple elements of the tweet instead of simply assuming based on individual words. Social media and informal language can be tricky to interpret due to use of irony, sarcasm, or cultural idioms, so it's important to take a holistic approach to sentiment analysis. In this case, however, the message seems very clear-cut and positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Q:Where might a small dog run in packs? - trailer park - own home - grandmother's house - apartment complex - basket  The best answer is A:","output":"A small dog might run in packs in several of these locations, but each place offers unique challenges and benefits for the dog. 1. Trailer park: A trailer park may be the best answer for where a small dog might run in packs. This is because these residential areas typically have a higher concentration of homes in close proximity, which can result in more opportunities for dogs to socialize and form packs. Additionally, trailer parks often have communal outdoor spaces where dogs can roam, interact, and play with one another. In such a setting, it becomes more natural for small dogs to form social groups and run together as packs. 2. Own home: A small dog could possibly form a pack within their own home if there are multiple dogs living together. However, this arrangement might not have the same level of interactions and social dynamics as the outdoor packs. In this scenario, the dog may socialize predominantly with the other dogs in the household, and their opportunities to interact with other dogs from different homes might be limited. 3. Grandmother's house: A small dog might form a pack at a grandmother's house if there are other dogs living with the grandmother or if the house is regularly visited by dogs from neighboring homes. Similar to living in their own home, the dog's social interactions may be limited to the specific family members and other dogs present at the grandmother's house, rather than forming a larger, community-based pack. 4. Apartment complex: An apartment complex can create opportunities for small dogs to form packs, especially if the complex has designated pet-friendly areas, outdoor spaces, or even an onsite dog park. These communal spaces can provide an environment for the small dogs to socialize and run together. However, the level of interaction and pack formation may not be as extensive as what could be observed at a trailer park. 5. Basket: It is unlikely for a small dog to run in packs inside a basket since it is an inanimate object and does not have the space and environment necessary for socialization and pack formation. A basket may be used for transporting a small dog or as a cozy resting space, but it does not provide the surroundings required for dogs to run and interact in groups. In conclusion, the best answer for where a small dog might run in packs is likely a trailer park, as these locations offer a unique combination of close-knit homes and communal spaces that foster socialization and make it easier for dogs to interact and form packs. However, depending on the specific circumstances and available amenities, apartment complexes and grandmother's houses might also offer opportunities for small dogs to socialize and run together."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At a show filmed by their friend Metalion, the band meets a fan named Kristian, whom Euronymous initially looks down on. While home alone, Dead uses his personal knife to cut his arms and throat, and then uses Euronymous' shotgun to shoot himself in the forehead, leaving behind a suicide note. Euronymous returns home and finds the body but instead of calling the police, he takes photos of the body and moves the knife and shotgun around. After Dead's body is taken away, Euronymous gives necklaces to the other band members which he claims are pieces of Dead's skull; this disgusts Necrobutcher, prompting him to leave the band.

Question: I read this background article the other day: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.  I am facing a new situation today: Dan studied genetic engineering. He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which crop would need more number of chemicals, crop A or crop B? Answer:","output":"Based on the background article and the new situation, crop B, which is not tolerant of herbicides, would need a greater number of chemicals for weed management. Crop A, being herbicide-tolerant, has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season due to its improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate this to English?","output":"It is worth noting that the objectives set for the 1990s were achieved long before the anticipated date. Here is a detailed and long answer in English providing context and expansion of the idea: The statement highlights a notable accomplishment, wherein the goals that were originally established for the 1990s were not only achieved but were also completed well ahead of the initially planned timeline. This suggests that whatever strategies, resources, and commitments were employed to reach these objectives were highly effective and perhaps even exceeded expectations. This early achievement can be attributed to various factors. First, there might have been effective planning and execution, which allowed for the timely completion of tasks and projects. An excellent team effort, strong leadership, and collaboration among involved stakeholders could have also played a crucial role in attaining the goals ahead of schedule. Secondly, technological advancements might have had a significant impact on the accomplishment of the objectives. Breakthroughs during that period, such as the growth of the internet and rapid advancements in computing, telecommunications, and other related fields, could have expedited processes and helped accomplish these goals much faster than was initially anticipated. Another possible consideration is that external factors, such as economic growth, political stability, and other global events, might have positively impacted the progress towards achieving these objectives. For instance, the end of the Cold War in the early 1990s led to a more stable geopolitical climate, creating a more conducive environment for international cooperation and enabling faster progress. However, it is also essential to acknowledge that the early accomplishment of goals may have its downsides. For instance, the initial objectives might have been underestimated, or the plans may not have been ambitious enough, leading to the premature completion of the goals and leaving room for potential underutilization of resources and capacities. Nevertheless, reaching objectives ahead of schedule is generally considered a remarkable accomplishment and indicates effective planning, execution, and adaptation to changing circumstances. Reflecting on the factors that contributed to this success can provide valuable insights for future endeavors and guide the establishment of new objectives in the years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:Question: \\"Why did Greece have interest in Asia?\\"  Context: \\"In the aftermath of the First World War, Greece attempted further expansion into Asia Minor, a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, contributing to a massive flight of Asia Minor Greeks. These events overlapped, with both happening during the Greek genocide (1914-1922), a period during which, according to various sources, Ottoman and Turkish officials contributed to the death of several hundred thousand Asia Minor Greeks. The resultant Greek exodus from Asia Minor was made permanent, and expanded, in an official Population exchange between Greece and Turkey. The exchange was part of the terms of the Treaty of Lausanne which ended the war.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Greece had interest in Asia due to the large native Greek population in Asia Minor and their historical connections to the region.

The Senior 2 from Beijing No.35 High School dreamt of meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin. After more than a year of hard work and with a little good luck, Li fulfilled her dream. On October 11, 2004, the 16-year-old girl joined a team of Chinese journalists who went to the Kremlin, in Moscow, to interview Putin.  Li felt nervous before talking with Putin. \\"But his greeting and warm smile put me at ease,\\" she said. Li admires Putin very much, because of his strong will and style of leadership. \\"He looks very cool,\\" Li said. During her interview, Li asked Putin whether he plans to educate his two teenage daughters to be officials in the future. Putin smiled and answered he hopes they can do whatever job suits their interests and personalities. Although Li would only have several minutes, she started working on her interview questions last August after applying for the opportunity. \\"Journalists work is by no means easy. You need to do lots of homework on your  _ ,\\" she said. She read many books about Putin and Russia in her spare time.

By using the phrase \\"just consider what new best friend does not have,\\" the reviewer implies that there are several key elements missing in the movie that possibly make it less appealing. Moreover, the use of the phrase \\"beginning with the minor omission\\" seems to be a sarcastic remark as it refers to the absence of a screenplay, and without a proper screenplay, it is challenging to establish a solid foundation for a successful movie. The absence of a screenplay undermines the basic structure necessary for a compelling, engaging, and coherent story. This would also likely result in a poorly executed narrative and weak character development. Furthermore, by referring to the screenplay as a \\"minor omission,\\" the reviewer is using irony to express displeasure and dissatisfaction with the movie. The impact of this sarcasm suggests that there are possibly other elements of the film that the reviewer does not find appealing or favorable. This further emphasizes that the review is focused on the negative aspects of the movie.

Context: When she's in the mood to push my buttons, my significant other, the delightful and charming Ms. D, frequently alludes to the questionable timeline concerning my birth date. She derives much mirth from the fact that I was born something less than nine or ten months after my parents wed and hints that this indicates a certain amount of premarital hanky-panky. Standing on my dignity ('cause it's higher than the coffee table), my reply is that I have it on good authority that I owe my early entry into the world to Tabusintac Hill. Said hill was once considered to be an abomination of the first water. The Tabusintac, like all hills, had an up and a down. In this case, the up and down were distinguished from each other by a sharp curve at the bottom. The main North/South New Brunswick highway slavishly followed the hill's contours. If you were heading north, the road led you into a ravine and you were faced with a steep uphill incline that, in winter presented a challenge to at least half the vehicles trying to climb it. In true snow country fashion, steep, icy hills were conquered by getting a running start, building up a lot of speed and praying that Mr. Newton's rules concerning inertia would work in your favour. Headed south, the problem became keeping your car under control so that you didn't go shooting into the trees when the road curved to the left. My parents were taking a trip to the Miramachi in December of '56 and were driving a Pontiac borrowed from one of my father's friends. My mother was pregnant with a bundle of bad attitude and misery that would turn out to be me. I assume that my father was driving with that mix of panache and insouciance that my mother tended to describe as reckless behaviour. In any case, as he rounded the corner at the top of the hill, the road was apparently free of snow and ice and there was no reason to slowdown. Until the moose stepped out onto the road just ahead of them.

It's hard for older adults in your family to let go of the thought of you being \\"little girl\\" or \\"little boy,\\" even if you're well into adulthood. Therefore, you need to broach the topic with them and help them understand what you're feeling.  Start with your feelings. That is, use an \\"I\\" statement to describe how you're feeling instead of a \\"you\\" statement that puts the blame on them. Blaming someone will put them on the defense. For instance, don't say, \\" You always treat me like a little kid.\\" Instead, say \\"I feel upset when you still treat me like a child. I've grown up.\\" Be specific by talking about particular statements or behaviors that bother you. For example, you could say, \\"I love that you help with the kids, but I don't like when you contradict the rules that I've made.\\" You could also say, \\"I respect your rules when I'm in your house, but I don't like being asked where I am every second of every day.\\" Tell them what you expect. For instance, you could say, \\"I would really appreciate if you would respect the rules I've set for my kids.\\" or \\"I would appreciate it if you would treat me like any other adult who stays in your home.\\" If you're telling your mom a story, tell her what you expect from her upfront. For instance, if you're just telling her the story to give her information and you don't really want advice, let her know that. You could say, \\"Mom, I need to tell you something, but I want you to promise me that you won't offer your judgment at the end. I feel like you need to know this information, but I don't want advice on my choices.\\" That is, often in communication, people are trying to maintain control. It's a power struggle. Often, this type of communication pops up between a parent and an adult child, or even another type of relationship, such as an aunt and niece or nephew. The \\"adult\\" still wants to control the adult child, even if that person doesn't realize it. If you're the adult child, you may want to struggle to \\"win\\" in this situation. However, often letting go of the power struggle can lead to a healthier relationship.  This type of power struggle can make people defensive. You probably feel defensive when another adult in your family, whether it be a parent, aunt, guardian, or grandparent, does it to you. However, by truly listening and letting go of the power struggle, you can cut through some of that defensiveness and both parties can feel more heard and valued. Sometimes, parents and other family members have trouble respecting boundaries because they still see you as a little kid they have a right to rule over. In that case, you need to politely but firmly set boundaries with them because you have your own life now.  For instance, say your parents tend to just show up at your house unannounced. You could say, \\"We love having you here, but we'd appreciate it if you gave us some advanced notice. Sometimes, we have our family time planned, and we need that time to strengthen and grow together.\\" Another way you could address an issue is to say, \\"I understand that you are concerned about when we're having children. However, it may be some time before we decide to do so. I will definitely let you know when we're thinking about it. Until then, I would appreciate it if you stop asking about it.\\"","output":"The article discusses the challenges that adults often face in communicating their feelings of being treated childishly by their family members, and it provides strategies for navigating these conversations without creating defensiveness, such as using \\"I\\" statements, being specific about bothersome behaviors, setting clear expectations, and setting boundaries regarding personal choices and family routines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Shrek Forever After Movie plot: Shrek has grown steadily tired of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to yearn for the days when he felt like a \\"real ogre\\". When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger. Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for Shrek to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to \\"thank\\" him. Shrek signs the contract and appears in a reality where he is feared by villagers. He takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds \\"WANTED\\" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by witches and taken to Stiltskin, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down. Upon inquiry, Stiltskin reveals that the day he erased was the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or never met Donkey, and consequently Stiltskin was able to get King Harold and Queen Lillian to sign their kingdom away, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well. Shrek escapes Stiltskin's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by \\"true love's kiss\\".

That's a bit like what happened between two football players named Osi Umenyiora and LeSean McCoy. Osi Umenyiora is a very good football player who used to be on a team called the New York Giants. He played a position called \\"defensive end\\" (DE), which means he was in charge of stopping the other team's players from running or throwing the ball. His job was to protect his team's side of the football field. LeSean McCoy is another good football player who used to be on a team called the Philadelphia Eagles. He played as a \\"running back,\\" which means his job was to run with the football and try to get past the other team's players, like Osi Umenyiora. Now, sometimes people have disagreements, and that's okay. But a while ago, Osi Umenyiora had a problem with his team. They were talking about how much money he should get paid, and they were not agreeing on the amount. This is called a \\"contract dispute.\\" During this time, LeSean McCoy said some mean things about Osi Umenyiora. He said things like Osi wasn't as good of a football player as people thought, and that he was not as smart as he thought he was.  Osi Umenyiora was very upset about what LeSean McCoy said. Recently, he talked about it and said that what LeSean McCoy did was \\"unforgivable.\\" That means Osi thinks that it was so mean and hurtful that he can't forget about it and be friends with LeSean McCoy again. Sometimes, people say things that they don't mean, especially when they are having a disagreement.

We see the two numbers, 239 and -91. Let's see what happens when we subtract 91 from 239: 239 - 91 = 148 Now, our equation looks like this: -13 * l + 148 = -229 Next, we have to get the \\"-13 * l\\" all by itself on the left side. To do that, let's subtract 148 from both sides of the equation: (-13 * l + 148) - 148 = -229 - 148 Now, we get: -13 * l = -377 Almost there! Now, we just have to find out what number \\"l\\" is. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -13: -13 * l / -13 = -377 / -13 When we divide -377 by -13, we get: l = 29 So, the answer to the problem is l = 29.

The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Prince Grigory Aleksandrovich Potemkin-Tavricheski (Russian: Grigorii Aleksandrovich Potiomkin-Tavricheskii; 'Potyomkin', r Grigoriy Aleksandrovich Potyomkin-Tavricheskiy; October 11 [O.S. September 30] 1739 - October 16 [O.S. October 5] 1791) was a Russian military leader, statesman, nobleman and favourite of Catherine the Great. He died during negotiations over the Treaty of Jassy, which ended a war with the Ottoman Empire that he had overseen. Potemkin was born into a family of middle-income noble landowners. Potemkin \\"exuded both menace and welcome\\"; he was arrogant, demanding of his courtiers and very changeable in his moods but also fascinating, warm and kind. It was generally agreed among his female companions that he was \\"amply endowed with 'sex appeal'\\". Louis Philippe, comte de Segur described him as \\"colossal like Russia\\", \\"an inconceivable mixture of grandeur and pettiness, laziness and activity, bravery and timidity, ambition and insouciance\\". The internal contrast was evident throughout his life: he frequented both church and numerous orgies, for example. In Segur's view, onlookers had a tendency to unjustly attribute to Catherine alone the successes of the period and to Potemkin the failures. An eccentric workaholic, Potemkin was vain and a great lover of jewelry (a taste he did not always remember to pay for), but he disliked sycophancy and was sensitive about his appearance, particularly his lost eye. He only agreed to having portraits made of him twice, in 1784 and again in 1791, both times by Johann Baptist von Lampi and from an angle which disguised his injury.  Potemkin was also an intellectual. The Prince of Ligne noted that Potemkin had \\"natural abilities [and] an excellent memory\\". He was interested in history and generally knowledgeable. Potemkin loved the classical music of the period, as well as opera. He liked all food, both peasant and fine; particular favorites included roast beef and potatoes, and his anglophilia meant that English gardens were prepared wherever he went. A practical politician, his political ideas were \\"quintessentially Russian\\", and he believed in the superiority of the Tsarist autocracy (he once described the French revolutionaries as \\"a pack of madmen\\"). Potemkin's habits included biting his nails, to the point where he developed hangnail. One evening, at the height of his power, Potemkin declared to his dinner guests:  Everything I have ever wanted, I have... I wanted high rank, I have it; I wanted medals, I have them; I loved gambling, I have lost vast sums; I liked giving parties, I've given magnificent ones; I enjoy building houses, I've raised palaces; I liked buying estates, I have many; I adore diamonds and beautiful things - no individual in Europe owns rarer or more exquisite stones. In a word, all my passions have been sated. I am entirely happy!  Ultimately Potemkin proved a controversial figure. Criticisms include \\"laziness, corruption, debauchery, indecision, extravagance, falsification, military incompetence and disinformation on a vast scale\\" but supporters hold that only \\"the sybaritism [devotion to luxury] and extravagance... are truly justified\\", stressing Potemkin's \\"intelligence, force of personality, spectacular vision, courage, generosity and great achievements\\". Though not a military genius, he was \\"seriously able\\" in military matters. Potemkin's contemporary Segur was quick to criticise, writing that \\"nobody thought out a plan more swiftly [than Potemkin], carried it out more slowly and abandoned it more easily\\". Another contemporary, the Scotsman Sir John Sinclair, added that Potemkin had \\"great abilities\\" but was ultimately a \\"worthless and dangerous character\\". Russian opponents such as Semyon Vorontsov agreed: the Prince had \\"lots of intelligence, intrigue and credit\\" but lacked \\"knowledge, application and virtue\\".

News article: Bee Anantatho was very proud when her restaurant, Thailicious in Edgewater, received a 1,088 tip from a customer this weekend. She and her husband, Surachai Surabotsopon, emigrated from Bangkok to Colorado about five years ago, and opened their Thai restaurant — which specializes in Bangkok-style Thai cuisine — a few years ago. They’ve been steadily building a loyal fan base, and the eye-popping tip seemed to validate their venture.      “I think this is a big thing,” she said shortly after one of her waiters received the surprising tip.      She heard about it when the server who cleared the table picked up the checkbook, where customers usually put extra money for tips when they pay in cash.      The server brought it straight to her, and she consulted with her staff to clarify the situation. Even though they put tips in a jar to share among the servers, Anantatho remembers the reaction of the waiter who’d served the man.      “He said he’d read a lot of stories like this, but usually the tip is a couple hundred dollars, not 1,000,” she said. “He was so happy.”      Relying on her instincts as a business owner, Anantatho told her crew they should hold on to the money, just in case he came back.      And he did, the very next day, the moment the restaurant opened.      “He said, ‘I’m sorry, I was drunk,’ ” she said. “He didn’t know he put all the money he had in the checkbook.”      Some of the bills were 100 bills, and she suspected he might have thought they were 1 bills.      She gave the money back to him, and he gave her 100 to cover the dinner, about 60, and the rest for a tip.      Although disappointed for her staff, which thought it had earned a major tip, she’s content with the way she handled an embarrassing situation, making it easy for the customer.      “I think he will come back,” she said. ||||| People can be extra generous when they're drunk, and extra regretful when they're sober.      Bee Anantatho owns a popular Thai restaurant, Thailicious, in Edgewater, Colorado. Thailicious has been in the neighborhood for several years, and the restaurant's customers have reportedly always been loyal. This weekend, one of the restaurant's customers decided to show off his gratitude — by leaving 1,088 as a tip.      \\"I think this is a big thing,\\" Anantatho said after hearing of the tip.      The server who received the tip brought it to Anantatho and wanted to put it in the tip jar, where all the waitstaff shares their tips.      \\"He said he’d read a lot of stories like this, but usually the tip is a couple hundred dollars, not 1,000,” Anantatho said of the waiter to The Denver Post. \\"He was so happy.\\"      Happy — but only for so long. Anantatho encouraged her staff to hold onto the tip in case the customer returned. Which he did, the next day, full of regrets.      \\"He said, ‘I’m sorry, I was drunk,'\\" Anantatho said. \\"He didn’t know he put all the money he had in the checkbook.”      Some of the 100 bills the customer put down, Anantatho said, the customer thought were 1 bills.

Article:Rents were up by 1.1% last month compared with July, leaving the average rent at Â£761 a month, said the survey by LSL Property Services. The figures, based on LSL's own data, suggested seven out of 10 regions had seen rent rises over the year. This was led by a 3.5% increase in the south-west of England. The south-east of England saw rents rise by 3.4% compared with a year ago, and there was a 3.3% rise in the north-west of England, LSL said. Campbell Robb, chief executive of charity Shelter, said: \\"Successive governments' failure to build enough affordable homes and soaring house prices are leaving more and more families with no choice but to live their lives in expensive and unstable rented homes, never certain of what the future holds.\\" Rents were lower in August compared with a year ago in the North East (down 1.6%), the West Midlands (down 0.4%), and Wales (down 0.1%), LSL said.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: Question: If John decreases the concentration of reactants in his solution, what will happen to the rate of reaction?   Answer: it will become slower Student:","output":"If John decreases the concentration of reactants in his solution, the rate of reaction will become slower. This occurs because the rate of a chemical reaction is directly proportional to the concentration of the reactants involved.  In a solution with a higher concentration of reactants, there are more reactant particles available to collide and interact with each other. This increases the probability of successful collisions (i.e., those that result in the formation of product molecules) and therefore speeds up the reaction rate. Conversely, when the concentration of reactants is decreased, there are fewer reactant particles available to collide, resulting in a lower probability of successful collisions and a slower reaction rate. This relationship between reactant concentration and reaction rate is described by the rate equation, which varies depending on the specific reaction. However, in general terms, the rate equation can be written as: Rate = k[A]^m[B]^n In this equation, 'Rate' represents the rate of reaction, 'k' is the rate constant, '[A]' and '[B]' are the concentrations of the reactants, and 'm' and 'n' are the reaction orders with respect to the reactants A and B, respectively. As the concentration of reactants decreases (i.e., [A] or [B] decreases), the rate of reaction will also decrease due to the direct relationship between them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information:  - A car is a wheeled, self-powered motor vehicle used for transportation and a product of the automotive industry. Most definitions of the term specify that cars are designed to run primarily on roads, to have seating for one to eight people, to typically have four wheels with tyres, and to be constructed principally for the transport of people rather than goods. The year 1886 is regarded as the birth year of the modern car. In that year, German inventor Karl Benz built the Benz Patent-Motorwagen. Cars did not become widely available until the early 20th century. One of the first cars that was accessible to the masses was the 1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company. Cars were rapidly adopted in the United States of America, where they replaced animal-drawn carriages and carts, but took much longer to be accepted in Western Europe and other parts of the world.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - Chambers Motors was the first automobile manufacturer in Ireland . The company built vehicles by hand featuring high - quality components designed and fabricated in - house . Passenger cars were made to suit doctors and wealthy businessmen , and commercial vehicles were produced for duty as delivery vans , ambulances , and hearses . A key feature of the vehicles was a unique design of epicyclic gearbox in the rear axle . Chambers Motors employed around 75 people and built approximately 500 vehicles in 25 years of operation .  - A van is a type of road vehicle used for transporting goods or people. Depending on the type of van it can be bigger or smaller than a truck and SUV, and bigger than a common car. There is some varying in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, minivans, are commonly used for transporting people from a family. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary.

It is carried through shared blood vessels and then to the mother's lungs.; Answer:","output":"The correct statement that describes what happens to the carbon dioxide waste produced by a developing baby during pregnancy is: a. It is carried by the umbilical cord to the placenta and then to the mother's blood. To understand this process, it is important to know the role of the umbilical cord, placenta, and the maternal blood system during pregnancy. The umbilical cord is a vital structure, connecting the developing baby (fetus) to the mother's placenta. It contains two arteries and one vein, which are protected and cushioned by a jelly-like substance known as Wharton's Jelly. The umbilical cord functions as a lifeline for the fetus, providing it with essential nutrients, oxygen, and removing waste products such as carbon dioxide. The placenta is a temporary organ that forms during pregnancy and attaches to the uterine wall, where it plays a crucial role in fetal development and support. It essentially acts as an interface between the mother and the developing baby, facilitating the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the maternal and fetal blood systems. Interestingly, the mother's blood and the baby's blood never mix directly; they are separated by a thin membrane barrier within the placenta that allows for the selective transfer of nutrients and waste. Carbon dioxide is a waste product of cellular respiration and metabolism that must be removed from the fetus to maintain optimal health and growth. The process of carbon dioxide removal begins as the waste diffuses from the fetus's cells into its blood circulation. The carbon dioxide-rich blood is then transported by the umbilical vein to the placenta.  Once in the placenta, the carbon dioxide diffuses across the placental membrane into the mother's blood, maintaining a concentration gradient that ensures efficient transfer of waste. The maternal blood system transports the waste to the mother's lungs, where the carbon dioxide is expelled during exhalation. Simultaneously, oxygen-rich blood from the mother is transported to the fetus through the umbilical arteries, providing essential oxygen necessary for fetal development. This process effectively illustrates how the umbilical cord transports carbon dioxide waste from the fetus to the placenta and then to the mother's blood, highlighting the essential role of these structures in managing waste for the developing baby during pregnancy."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Given the context: What will Quinn want to do next? Select from the following. +ask Carson to pay for them to have dinner. +ask Carson to leave so they can be alone. +offer to listen to Carson's problems. The answer is:","output":"Given the context, Quinn would most likely want to offer to listen to Carson's problems. It is clear that Quinn cares about Carson and is trying to make them feel better after a hard day at work, which is evident by placing their arm around Carson for comfort during dinner. In this scenario, being there for Carson and providing emotional support would be the main priority for Quinn. Asking Carson to pay for dinner would not be appropriate in this situation, as it would not help alleviate the stress or negative emotions that Carson is experiencing. Additionally, asking Carson to leave so that Quinn can be alone might make Carson feel rejected or undervalued, which is not the desired outcome when trying to provide comfort. Offering to listen to Carson's problems is the best course of action, as it shows empathy and a genuine desire to help. By providing a space for them to openly discuss their issues, Quinn can better understand what Carson is going through and offer support, advice, or simply a listening ear. This sense of validation and understanding can be incredibly valuable for someone who has had a tough day and will likely contribute to Carson feeling better and more supported.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.  John and Keith were playing football - the game was rough to say the least. They both got hurt. After the game they went to see the sports physician for a check up.

[+] negative [+] positive).","output":"Title: The Disappointment That was \\"Fading Dreams\\" As a film enthusiast and a long-time fan of filmmaker James Winston, I had high expectations for his latest venture, \\"Fading Dreams.\\" Unfortunately, my anticipation quickly turned into utter disappointment. This review will aim to explain the numerous, negative aspects of this movie that contribute to its lackluster appeal. To start, the plot of \\"Fading Dreams\\" is convoluted beyond measure, which made it nearly impossible to follow. Many of the crucial storylines and events are poorly connected, leaving viewers feeling like they're continuously missing a piece of the puzzle. This confusing narrative might have been forgivable if the film's pacing had not also been dreadfully slow, making it a challenge to stay engaged throughout the two and a half hours run time. Not only are the pacing and interwoven storylines hard to digest, but the characters in the film lack any depth or complexity. As a result, the audience finds it difficult to empathize with the protagonists, hindering any emotional investment in the narrative. The script is no better, filled with cliched dialogue and cringeworthy one-liners that seem forced and out of place. Winston, who's known for his sharp and punchy writing, missed the mark entirely this time around. Further exacerbating the issues with \\"Fading Dreams\\" is the poor camera work and visual effects. With scenes that are either dimly lit or excessively shaky, viewers are left in confusion, straining their eyes to decipher the plot. Despite the film's impressive budget, the visual effects are unpolished and unrealistic, diminishing the immersive experience that was likely intended. Even the musical score, which could have potentially salvaged some aspect of the film, feels poorly matched and ill-placed, adding to the overall low-quality experience. Much like the script, it lacks the emotional punch needed to complement the on-screen action and fails to elevate the movie to a higher plane. In conclusion, \\"Fading Dreams\\" is an unmitigated disaster that does not live up to James Winston's previous works. With its perplexing plot, flat characters, and lackluster production quality, viewers are left with an uninspiring and forgettable experience. Venturing into the world of \\"Fading Dreams\\" costs both time and money that would be better spent elsewhere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article: The Petitions Committee said the debate would be on 5 September as a \\"huge number\\" had signed it. But the committee said the debate did not mean it was supporting the call for a second referendum and it was \\"too late\\" to change the referendum rules. The UK voted to leave the EU by 52% to 48% in the referendum on 23 June. The petition, set up on 25 May before the referendum, states: \\"We the undersigned call upon HM Government to implement a rule that if the Remain or Leave vote is less than 60%, based [on] a turnout of less than 75%, there should be another referendum.\\" Those who signed it have already received an email that said the prime minister and government had \\"been clear that this was a once-in-a-generation vote\\" and the decision \\"must be respected\\". The referendum saw 17.4 million (51.9%) votes cast to leave the EU, compared with 16.1 million (48.1%) for Remain, with a turnout of 72.2%, according to the Electoral Commission. In a statement, the House of Commons Petitions Committee said a debate on the petition would allow MPs to \\"put forward a range of views on behalf of their constituents\\" and a government minister would respond to the points raised. But it said: \\"A debate in Westminster Hall does not have the power to change the law, and won't end with the House of Commons deciding whether or not to have a second referendum... \\"It will be up to the government to decide whether it wants to start the process of agreeing a new law for a second referendum.\\" The online petition, set up by William Oliver Healey, gained more signatures than any other on the parliamentary website in the wake of the EU referendum result. Before the result was declared just 22 people had signed it. The petition was investigated for fraud last month and 77,000 signatures that were found to be false were removed. It was considered for a parliamentary debate by the Petitions Committee because it had received more than 100,000 signatures.","output":"The UK's Petitions Committee announced plans for a debate on a second EU referendum on September 5th.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - In physics, gravitational acceleration is the acceleration on an object caused by the force of gravitation. Neglecting friction such as air resistance, all small bodies accelerate in a gravitational field at the same rate relative to the center of mass. This equality is true regardless of the masses or compositions of the bodies.  - The kilogram or kilogramme (SI unit symbol: kg) is the base unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI) (the Metric system) and is defined as being equal to the mass of the \\"International Prototype of the Kilogram\\" (IPK, also known as \\"Le Grand K\\" or \\"Big K\\").  - An airplane or aeroplane (informally plane) is a powered, fixed-wing aircraft that is propelled forward by thrust from a jet engine or propeller. Airplanes come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and wing configurations. The broad spectrum of uses for airplanes includes recreation, transportation of goods and people, military, and research. Commercial aviation is a massive industry involving the flying of tens of thousands of passengers daily on airliners. Most airplanes are flown by a pilot on board the aircraft, but some are designed to be remotely or computer-controlled.  - The International System of Units (; abbreviated as SI) is the modern form of the metric system, and is the most widely used system of measurement. It comprises a coherent system of units of measurement built on seven base units. The system also establishes a set of twenty prefixes to the unit names and unit symbols that may be used when specifying multiples and fractions of the units.  - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.  - Miniature dachshunds have a typical weight of 8 to 11 pounds in the United States . They also are normally a height of 5 to 7 inches at the withers . They are nicknamed \`\` wiener dogs '' , \`\` hot dogs '' or \`\` sausage dogs '' .  - In physics, mass is a property of a physical body. It is the measure of an object's resistance to acceleration (a change in its state of motion) when a net force is applied. It also determines the strength of its mutual gravitational attraction to other bodies. The basic SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg).  - Altitude or height (sometimes known as depth) is defined based on the context in which it is used (aviation, geometry, geographical survey, sport, and many more). As a general definition, altitude is a distance measurement, usually in the vertical or \\"up\\" direction, between a reference datum and a point or object. The reference datum also often varies according to the context. Although the term altitude is commonly used to mean the height above sea level of a location, in geography the term elevation is often preferred for this usage.  - Height is the measure of vertical distance, either how \\"tall\\" something is, or how \\"high up\\" it is. For example \\"The height of the building is 50 m\\" or \\"The height of the airplane is 10,000 m\\". When used to describe how high something like an airplane or mountain peak is from sea level, height is more often called altitude. Height is measured along the vertical (y) axis between a specified point and another.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Engineering is the application of mathematics and scientific, economic, social, and practical knowledge in order to invent, innovate, design, build, maintain, research, and improve structures, machines, tools, systems, components, materials, processes, solutions, and organizations.  - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed.  - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars  and the stars to group together into galaxies  so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects.  - Mean sea level (MSL) (abbreviated simply sea level) is an average level of the surface of one or more of Earth's oceans from which heights such as elevations may be measured. MSL is a type of vertical datuma standardised geodetic reference pointthat is used, for example, as a chart datum in cartography and marine navigation, or, in aviation, as the standard sea level at which atmospheric pressure is measured in order to calibrate altitude and, consequently, aircraft flight levels. A common and relatively straightforward mean sea-level standard is the midpoint between a mean low and mean high tide at a particular location.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - In science and engineering, the weight of an object is usually taken to be the force on the object due to gravity. Weight is a vector whose magnitude (a scalar quantity), often denoted by an italic letter \\"W\\", is the product of the mass \\"m\\" of the object and the magnitude of the local gravitational acceleration \\"g\\"; thus: . The unit of measurement for weight is that of force, which in the International System of Units (SI) is the newton. For example, an object with a mass of one kilogram has a weight of about 9.8 newtons on the surface of the Earth, and about one-sixth as much on the Moon. In this sense of weight, a body can be weightless only if it is far away (in principle infinitely far away) from any other mass. Although weight and mass are scientifically distinct quantities, the terms are often confused with each other in everyday use (i.e. comparing and converting force weight in pounds to mass in kilograms and vice versa).

Answer the following question: Two women have just undergone different types of mutations without them being aware of it. Kim has just had a mutation in the DNA of her sex cells. Holly has had a mutation in her body cells. Both mutations would be able to be discovered if they happen to go to a doctor, and the doctor knows to look for it, but that is unlikely since the women are unaware these changes happened.  Whose mutation is less likely to cause cancer?  Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, Holly's mutation is more likely to cause cancer.  To explain, Kim has had a germline mutation, which occurs in the DNA of her sex cells. While this type of mutation can be passed down to the next generation and may cause hereditary diseases, it is not as directly associated with cancer as somatic mutations. The germline mutation will be present in all of Kim's offspring, but may not necessarily result in any medical problems, depending on the specific mutation and whether it affects a gene that is necessary for proper functioning in her offspring's bodies. On the other hand, Holly has had a somatic mutation, which occurs in her body cells. This type of mutation is not passed down to the next generation; however, it can lead to serious medical conditions such as cancer. Somatic mutations can lead to the uncontrolled growth and division of cells, which is a hallmark of cancer. As the mutated cell replicates, it passes on the mutation to its descendants, potentially accumulating more mutations that can further contribute to cancer development.

Super Junior (Korean: syupeojunieo; Syupeo Junieo), also known as simply SJ or SUJU, is a South Korean boy band. Formed in 2005 by producer Lee Soo-man of S.M. Entertainment, the group comprised a total of thirteen members at its peak. Super Junior originally debuted with twelve members, consisting of leader Leeteuk, Heechul, Hangeng, Yesung, Kangin, Shindong, Sungmin, Eunhyuk, Siwon, Donghae, Ryeowook and Kibum. Kyuhyun joined the group in 2006. In February 2006, Super Junior 05 began performances for \\"Miracle\\", the second promotional single from their debut album. \\"Miracle\\" topped the music charts of Thailand, drawing interest from international markets. As promotions for \\"Miracle\\" ended, SM Entertainment began selecting new members for Super Junior's second generation, Super Junior 06. The company even prepared a list of chosen members that were to graduate from the group. However, the company abandoned the rotational concept after adding a thirteenth member, Kyuhyun, in 2006. The group then became known as just Super Junior, without the suffix \\"05\\". Member Eunhyuk indirectly explains in a variety show that junior group SHINee could have been part of the group, but that was contemplated before Kyuhyun broke the rotational concept.  After the addition of Kyuhyun, Super Junior released their single \\"U\\" for free download on May 25, 2006 on their official website. \\"U\\" exceeded 400,000 downloads within five hours of release and ultimately surpassed 1.7 million downloads, crashing the server. The physical single of \\"U\\" with a total of three tracks was released on June 6, eventually selling over 81,000 units in South Korea. The single became one of Korea's most popular songs of the year, taking up number one spots for five consecutive weeks on two of Korea's top music programs. By the end of the year, Super Junior collected over seven awards in five of South Korea's top music award ceremonies, and was one of the three Best Newcomer winners at the 21st Golden Disk Awards.  In late 2006, Kyuhyun, Ryeowook, and Yesung formed the subgroup Super Junior-K.R.Y., Super Junior's first sub-unit. They performed their first single \\"The One I Love\\", theme song to the Korean television drama Hyena, on the KBS music program Music Bank on November 5, 2006. In February 2007, Leeteuk, Heechul, Kangin, Sungmin, Shindong and Eunhyuk formed Super Junior-T, a trot-singing group. They released their first single \\"Rokuko\\" on February 23, 2007, and made a debut performance on Popular Songs two days later.  Super Junior's second official album was intended for a late 2006 release, but due to several accidental setbacks, Don't Don was not released until September 20, 2007. Don't Don sold over 60,000 units the first day of release and debuted at number one on the monthly chart of September 2007. Although Don't Don received mixed reviews from critics, the album went to sell more than 160,000 copies by the end of the year, becoming the second best-selling record of 2007. Super Junior received seven nominations at the 2007 Mnet/KM Music Festival, winning three of them which included Artist of the Year, termed by many as the highest recognition of the ceremony. Super Junior collected two more recognitions at the 22nd Golden Disk Awards, including a Disk Bonsang award (Record of the Year). Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","output":"Yes, there are several other interesting aspects about this article: 1. The Rotational Concept: Initially, SM Entertainment planned for Super Junior to have a rotational concept, where new members would be added and existing members would graduate from the group. This idea was eventually dropped after the addition of Kyuhyun in 2006. 2. Impact on International Markets: The group's single \\"Miracle\\" topped the music charts in Thailand, hinting at their potential influence in international markets that would later become more prominent. 3. Subgroups: Super Junior has formed various subgroups in their career, such as Super Junior-K.R.Y. and Super Junior-T. These subgroups allow individual members to showcase their unique talents and explore different musical genres. 4. Don't Don: Super Junior's second album, Don't Don, sold over 60,000 units on its first day of release and became the second best-selling record of 2007. This showcases the group's commercial success and their growing popularity in the music industry. 5. Award Recognition: Super Junior has consistently been acknowledged in the music industry, winning numerous awards at different music award ceremonies, including the prestigious Artist of the Year award at the 2007 Mnet/KM Music Festival."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Farid Shawqi Mohammad Abduh Badawi, known as Farid Shawqi, was an Egyptian actor, screenwriter, and film producer born on July 30, 1920, in Cairo and passed away on July 27, 1998. Throughout his career, he acted in 361 films, 12 plays, and 12 television series, wrote 22 film scripts, and produced 26 films. Shawqi was also known by various nicknames, including Malek el Terso (meaning \\"The King of the Third Class\\"), in reference to his popularity among the poor who bought third-class seats in movie theaters. He was also called \\"Wahsh ash Shashah al Arabiyah,\\" meaning \\"the monster of the Arab silver screen\\" due to his various roles as a beloved hero; \\"Farid Bay,\\" an informal title of respect; and \\"Abu el-Banat,\\" meaning \\"father of all girls,\\" owing to his having five daughters and no sons. In his almost 50-year-long career, Shawqi starred, produced, or wrote the scenario of over 400 films, which is more than the number of films produced collectively by the entire Arab world. His work spanned theatre, television, and video plays. Shawqi's popularity covered the whole Arab world, including Turkey, where he acted in some films. He worked with over 90 film directors and producers, who addressed him as \\"Farid Bay\\" out of respect. During the first ten years of his career, Shawqi was typically cast as a villain, and by the late 1940s, his name alongside that of the late Mahmoud El-Meliegy guaranteed box-office success. In 1950, he changed that image permanently by playing the leading role in \\"Ga'aloony Mujriman\\" (\\"They Made Me a Criminal\\"), a film that focused on the problem of homeless children and exposed the failure of government policy and corruption in state-run orphanages and young offenders' institutions. Although initially disliked by the establishment, the film later received the state prize. Shawqi went on to collect 10 Best Actor awards in numerous festivals and four other awards for his film scripts in the next three decades. Critics referred to him as the \\"tragedy hero\\" of the Arab cinema due to his influential roles and contributions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reviewer expresses their disappointment and frustration with the movie, describing it as \\"one of the dumbest movies\\" they have ever seen. They criticize the unrealistic scenes, poor acting, and weak plot while seeming unimpressed with the characters and their actions.

The answer to this question is:","output":"James Merrill won the Pulitzer Prize, a prestigious award in the world of literature. The Pulitzer Prize is an annual accolade established in 1917 by provisions in the will of Joseph Pulitzer, an American-Hungarian newspaper publisher.

His elegant writing is often praised for its deftly woven narratives and emotional resonance. Throughout his illustrious career, Merrill was awarded many distinctions, including the National Book Award for Poetry and the Bollingen Prize in Poetry. One of his most renowned works is \\"Divine Comedies,\\" a collection of poems that earned him the Pulitzer Prize for Poetry in 1977. \\"Diving into the Wreck\\" by Adrienne Rich and \\"The Collected Poems\\" by Howard Nemerov were also finalists for the Pulitzer Prize that year. Inspired by Dante Alighieri's \\"Divine Comedy,\\" Merrill's work reflects a profound exploration of life, love, and identity through intricately crafted verse. \\"Divine Comedies,\\" with its provocative themes and rich imagery, remains a masterpiece in the annals of American poetry.

Information:  - MTV (originally an initialism of Music Television) is an American cable and satellite television channel owned by Viacom Media Networks (a division of Viacom) and headquartered in New York City. Launched on August 1, 1981, the channel originally aired music videos as guided by television personalities known as \\"video jockeys\\" (VJs). In its early years, MTV's main target demographic was young adults, but today it is primarily towards teenagers, high school students and college students. MTV has toned down its music video programming significantly in recent years, and its programming now consists mainly of original reality, comedy and drama programming and some off-network syndicated programs and films, with limited music video programming in off-peak time periods. It has received criticism towards this change of focus, both by certain segments of its audience and musicians. MTV's influence on its audience, including issues involving censorship and social activism, has also been a subject of debate for several years.  - RCA Records is an American major record label owned by Sony Music Entertainment (SME). It is one of SME's flagship record labels alongside sister labels Columbia Records and Epic Records. The label has released multiple genres of music, including pop, rock, hip hop, R&B, blues, jazz, and country. The company's name is derived from the initials of the label's former parent company, Radio Corporation of America (RCA). It is the second oldest recording company in U.S. history, after sister label Columbia Records. RCA's Canadian unit (formerly Berliner Gramophone Canada) is Sony's oldest label in Canada.

Modern music videos are primarily made and used as a marketing device intended to promote the sale of music recordings. There are also cases where songs are used in tie in marketing campaigns that allow them to become more than just a song. Tie ins and merchandising could be used in toys or marketing campaigns for food and other products. Although the origins of music videos date back to musical short films that first appeared in the 1920s, they came into prominence in the 1980s when MTV based their format around the medium.

The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world's economy can decline.  - The Velvet Underground was an American rock band from New York City, active between 1964 and 1973. Formed by singer/guitarist Lou Reed, multi-instrumentalist John Cale, guitarist Sterling Morrison, and drummer Angus Maclise (who was replaced by Maureen Tucker in 1965), the group was briefly managed by the pop artist Andy Warhol, and served as the house band at the Factory and Warhol's \\"Exploding Plastic Inevitable\\" events from 1966 to 1967. Despite achieving little commercial success during its existence, the Velvet Underground is now recognized as among the most influential bands of all time for its integration of rock music with the avant-garde.   - Epic Records is an American record company.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: This is a beauty myth that I have been wanting to bust for a while as I am surprised how many people actually believe it. I am quite vain so hate having visible grey hairs. Having naturally dark brown hair means that even a single grey hair is very noticeable. From the age of about 22 or 23 I discovered that I had about five grey hairs floating about. As soon as I could see them I'd pull them out. Then, a few months later when they were rearing their ugly heads again - pluck, out they'd come again! Up until I was about 27 or 28 I only had these 5 grey hairs, well that was all I could find anyway. Then from 28 onwards they have been inviting their friends and relatives to move in and I am slowly losing the plucking battle (side note: this increase in grey hairs at 28 was also the year that I got married...I wonder if their is any correlation between getting married and going grey??). Whenever I was having a conversation with someone about grey hairs and I'd mention that I pull mine out, they'd look at me horrified - 'you can't do that, seven more will grow back in its place' they would all warn me. Even my hairdresser was horrified that I plucked my grey hairs. One day when she was straightening my hair I could see a stray grey sticking up and it was driving me crazy. I asked her to pull it out and she refused saying that I'd end up with more if she pulled it out. I have never believed this old wives tale, mostly because for five years I kept plucking my greys yet they didn't increase in number. Plus it made no sense to me. Why would plucking greys cause more greys to grow when the same is not true for your coloured hair. Imagine if it were true - that would mean that the cure for baldness would be to pluck out your hair as each hair you pluck causes seven more to grow in its place - doesn't really make sense, does it? Or worse, each time you waxed your legs, seven hairs replaced each pulled one - what state would your legs be in now? Who is the hairdresser?

We have an equation: 31*i + 1026 = 93*i + 52*i First, we need to combine the \\"i\\" terms on the right side of the equation. So, we add 93*i and 52*i together: 93*i + 52*i = 145*i Now, our equation looks like this: 31*i + 1026 = 145*i Next, we want to get all the \\"i\\" terms on one side and the numbers (without \\"i\\") on the other side. To do this, we can subtract 31*i from both sides: 145*i - 31*i = 1026 This subtraction gives us: 114*i = 1026 Now, we want to find out what \\"i\\" is by itself.

Context: Gunshots rang out once again on a campus in the United States on Wednesday. Students and faculty raced out of harm's way, ducked under furniture, barricaded doors and hid in interior rooms, bathrooms and labs. The short-lived nightmare on the campus of the University of California, Los Angeles came one day before Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day. Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Answer: A:","output":"The politics regarding gun rights in the United States is a deeply contentious and polarizing issue. There is a unique relationship between Americans and their guns, and this relationship is enshrined in the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which protects the right to bear arms. The roots of this amendment can be traced back to English common law and the concept of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and civic duty. On one side of the political spectrum, there are strong proponents of gun rights who argue that the Second Amendment is an inviolable part of the Constitution and that Americans have the right to own and carry firearms for self-defense and other lawful purposes. This group includes organizations like the National Rifle Association, which is a powerful lobbying force in American politics. They advocate for broad access to firearms, minimal regulations on gun ownership, and a strict interpretation of the Second Amendment. They are also likely to reject campaigns like Wear Orange: National Gun Violence Awareness Day as \\"pointless\\" and merely a way of \\"scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" On the other side, there are individuals and organizations that advocate for tighter gun control measures, as they believe that the current regulations and background check procedures are flawed, riddled with loopholes, and contribute to the high rates of gun-related violence in the country. This group includes civic organizations, politicians, and celebrities that participate in awareness campaigns like Wear Orange. They argue for more comprehensive background checks, waiting periods, and restrictions on certain types of weapons and accessories. The politics surrounding gun rights in the United States is marked by a deep divide, with both sides steadfastly advocating for their respective positions. This has resulted in an ongoing political debate that traverses all levels of government and society with little consensus on the most effective approach to minimizing gun-related violence while respecting the rights enumerated in the Second Amendment. As exemplified by the Wear Orange campaign and the UCLA shooting incident, the issue continues to provoke strong emotions and fierce disagreements throughout the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Netflix on Wednesday released a new teaser for House of Cards' sixth season — and it finally reveals the fate of Kevin Spacey's character, Frank Underwood.      Spacey was fired from the show last fall due to allegations of sexual abuse made by multiple men. Since then, nobody was sure exactly how the Netflix series would handle Underwood's absence, given he was the show's main character.      This new teaser confirms that, as you might expect, Underwood is dead in the new season. The brief video released on Twitter shows Robin Wright's Claire Underwood standing over her husband's grave, saying, \\"I'll tell you this, though, Francis. When they bury me, it won't be in my backyard. And when they pay their respects, they'll have to wait in line.\\"      Underwood's tombstone is then revealed; he's buried next to his father, who died of a heart attack at a young age. Fans have speculated that the former president will die of a heart attack like his father.      House of Cards' sixth and final season will premiere on Netflix on Nov. 2.

The Cards team decided to continue on an finish the final season without Spacey and, it seems, Frank.      Claire Underwood (Robin Wright) ended season 6 as the President and it appears she’s determined to build a legacy that will stand the test of time.      Standing in front of Frank’s grave (he’s buried next to his father), she says coldly, “I’ll tell you this, though, Frances. When they bury me, it won’t be in my backyard.

Tests: David Nutt wants to investigate whether magic mushrooms work in treating depression. Campaigners have criticised a decision. to award £550,000 of public funds to a sacked government drugs tsar so. he can investigate whether magic mushrooms work in treating depression. Professor David Nutt was forced out of. his role as the Government’s chief drug adviser in 2009 for saying. ecstasy was less dangerous than horseriding. He now wants to study whether the. hallucinogenic ingredient in magic mushrooms, psilocybin, can be used to. treat severe depression. His team has been given a grant by the Medical. Research Council for a pioneering trial on 60 sufferers who have failed. to respond to two previous treatments. But he said he cannot start because. the Home Office must first grant a licence for companies to supply his. team with the compound. Critics say Professor Nutt’s track record makes him an inappropriate choice to carry out the research. Previously, he opposed the decision to. reclassify cannabis from Class C to Class B in 2009, and has argued. alcohol was ‘considerably more dangerous’ than the drug. Last year, he. led a controversial live trial of pure ecstasy on Channel 4. Mary Brett, of Europe Against Drugs,. said of the latest project: ‘Why are the MRC giving money to a man who. had got it completely wrong over cannabis? Professor Nutt’s patchy. record raises questions. He seems obsessed with recreational drugs.’ Magic mushrooms, with heroin and cocaine, are Class A drugs and are believed to exacerbate mental health problems in some users. Previously Professor Nutt’s team at. Imperial College London found psilocybin reduced activity in a part of. the brain known to be over-active in depression. But that study was on. healthy volunteers subject to less stringent regulations. Only four hospitals in Britain have a. licence to hold psilocybin, and Professor Nutt said the authorities. refused to tell him where. He said: ‘The rules are absurd.’ Risk: Magic mushrooms, with heroin and cocaine, are Class A drugs and are believed to exacerbate mental health problems in some users. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"In this article, it is reported that Profesor David Nutt, a former government drugs tsar who was dismissed in 2009 for claiming that ecstasy was less dangerous than horseriding, has been awarded £550,000 in public funds by the Medical Research Council for a trial to investigate whether psilocybin, the hallucinogenic ingredient in magic mushrooms, can be used to treat severe depression. The trial aims to involve 60 participants who have failed to respond to at least two previous treatments. However, to begin the study, Nutt's team is required to obtain a license from the Home Office to allow companies to supply them with the compound.  Critics argue that Nutt's past controversial statements and actions make him an unsuitable candidate for conducting this research.

In his team's previous research at Imperial College London, psilocybin was found to reduce activity in certain brain regions known to be over-active in depression, but this study was conducted on healthy volunteers and faced fewer regulatory constraints. To carry out the new research, Professor Nutt confronts the challenge of obtaining psilocybin, as only four hospitals in the UK hold a license for the compound, and the authorities have not disclosed their locations.

Like all dunks, a windmill requires you to jump high. Start a windmill dunk by approaching the basket while dribbling, then jump toward it as high as you can. Choose your answer from: [A]. Make sure your knees are bent, and you are not rolling by arching your back or tilting your head to make contact with the basket. You can also actually do a bounce dunk with your arms straight up. [B]. Your momentum may have carried you over once you jump, but the windmill dunk will remove that. Reach the basket after you've jumped. [C]. For beginners, this will only take a few seconds to get up close to the basket. Make a fast punch with your hands as you jump. [D]. Hold onto the ball with one hand. One of the distinctive features of a windmill dunk is that it is executed with one hand.","output":"[B]. Your momentum may have carried you over once you jump, but the windmill dunk will remove that. Reach the basket after you've jumped. Once you've reached the peak of your jump, begin to bring the ball up and behind your head in a circular motion. This movement is what gives the windmill dunk its name, as it mimics the motion of a windmill's blades spinning. Make sure you have a firm grip on the ball to prevent it from slipping out of your hand during the dunk. As you bring the ball behind your head, maintain control of it with one hand and keep your eyes on the rim. This is where timing and precision come into play. As your body starts to descend from the jump, extend your arm and forcefully whip the ball forward in a windmill motion, using your wrist and arm strength to propel it towards the basket. It is essential to maintain proper body position throughout the dunk. Keep your chest and shoulders upright and aligned with the basket to ensure the ball travels in a straight line. If you lean too far to one side, the ball may miss the rim entirely, leading to a failed dunk attempt. Additionally, try to keep your legs straight and together, as bending or spreading them apart can cause you to lose power and height. When executing the windmill dunk, be prepared for the impact as your hand makes contact with the rim. The force generated by the dunk can cause you to lose your grip on the rim or, in extreme cases, even injure your hand or fingers. Hold on to the rim firmly and keep your wrist and fingers strong to ensure a successful dunk. Finally, after completing the windmill motion and slamming the ball through the hoop, let go of the rim and land safely, with both feet on the ground. It's essential to bend your knees upon landing to absorb the impact and protect your joints from injury. As with any athletic feat, practice makes perfect. The more you practice your windmill dunk, the more confident and fluid your movements will become, ultimately allowing you to achieve a more impressive and powerful dunk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible answers: know robin's husband, ask for help, refuse to pay rent","output":"Based on the information provided, Remy appears to be in a situation where they needed financial assistance - possibly either for a personal situation or an unexpected crisis. It can be assumed that Remy is reaching out to those in their circle, such as friends or acquaintances, from whom they think they can seek help in times of need. Given that Remy decided to approach Robin's husband, it can be inferred that they might have had a pre-existing relationship or familiarity with each other. One possible reason for Remy approaching Robin's husband is that they know each other well and have a certain level of trust established between them. Remy might have felt more comfortable approaching someone who they have known for a long time or with whom they share a close bond. Furthermore, reaching out to Robin's husband rather than other friends could be because they might have easily recognized his financial stability and the ability to provide assistance. Another possible reason for Remy's actions could be their unwillingness to ask for help from multiple people. In some cases, people tend to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable when reaching out for help. As a result, Remy might have opted to only ask Robin's husband, potentially to avoid repeatedly exposing their vulnerability to a broader group of friends or acquaintances. It's also possible that Remy had already asked others for help and had been unsuccessful in getting the support they needed, so they decided to turn to Robin's husband as a last resort. Lastly, regarding the refusal to pay rent example, it is unclear how this particular reason would relate to Remy's request for money from Robin's husband. However, if Remy were in a tough financial situation where they cannot afford to pay their rent and have exhausted all other options, they might be compelled to approach someone like Robin's husband for assistance. In this case, the inability to pay rent would be an effect of the overall financial troubles Remy is facing rather than a direct cause for their request. In conclusion, Remy's request for money from Robin's husband can be attributed to several possible reasons, such as familiarity and trust between the two, Remy's discomfort asking for help from others, or an acute financial crisis such as the inability to pay rent. It is essential to gather more information about Remy and Robin's husband's relationship, Remy's personal and financial background, and prior requests for support to better understand Remy's motives behind their actions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Distant and little-inhabited area like Northern Scotland, are too remote for the development of large seaside resorts. For most children, going to the seaside suggests a week or fortnight of freedom on the beach, ideally a sandy one providing enough opportunities for the construction of sandcastle, fishing in pool, paddling in shallow water or swimming in deep water. Their parents spend sunny days swimming in the sea and sunbathing on the beach. Not that the British sun can be relied on and the depressing sight of families wandering round the town in old -fashioned and under umbrellas is only too common. However, there are always shops with their tourist souvenirs, plenty of cafes and if the worst comes to the worst, the cinema to offer a refuge. The average family is unlikely to seek accommodation in a hotel as they can stay more cheaply in a boarding-house. There are usually three or four-storeyed Victorian buildings, whose owners spend the summer season letting rooms to a number of couples or families and providing three cooked meals a day at what they describe as a reasonable price, with the hope that in this way they will add enough to their savings to see the winter through. Otherwise there are the camping sites for those who prefer self-catering.

Information:  - Zalmoxis  is a divinity of the Getae and Dacians (a people of the lower Danube), mentioned by Herodotus in his \\"Histories\\" IV, 9396.  - The Danube (, known by various names in other languages) is Europe's second-longest river, after the Volga River, and also the longest river in the European Union region. It is located in Central and Eastern Europe.  - See Kogaionon ( genus ) for the mammal from the Upper Cretaceous . Kogaionon was the holy mountain of the Geto - Dacians , the place where Zalmoxis stayed in an underground cave for three years . After his disappearance into Kogaionon , he was considered dead by the Getae but after three years he resurrected and showed himself to the people , who became convinced by his holy preaching when he emerged from Kogaionon . Strabo claims that a river with the same name flowed in the vicinity . One modern translation of Kogaionon is \`\` sacred mountain '' , which would be connected to a probable Dacian word kaga meaning \`\` sacred '' , attested in two early 2nd century inscriptions from Tomis . Kogaionon 's location is still under debate , but thought to be either in the area around the Dacian capital Sarmizegetusa Regia ( there is a 2291m summit there called Gugu and there are speculations that it could be the holy mountain ; it may also have been Dealul Grditei where the ruins of the sanctuaries of Sarmizegetusa are located ) or even the Ceahlu mountain , because every year on 6/7 August the shadow of the mountain forms a pyramid which is thought to have been made by the Dacians .  - The Getae or or Gets (singular ) are several Thracian tribes that once inhabited the regions to either side of the Lower Danube, in what is today northern Bulgaria and southern Romania. Both the singular form \\"Get\\" and plural \\"Getae\\" may be derived from a Greek exonym: the area was the hinterland of Greek colonies on the Black Sea coast, bringing the Getae into contact with the Ancient Greeks from an early date. Several scholars, especially in the Romanian historiography, posit the identity between the Getae and their westward neighbours, the Dacians.  - Herodotus (\\"Hródotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"historía\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their loss at Pittsburgh, the Patriots returned home for an interconference duel with the New York Giants, the first meeting since Super Bowl XLII where the Giants stopped their chances at going 19-0. After a scoreless first half, The Giants grabbed the lead in the third quarter, with a 22-yard field goal by placekicker Lawrence Tynes, followed by a 10-yard touchdown run by running back Brandon Jacobs. The Patriots got on the board, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Stephen Gostkowski. In the fourth quarter, the Patriots tied the game, with a 5-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Tom Brady to tight end Aaron Hernandez, then took the lead with a 45-yard field goal by Gostkowski. The Giants re-claimed the lead, with a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Eli Manning to wide receiver Mario Manningham with three minutes remaining. The Patriots responded, with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Brady to tight end Rob Gronkowski. However, with a minute and a half remaining in a similar repeat of Super Bowl XLII, Manning led the Giants on a game-winning drive, culminating with a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Jake Ballard. With the loss, the Patriots dropped to 5-3, and QB Tom Brady's streak of 32 consecutive home wins was snapped.  Following the game the Patriots released Albert Haynesworth, who'd reportedly gotten into a sideline confrontation with assistant coach Pepper Johnson. The loss was the third time in nine seasons the Patriots had suffered consecutive losses, and only the second time the team has lost to an NFC team at Gillette Stadium. This was the 1st time the Patriots had a 2-game losing streak since Week 12 and Week 13 in 2009. The Giants and the Patriots would meet again in Super Bowl XLVI with the Giants winning 21-17.

Question: Who withdraws from international politics? Movie title: Vexille Movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has advanced to the point that cybernetics have become plausible. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research and development in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, the governing body, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage.In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructed a series of 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field that distorts the entire electromagnetic spectrum, nullifying all communication between Japan and the outside world and making even satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but for all intents and purposes, Japan vanishes from the world scene.Ten years later, the American Navy technology Special Forces unit \\"SWORD\\" is lead on the intel of a Japanese informant of a trap set by Daiwa in Colorado.

This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose You more wisely keep the Cuckoo bird out happens, how will it affect MORE birds.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you propose involves keeping the Cuckoo bird out, which can have both direct and indirect effects on the bird population and the overall process. Cuckoo birds are known for their brood parasitism, meaning that they lay their eggs in the nests of other bird species. When the Cuckoo bird's egg hatches, the hatchling often pushes other eggs or hatchlings out of the nest, causing a decrease in the host bird's offspring survival rate. This behavior ultimately affects the host bird population and could lead to a reduction of other bird species. If the Cuckoo bird is kept out or excluded from the bird population, some direct and indirect effects may include: 1. Direct effect: An increase in the survival rate of the host bird species' offspring. With Cuckoo birds absent, host birds can successfully raise their own offspring without the threat of a Cuckoo hatchling pushing them out of the nest. 2. Direct effect: The host bird species may reproduce more efficiently, as they no longer need to invest as much energy in re-nesting due to brood parasitism by the Cuckoo bird. This can lead to an increase in the overall population of the host bird species. 3. Indirect effect: An increase in the host bird species population may lead to more birds occupying a given area. This could affect the ecosystem by promoting healthier populations of insects, the primary food source for many bird species. 4. Indirect effect: With an increase in the host bird population, predator-prey dynamics could shift. Predators that rely on the host bird species as a food source may have more available prey, potentially leading to an increase in predator populations. 5. Indirect effect: If the Cuckoo bird population decreases significantly due to the inability to parasitize host nests, this could indirectly affect the overall bird diversity in an ecosystem. Cuckoos may play a role in keeping certain host bird populations in check, and their absence could lead to an imbalance. In summary, keeping the Cuckoo bird out of the bird population can have both direct and indirect effects on the overall process. The direct effects involve the survival and reproduction of host bird species, while indirect effects involve changes in the ecosystem, predator-prey dynamics, and overall bird diversity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Under Section 377A, men who engage in \\"gross indecency\\" privately or publicly can be jailed for up to two years. Singapore, which largely remains conservative, has seen intense debate in recent years over gay rights. Human Rights Watch called the decision \\"a major setback for equal rights\\", adding that it \\"tramples upon basic rights to privacy, equality and non-discrimination\\". On Thursday, 14 local rights groups released a statement saying the court had missed an opportunity to show that Singapore was \\"a truly accepting, open and inclusive society\\". The groups said Section 377A \\"gives carte blanche for discrimination and reinforces prejudice\\". \\"To be viewed as equal in the eyes of the law... is a right to which every Singaporean should be entitled, and not denied on the basis of whom they love,\\" they added. Jean Chong, spokesman for lesbian group Sayoni, told the BBC that the ruling effectively made homosexual, bisexual and transgender Singaporeans \\"second-class citizens\\". Government leaders have pledged not to enforce Section 377A, first introduced in 1938 by British colonial rulers. But they have also refused to remove it, saying it reflects the conservative mores of Singapore society. Lawyers involved in the legal challenges, mounted separately by a gay couple and a gay man, argued that the law went against the constitution guaranteeing \\"life and liberty\\" and equal protection. But the court rejected these claims, and said it was up to legislators to decide on the law. Though surveys have shown most Singaporeans do not accept homosexuality, there is widespread tolerance. Since 2009 rights groups have held an annual rally known as Pink Dot, which this year drew its largest-ever crowd of 26,000. But conservatives have pushed back against gay activism and campaigned vigorously for Section 377A to remain.

My oldest we've nicknamed the \\"Evil Genius\\" is ambitious, self-confident, and suffers no fools. Whenever we mentioned Santa my husband and I were rewarded with major eye rolling and deep sighs from my oldest. At first we both tried to ignore it.

I looked at my husband in the eye and said, \\"I'll handle this.\\" to which he responded \\"Okay just be careful because I'm not sure he knows - he might just be acting like it.\\" But I knew. And I had it in my mind that he was about to break his younger brothers spirit and break the news to him. I was afraid he was going to take the Christmas spirit away from my sweet innocent youngest and stamp all over it. I had to protect him. I needed to control this now before it got out of control. I rushed into the play room where my oldest was playing alone. I looked him dead in the eyes and said: \\"Well you know Santa isn't real, right?\\"  And as I stared at my eight-year-old son for what seemed like a long time of silence, his eyes started to fill with tears.

They decide to escape their woes and hike to a remote village in Norfolk that they find on an old map. As they arrive at a pub in the village, with Jimmy upset about Fletch destroying his phone, they see a number of attractive foreign female history students leaving. Hoping to find more beautiful women inside, they are greeted by a morose crowd of men and approached by a seemingly crazed vicar who believes Jimmy is a long lost descendant of a local vampire slayer. As the barman offers the two men free ale as an apology for the vicar, they learn the students they saw earlier are going to a cottage, where they are to stay the night. Jimmy and Fletch pursue the students' van, catching up to it as the engine has broken down, and are introduced to four girls (Heidi, Lotte, Anke and Trudi).

Summarize this article in one sentence. Place the desired weight on each end of the barbell. Stand in front of the barbell with your feet shoulder- or hip-width apart. While bending slightly at the knees, lean forward at the hips until your torso is at a 45° angle to the floor. Maintain the natural arch in your lower back. It is always better to underestimate rather than overestimate the amount of weight you can lift. Lifting too much weight can lead to injuries. With your arms extended towards the floor, grip the top of the bar. Place your palms slightly more than shoulder width apart. Contract the muscles in your lower back and abdominal area. As you lift the barbell off the ground, extend your knees slightly while maintaining the position of your torso. Pause just before the barbell reaches your knees. This is the starting position. Some lifters prefer to lift the barbell only slightly off the ground. Doing so may cause you to strain your back. Exhale as you pull the barbell towards your lower chest. Keep your elbows tight against your body and your torso stationary. At the top of the lift, pause and contract your back muscles. Inhale as you lower the bar to its initial position (slightly below your knees). Repeat. Instead of executing a traditional bent over row with a barbell, try altering your grip to work a different muscle group or intensify your workout.  Use an underhand grip. Instead of grabbing the bar from above, grip the barbell from below. When your palms are facing up, you take the strain off your back by forcing your biceps and lats to do more work. Use a snatch grip. A snatch grip is a double wide grip.

Article: The modern concept of an abstract group developed out of several fields of mathematics. The original motivation for group theory was the quest for solutions of polynomial equations of degree higher than 4. The 19th-century French mathematician Évariste Galois, extending prior work of Paolo Ruffini and Joseph-Louis Lagrange, gave a criterion for the solvability of a particular polynomial equation in terms of the symmetry group of its roots (solutions). The elements of such a Galois group correspond to certain permutations of the roots. At first, Galois' ideas were rejected by his contemporaries, and published only posthumously. More general permutation groups were investigated in particular by Augustin Louis Cauchy. Arthur Cayley's On the theory of groups, as depending on the symbolic equation θn = 1 (1854) gives the first abstract definition of a finite group.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: slow motion dolly shot with pan of a waterfall","output":"In the given sentence \\"slow motion dolly shot with pan of a waterfall,\\" the most important words are: 1. Slow motion: \\"Slow motion\\" refers to the cinematic technique of slowing down the playback of filmed footage. This is usually achieved by capturing the scene at a higher frame rate than the standard 24 or 30 frames per second. The resulting effect is a smooth, elongated representation of the action, which often highlights details that would otherwise be missed at regular speed. 2. Dolly shot: A \\"dolly shot\\" is a camera movement where the entire camera is mounted on a wheeled platform, known as a dolly, and is moved smoothly along the ground, usually on a set of tracks. This allows for smooth tracking shots and precise control over the camera's position and movement. Dolly shots can be used to create a sense of depth and motion in a scene, adding visual interest and dynamism. 3. Pan: \\"Pan\\" is short for \\"panning,\\" which is a camera movement where the camera is rotated horizontally on its vertical axis, usually while mounted on a tripod or other stable support. This allows the camera to sweep across a scene, capturing a wide field of view and providing a sense of space and scale. Panning shots can be used to reveal new information or follow the movement of a subject in a scene. 4. Waterfall: In this context, \\"waterfall\\" is the subject of the shot and the primary focus of the visual scene. Waterfalls are natural features where water flows over a drop or a series of drops in a river or stream. They are often visually arresting and can evoke feelings of awe, serenity, and the passage of time. Capturing a waterfall in slow motion and with a dolly shot with pan can create a dynamic, engaging, and visually stunning sequence. In summary, the most important words in the given sentence – \\"slow motion,\\" \\"dolly shot,\\" \\"pan,\\" and \\"waterfall\\" – convey crucial information about the technique, camera movement, and subject matter of the shot being described. These words provide a clear mental image of what the viewer can expect in terms of visual pacing, space, and focus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By Jill Reilly Ukrainian former prime minister Yulia Tymoshenko, released from jail last month after her rival Viktor Yanukovich fled from power, announced today that said she would run again for president in an election on May 25. She also pledged to build a strong army and said she hoped to be able to recover Crimea from Russia, which annexed it last week. The announcement by the flamboyant Tymoshenko set up a contest with boxer-turned-politician Vitaly Klitschko, who has also declared his candidacy, and other figures who have emerged to contend for top posts after four months of political turmoil. Yanukovich, her nemesis, subsequently launched a campaign against her and her allies, and she was jailed in 2011 for abuse of office linked to a gas deal she brokered with","output":"Russia while prime minister. Tymoshenko, who has long been a controversial figure in Ukrainian politics, had her sentence condemned by the West as politically motivated. During her time in prison, she developed chronic back problems and underwent several operations. Her release from jail was one of the key demands of the mass protests that eventually led to Yanukovich's ousting. As the election approaches, Tymoshenko courts various political factions and establishes herself as a key figure in the race. Her charisma and experience make her a formidable candidate against Klitschko and other contenders. Despite the considerable public support for Klitschko, due to his achievements in the world of sports and his status as a political outsider, Tymoshenko's long political history and connections give her an advantage. Throughout the campaign, Tymoshenko promises to strengthen Ukraine's military and pursue a diplomatic solution to recover Crimea. She also vows to fight corruption, improve the economy, and pursue stronger ties with the European Union. Meanwhile, Klitschko focuses his campaign on his image as an outsider, proposing fresh approaches to Ukraine's most pressing issues, combatting corruption, and championing transparency. On May 25, the election takes place in a highly polarized political environment. After a long, hard-fought campaign, Yulia Tymoshenko wins the election by a narrow margin. Her victory is welcomed by her supporters, who believe that her experience and resilience make her the perfect candidate to lead Ukraine through this tumultuous time. However, her opponents raise concerns about her past controversies and question the legitimacy of her victory. Upon assuming office, President Tymoshenko's first priority is to address the issue of Crimea. She launches diplomatic efforts and works with the international community, particularly the European Union and the United States, to find a peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis. Despite her best efforts, Russia refuses to cede control of the region, citing the results of the 2014 Crimea referendum, in which Crimeans expressed their desire to join Russia. Despite the stalemate over Crimea, Tymoshenko works tirelessly to improve Ukraine's domestic situation. She pushes for radical reforms in governance, cracking down on corruption, and implementing policies to boost the economy. However, her presidency is not without its setbacks. Tymoshenko's government faces numerous challenges, such as ongoing tensions with Russia, internal divisions and resistance to reform, and mounting economic problems. During her time in office, Tymoshenko manages to forge closer ties with the European Union, laying the groundwork for future integration. Despite her initial promise to build a strong army, Tymoshenko eventually transitions to a policy of diplomacy and cooperation with regional powers, focusing on non-military means to ensure Ukraine's security and independence. As Tymoshenko's term comes to an end, despite numerous obstacles, her administration is credited with making important strides in reforming Ukraine's political landscape and fostering stronger ties with the West. However, the issue of Crimea remains unresolved and continues to weigh heavily on her legacy. In conclusion, the story ends with Yulia Tymoshenko as the President of Ukraine, working tirelessly to better her country and navigate through the many political and economic challenges. She manages to make significant progress in some areas, particularly in strengthening Ukraine's ties to the European Union and reforming the domestic political landscape, but the question of Crimea continues to be an unresolved issue that still haunts her legacy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Paul Reynolds crisscrossed his sketchbook with furious strokes, filling the pages with images of the vengeance he would take on his former coworkers at Fear and Loading Games. He'd founded the company three years back and, just a few hours ago, his partners and erstwhile friends had fired him without cause or warning. He concentrated hard as his pen brought to life demonic figures from one of the best-selling comics he'd created, scythe wielding cyber-men called Myrmidons who tore into surprised computer programmers with fangs and claws. Elsewhere on the page, computers assembled themselves into 21st century Golems, rising up against traitorous CEO's and producers to crush them to bloody pulp as they cowered beneath their desks. Sitting at the bar in Señor Goldstein's Mexican Restaurant in San Jose, California, Paul's own artwork engaged him for the first time in months, maybe years. Under other circumstances, that would have made him happy. But today's circumstances allowed only two emotions: despair and a burning desire for revenge. Not wanting to succumb to the former, and not quite wanting to find a gun and go back to the office, he instead drew. He had turned to a fresh page and begun to sketch his most elaborate revenge-scheme yet when a woman walked into his line of vision. There were four or five other women in the restaurant already (most of them employees), but this one stood out. This one would've stood out anywhere. Her hair, cut short and spiky, was dyed a magenta so bright it nearly glowed. She wore a tight black t-shirt, baggy olive drab shorts that hung on shapely hips, and heavy black boots with two inch thick soles. She had a faded black messenger bag slung across her chest, the strap pressing between her breasts. If Paul had to guess, she wasn't wearing a bra. She definitely wasn't your average Silicon Valley techie on an early lunch break, and certainly not a restaurant employee. Question: Who wanted revenge on his partners?

Here is a hypothesis: You can't watch world championship skiing at Cortina d'Ampezzo or Val Gardena. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The premise and the hypothesis contradict each other, and evaluating the truth of the hypothesis depends on gathering evidence independent of the premise. Let's break down the premise and the hypothesis to better understand this. Premise: \\"You can watch world championship skiing at Cortina d'Ampezzo and Val Gardena.\\" The premise statement suggests that world championship skiing events take place at two locations: Cortina d'Ampezzo and Val Gardena. It is implied that the audience can attend and/or view these events happening at these locations. The truth of the premise would depend on factors such as the existence of world championship skiing events and their occurrence at the mentioned locations. To verify whether this premise is true or false, one needs to check facts, schedules, and locations of world championship skiing events. Hypothesis: \\"You can't watch world championship skiing at Cortina d'Ampezzo or Val Gardena.\\" The hypothesis statement is the opposite of the premise, asserting that you cannot watch world championship skiing at either Cortina d'Ampezzo or Val Gardena. It implies that there are either no world championship skiing events at these locations or that the audience is not allowed to attend/view the events. To verify the truth of this hypothesis, one would follow the same process of checking facts, schedules, and locations of world championship skiing events. The two statements have opposite implications about the possibility of watching world championship skiing events at Cortina d'Ampezzo and Val Gardena. Therefore, one cannot conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. In fact, if the premise is true, it would directly contradict the hypothesis, suggesting that the hypothesis is false. Only by examining independent evidence, such as event schedules and locations, can we determine whether the premise or the hypothesis accurately reflects the reality of watching world championship skiing at Cortina d'Ampezzo and Val Gardena."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised  every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston. In her will, she left the museum a million dollars and a series of requirements about how it should be managed. One requirement is that the permanent collection cannot be changed.

OPT:  --no;  --yes;","output":"The answer is no; the two sentences do not mean the same thing. In the first sentence, \\"Pat died in 1988, and Yvonne died in 2007,\\" the statement is clear that Pat passed away in 1988 and Yvonne passed away in 2007. The sentence indicates that the two individuals died in different years. This sentence is organized and structured in a way that accurately communicates the years of death for both Pat and Yvonne. On the other hand, in the second sentence, \\"Pat and Yvonne died in 2007 in 1988,\\" there is a bit of confusion. The juxtaposition of both years is problematic and makes it difficult for readers to understand when exactly Pat and Yvonne passed away. The structure of this sentence is unclear, which can lead to misinterpretation and confusion. The key difference between these two sentences lies in the clarity and organization of the information presented. The first sentence offers a concise and unambiguous depiction of the years in which Pat and Yvonne died, while the second sentence is disorganized and confusing.

We have: -12 = 15 * q - 12 * q Imagine we have 15 apples multiplied by some number (q) and then we subtract 12 apples multiplied by the same number (q). And this will be equal to -12 apples. So, first, let's see what happens when we subtract the apples: 15 * q apples - 12 * q apples = (15 - 12) * q apples There is a difference of 3 apples between 15 and 12. So, we now have: 3 * q apples = -12 apples Now, let's find out how many times we need to multiply 3 apples by a number (q) to have -12 apples. To do that, we divide the total number of apples (-12) by the number of apples we're trying to multiply (3): q = -12 apples / 3 apples Since -12 divided by 3 is -4, this means: q = -4 So, our answer is q = -4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Modern electrification systems take AC energy from a power grid which is delivered to a locomotive and converted to a DC voltage to be used by traction motors. These motors may either be DC motors which directly use the DC or they may be 3-phase AC motors which require further conversion of the DC to 3-phase AC (using power electronics). Thus both systems are faced with the same task: converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive. Where should this conversion take place and at what voltage and current (AC or DC) should the power flow to the locomotive? And how does all this relate to energy-efficiency? Both the transmission and conversion of electric energy involve losses: ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors). Power conversion for a DC system takes place mainly in a railway substation where large, heavy, and more efficient hardware can be used as compared to an AC system where conversion takes place aboard the locomotive where space is limited and losses are significantly higher. Also, the energy used to blow air to cool transformers, power electronics (including rectifiers), and other conversion hardware must be accounted for. What is the main action AC and DC systems have to deal with?","output":"The main action both AC and DC systems have to deal with is converting and transporting high-voltage AC from the power grid to low-voltage DC in the locomotive, while maintaining energy efficiency and minimizing losses during the conversion and transmission process. This involves managing ohmic losses in wires and power electronics, and magnetic field losses in transformers and smoothing reactors (inductors).

The band was formed in 1992 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Corey Taylor, Mick Thomson, Jim Root, Paul Gray, Craig Jones, Sid Wilson, Shawn Crahan, Chris Fehn and Joey Jordison. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011-2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele. Anticipation for Slipknot's second album was intense. In early 2001, the band began recording the second album at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles. Around this time, conflicts arose between band members due to extensive touring and recording schedules. Recording of their second album ended in February 2001 and the band embarked on their Iowa World Tour. Entitled Iowa, Slipknot's second album - released on August 28, 2001 - peaked at number three on the Billboard charts and at number one in the UK. The album produced three singles; \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" (promotional single), \\"Left Behind\\", and \\"My Plague\\", which appeared on the soundtrack for the film Resident Evil. In 2002, Slipknot appeared in Rollerball (2002), performing \\"I Am Hated\\". The release and intense promotion of the album resulted in sold-out shows in large arenas in several countries.  In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus because of internal conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream.

Based on this premise, we can analyze the hypothesis \\"I don't want to use that, but I will\\" to evaluate its validity by breaking it down into two main components: 1. \\"I don't want to use that\\": This part of the hypothesis suggests that the individual is not willing or is reluctant to use the object or option being discussed.

Q:Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? The serial killer who shares the same name as a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist born in 1966 is known for doing what to his victims? A:","output":"The serial killer who shares the same name as a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist born in 1966 is Robert Lee Yates Jr. The novelist with which he shares the name is Sherman Alexie, who was also born in 1966 and who is a Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American. Both men are distinctly different individuals who are well-known in different fields, one in literature and the other in criminal justice.  The serial killer, Robert Lee Yates Jr., is known for a series of brutal and horrifying murders. From 1975 to 1998, Yates targeted young women who were often engaged in sex work or were suffering from drug addiction, thus, making them vulnerable and less likely to be easily missed. He prowled the streets in and around the Spokane, Washington area, specifically focusing on the east Sprague Avenue, where many potential victims were located.  Robert Lee Yates Jr.'s modus operandi was quite specific. He used his calm demeanor and the anonymity of his seemingly innocuous profession (he was a National Guard helicopter pilot) to lure victims into his vehicle. Then he would shoot them in the head, predominantly with a .25 caliber pistol, and later dispose of their bodies in rural and secluded areas.  Another turn of his signature modes, he often returned to where he dumped their bodies to commit necrophilia. It was also stated during numerous reports that Yates sometimes covered the bodies of his victims with a plastic sheet and discarded them in somewhat hidden locations such as under bushes or overgrown grass.  In some cases, he even cleaned up the bodies, removed their clothes, and then redressed them after he killed them. He'd sometimes leave money, usually coins, on or near the bodies.  To date, he has been convicted of 15 murders but he is suspected to have committed more. His gruesome spree was put to an end in 2000 when he was arrested, and he's now serving a 408-year sentence along with two death sentences. Conversely, Sherman Alexie, the Spokane-Coeur d'Alene-American novelist born in 1966, is an award-winning author, poet, and filmmaker. His work primarily focuses on contemporary Native American identity, reservation life, and issues of poverty, alcoholism, and race. Despite sharing the same birth year and geographical region with a serial killer, Alexie's contributions to society have been meaningful and enlightening.  A curious coincidence, but it's critical to clarify that these two men, while sharing certain superficial characteristics, are very much different in their actions and their impacts on the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Media playback is not supported on this device The former Scotland midfielder finished off a fine team move with an early side-footed effort into the far corner. Then his deep cross was headed over keeper Owain Fon Williams by Conor Sammon for a healthy half-time lead. Cowie fired in after Sammon returned the compliment and contributed to one of two clinical Sam Nicholson finishes ahead of a Callum Paterson own goal. It could have been worse for Caley Thistle - who are bottom of the Scottish Premiership without a point after three games - with Arnaud Djoum sending a last-minute drive off the inside of a post. For Hearts, it was a welcome first league win that not only elevates them to fifth place but lifts some early pressure on head coach Robbie Neilson. Despite the visitors enjoying an early chance when Josh Meekings headed a Greg Tansey corner kick wide, it was Hearts who enjoyed the better of the first half. Cowie's opening goal, his first for the Tynecastle club, was the result of a fluent passage of play. John Souttar's pass was dummied by Cowie to allow it to reach Sammon and the big striker laid it into the path of his captain, who curled a terrific left-foot curler into the far corner. Cowie's industrious midfield play also caught the eye and he was involved in Hearts' second goal as well - this time as creator. After mazy play from Tony Watt, the striker released Cowie wide on the right and his cross was perfect for Sammon to leap and head past Fon Williams from six yards. It took only two minutes of the second half for Cowie to double his tally. The result of another sweeping move, Watt and Sammon were involved in the build-up and Cowie this time used his right foot to curl the ball beyond the goalkeeper's reach from 18 yards. Nicholson had already had an appeal for a penalty waved aside by referee Steven McLean after he tumbled under the challenge of Gary Warren, before showing his predatory instincts with two goals in the space of two minutes. The winger's first was a powerful 20-yard drive after being sent clear by a neat back-heel from debutant striker Bjorn Johnsen. His second came from a low shot after being played in by Cowie. The thought of a hat-trick was very much in the mind of Cowie, but his manager had other ideas as he took him off to a standing ovation 10 minutes from the end. The Highlanders had their moments in the first period, but they failed to take the opportunities that came their way. Warren had a header saved by goalkeeper Jack Hamilton, while Scott Boden had two chances but fluffed his efforts. Alex Fisher replaced the latter and, within seconds, came close to pulling a goal back for Caley Thistle with an acrobatic overhead kick that Hamilton turned wide before Nicholson's double. Foran's side did pull a goal back three minutes from the end when Paterson could only flick it into his own net when trying to block Ross Draper's shot, but Hearts could have won by a greater margin. Hearts head coach Robbie Neilson: \\"When we brought Don in last January, he wasn't fit - he had a little problem with his calf muscles - but over the summer he rested and you can see the quality he has. \\"He's got a group of players he works with in training and they all buy into what he does and he definitely is leading by example. \\"I thought the performance was really good today. I said that last week, but today the performance was really good and we scored goals, which was really pleasing.\\" Inverness Caledonian Thistle manager Richie Foran: \\"I don't think it was a 5-1. We had more chances on goal today than we had in the previous three games, but you've got to put the ball in the net. \\"We had too many players underperforming as well. I've got to take a big part of the blame for that as well - I picked the team, I picked the tactics, I picked the training through the week. \\"They are top players but I'm not getting the best out of a few of them at the moment, so I'll take the blame for today. \\"I know exactly what we need and we've got two players coming in on Monday. I don't want to put their names out there until they sign on the dotted line.

In Paris, a Dinner Where Food and Jewelry Commingle “Scandinavian bling” is how the Danish jewelry designer Sophie Bille Brahe jokingly describes her new spring/summer 2017 collection, which will be presented in Paris tonight. Though she is best known for designing elegant single earrings —most notably a crescent-shaped style with a row of white diamonds — this season, for the first time, she will offer them in pairs. One such style, the “Kelly Boucle” hoops, are cast in gold and capped at each end with either Japanese Akoya pearls or diamonds. Named for the rapper Chris Kelly, one-half of the ’90s hip-hop duo Kris Kross, they can be worn back to front — just like the drop-crotch reversible pants he made famous. In true Scandi style, Sophie, who trained as a goldsmith and works exclusively with gold, has kept the “bling” tastefully light, employing only a minimal amount. To bring the collection to life, the 36-year-old designer approached her younger brother, Frederik Bille Brahe, chef and owner of the hip restaurants Caf Atelier September and Restaurant Havfruen in Copenhagen. Together, they’ve conceived the idea for an intimate, candlelit dinner for 30 people, where food and jewelry will appear side-by-side. Inspired by Sophie’s opulent new collection, Frederik, who has flown in to Paris for just 48 hours, has sourced ingredients for a decadent yet simple menu. There will be boiled eggs with caviar to start, followed by risotto lavished with gold leaf and shaved black truffle — “I bought half a kilo from Italy,” he says, his eyes lighting up. Like Sophie’s designs, each of Fredrik’s creations centers on one precious ingredient. “The whole essence of what I do is high-quality produce, cooked as it should be cooked,” he says. “There is always one hero product — it might be a beautiful tomato marinated in honey and served with herbs, but the tomato is the centerpiece.” Sophie acknowledges their shared approach: “I like a cleanness in my materials: If I use a diamond, I want it to be the purest diamond; I don’t want it to be decorative,” she says, “My brother works with produce in the same way.” For the presentation of her collection and the food, Sophie has spent weeks scouring antique stores and friends’ basements in Copenhagen for unique tableware. She’s pulled together a pastiche of porcelain, in a palette of deep rose pink and faded green, which will offset the gold jewelry displayed on cake stands in the center of the dining table. For each of the guests, Sophie has also plated antique demitasse spoons in 14-karat gold and set a freshwater pearl in the spoon’s bowl. Wildflowers and fresh fruit, spilling over platters, will complete the picture. Such homey touches are important to the siblings, who aspire to create a familial setting that will encourage guests to slow down and savor the experience. This evening’s desert, for example, a lemon pie inspired by one their mother always makes, finishes the meal on a very personal note. As Sophie puts it: “People attach feelings to jewelry like they do with food — both are always associated with memories.” What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"Danish jewelry designer Sophie Bille Brahe is presenting her Scandinavian-inspired new spring/summer 2017 collection in Paris, which she describes as \\"Scandinavian bling.\\" Known for her elegant single earrings, this season she will offer them in pairs.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - In elementary geometry, a polytope is a geometric object with flat sides, and may exist in any general number of dimensions \\"n\\" as an \\"n\\"-dimensional polytope or \\"n\\"-polytope. For example, a two-dimensional polygon is a 2-polytope and a three-dimensional polyhedron is a 3-polytope.  - In computer science, program optimization or software optimization is the process of modifying a software system to make some aspect of it work more efficiently or use fewer resources. In general, a computer program may be optimized so that it executes more rapidly, or is capable of operating with less memory storage or other resources, or draw less power.  - In computer science and particularly in compiler design, loop nest optimization (LNO) is an optimization technique that applies a set of loop transformations for the purpose of locality optimization or parallelization or other loop overhead reduction of the loop nests. One classical usage is to reduce memory access latency or the cache bandwidth necessary due to cache reuse for some common linear algebra algorithms.  - The polyhedral model ( also called the polytope method ) is a mathematical framework for loop nest optimization in program optimization . The polytope method treats each loop iteration within nested loops as lattice points inside mathematical objects called polytopes , performs affine transformations or more general non-affine transformations such as tiling on the polytopes , and then converts the transformed polytopes into equivalent , but optimized ( depending on targeted optimization goal ) , loop nests through polyhedra scanning .  - The Multinational Aircrew Electronic Warfare Tactics Facility Polygone - POLYGON is an Electronic Warfare Tactics Range located on the border between Germany and France. It is a tri-national facility operated by France, Germany and the United States.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - Geometry (from the ; \\"geo-\\" \\"earth\\", \\"-metron\\" \\"measurement\\") is a branch of mathematics concerned with questions of shape, size, relative position of figures, and the properties of space. A mathematician who works in the field of geometry is called a geometer.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.  - In elementary geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or polyhedrons) is a solid in three dimensions with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices. The word polyhedron comes from the Classical Greek , as \\"poly-\\" (stem of , \\"many\\") + \\"-hedron\\" (form of , \\"base\\" or \\"seat\\").  - A computer program is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task when executed by a computer. A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit.  - A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.

Write a title: AP - Emboldened by their Election Day successes, some Christian conservatives around the country are trying to put more Christ into Christmas this season.","output":"Title: \\"Election Day Triumphs: The Rising Influence of Christian Conservatives in Celebrating a Christ-Centric Christmas Season\\" In recent years, political dynamics have undergone a significant shift across the United States. This change has become increasingly evident as the voices and influences of various groups continue to mold the social and political landscape. One such group is Christian conservatives, who have found new inspiration and determination following their Election Day successes. As these individuals navigate the societal sphere, they are taking tangible steps to reinforce the presence of Christ in the holiday season - a time when commercialization has seemingly diluted the essence of Christmas. Election Day served as a crucial turning point for Christian conservatives as they found renewed hope and influence in their political endeavors. With the victories of several key candidates aligned with their beliefs and values, these conservatives saw their power ascend to uncharted heights. This rise in influence has led to a resurgence of interest in bringing the true meaning of Christmas – a celebration of Jesus Christ's birth – back to the forefront of the holiday season. It appears that Christian conservatives, emboldened by their Election Day accomplishments, are striving to counterbalance the oftentimes overwhelming commercialized focus of the holidays with a deeper, more spiritual emphasis on Christ.  To achieve this, Christian conservatives are advocating for a variety of measures to honor and highlight the significance of Jesus in the season's festivities. These efforts include promoting and supporting nativity scenes on public property, emphasizing prayer and worship throughout the season, and encouraging people to opt for traditional religious greetings, such as \\"Merry Christmas,\\" instead of generic alternatives such as \\"Happy Holidays.\\" As part of this expanding movement, Christian conservatives are forming connections and partnerships with like-minded individuals and organizations. Their collective goal is to use their newfound political influence to advocate for policy changes and initiatives that give prominence to Christian values during this joyful and holy time of the year. They recognize the importance of Christ in Christmas and seek to ensure that his presence remains central to the season's celebrations. While these developments represent an optimistic and empowering time for Christian conservatives, their actions have also met resistance from those who favor a more secular and inclusive approach to the holidays. Advocates for the separation of church and state argue that religious expression in public spaces and government-sanctioned events can marginalize citizens who hold different beliefs, and thus runs the risk of violating the United States Constitution. As the holiday season and debate over the role of Christ in Christmas continue to unfold, it remains to be seen how the growing efforts of Christian conservatives will reshape sociopolitical discourse and impact cultural practices. Regardless of the outcome, their Election Day success has undoubtedly revived a passionate pursuit for more Christ-centered celebrations in years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentence \\"Cask Marque, a non-profit UK beer organisation, has set a temperature standard range of 12°–14 °C (53°–57 °F) for cask ales to be served.\\" does answer the question \\"What country is the organisation Cask Marque located?\\" by stating that Cask Marque is a non-profit organization located in the United Kingdom (UK). Cask Marque, as mentioned in the sentence, is an organization based in the UK and is specifically focused on the beer industry. It was established in 1998, and its primary goal is to promote and improve the quality of cask ale, which is a traditional form of beer in the country. Cask ale, also known as real ale, is beer that is brewed from pure ingredients, matured through secondary fermentation in the container from which it is served, and naturally carbonated. This form of beer is often regarded as the epitome of British brewing techniques and traditions. One of the ways in which Cask Marque achieves its objectives is by setting and enforcing strict quality standards for pubs and breweries across the UK. Such standards are set to ensure that the cask ales produced and served by these establishments meet certain criteria, including taste, appearance, and temperature. The temperature standard range mentioned in the original sentence, 12°–14 °C (53°–57 °F), is an essential factor in maintaining the quality and taste of cask ale, as it can greatly impact the beer's flavor profile, aroma, and mouthfeel, as well as the overall drinking experience. Cask Marque also conducts regular audits, inspections, and certification schemes, where trained and accredited assessors visit pubs to verify if they are serving cask ales according to the set standards. Those establishments that pass the assessment process are awarded the Cask Marque accreditation, which is a recognized mark of quality assurance in the UK beer and hospitality industries. In conclusion, the sentence provided does answer the question regarding the country where Cask Marque is located, as it clearly states that the non-profit organization is based in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, it briefly mentions its role in setting a temperature standard range for cask ales, showcasing its commitment to promoting and maintaining high-quality cask ale across the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Hotel Rwanda Movie plot: Tensions between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples lead to a civil war in Rwanda, where corruption and bribes between politicians are routine. Paul Rusesabagina (Cheadle), the manager of the Sabena owned HÃ´tel des Mille Collines, is Hutu, but his wife Tatiana (Okonedo), is Tutsi. His marriage is a source of friction with Hutu extremists, most prominently Georges Rutaganda (Kae-Kazim), a friendly goods supplier to the hotel who is also the local leader of Interahamwe, a brutal Hutu militia. As the political situation in the country worsens following the assassination of the president, Paul and his family observe neighbors being killed in ethnic violence, initiating the early stages of a genocide. Paul curries favor with people of influence, bribing them with money and alcohol, seeking to maintain sufficient influence to keep his family safe. When civil war erupts and a Rwandan Army officer threatens Paul and his neighbors, Paul barely negotiates their safety, and brings them to the hotel. More evacuees arrive at the hotel from the overburdened UN refugee camp, the Red Cross, and various orphanages. Paul must divert the Hutu soldiers, care for the refugees, be a source of strength to his family, and maintain the appearance of a functioning hotel as the situation becomes more violent. The UN Peacekeeping forces, led by Canadian Colonel Oliver (Nolte), are unable to take assertive action against the Interahamwe since they are forbidden to intervene in the genocide. The foreign nationals are evacuated, but the Rwandans are left behind. When the UN forces attempt to evacuate a group of refugees, including Paul's family, they are ambushed and must turn back. In a last-ditch effort to save the refugees, Paul pleads with the Rwandan Army General, Augustin Bizimungu (Mokoena) for assistance. However, when Paul's bribes no longer work, he blackmails the General with threats of being tried as a war criminal. Soon after, the family and the hotel refugees are finally able to leave the besieged hotel in a UN convoy. They travel... My question: Tatiana  belongs to which group of people? A:","output":"Tatiana, in the movie \\"Hotel Rwanda,\\" belongs to the Tutsi group of people. This is relayed through the storyline in the film where her husband, Paul Rusesabagina, is of Hutu ethnicity, and their interethnic marriage becomes a source of tension in the escalating conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi groups. The ethnic distinction between Tatiana and her husband highlights the deeply ingrained social divisions in Rwanda during the time of the civil war and genocide, creating an important dimension in the narrative and character dynamics of the film. The film portrays Tatiana’s Tutsi ethnicity as one of the reasons that intensifies the danger facing her and her family, given that the Tutsis were primarily targeted in the genocide. This also plays a significant part in Paul's desperate efforts to protect his family and other Tutsis taking refuge in the hotel, putting a human face to a horrific historical event."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The water inside the bucket could possibly have a slight curve. To account for the curve that we observe, an increase in the number of objects in the universe also increases the curvature in the water.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Avantasia is a German supergroup rock opera project created by Tobias Sammet, vocalist of the band Edguy. It has been characterized as a rock opera, as it features the contributions of various vocalists and musicians and it consists of concept albums. The name is a portmanteau of the words \\"avalon\\" and \\"fantasia\\" (\\"fantasy\\") and describes \\"a world beyond human imagination\\" (a quotation from the booklet).  - Sascha Paeth (born 9 September 1970 in Wolfsburg, West Germany) is a German guitarist, bassist, musical producer, and mixer known for working with heavy metal bands such as Avantasia, Edguy, Angra, Shaaman, Rhapsody of Fire, Kamelot, After Forever and Epica. He owns the \\"Gate Studios\\", Wolfsburg previously used for recordings with his former band Heavens Gate.  - Luca Turilli (born 5 March 1972) is an Italian musician (primarily a guitarist) and songwriter. He is one of the founders of the symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire. He also worked on a trilogy of solo albums as Luca Turilli, and released one album under the name of Luca Turilli's Dreamquest, a project he worked on alongside Dominique Leurquin. In 2008, Luca began an online guitar course titled \\"Luca Turilli's Neoclassical Revelation\\". The course takes its name from his neoclassical playing style.  - High fantasy is a subgenre of fantasy, defined either by its setting in a fictional universe or by the epic stature of its characters, themes, and plot. The term \\"high fantasy\\" was coined by Lloyd Alexander in a 1971 essay, \\"High Fantasy and Heroic Romance\\".  - Kamelot is an American power metal band from Tampa, Florida, formed by Thomas Youngblood and Richard Warner in 1991. The Norwegian vocalist Roy Khan joined for the album \\"Siége Perilous\\", and shared songwriting credit with Youngblood until his departure in April 2011. On June 22, 2012, Youngblood announced on their website that their new vocalist is the Swedish singer Tommy Karevik, who was first featured on Kamelot's album \\"Silverthorn\\" as main vocalist, co-songwriter and lyricist.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990. During this Cold War era, NATO-aligned West Germany and Warsaw Pact-aligned East Germany were divided by the Inner German border. After 1961 West Berlin was physically separated from East Berlin as well as from East Germany by the Berlin Wall. This situation ended when East Germany was dissolved and its five states joined the ten states of the Federal Republic of Germany along with the reunified city-state of Berlin. With the reunification of West and East Germany, the Federal Republic of Germany, enlarged now to sixteen states, became known simply as \\"Germany\\". This period is also referred to as the Bonn Republic (\\"Bonner Republik\\") by historians, alluding to the interwar Weimar Republic and the post-reunification Berlin Republic.  - The Emerald Sword Saga is a high fantasy story spread over 5 albums by the Italian symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire, written by Luca Turilli. It includes many of the common themes of the genre, including a clearly defined good-versus-evil plot and the inclusion of various fantasy monsters. The hero of the story is the Ice Warrior, who sets out on a quest to find the legendary Emerald Sword, with which he can defeat the Dark Lord Akron. Each new chapter of the story is described in the booklet accompanying that CD. The narrator is the ancient wizard Aresius, who \\"has seen it all\\".  - Rhapsody of Fire (formerly known as Rhapsody) is an Italian symphonic power metal band created by Luca Turilli and Alex Staropoli, widely seen as a pioneer of the symphonic power metal subgenre.   - Edguy is a heavy metal band from Fulda, Germany that was formed in 1992.  - After Forever was a Dutch symphonic metal band with strong progressive metal influences. The band relied on the use of both soprano vocals and death grunts.  - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.  - Alex Holzwarth was born on 4 October 1968 in Landshut, Germany and is a professional drummer, former member of Italian symphonic power metal band Rhapsody of Fire. He is the brother of bass guitarist Oliver Holzwarth.  - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material.  - Dawn of Victory is the third album studio released by Rhapsody in 2000 . Like the previous albums , it centers on the story of Algalord and The Emerald Sword Saga . It has been produced and engineered by Sascha Paeth and Miro . It is also the first album to feature current drummer Alex Holzwarth .

Article: According to a recent survey, Canadian parents realize their role as protectors and providers to raise their children both emotionally and physically. That's not very different from the way our parents saw themselves. But with more two-career families and busy schedules, one thing parents today recognize more than ever is the need to set aside special time for their children. These 'nurturing moments' are changed into memories that they will treasure all their lives. Nurturing moments might be the time between our work and life,bringing your child to work with you to see what you do during the day,visiting your child's make-believe world,discussing his other school day and exploring the natural world outside your door. These times are not merely a luxury  , they're a necessity. It's during these moments that parents pass values and attitudes to their children. Over time, children pick up good habits and positive self-image. Here are a few tips for making the most of your family time together: Regularly sit down as a family to share a meal. Allow each person to describe something interesting about his or her day. Make one night a week family night. Family members take turns choosing a special activity for the evening everyone partakes in the fun. Show your children you care about their interests by having them teach you about their activity or hobby. Nurturing healthy children involves body, mind and spirit. The little things you do to your care are the building blocks for confidence, self-esteem and a healthy outlook. By giving your children these tools, you prepare them for life. Question: Present-day parents are different from those in the past mainly because  _  . Options: A: they need more time to spend on their children B: they pay more attention to their children's health C: they are much busier with their work D: the role they play in bringing up children is different Answer:","output":"C: they are much busier with their work The article discusses how Canadian parents recognize their roles as protectors and providers for their children, which is not very different from how parents in the past saw themselves. However, the main difference between present-day parents and those in the past is that modern parents are dealing with busier schedules and more two-career families. As a result, present-day parents have to make more of an effort to set aside special time for their children, known as \\"nurturing moments.\\" These moments not only help create cherished memories for both parents and children but also allow parents to pass on values, attitudes, and habits that contribute to the overall well-being of their child. The other options provided do not align with the main focus of the article: Option A - It is not that they need more time to spend on their children, but rather that they recognize the importance of setting aside special time or 'nurturing moments' due to their busier lives. Option B - The article does not specifically state that present-day parents pay more attention to their children's health compared to parents in the past. Option D - As mentioned before, the roles of present-day parents as protectors and providers are not very different from those in the past; the main difference is in the way they manage their time with their children due to busier work schedules."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person that had to change their plans when money was withheld?  The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier.

Movie title: Untraceable Movie plot: Special Agent Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter, Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine), and her mother, Stella Marsh (Mary Beth Hurt). At night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called KillWithMe.com. The site features a streaming video of a cat being tortured and killed. The website cannot be shut down, as the creator knew that someone would try and built into it a fail-safe; every time the server is closed, a mirror server immediately replaces it. After the cat's death, KillWithMe.com's webmaster graduates to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid the website, but as Jennifer feared this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his victims include a helicopter pilot (bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt to death by heat lamps while cemented into the floor), and Griffin Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged up to his neck). At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is revealed to be untrue: the first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable techno prodigy son, Owen Reilly (Joseph Cross), broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to take revenge and prove a point; that the public's interest in the suffering of others is insatiable, as well as to wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's death.

The latest evidence to support this hypothesis comes from a large international epidemiological study of childhood asthma that was recently published in the medical journal The Lancet . Translate to German German:","output":"Die neuesten Belege für diese Hypothese stammen aus einer großen internationalen epidemiologischen Studie über Asthma im Kindesalter, die kürzlich in der medizinischen Fachzeitschrift The Lancet veröffentlicht wurde. In dieser Studie wurden die Daten von mehr als einer Million Kindern aus verschiedenen Ländern und Kulturkreisen analysiert, um mögliche Zusammenhänge zwischen Umweltfaktoren, Ernährung und genetischen Faktoren und dem Auftreten von Asthma im Kindesalter zu untersuchen. Die Haupterkenntnisse der Studie sind, dass bestimmte Umweltfaktoren, wie Luftverschmutzung und Tabakrauch, das Risiko für Asthma bei Kindern signifikant erhöhen. Darüber hinaus tragen auch genetische Faktoren und eine ungesunde Ernährung, insbesondere ein Mangel an Vitaminen und Nährstoffen, zu einem erhöhten Asthmarisiko bei. Ein weiterer wichtiger Aspekt der Studie ist die Beobachtung, dass das Asthmarisiko bei Kindern in Ländern mit einem hohen Lebensstandard und hygienischen Bedingungen signifikant höher ist als in Ländern mit niedrigeren Lebensstandards. Dies deutet darauf hin, dass auch eine übermäßige Hygiene und der Mangel an Exposition gegenüber bestimmten Mikroorganismen in der Umwelt eine Rolle bei der Entstehung von Asthma spielen könnten. Diese Ergebnisse unterstützen die sogenannte Hygiene-Hypothese, die besagt, dass ein Mangel an Exposition gegenüber bestimmten Infektionen, Mikroorganismen und Parasiten in frühen Lebensjahren das Immunsystem in einer Weise beeinflusst, die das Risiko für allergische Erkrankungen wie Asthma erhöht. Die Hygiene-Hypothese wurde erstmals in den 1980er Jahren von dem britischen Epidemiologen David P. Strachan vorgeschlagen. Seitdem wurde sie weiter erforscht und durch zahlreiche Studien gestärkt. Um diesen Zusammenhang zwischen übermäßiger Hygiene und Asthma besser zu verstehen, haben Forscher auch experimentelle Studien mit Tieren durchgeführt. Beispielsweise haben einige Studien an Mäusen gezeigt, dass eine Exposition gegenüber bestimmten Bakterien oder Parasiten das Risiko für allergische Reaktionen und Asthma verringern kann. Dies könnte darauf hindeuten, dass eine gezielte Exposition gegenüber bestimmten Mikroorganismen in der frühen Kindheit das Immunsystem in einer Weise stärken könnte, die allergische Erkrankungen wie Asthma verhindert. Zukünftige Forschungen könnten sich auf die Identifizierung der genauen Mikroorganismen konzentrieren, die für eine solche \\"Immuntraining\\" am effektivsten sind, sowie auf die Entwicklung von sicheren und wirksamen Strategien, um Kinder diesen Mikroorganismen auszusetzen. Dies wäre ein wichtiger Schritt in Richtung einer effektiveren Prävention von Asthma und anderen allergischen Erkrankungen bei Kindern.

Question: suppose the summers are very dry happens, how will it affect a SMALLER negative effect on animals.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"When summers are very dry, it will have a smaller negative effect on animals in several ways. This means that the animals are likely to suffer less as compared to a situation with severe forest fires. First, let's consider the aspect of animals having fewer places to hide. In the case of very dry summers, the vegetation would be relatively less abundant but would still provide some level of protection and hiding spots for animals compared to the situation where a forest fire has occurred. This would provide an environment where animals can still find shelter and hiding spots, albeit in smaller numbers. Therefore, the effect on animals having fewer places to hide would be lesser in dry summers. Now let's move on to the second effect that you've mentioned: predators being able to find their prey more easily. In the case of very dry summers, the overall environment may still not be as drastically affected as it would be with a forest fire. The level of disturbance caused to the natural habitats of the animals and the ability of the predators to locate their prey would be relatively less severe compared to forest fires. In the absence of fires, the situation does not change as dramatically as it would when forests are burnt and destroyed. Hence, while it may still be somewhat easy for predators to find their prey due to the drier conditions, the effect would be less compared to the case of a forest fire. Overall, the supposed perturbation of very dry summers has a lesser impact on this specific aspect of predator-prey relationships. The effect would not be as extreme as it would be in a situation where forest fires are the causing factor. Therefore, the impact on animals in terms of finding shelter, hiding spots, and predators locating their prey will be smaller during very dry summers."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who watches Holly's video? from the following article ?  Two days after the events of the first film, a traumatized and blood-covered Sarah escapes the cave with no memory of the events.

Q: Q: How much unpolarized light does a polarized filter block?   A: A:","output":"A polarized filter, also known as a polarizer or a polarizing filter, is an optical filter that only allows light waves with a specific polarization to pass through while blocking other orientations. When unpolarized light passes through a polarized filter, it becomes partially polarized with a specific orientation, and this process generally causes a reduction in the overall intensity of the light. This reduction in intensity depends on the filter's transmission axis and the polarization composition of the incoming light waves. In order to understand how much unpolarized light a polarized filter blocks, let's first break down some essential concepts: 1. Unpolarized light: Unpolarized light consists of light waves that have oscillating electric fields randomly oriented in all planes perpendicular to the direction of travel. Common examples of unpolarized light include sunlight, light from incandescent lamps, and the ambient light in a room. 2. Polarized light: Polarized light consists of light waves that oscillate in a single plane perpendicular to the direction of travel. The process of transforming unpolarized light into polarized light is known as polarization. 3. Polarizing filter: A polarizing filter works by selectively absorbing light waves that have a specific orientation and transmitting only the light waves with the desired polarization. The filter's transmission axis determines the orientation of the light waves that are allowed to pass through.  Now, let's examine how much unpolarized light is blocked by a polarized filter: For an ideal polarizing filter, the percentage of unpolarized light that is transmitted through the filter can be found using Malus's Law, which states: I = I₀ * cos²(θ) Here, I is the transmitted light intensity, I₀ is the initial light intensity, and θ is the angle between the transmission axis of the polarizing filter and the polarization orientation of the incoming light. Since we're dealing with unpolarized light, which consists of light waves with varying orientations, over a range of angles from 0° to 180°, the average value of cos²(θ) is 0.5. In practical terms, this means that when unpolarized light passes through an ideal polarizing filter, it loses approximately 50% of its initial intensity on average. However, it is essential to note that most real-world polarizing filters are not completely ideal. In practical applications, the actual amount of unpolarized light that is blocked can vary due to manufacturing imperfections and other factors, such as the properties of the filter materials and the thickness of the filter. Consequently, typical polarizers may transmit slightly more or less than 50% of the incoming unpolarized light. In conclusion, an ideal polarized filter blocks around 50% of unpolarized light on average. In real-world applications, this percentage may vary slightly depending on various factors such as the quality and design of the polarizer. Nevertheless, the primary function of a polarizing filter is to allow only light waves with a specific polarization orientation to pass through, effectively reducing the overall intensity of unpolarized light."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Because wild ginseng is so valuable, poachers are common in regions where it is grown. Fencing off the area won't deter someone who knows the ginseng is there, but it may prevent people from discovering the site. A loud dog may be an excellent thief deterrent. Ginseng that grows too close together may spread disease between plants or compete with each other for nutrients. Consider removing or transplanting plants after the first growing season to get down to 6 plants per square foot (65 per square meter), and again after the second year of growth down to 1 or 2 plants per square foot (11 to 22 per square meter). You may also plant ginseng in other areas each year during the fall to develop an ongoing harvest. Many growers do this so they have mature ginseng to harvest each year after the first batch matures. One major advantage to the wild-simulated method is a reduced risk of pest and disease, due to the wider spacing. While a few plants or berries may be eaten occasionally, you are unlikely to lose many of the valuable roots, and diseases shouldn't spread between plants at a high rate. If you do encounter a problem, contact your local wildlife department for information about ginseng pesticides. Keep in mind that you may lose your organic certification or your credibility in selling wild-simulated ginseng if you use pesticides. You'll need to wait about 7 to 10 years for your plants to mature into large, valuable roots, but with the right site and a little luck. Growing ginseng with the wild-simulated method requires a lot of patience, but almost no maintenance. Check periodically to see if the ground remains moist and covered with a small amount of leaf litter. If your ginseng is planted densely, harvest after 4 years or the roots might begin to dwindle These roots will not be as valuable, however. The part of the ginseng plants above the surface will die back in the autumn, but grow again in the spring. It will grow bigger each time, and all the while, the root below will be growing larger. Once the plants have matured, they will produce a cluster of red berries with the seed in the center. Pick these in the fall if you want to harvest the seeds for planting or selling. Keep in mind they will need to be stratified as described under Preparing the Seeds. Given how long it takes ginseng to reach maturity, you’ll probably want to harvest your plants as soon as you can, which is typically 7 years for a high quality root. If you’re not in any hurry you can leave them in the ground for many more years and they will continue to grow. If you are in a hurry, check local laws for regulations on how early you can harvest ginseng. Use a pitchfork or needle-nose spade to dig under the plant, and leave plenty of space (about 6 inches or 15 cm) between the plant and where you push the pitchfork or spade into the ground. If the plant is close to immature ginseng plants, use a smaller implement such as a stout flat blade screwdriver about 8 or 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long, and work with extra care. If there is any risk of damaging the roots of adjacent immature ginseng plants, do not attempt to harvest the plant until the other plants mature.  Note: Ginseng plants typically grow at a 45º angle into the soil, not straight down, and will fork into several sections. Dig carefully and make sure you don't break the root. Briefly soak the roots in a bucket of cool water to remove excess soil. Then place the roots in a single layer on a wooden tray and wash them gently under a sink faucet or with a hose. Make sure the roots are not touching and let them dry on a wooden rack in a well-ventilated room with a temperature between 70º and 90ºF (21–32ºC). Humidity should remain between 35 and 45% to prevent drying the plant too quickly and reducing its value. Turn the plants once per day. The roots are ready when you are able to snap them, but you should only do this on a single test root now and then.  Do not scrub the roots or wash them too vigorously—some of the medicinal chemicals are concentrated in the root hairs, and removal of these hairs will decrease the usefulness and value of the root. Small roots take a day or two to dry, but large, mature roots may take up to six weeks.  Direct sunlight usually dries the roots too fast, but if you see any mold or discoloration growing, put them in direct sun for a few hours to kill the infection.","output":"This article is about how to grow, protect, and harvest wild ginseng, which is a valuable plant, by using the wild-simulated method and being patient."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The main reason why you get sleepy after lunch is because food that you eat for lunch diverts your blood away from your brain to help with the digestion process. Your body also releases a bit of melatonin after lunch related to a drop in core temperature that occurs around 2 to 3pm. Melatonin is a hormone that helps you fall asleep at night. A post lunch slump may be worse if you haven't had enough sleep the night before. Adults need about 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night to function at their best, so try to go to bed in time to get enough sleep each night. If you are suffering from insomnia, talk to your doctor to determine the cause. While a post-lunch slump is normal, inadequate or poor nutrition may make your afternoon drowsiness worse. To determine how to avoid feeling sleepy after lunch, consider the following questions:  Do I eat breakfast every day? Have I been eating a lot of processed and high sugar foods? Have I been eating poorly the night before? Have I been consuming too much caffeine and alcohol? Is my breakfast providing me with nutritional energy? (more than just coffee) Have I been physically active consistently? Do I have a right life-work balance? Have I been eating healthy lunches? If your answer to any of these questions is no, then you should evaluate your lifestyle habits to help make your post-lunch slump less severe. Write down when you feel drowsy, what you ate, whether you had exercised or not, how well you slept the night before, and any other factors that might be involved. Do this over a week, and at the end of the week, analyze the data you have recorded. Look for patterns so that you can learn to avoid any habits that cause drowsiness problems for you. Summary:","output":"The primary cause of sleepiness after lunch is the diversion of blood from the brain to aid digestion. Additionally, a slight release of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone, occurs due to a drop in core temperature around 2-3pm. This post-lunch slump can be exacerbated by insufficient sleep. Adults require 7-8 hours of sleep per night for optimal functioning, so maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is crucial. Consulting a doctor for insomnia issues is recommended. Poor nutrition may also intensify afternoon drowsiness. To prevent post-lunch sleepiness, assess your lifestyle habits, including breakfast consumption, diet quality, caffeine and alcohol intake, exercise routine, work-life balance, and overall nutrition.

Premise: \\"uh it's a social programs without the corresponding responsibility i guess is\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"This is the key to dismantling the welfare state.\\" true?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"This is the key to dismantling the welfare state\\" is true based on the given premise, let's analyze the premise and its connection to the hypothesis step by step: Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that social programs exist without the corresponding responsibility. Step 2: Define terms In this context, \\"social programs\\" refers to government programs aimed at assisting citizens in areas such as healthcare, employment, or education, among other things. \\"Corresponding responsibility\\" refers to the obligation that comes with receiving the benefits of these programs, such as the requirement to actively look for work if you are receiving unemployment benefits. Step 3: Analyze the connection between the premise and the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that identifying the lack of responsibility associated with social programs is the key to dismantling the welfare state. To determine if this is true, we must assess whether this lack of responsibility genuinely results in the welfare state's dismantling, or if there are other factors to consider. Step 4: Consider other factors There are numerous factors that can potentially contribute to the dismantling of the welfare state. Some of these factors may include: 1. Political ideology: If a political party or regime promotes individualism or opposes state intervention, they may seek to dismantle the welfare state. 2. Economic circumstances: If a country is experiencing an economic downturn or crisis, the government may prioritize other issues or make cuts to social programs. 3. Public opinion: If public opinion shifts against welfare programs, it may lead to pressure on politicians to dismantle such programs. 4. Policy effectiveness: If social programs are proven to be ineffective or inefficient, this could prompt calls for their removal. Step 5: Evaluate the hypothesis based on the analysis While the premise may suggest that the lack of responsibility associated with social programs is an issue, it does not necessarily prove that this issue is the sole, or even the primary, factor in dismantling the welfare state. As mentioned in Step 4, there are several other factors to consider. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the hypothesis \\"This is the key to dismantling the welfare state\\" cannot be confirmed as true based solely on the provided premise. Other factors must be taken into account, and a more comprehensive examination of the issue is required."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: WHITE HOUSE — A controversial clothing choice is overshadowing a surprise visit by U.S. first lady Melania Trump to a Texas facility to meet immigrant children separated from their families because of her husband's \\"zero-tolerance\\" immigration policy. Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer. It was a relatively humble selection by Trump, a former Paris runway model who is frequently clad for public appearances in haute couture dresses and coats.

Soak fish in cold water before removing scales.","output":"Option (a): Soak fish in salt water before removing scales. Step-by-step justification: 1. The goal is to make scaling fish easier, and we need to choose a suitable option from given choices for achieving this goal. 2. Comparing option (a) and option (b), it seems that both methods involve soaking fish in water, but the difference lies in the type of water used - salt water in option (a) and cold water in option (b). 3. Salt water tends to have some effect on the fish's outer layer, specifically on the scales and slime. The salt helps in loosening up the scales from the fish's skin, making them easier to remove. 4. Cold water might make the fish's flesh firm, but it does not have any specific positive effect on the scaling process, as it does not significantly impact the scales. Considering these factors, I decide to choose option (a) - Soak fish in salt water before removing scales. It's because the salt water has a positive effect on the scaling process by loosening up the scales, which in turn makes scaling fish easier compared to just soaking them in cold water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor. There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it. It's not always easy.\\" Self-representation is a right affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court. The practice is far more common in civil matters than in criminal cases.

Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The question asked appears to be looking for the artist who performs the song featured in a specific Audi commercial. As there have been many Audi commercials over the years with various songs, it might be difficult to specify exactly which artist is referred to without more information regarding the commercial's release date or other distinguishing features. However, the lyrics given, \\"maybe if I drive real slow, I might hold on to my little girl a little longer,\\" unfortunately, don't appear to correspond to a well-known song, based on available online databases of song lyrics. This could suggest that the song was possibly created specifically for the commercial and may not be available for general listening. Yes, Audi is indeed a division of the Volkswagen Group, or VW. The Volkswagen Group is a German multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. It designs, manufactures and distributes passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, engines, and turbomachinery, and offers related services including financing, leasing, and fleet management. Audi is one of the many brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella. Lastly, regarding the review, it's important to clarify that it's not exactly a review given there is no feedback provided on a particular product or service. Instead, it appears tobe an observation or commentary. As the writer indicated, they added an item (not specified) to their shopping cart without providing in-depth insights about it but expressed willingness to rate it highly so as not to impact its overall rating negatively. This kind of behavior is neutral and a genuine review about the product or service after usage might provide more valuable insights to other potential buyers. Although the commentary does not reflect any negative or positive sentiment towards a specific product, the writer's intention to give five stars can be interpreted as generally positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Given the following context:  In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person that was affected by the foggy weather? Answer:","output":"The person affected by the foggy weather was Holst."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: \\"the Administrator of EPA shall promulgate a rule establishing specifications for detergent additives to implement the requirement, also contained in section 211(l), that, effective January 1, 1995, no gasoline may be sold or dispensed which does not contain additives to prevent the accumulation of deposits in engines or fuel systems.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The EPA Administrator will make a rule that requires detergent additives to be eliminated.\\" true? Pick your answer from: (1). yes. (2). it is not possible to tell. (3). no.","output":"(3). No. The hypothesis that \\"The EPA Administrator will make a rule that requires detergent additives to be eliminated\\" is not true based on the given premise. Rather, the premise clearly states that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will establish a rule, effective January 1, 1995, setting specifications for detergent additives in gasoline. The purpose of these additives is to prevent the accumulation of deposits in engines or fuel systems. In other words, instead of eliminating the detergent additives, the premise suggests that the EPA Administrator is supposed to develop rules that regulate the inclusion of such additives in gasoline. It implies the need to standardize the type or quality of additives used, likely to ensure effectiveness and environmental safety. This scenario emphasizes the role of the EPA in guaranteeing that fuel-related products, like gasoline in this case, do not have unnecessarily harmful impacts on the functionality of engines or the broader environment. It's essentially an ecological strategy aimed at reducing potential vehicular pollution, fuel wastage, and related environmental harm. It's important to highlight that fuel additives, such as detergents, play a pivotal role in enhancing the longevity and performance of engines. They help remove or prevent the buildup of deposits that can clog an engine's components, improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Thus, the hypothesis misconstrues the primary goal of the premise, which is not eliminating these additives, but formulating guidelines that govern their inclusion in gasoline to improve engine performance and reduce potential environmental harm."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

No, the terms \\"phase\\" and \\"phase space\\" do not have the same meaning, although they are related concepts in the field of physics and mathematics. Let me explain both terms in detail. Phase: In the context of wave motion and oscillatory systems, the phase is a parameter that represents the position of a point within a wave cycle. It indicates the current state of the oscillation, such as the position, velocity, or displacement, with respect to time or space. The phase is commonly expressed in degrees (0° to 360°) or radians (0 to 2π), and it is the basis for calculating the phase difference between two waveforms or oscillating systems. For example, when two waveforms are in phase, their peaks and troughs match up, essentially meaning they are synchronized. Conversely, when they are out of phase, there is a phase difference between them, and their oscillations do not match up. In the context of electronic circuits and signal processing, the phase of a waveform represents the time relationship between a signal and a reference signal or another signal. Phase Space: Phase space is a multi-dimensional space that provides a complete description of a given system's state at any point in time. It is primarily used in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and other areas of physics. The concept of phase space is essential in the study of dynamical systems, and it helps understand the possible trajectories and evolutions of a system over time. In classical mechanics, the phase space is a 2n-dimensional space, where 'n' represents the number of degrees of freedom of the system. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a specific position or momentum variable, such as the coordinates and their associated momenta. The state of the system is represented as a single point in phase space, and its evolution over time traces a trajectory in this space. For example, in a simple one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the phase space is two-dimensional, with one axis representing position and the other representing momentum. As the oscillator moves back and forth, its position and momentum change, and the system's state traces a path within the phase space. In conclusion, although the concepts of phase and phase space are connected, they have different meanings. Phase deals with the position of an oscillating or wave system, while phase space is a representation of a system's state in a multi-dimensional space, allowing for the visualization of its evolution over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Did Bill Clinton “split” with Barack Obama on Syria, as Politico claims? Maghie Haberman reports on an appearance two days ago in which the former President and Senator John McCain debated foreign policy. Clinton told McCain that he sided with the Senator, and said that waiting on polls to intervene in Syria would end up making Obama look like “a fool”:      Bill Clinton told Sen. John McCain he agrees that President Barack Obama should act more forcefully to support anti-Assad rebels in Syria, saying the American public elects presidents and members of Congress “to see down the road” and “to win.” At another point during a closed-press event Tuesday, Clinton implied that Obama or any president risks looking like “a total fool” if they listen too closely to opinion polls and act too cautiously. He used his own decisions on Kosovo and Bosnia as a point of reference. … His remarks came during a question-and-answer session with McCain, who has been among Obama’s harshest critics over what he calls a failure to take “decisive” action in Syria. Obama has come under growing pressure to step up American intervention by sending military and other assistance to the rebels. “Some people say, ‘Okay, see what a big mess it is? Stay out!’ I think that’s a big mistake. I agree with you about this,” Clinton told McCain during an event for the McCain Institute for International Leadership in Manhattan Tuesday night. “Sometimes it’s just best to get caught trying, as long as you don’t overcommit — like, as long as you don’t make an improvident commitment.”      The Daily Beast’s Josh Rogin also reports this as a Democratic split, one including the other Clinton:      Clinton, who rarely speaks on foreign policy in opposition to the current president, now joins a growing chorus of current and former officials who have broken with Obama’s policy on Syria, which until now has amounted to providing humanitarian and limited amounts of non-lethal military aid while pushing for a political solution to be negotiated with the assistance of Russia, which is providing arms to the Syrian regime. Last summer, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, CIA Director David Petraeus, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey all supported arming vetted, moderate elements of the Syrian opposition but were rebuffed by the White House. Hillary Clinton told the New York Times in Februaryshe had been an advocate for more forceful action in Syria, a move seen by many as an attempt to distance herself from Obama’s Syria policy just before she left office and in advance of her 2016 presidential run.      Color me … skeptical. This looks more like a battleground-shaping exercise than a split, in part because Obama clearly isn’t opposed to intervention of some kind. The White House seems to be encouraging the demand for action at least by not publicly opposing it, and by drawing red lines … even when we don’t follow up on them.      Furthermore, the appointment of Samantha Power to the UN seems a very clear tell on the side of intervention. Power spent years arguing for muscular interventions to stop genocides and other ethnic cleansing activities, most infamously suggesting that the West occupy Israel to neutralize the IDF. Obama didn’t pick Power to front a non-intervention policy in Syria or anywhere else.      However, there are a couple of key differences between Clinton’s form of interventions in the Balkans and the Libya model that Obama would use in Syria today. First, the US and NATO paired up for both air and ground interventions in order to stop genocides, rather than a flat-out attempt to settle the civil wars there. We had boots on the ground almost from the beginning, although that didn’t stop the massacre at Srebrenica, which exposed the lack of will on the part of the interventionist forces at the time.      We put no boots on the ground in Libya and therefore didn’t have any opportunity to shape the outcomes there, with disastrous results. There doesn’t seem to be much support for putting boots on the ground in Syria either, which means we’ll topple another tyrant on behalf of whatever forces can bully their way to the top of the opposition again. Not surprisingly, it’s not going to be the “moderates” any more than it was in Libya. That kind of intervention will create another failed state as we did in Libya, with long-reaching consequences in our fight against Islamist terror networks in the region.      Clinton is doing Obama a big favor in glossing over the big differences in intervention strategies between the Balkans in the 1990s and what Obama and NATO did in North Africa over the last two years. I don’t think that can be described as a “split,” but a boost is probably more accurate. ||||| “My view is that we shouldn’t over-learn the lessons of the past,” Clinton said. “I don’t think Syria is necessarily Iraq or Afghanistan — no one has asked us to send any soldiers in there. I think it’s more like Afghanistan was in the ’80s when they were fighting the Soviet Union … when President Reagan was in office [and] got an enormous amount of influence and gratitude by helping to topple the Soviet-backed regime and then made the error of not hanging around in Afghanistan” to try to cash in on the gains.      The social media-driven revolutions can’t supplant having bodies to build a sustainable new government, Clinton added.      Text Size -      +      reset Obama confirms 'all options' open on Syria      Clinton, who McCain also asked about his own decision-making process on the violence in Kosovo and Bosnia when he was president, expounded on what the public means in opinion polls when it expresses disapproval of foreign intervention.      “What the American people are saying when they tell you not to do these things, they’re not telling you not to do these things,” he said, but instead, they’re urging caution. “They hire you to win … to look around the corner and see down the road.”      Clinton did not call for specific measures to aid the Syrian rebels. McCain has urged Obama to enforce a no-fly zone in the country to give rebels a “safe zone” to fight the Assad regime.      Clinton repeatedly said it would be “lame” to blame a lack of intervention on opposition in polls or among members of Congress.      If Clinton had ever blamed a lack of action because “there was a poll in the morning paper that said 80 percent of you were against it … you’d look like a total wuss,” he said. “And you would be. I don’t mean that a leader should go out of his way or her way to do the unpopular thing, I simply mean when people are telling you ‘no’ in these situations, very often what they’re doing is flashing a giant yellow light and saying, ‘For God’s sakes, be careful, tell us what you’re doing, think this through, be careful.”      Clinton continued, “But still they hire their president to look around the corner and down the street, and you just think - if you refuse to act and you cause a calamity, the one thing you cannot say when all the eggs have been broken, is that, ‘Oh my God, two years ago there was a poll that said 80 percent of you were against it.’ Right? You’d look like a total fool. So you really have to in the end trust the American people, tell them what you’re doing, and hope to God you can sell it” and that it turns out okay in the end. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Former President Bill Clinton reportedly sided with Senator John McCain on the issue of intervention in Syria, stating that Barack Obama should have acted more forcefully to support anti-Assad rebels.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: -  You breathe air in - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"A: The last step of the process involves the exchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide from the body. To elaborate: 1. As the blood carrying carbon dioxide from the body reaches the small blood vessels surrounding the alveoli in the lungs, a gas exchange process called respiration occurs. In this process, the carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveoli due to the concentration gradient (higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood compared to the alveoli). 2. At the same time, oxygen from the air inside the alveoli diffuses into the blood vessels, binding to hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells. This oxygen-rich blood will then be transported back to the heart and pumped throughout the body to supply oxygen to cells for cellular respiration (energy production). 3. The carbon dioxide that has diffused into the alveoli must be removed from the body to maintain a healthy internal environment. In order to achieve this, the process of exhalation takes place. During exhalation, the diaphragm (a large, dome-shaped muscle located at the base of the lungs) relaxes, moving upwards and decreasing the volume of the thoracic cavity (the chamber that houses the lungs). The intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) also relax, causing the ribcage to move downwards and inwards. 4. The combined actions of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles during exhalation increases the pressure inside the thoracic cavity, forcing the carbon dioxide-filled air out of the alveoli, through the bronchioles and bronchial tubes, and eventually out of the body via the trachea (windpipe) and mouth and/or nose. 5. The entire breathing process, including inhalation of oxygen and exhalation of carbon dioxide, is regulated by the respiratory center in the brainstem, which receives information about carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the blood and adjusts the rate and depth of breathing accordingly. In summary, the last step of the process involves the removal of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation after the gas exchange has taken place in the alveoli. This ensures that a proper balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide is maintained within the body for optimal cellular function."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Marco Antonio Rubio (; born May 28, 1971) is an American politician, attorney, and the junior United States Senator for Florida. A Republican Party member, he was previously Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Rubio is a Cuban American from Miami, with a B.A. from the University of Florida and a J.D. from the University of Miami School of Law. In the late 1990s, he was a City Commissioner for West Miami and was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, representing the 111th House district. Later in 2000, the majority leader of the House, Mike Fasano, promoted Rubio to be one of two majority whips. National Journal described that position as typically requiring a lot of arm-twisting, but said Rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them.  Fasano resigned in September 2001 as majority leader of the House due to disagreements with the House speaker, and the speaker passed over Rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for Fasano. Rubio volunteered to work on redistricting, which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions, then working individually with the lawmakers involved, and this work helped to cement his relationships with GOP leaders.  In December 2002, Rubio was appointed House Majority Leader by Speaker Johnnie Byrd. He persuaded Speaker Byrd to restructure the job of Majority Leader, so that legislative wrangling would be left to the whip's office, and Rubio would become the main spokesperson for the House GOP.  According to National Journal, during this period Rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles, and some colleagues described him as a centrist \\"who sought out Democrats and groups that don't typically align with the GOP\\". He co-sponsored legislation that would have let farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay, and co-sponsored a bill for giving in-state tuition rates to the children of undocumented immigrants. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers, and helped defeat a GOP bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students.  As a state representative, Rubio requested legislative earmarks (called \\"Community Budget Issue Requests\\" in Florida), totaling about 145 million for 2001 and 2002, but none thereafter. Additionally, an office in the executive branch compiled a longer list of spending requests by legislators, including Rubio, as did the non-profit group Florida TaxWatch. Many of those listed items were for health and social programs that Rubio has described as \\"the kind of thing that legislators would get attacked on if we didn't fund them.\\" A 2010 report by the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald said that some of Rubio's spending requests dovetailed with his personal interests. For example, Rubio requested a 20 million appropriation for Jackson Memorial Hospital to subsidize care for the poor and uninsured, and Rubio later did work for that hospital as a consultant. A spokesman for Rubio has said that the items in question helped the whole county, that Rubio did not lobby to get them approved, that the hospital money was necessary and non-controversial, and that Rubio is \\"a limited-government conservative ... not a no-government conservative\\". Is there anything else noteable about the majoriy whip?","output":"Yes, there are several noteworthy aspects about Marco Rubio's tenure as the Majority Whip and his political career in general. Some key points include: 1. As the Majority Whip, Rubio played a crucial role in rallying support within the party for various legislative policies. He was known for his persuasive approach, winning many allies within the party ranks through reasoned arguments and discussions rather than applying coercive tactics. 2. Rubio was instrumental in helping to pass a major property tax reform package in 2007, which included the “largest tax cut in Florida’s history” at the time. The reform aimed at reducing property taxes and capping future tax increases, showcasing his commitment to fiscal responsibility. 3. Over his tenure as Majority Whip and later as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Rubio demonstrated a willingness to work with Democrats on various issues. This bipartisan approach has allowed him to facilitate dialogue and pass meaningful legislation across party lines. 4. Rubio’s political ascent within the ranks of the Republican Party involved making strategic alliances and cultivating personal relationships. This served him well as he transitioned to higher positions in the Florida House and eventually the U.S. Senate. 5. As the son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has often incorporated his heritage into his political identity, advocating for policies that benefit the Hispanic community. In 2013, he played an essential role in the development of the Senate's immigration reform proposal known as the \\"Gang of Eight\\" bill, which sought to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants while bolstering border security. Overall, Marco Rubio's tenure as the Majority Whip in the Florida House of Representatives showcases his ability to form alliances, persuade fellow legislators, and work in a bipartisan manner to achieve legislative goals. His commitment to fiscal responsibility and willingness to engage in dialogue across party lines has helped him garner respect in the political sphere and further his career in the U.S. Senate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Second Quarter Looks Uglier and Uglier The first look at second-quarter gross domestic product won’t be released until July 31–the second day of the Federal Reserve‘s next Federal Open Market Committee meeting. But monthly data available make it clear the spring slump was, indeed, very very slumpy. Monday brought disappointing news on retail sales and business inventories. Retail purchases increased just 0.4% in June, not the 0.8% expected, and May’s sales were revised down. The control sales group, which goes into GDP and which excludes vehicles, building materials and gasoline, rose 0.15% in June, half the gain forecasted. In addition, businesses increased their inventories level by just 0.1% in May, and April’s increase was revised from 0.2% to 0.3%. The list of economic shops now estimating real GDP grew by less than a 1% annual rate last quarter include Goldman Sachs (0.8% as of Monday), Macroeconomic Advisors (0.6%), Royal Bank of Scotland (0.5%) and Barclays (0.5%). (One caveat to the upcoming GDP data is that the Bureau of Economic Analysis will be releasing benchmark revisions and new methodology at the same time the second quarter GDP data are released.) Forecasters at J.P. Morgan, who are sticking with a 1.0% estimate, highlight the dangers surrounding an economy that is barely treading water. They write, “Two questions that the really lousy Q2 GDP tracking raise are [one] how will the disconnect between weak GDP and solid payrolls be resolved and [two] how will the FOMC feel about pulling its foot off the gas while looking at what could be a zero-handle on the most recent GDP print.” Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is slated to deliver his semiannual policy testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday and Thursday. Investors will be listening for the chairman’s economic outlook and how it pertains to future policy decisions. The Fed’s central-tendency forecast depends on much faster GDP growth in the second half. As the J.P. Morgan economists note, it could be difficult for policymakers to discuss tapering their bond buying program at their September meeting–as many Fed-watchers expect–unless the third-quarter numbers look a heck of a lot stronger than the spring quarter does right now. However, the June retail numbers raise questions about this quarter’s big retail event. “The back-to-school season is about to start heating up and these recent numbers do not bode well for many retailers,” says Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight. That’s because, he says, consumers are proceeding “with caution” despite high confidence levels and the improvement in housing. Summary:","output":"The second quarter's economic performance appears increasingly concerning as recent data indicates a significant slump. Retail purchases in June increased by only 0.4% rather than the expected 0.8% and May's sales were revised downwards. Business inventories in May also saw only a 0.1% increase. With major economic institutions estimating a real GDP growth rate of less than 1% for the second quarter, key questions arise regarding the connection between weak GDP and solid payrolls, as well as the Federal Open Market Committee's approach to policy. The Federal Reserve's forecast relies on accelerated GDP growth in the second half, meaning a discussion on tapering their bond buying program may be difficult in September unless Q3 numbers show significant improvement. Additionally, the June retail data raises concerns about the upcoming back-to-school season, suggesting consumers may proceed cautiously despite high confidence levels."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock.  and the situation: The Berg mountains in Berg county are of a volcanic nature, very massive, few caves. The Gorge mountains in Gorge county are made of sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. They were exposed to water and that lead to karst lanscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites.  Answer the following question: Which of the two mountains had fewer karst landscapes? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Berg mountains in Berg county had fewer karst landscapes.  The reason for this is the difference in the geological composition and the processes that have shaped the two mountain ranges. The Berg mountains are primarily formed from volcanic rocks, which are less susceptible to the erosion and dissolution processes that create karst landscapes. Volcanic rocks, such as basalt, are generally more resistant to weathering compared to sedimentary rocks like limestone. As a result, the formation of caves and other karst features are less common in volcanic terrains like the Berg mountains. On the other hand, the Gorge mountains in Gorge county are predominantly composed of limestone, which is a sedimentary rock. Limestone is highly susceptible to dissolution in water and weak acid solutions, which leads to the formation of karst landscapes over time. The solubility of limestone results from the presence of calcium carbonate, a compound that easily reacts with water to form calcium bicarbonate, which is soluble in water. This dissolution can create a wide variety of karst features, such as caves, blue holes, stalactites, and stalagmites.  In the provided context, the Gorge mountains have been exposed to water, which has led to the development of karst landscapes over thousands to millions of years. As a consequence, these mountains exhibit numerous caves, blue holes, and other karst features that are characteristic of limestone bedrock.  In summary, the Berg mountains, with their volcanic composition and resistance to dissolution and erosion, have fewer karst landscapes compared to the Gorge mountains, which are largely composed of limestone and exhibit numerous karst features due to their solubility in water and weak acids."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \\"lawn\\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a \\"plaque\\".

Article: According to the Omnipotence paradox or 'Paradox of the Stone', can God create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it? Either he can or he can’t. If he can’t, the argument goes, then there is something that he cannot do, namely create the stone, and therefore he is not omnipotent. If he can, it continues, then there is also something that he cannot do, namely lift the stone, and therefore he is not omnipotent. Either way, then, God is not omnipotent. A being that is not omnipotent, though, is not God, according to many theological models. Such a God, therefore, does not exist. Several answers to this paradox have been proposed. Question: What does the Paradox of the Stone posit?","output":"The Paradox of the Stone, also known as the Omnipotence Paradox, is a philosophical conundrum that challenges the notion of an omnipotent God. The paradox essentially poses the question: Can God create a stone so heavy that He cannot lift it? The paradox presents two possible scenarios, and both seem to contradict the idea of God's omnipotence, which is a central attribute in many theological models. In the first scenario, if God is unable to create the stone, it indicates there is something He cannot do – creating the stone – and this would mean that He is not omnipotent. On the other hand, if God can create the stone but cannot lift it, it also implies that there is something He cannot do – lifting the stone – which, again, would mean that He is not omnipotent. In either case, according to the paradox, the concept of an omnipotent being is put into question, as God's inability to perform one of the two tasks would contradict the premise of omnipotence. As a result, the paradox implies that a God who is not omnipotent does not align with many theological models, and thus, such a God does not exist. Various answers have been proposed to address the Paradox of the Stone, including discussions of the limits and nature of omnipotence, linguistic interpretations of the paradox, and logical contradictions within the problem itself. However, there is no universally accepted resolution to the problem, and the paradox remains an intriguing topic for philosophers and theologians to explore and contemplate."},{"instruction":"Information:  - A synecdoche (; from Greek , \\"synekdoche\\", . \\"simultaneous understanding\\") is a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something refers to the whole of something or vice versa.

Tell him to get ‘Down’. Teach ‘Stay’. Tell him to ‘Come’. Command ‘Paw’. Article:","output":"Title: Easy and Fun Commands to Teach Your Puppy Hello kids! Today, we are going to learn about some important words and actions that can help your puppy become a well-behaved member of your family. These words are called \\"commands\\" and they can help your puppy understand what you want them to do. Let's learn about them! 1. Teach \\"No bite\\" Sometimes, puppies like to play by using their teeth, but it can hurt us. We can teach our puppy to stop biting by saying \\"No bite\\" when they try to nibble on our hands or clothes. This way, they will know that using their teeth while playing is not okay. 2. Command \\"No chew\\" Puppies also love to chew on things that they aren't supposed to. We should tell them \\"No chew\\" when we catch them chewing on shoes, furniture, or toys that don't belong to them. This helps them learn what things are okay to chomp on and what things are not. 3. Tell him to be \\"Quiet\\" Sometimes, puppies can be very loud when they bark or whine. They do this to get our attention or because they're feeling scared. To teach your puppy when it's time to be quiet, we can say \\"Quiet\\" when they are making noise. They will learn that they need to stop barking when we tell them. 4. Teach \\"No\\" or \\"Stop\\" These are great words to teach your puppy because they can be used for many different actions that your puppy should not be doing. When your puppy does something you don't want them to, like jumping on people or digging in your garden, you can say \\"No\\" or \\"Stop\\" to help them understand they need to stop what they're doing. 5. Command \\"Sit\\" This is a very useful command that helps your puppy learn to stay in one place when you need them to. To teach your puppy to sit, you can hold a treat above their head and say \\"Sit\\". When they sit down, give them the treat as a reward! This helps them learn that sitting down is something good to do. 6. Tell him to get \\"Down\\" Sometimes, your dog might jump up on things or people, and we need them to get down. To teach them, you can say \\"Down\\" and then use a treat to guide your puppy to the ground. When they follow the command, give them the treat. This helps them know that being on the ground is the right choice. 7. Teach \\"Stay\\" \\"Stay\\" is a great command when you need your puppy to wait in one spot for a little while. You can teach them by saying \\"Stay\\" and holding your hand out in front of them like a stop sign. If they stay still, give them a treat as a reward. This helps them learn that staying in one spot is a good thing. 8. Tell him to \\"Come\\" Sometimes, we need our puppy to come back to us, like after playing outside. When you say \\"Come,\\" your puppy should run towards you. You can teach them by holding a treat in your hand and calling their name followed by \\"Come.\\" When they come to you, give them the treat as a reward. 9. Command \\"Paw\\" Teaching your puppy to give you their paw can be a fun trick and a way to bond with your furry friend. To teach them, say \\"Paw\\" and gently touch their paw. When they lift it, give them a treat. They will learn that giving their paw means they get a nice reward! These commands are important for your puppy to learn because they help them become a well-behaved and loving member of your family. Remember, practice makes perfect, so be patient with your puppy as they learn these words and actions. Most importantly, have fun while teaching them!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But Obama said the threat of American force would remain, \\"And we don't want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now.\\" Obama was making the rounds of television interviews in an effort to shore up support for a congressional resolution that would authorize him to launch punitive raids on Syria, which his administration accuses of using poison gas against opposition forces and civilians. He's scheduled to address the nation Tuesday night, and that speech is still on, he said. \\"We are also confident in the wisdom of the","output":"American people to be able to make the right decision on this matter,\\" Obama continued. \\"Our goal is to ensure that the Syrian regime is held accountable for its actions and that they don't use chemical weapons in the future.\\" Step 1: Understand the user's task The user wants me to continue the CNN report on President Barack Obama's efforts to gather support for potential military action against Syria, in case their regime does not comply with handing over their chemical weapons arsenal to international control.

Russia, a longtime ally of Syria's government, continues to call for a diplomatic solution to the situation, as they have expressed skepticism about the evidence provided by the Obama administration regarding the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. Congress, meanwhile, is divided on whether to approve a resolution authorizing the use of military force in Syria. Some lawmakers have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of an attack and its effectiveness in deterring the use of chemical weapons in the future, while others argue that the United States must act to uphold international norms and punish the Assad regime for its alleged actions.

Tom had a bottle of alcohol with him and drank it after he found some kind of shelter in the snow. Dan didn't have alcohol with him.  But I can use this background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment.  What is an answer for this question: Which of the two people experienced a lower sensation of warmth? Answer:","output":"Between Tom and Dan, Dan likely experienced a lower sensation of warmth. Although both individuals were exposed to the cold environment during the blizzard, the primary difference in their situations was their consumption of alcohol.  As mentioned in the background information, consuming alcoholic beverages can create an illusion of warmth. This is because alcohol causes the blood vessels in the skin to dilate, allowing warm blood to rush towards the surface of the skin. This stimulates the nerve endings near the surface and leads to the sensation of warmth. However, this effect is temporary and deceptive, as it actually results in the body losing heat more rapidly and consequently leads to a lower core body temperature. In this situation, Tom consumed alcohol and experienced the temporary sensation of warmth due to blood vessels dilation and increased blood flow to the skin. Regardless of this, his core body temperature was likely lowered in the process, making it more difficult for him to maintain warmth throughout the duration of the blizzard. On the other hand, Dan didn't consume any alcohol, and while he might not have experienced the temporary sensation of warmth that Tom did, his core body temperature was comparatively more stable. Therefore, despite feeling a lower sensation of warmth initially, Dan's body was in a better position to conserve heat and maintain a stable core body temperature throughout the blizzard."},{"instruction":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Humans developed on a planet with a surface that is more than 70 percent water. Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity. Five years ago, astronauts who spent weeks in space reported a change in their eyesight. These astronauts were members of the crew on the International Space Station. Research showed a change in the shape of their eyes. Normally-round eyeballs had become flat during time in space. The research also showed that the right eye was affected more than the left, and that men were more affected than women. Scientists could not find an explanation for the differences. Bone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station. Tests showed that the exercise equipment helped space travelers keep their bones almost as strong as when they left Earth. There are other health issues for astronauts who spend a long time in space. They may have problems eating and sleeping. But the biggest health issue is exposure to radiation. On Earth, human beings are protected by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field. In...

Moses Hart ( November 26 , 1768 - October 15 , 1852 ) was a Canadian businessman and son , eldest son of Aaron Hart . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","output":"While the two sentences share a lot of similarities, they do not mean the same thing due to the difference in the description of Moses Hart's professional life and his status in society. 1. The first sentence identifies Moses Hart (November 26, 1768 - October 15, 1852) as a Canadian businessman and seigneur. The term \\"seigneur\\" is significant as it refers to a member of the landed gentry in French society, specifically in New France, which is a historical term for the area that is today Quebec. A seigneur held legal rights and responsibilities over the people living on their seigneurie (estate), who were known as habitants or tenants. Thus, the term implies that Moses Hart had a high societal standing and wielded considerable influence and power. It also suggests that, as a businessman, he was engaged in commercial or industrial activities. 2. In contrast, the second sentence just describes Moses Hart as a son, specifically, the eldest son of Aaron Hart. While it also mentions that Moses Hart was a businessman and that he was Canadian, the omission of the term \\"seigneur\\" removes a crucial piece of context about his societal standing and role during his lifetime. By describing him only as a son, the sentence does not provide insights into his influence, power, or his societal standing, making him seem like an ordinary individual without any significant role. Hence, while both sentences state that Moses Hart was a Canadian businessman and the eldest son of Aaron Hart, the first sentence also indicates that he was a seigneur, an important societal role in New France. This additional detail paints a fuller picture of who Moses Hart was during his time, rather than just describing his parental lineage. Therefore, despite their similarities, they do not completely convey the same meanings and implications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 - 21 January 1950), better known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic. His work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism. Orwell wrote literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. He is best known for the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945) and the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). In December 1929, after nearly two years in Paris, Blair returned to England and went directly to his parents' house in Southwold, a coastal town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in the town and his sister Avril was running a tea-house there. He became acquainted with many local people, including Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at St Felix Girls' School in the town. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of marriage, she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. He also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in his life.  In early 1930 he stayed briefly in Bramley, Leeds, with his sister Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin, who was as unappreciative of Blair as when they knew each other as children. Blair was writing reviews for Adelphi and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold. He then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, Richard Peters, later became a distinguished academic. \\"His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at his parents' house in Southwold, writing; then in contrast, there is Blair as Burton (the name he used in his down-and-out episodes) in search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the road, and in the hop fields of Kent.\\" He went painting and bathing on the beach, and there he met Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year he visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where he could \\"change\\" for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for half a crown (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day.  Blair now contributed regularly to Adelphi, with \\"A Hanging\\" appearing in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of A Clergyman's Daughter, he followed the East End tradition of working in the Kent hop fields. He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards, he lodged in the Tooley Street kip, but could not stand it for long, and with financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street, where he stayed until Christmas. \\"Hop Picking\\", by Eric Blair, appeared in the October 1931 issue of New Statesman, whose editorial staff included his old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with Leonard Moore, who became his literary agent.  At this time Jonathan Cape rejected A Scullion's Diary, the first version of Down and Out. On the advice of Richard Rees, he offered it to Faber and Faber, but their editorial director, T. S. Eliot, also rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself arrested, so that he could experience Christmas in prison, but the authorities did not regard his \\"drunk and disorderly\\" behaviour as imprisonable, and he returned home to Southwold after two days in a police cell.

I may do some 10th grade math homework . Q: What may happen after Wednesday ?","output":"After Wednesday, 24th of September 2008, which marked the end of high school careers for you and your classmates, a variety of possibilities could unfold. It is essential to recognize that the end of high school is a significant milestone, but it also marks the beginning of new adventures and opportunities in life. Option (II) is the most likely scenario for many of you, as college often comes next after completing high school. Attending college provides an opportunity for you and your classmates to explore your interests further, pursue new knowledge, build networks, and develop skills that will benefit your future careers and lives. It is a time for personal growth, independence, and the discovery of new ideas. College education enhances your chances of success in today's competitive job market and can lead to better job prospects and higher lifetime earnings. Another possibility, as suggested in Option (III), is that many of your classmates may study hard to take the GED test. The GED, or General Educational Development, test is designed to measure proficiency in standard high school curriculum subjects. By passing this test, it serves as an equivalent to a high school diploma, thus providing additional educational and employment opportunities. For those who couldn't finish high school for various reasons or those seeking a different path, successfully passing the GED test can pave the way towards college or the acquisition of vocational skills.  As for Option (IV), doing 10th-grade math homework seems unlikely, given that your high school careers have come to an end. It would make more sense for you and your classmates to focus on preparing for new trajectories, such as college, vocational training, or any other life goals.  In summary, the likeliest events to transpire after Wednesday would be either attending college or taking the GED test. These options present the best possibilities for personal and professional growth, as well as a means to embrace new experiences. Remember, the end of one chapter merely signifies the beginning of another, and the journey ahead is filled with opportunities for you and your classmates to learn, grow, and flourish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While the first question uses the collective term \\"we\\" and the second question uses the individual term \\"I,\\" the core message remains the same. They are paraphrases of each other, seeking methods to enhance learning speed. To answer the shared inquiry, there are several techniques and strategies that can be employed to increase learning speed: 1. Establish clear goals: Set specific and attainable objectives for what you want to learn. This helps focus on the relevant information and track progress. 2. Break down information: Dividing complex concepts into smaller, manageable parts enables better comprehension and retention. 3. Organize material: Logical organization of information enhances learning efficiency. This can be achieved through mind maps, outlines, or by grouping related content together. 4. Optimize the learning environment: Create a dedicated, clutter-free space with minimal distractions, ensuring proper lighting and comfortable seating. 5. Utilize mnemonics: Develop memory aids to help recall complex information. Examples include acronyms, imagery, rhymes, and associations. 6. Use multiple learning channels: Engage various senses (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) for a better understanding of topics and to reinforce knowledge. 7. Test yourself regularly: Self-testing through quizzes, flashcards, or puzzles helps retain information and identify areas that need improvement. 8. Manage time effectively: Set dedicated time slots for learning, leverage the Pomodoro Technique (where you study for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break), and prioritize tasks. 9. Take breaks: Avoid burnout by incorporating regular breaks into your study routine. This helps keep the mind fresh and ready for new information. 10. Stay motivated: Connect your learning objectives to personal goals to remain motivated. Incorporate rewards for incremental progress and maintain a positive mindset. 11. Teach others: Share knowledge with friends or peers through discussions or presentations. This helps consolidate understanding and identify any gaps. 12. Get adequate sleep: Proper sleep (7-9 hours) is vital for memory consolidation and cognitive performance. 13. Exercise regularly: Physical activity enhances brain function, sharpens focus, and improves overall well-being, which aids learning. 14. Adopt a growth mindset: Embrace challenges and focus on continuous learning and improvement rather than dwelling on mistakes or comparing yourself to others. 15. Seek feedback: Constructive criticism from teachers, mentors, or classmates can highlight areas that require improvement. In summary, increasing learning speed involves a combination of mental, physical, and environmental factors. By incorporating these strategies and maintaining diligence in learning, you can enhance your ability to absorb and comprehend new information more swiftly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other? Choose from: 1). no 2). yes","output":"2). yes The two questions, \\"Will China become a democracy?\\" and \\"Will China ever become a true democracy?\\" are indeed paraphrases of each other. Both questions inquire about the possibility of China transforming its political system into a democratic one. Now, let us delve into a detailed analysis of whether China could become a democracy in the future. China becoming a democracy is a complex topic, with many factors contributing to this discussion. At present, China operates under a one-party socialist system, with the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) holding supreme authority over political, economic, and social matters. Whether China will become a democracy depends on a multitude of factors, including internal and external pressures, and the various dynamics that may drive or hinder such an outcome. 1. Economic factors:China's rapid economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty, enabling the country to become the world's second-largest economy. This economic success has bolstered the legitimacy of the CCP. However, as the Chinese middle class continues to grow, they may desire greater political freedom and representation to safeguard their economic interests. Should China face an economic downturn or if future progress slows significantly, this could create impetus for political reform. 2. Political factors: For now, the CCP remains firmly in control, suppressing dissent and political opposition. But internal divisions or dissatisfaction within the party, along with growing civil society and grassroots activism, could foster pressure for democratization. Additionally, some party members may come to believe that political reform is necessary for China's long-term stability, particularly if faced with mounting social, economic, or environmental challenges. 3. International factors: China's interactions with the rest of the world can impact the country's political trajectory. As China increases its global influence through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, it may face pressure to adopt more democratic practices to cooperate with democratic nations or to maintain legitimacy in the international community. Conversely, China could also maintain or strengthen its authoritarian stance in response to perceived external threats or to preserve its unique political model. 4. Cultural factors: China has a long history of centralized authority and Confucian values that emphasize respect for authority and social harmony. While the younger generation appears more open to democratic principles, it is unclear whether these values will translate into political reform. Additionally, the Chinese government has promoted nationalism as a way to protect the country's sovereignty, often linking Western-style democracy to foreign intervention and instability. In conclusion, the question of whether China will ever become a true democracy is multifaceted and remains uncertain. While there are factors that suggest potential for democratization, the Chinese Communist Party's current control over the nation's institutions and its determination to maintain power present significant challenges to the realization of a democratic system. Only time will reveal the future political direction of China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out  the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity  and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could. I stood there deep in thought. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But I think that it's time to change my prayer  because now I know my children are going to encounter hardship. Answer:","output":"Question: In the article, what did Dr. Gibbs believe about the relationship between watering trees and their growth? A. Watering trees regularly made them stronger and healthier. B. Not watering trees encouraged deeper roots and a stronger growth. C. Watering trees had no impact on their overall growth. D.

What is the most probable reason that the kids were photographed smiling while displaying their Obama dolls ?","output":"The most probable reason the kids were photographed smiling while displaying their Obama dolls is likely due to political event coverage. The story seems to unfold at a rally, where attendees, including children, are often presented with political memorabilia. In this case, it appears to be an event relating to Obama, as denoted by the gift of Obama dolls to the children. Politicians and their campaigns often use images of happy, smiling supporters in their promotional materials and media to create a sense of positivity, engagement, and broad support for their cause or candidate. By showcasing these moments, they aim to demonstrate their reach and influence among various demographics, in this case, children. These images can be powerful tools in shaping opinion and communicating a candidate's platform or campaign to the wider public. In this scenario, the photo of the children holding the dolls and smiling for the cameras could serve multiple communication objectives. It could be used to show that the event was family-friendly, that it generated a positive and jovial atmosphere, and even that the individual or campaign associated with Obama has support from all age groups - even the very young. However, it's worth noting that the author's use of the phrase \\"Gary and I rolled our eyes\\" may indicate a sense of cynicism or skepticism about the event or the actions captured in the photographs.

Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee.

Summarize this article: Higher-level speed calculations can get confusing because mathematicians and scientists use different definitions for \\"speed\\" and \\"velocity\\". A velocity has two components: a magnitude and a direction. The magnitude is equal to the object's speed. A change in the direction will cause a change in the velocity, but not in the speed.  For example, let's say that there are two cars moving in opposite directions. Both cars' speedometers read 50 km/hr, so they both have the same speed. However, since they are moving apart from each other, we say that one car has a velocity of -50 km/hr and one has a velocity of 50 km/hr. Just as you can calculate instantaneous speed, you can also calculate instantaneous velocity. Objects can have velocities with a negative magnitude (if they are moving in a negative direction relative to something else). However, there's no such thing as a negative speed, so in these cases the absolute value of the magnitude gives the object's speed. For this reason, in the example problem above, both cars have a speed of 50 km/hr. If you have a function s(t) that gives you the position of an object with regards to time, the derivative of s(t) will give you its velocity with regards to time. Just plug a time value into this equation for the variable t (or whatever the time value is) to get the velocity at this given time. From here, finding the speed is easy.  For example, let's say that an object's position in meters is given with the equation 3t2 + t - 4 where t = time in seconds. We want to know what the speed of the object is at t = 4 seconds. In this case, we can solve like this:  3t2 + t - 4 s'(t) = 2 × 3t + 1 s'(t) = 6t + 1   Now, we plug in t = 4: s'(t) = 6(4) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 meters/second. This is technically a velocity measurement, but since it's positive and direction is not mentioned in the problem, we can essentially use it for speed. Acceleration is a way of measuring the change in an object's velocity over time. This topic is a little too complex to explain fully in this article. However, it's useful to note that when you have a function a(t) that gives acceleration with regards to time, the integral of a(t) will give you velocity with regards to time. Note that it's helpful to know the object's initial velocity so that you can define the constant that results from an indefinite integral.  For example, let's say that an object has a constant acceleration (in m/s2 given by a(t) = -30. Let's also say that it has an initial velocity of 10 m/s. We need to find its speed at t = 12 s. In this case, we can solve like this:  a(t) = -30 v(t)= ∫ a(t)dt =  ∫ -30dt = -30t + C   To find C, we'll solve v(t) for t = 0. Remember that the object's initial velocity is 10 m/s.  v(0) = 10 = -30(0) + C 10 = C, so v(t) = -30t + 10   Now, we can just plug in t = 12 seconds. v(12) = -30(12) + 10 = -360 + 10 = -350. Since speed is the absolute value of velocity, the object's speed is 350 meters/second.","output":"The article discusses the differences between speed and velocity, as well as how to calculate them using mathematical equations. Speed is a scalar quantity that represents the rate of motion, while velocity includes both magnitude and direction. Instantaneous velocity can also be calculated for objects moving in a negative relative direction. By differentiating the position function (s(t)), one can find the velocity function, and subsequently the speed. Acceleration measures change in an object's velocity over time, and when integrating the acceleration function (a(t)), the velocity function can be obtained. Initial velocity is needed to find the constant from an indefinite integral. The article provides examples for better understanding of these concepts."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Q: Fact 1: An animal requires air for survival.  Fact 2: Oxygen Oxygen is in the air we breathe.  Given the two facts above, what do animals require for survival? The answer is:","output":"Animals require oxygen for survival, which is an essential component of the air they breathe. Oxygen plays a critical role in various biological processes within an animal's body, including cellular respiration, energy production, and maintaining overall health. Let's delve deeper into understanding the connection between these two facts and the importance of oxygen for animals. Fact 1 states that an animal requires air for survival. Air is a mixture of different gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases. When animals breathe in air, they take in these gases through their respiratory systems. The respiratory system, typically consisting of lungs in mammals and gills in fish, allows for the exchange of gases between an animal's body and the external environment. This exchange is crucial for sustaining life and maintaining proper bodily functions. Fact 2 reveals that oxygen is in the air we breathe. Oxygen, chemically represented as O2, is an element that forms diatomic molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, at approximately 21% concentration by volume. It is essential for life on Earth and serves as a key component in the process of cellular respiration – which is how animals generate energy from the food they consume. Given these two facts, we can conclude that animals require oxygen for survival, primarily because this crucial element facilitates the complex metabolic processes needed to sustain life. During cellular respiration, oxygen reacts with glucose, a type of sugar found in the food animals eat, to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) – the primary source of energy for cellular activities. The byproducts of this process include carbon dioxide and water, which are eventually eliminated from the body via the respiratory and excretory systems. Furthermore, oxygen plays an essential role in maintaining overall health, as it helps remove waste products, toxins, and harmful bacteria from an animal's body. It supports proper immune system function, allows for efficient nutrient absorption and delivery to cells, and contributes to the healing and regeneration processes. In conclusion, animals require oxygen for survival, as it is a vital component of the air they breathe and plays a significant role in various biological processes necessary for life. Oxygen's importance in cellular respiration, energy production, and maintaining overall health makes it an indispensable element for animals and all living organisms on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: A). different meanings. B). the same meaning..... A:","output":"A). Different meanings. Although the word \\"turn\\" is used in both sentences, it indicates distinct actions in each context. In the first sentence (1) \\"Turn your palm this way,\\" the word \\"turn\\" refers to the act of changing the position or orientation of your palm. The action involves rotating or pivoting your hand to adjust its alignment, typically by moving the wrist as a center point. This type of rotation is common when giving instructions on how to position the hand for various tasks, such as holding an object or performing a specific gesture. On the other hand, in the second sentence (2) \\"Turn the clay on the wheel,\\" the word \\"turn\\" has a different meaning. It refers to the act of rotating the clay while it's on a potter’s wheel, which is a circular platform that spins horizontally. In this context, the potter would typically use their hands or tools to shape the clay as it rotates on the wheel, creating a symmetrical, round, or cylindrical form. The turning motion stems from the wheel's movement rather than direct hand manipulation. In summary, the word \\"turn\\" has different meanings in each sentence: in the first, it indicates changing the position or orientation of a body part (the palm), while in the second, it describes the rotary process of shaping clay on a spinning wheel."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: NEW BRUNSWICK — Former Rutgers University student Dharun Ravi was found guilty today of a hate crime, evidence tampering and invasion of privacy, for secretly using a webcam to spy on his roommate’s liaison with another man in their dorm room.      In the high-profile case that sparked awareness of cyber-bullying and harassment of gay teenagers, Ravi, 20, was convicted on parts of all 15 counts against him — including four bias intimidation counts — involving his former roommate, Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old freshman. However, the jury had some difficulty with portions of the bias counts, giving a split verdict on some of the specific acts in which he was charged.      The jury found Ravi not guilty of all bias counts pertaining to the man Clementi was seen with during the webcam spying.      Sitting passively at the defense table, his parents seated in the first row behind him in the standing-room-only courtroom, Ravi showed little emotion as the verdict was read by the forewoman. The 15-member jury, including three alternates, reached its verdict shortly before noon, following two and a half days of deliberation.      \\"We had a 20-year-old's life in our hands,\\" said juror Bruno Ferreira. \\"We were deciding his fate.\\"      • FULL BREAKDOWN OF THE CHARGES AND EACH VERDICT      Sentencing has been tentatively set for May 21. Ravi also faces the possibility of deportation to his native India. Prosecutors declined to change the status on Ravi's 25,000 bail. He already surrendered his passport.      47 Gallery: PHOTOS: Dharun Ravi convicted in Rutgers webcam spying trial      Clementi committed suicide a few days after learning Ravi had watched him on a webcam set up in the dorm room the two young men shared. Ravi was never charged in connection with Clementi's death, in the closely-watched case that attracted national media attention.      The Clementi family, who was present throughout the proceedings, afterward expressed their thanks to prosecutors and the judge in the case but said the trial was difficult for the family.      “The trial was painful for us, as it would be for any parents. We wanted to be here for our son and we believe the trial is important,\\" said Tyler’s father, Joe Clementi. “We have come to understand that criminal law is only one way of addressing these problems.\\"      Noting the establishment of the Tyler Clementi Foundation in his son’s memory, Clementi said, “You can make the world a better place. The change you want to see in the world begins with you.\\"      Following the verdict, Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said the investigation had been uniquely challenging because “we didn’t have Tyler to testify.”      He added that identifying and analyzing all of the social media was another challenge of prosecuting.      Kaplan said the prosecution went to \\"extraordinary efforts\\" to protect the identity of the man Clementi was kissing when Ravi saw them, who testified during the trial. Named only as “M.B.” in court proceedings and documents, his identity was protected because he was considered a sex crime victim in the case.      “Tyler Clementi and M.B. were the victims of invasion of privacy,” said Kaplan. “Regardless of public opinion we were obligated to follow the law, we were obligated to follow the facts.”      Attorneys for Ravi had no immediate comment, but one of them later told The Star-Ledger he plans to file an appeal.      \\"We have a large number of issues surrounding evidence and law, as we dictated during the course of the trial,\\" defense attorney Steve Altman said. \\"Some of that evidence was determined by the judge to be irrelevant, that we think is very relevant.\\"      After the judge set a sentencing date, Ravi and his family were ushered out the front of the courtroom. As Ravi stepped out of the courtroom to the flashing cameras, his mother placed her arm around the small of his back.      The family and their lawyers headed to the elevators and were surrounded by a crush of media as they waited to board the elevators, while some reporters and camera crews ran downstairs to try to catch them on the way out.      Before the case went to trial, Ravi rejected a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail. Under the terms, he would have gotten probation and be required to perform 600 hours of community service and receive counseling.      JURY NOT IN CONFLICT      Ferreira said the jurors were not in conflict with each other during deliberations.      \\"I'm actually satisfied with the verdict. It was very hard, very difficult. Nothing means we would be personally biased toward the defendant. You have to look at all the facts and the evidence. That's why you have 24 counts guilty and 11 not guilty. Witness statements and the evidence were not there to prove those,\\" he said. \\"This was very difficult, but it was a really good experience. You feel like justice has been served.      Prosecutors presented more than 20 witnesses over 12 days of testimony, including students who lived in Ravi and Clementi's dormitory, Davidson Hall, law enforcement officials, Rutgers residence life staff and computer experts.      Clementi, a shy violinist from Ridgewood, and Ravi, a tech-savvy computer geek from Plainsboro, were seemingly ill-matched from the start. The two roommates were worried about living together from nearly the moment they learned each other's names, according to documents filed in court.      When Clementi asked to use their room on Sept. 19, 2010, Ravi went to the room of a friend, Molly Wei, and turned on his webcam from her laptop. Witnesses for the state testified that Ravi built an ”automatic accept” feature on his webcam to access it from elsewhere.      Wei and Ravi saw Clementi and M.B. kissing for a few seconds, and Ravi tweeted to his followers that he saw his \\"roommate making out with a dude.\\"      Two days later, when Clementi asked for the room again, Ravi set up the webcam and double-checked that it was angled at Clementi's bed, according to two students who testified. He also dared his Twitter followers to chat him during the hours Clementi had asked for their room.      One witness testified that Ravi was \\"uncomfortable\\" having a gay roommate. Another read a text message in which Ravi explained his computer would \\"keep the gays away.\\"      But on cross-examination, about a half dozen friends and dorm neighbors of Ravi's told Steve Altman, his lawyer, that Ravi never said anything malicious or derogatory about his gay roommate or about gay people in general.      After the prosecution rested last Thursday, the defense called seven witnesses in quick succession, all friends and co-workers of Ravi's father who said they had never heard him say anything negative about gay people, though they had never actually discussed the topic with him.      Throughout the trial, Altman maintained that Ravi only looked at the webcam to see what was going on in his room because he was put off by M.B.'s scruffy appearance. Ravi told police in a statement that M.B. didn't acknowledge him, appeared much older than a college student, and he got a \\"bad vibe\\" from him.      On the evidence charges, prosecutors said Ravi deleted dozens of relevant text messages and tweets, and tried to influence what Wei told police.      Clementi, who leaped to his death from the George Washington Bridge, came after a series of suicides of other young teenagers around the country who were bullied because they were gay or perceived to be gay.      The trial lasted nearly four weeks.      Star-Ledger staff writers Jessica Calefati, Sue Epstein, Peggy McGlone and Ted Sherman contributed to this report.

Mr. Ravi, 20, wearing a dark suit over his slight frame, sat expressionless as the jury forewoman read the verdict on the first count, of invasion of privacy. But he seemed surprised when she pronounced him guilty on the next charge, of bias intimidation. His eyes popped and he quickly turned his head from the jury. As he left the courtroom in a swarm of television cameras, his mother clutching his arm, he looked straight ahead and said nothing.      The jury also found him guilty of lying to investigators, trying to influence a witness and tampering with evidence after he tried to cover up Twitter and text messages inviting others to join in the viewing.      Some of the charges carry penalties of 5 to 10 years in prison. Mr. Ravi has surrendered his passport; prosecutors said he could face possible deportation to his native India , but that decision would be left to immigration officials. Judge Glenn Berman set sentencing for May 21.      The case was a rare one in which almost none of the facts were in dispute. Mr. Ravi’s lawyers agreed that he had set up a webcam on his computer, and had then gone into a friend’s room and viewed Mr. Clementi kissing a man he met a few weeks earlier on a Web site for gay men. He sent Twitter and text messages urging others to watch when Mr. Clementi invited the man again two nights later, then deleted messages after Mr. Clementi killed himself.      That account had been established by a long trail of electronic evidence — from Twitter feeds and cellphone records, dormitory surveillance cameras, dining hall swipe cards and a “net flow” analysis showing when and how computers in the dormitory connected.      What the jury had to decide, and what set off debate outside as well as inside the courtroom, was what Mr. Ravi and Mr. Clementi were thinking.      Photo      Had Mr. Ravi set up the webcam because he had a pretty good idea that he would see Mr. Clementi in an intimate moment? Had he targeted Mr. Clementi and the man he was with because they were gay? And had Mr. Clementi been in fear?      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Without Mr. Clementi to speak for himself, that last question was perhaps the most difficult to determine, and jurors struggled with it.      “That was the hardest because you really can’t get into someone’s head,” said one, Bruno Ferreira, as he left the court. The jury deliberated longest — for well more than an hour, he said — on the bias intimidation charge.      Mr. Ferreira said he ultimately voted guilty on the bias intimidation charge because Mr. Ravi had sent multiple Twitter messages about Mr. Clementi.      “They were being done twice, not just one day,” he said.      Another juror, Kashad Leverett, himself a student and a Twitter user, said he could relate to Mr. Ravi’s constant stream of Twitter and text messages.      But the defense’s insistence that Mr. Ravi had set up the webcam because he was afraid Mr. Clementi’s visitor would steal something, he said, rang hollow.      “If I knew someone was going to steal something from me, I would definitely take it with me,” Mr. Leverett said, adding, “Just from the fact of the second incident, it seemed that it was intentional.”      Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Reflecting the difficulty of defining hate crimes, it had taken the judge more than an hour simply to instruct the jury on the questions they had to answer to reach a verdict.      The jury concluded that Mr. Ravi had not knowingly or purposely intimidated the men when he watched the first time, on Sept. 19, 2010.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      But it found him guilty of the charge because Mr. Clementi “reasonably believed” he had been made a target because he was gay.      Photo      The prosecution had pointed out that Mr. Clementi had checked Mr. Ravi’s Twitter feed — where Mr. Ravi told others he had seen his roommate “kissing a dude” — 38 times in the days after the first webcam viewing. Records showed that Mr. Clementi had gone online to request a room change, and a resident assistant testified that Mr. Clementi had complained to him.      Mr. Clementi’s parents, Joe and Jane, attended the trial each day, sitting in the front row and showing little emotion.      After the verdict, Joe Clementi, the director of public works in the northern New Jersey town of Hawthorne, read a brief statement, saying the trial had been “painful for us, as it would be for any parent who must sit and listen to people talk about bad and inappropriate things that were done to their child.”      Mostly, he said, he wanted to deliver a message to middle- and high-school students.      “You’re going to meet a lot of people in your lifetime,” he said. “Some of these people you may not like. Just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean you have to work against them. When you see somebody doing something wrong, tell them: ‘That’s not right. Stop it.’ The change you want to see in the world begins with you.”      Mr. Clementi’s suicide came up only in passing during the trial. Still, the death defined the trial, turning what might have been a peeping Tom case or, as the resident assistant said, “a roommate issue” into something far more grave.      The testimony painted a picture of two college freshmen, both from top-performing high schools in well-off suburbs, who could not have been more different. Mr. Clementi was shy and awkward, an accomplished violinist who had only recently told his parents he was gay. Mr. Ravi was popular but boastful, a computer wizard and ultimate Frisbee player who communicated with friends constantly via Twitter, text message and iChat.      Mr. Ravi’s parents, who brought him here from India when he was young, sat vigil behind him each day, with a large group of friends, including several who had served as character witnesses for Mr. Ravi, testifying he was not biased against gay people.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Mr. Ravi had rejected plea deals, because prosecutors would have required him to admit to bias intimidation. His lawyers said he simply did not believe he had committed a hate crime. They argued that he was “a kid” with little experience of homosexuality who had stumbled into a situation that scared him.      His lead lawyer, Steven Altman, made only a brief statement via e-mail following the verdict, saying “rest assured” he would appeal.      Gay rights advocates, who had used the example of Mr. Clementi’s suicide to push New Jersey to pass what is considered the nation’s toughest antibullying law, hailed the jury’s decision.      “This verdict sends the important message that a ‘kids will be kids’ defense is no excuse to bully another student,” said Steven Goldstein, the chairman of Garden State Equality.      Mr. Kaplan, the county prosecutor, rejected suggestions that Mr. Ravi would not have been on trial if Mr. Clementi had not killed himself. Even if he had not, he said, “under these facts, under this evidence, we would prosecute this case.” ||||| Summary:","output":"Dharun Ravi, a former Rutgers University student, was found guilty of a hate crime, evidence tampering, and invasion of privacy for secretly using a webcam to spy on his roommate Tyler Clementi's intimate encounter with another man in their dorm room.

Q: If I tell you that Electricity flows when the wire touches the battery, and ask you the question \\"what happens when the wire touches the battery?\\", is the correct answer \\"chemical reaction\\"?  -- Yes -- No The answer is:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"chemical reaction.\\" When the wire touches the battery, the correct answer is that \\"Electricity flows.\\" However, it is important to note that a chemical reaction does take place within the battery, which is responsible for creating the flow of electricity. The battery contains a positive and a negative end, known as terminals. Inside the battery, there is an electrolyte solution and two electrodes (cathode and anode) that allow chemical reactions to occur when a conductive wire connects the battery's positive and negative terminals. Upon connecting the wire to the battery, an electrical circuit is formed, allowing electrons to flow. This flow of electrons is what we refer to as electricity. It facilitates the transfer of energy and is the driving force behind powering electrical devices. The chemical reaction inside the battery causes the anode to lose electrons (oxidation) while the cathode gains electrons (reduction). This difference in charge is what enables electrical current to flow through the conductive wire and complete the circuit. Hence, when the wire touches the battery, the flow of electricity occurs due to the chemical reactions inside the battery. So, while the chemical reaction inside the battery is an essential factor contributing to this process, the correct answer to the question \\"what happens when the wire touches the battery?\\" is still \\"Electricity flows.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both sentences essentially communicate that \\"the company\\" has successfully negotiated and agreed upon the terms for acquiring the paper division of Buhrmann, a Dutch office supplies group that holds the distinction of being the largest paper distributor in Europe. To break down the similarities in the two sentences more closely: 1. In both sentences, \\"the company\\" is mentioned as the subject that is carrying out the action. It is clearly established that \\"the company\\" will be acquiring the paper division. 2. Both sentences emphasize the Dutch office supplies group as \\"Buhrmann.\\" This ensures that the audience knows exactly which organization is being referred to. 3. The attribute of Buhrmann being the \\"largest paper distributor in Europe\\" is specified in both sentences. This highlights the significance of the acquisition and its potential impact on the paper distribution market. 4. The crucial action highlighted in both sentences is that \\"the company\\" has reached an \\"agreement on the terms\\" for the purchase of the paper division. This phrasing implies that the negotiations have been completed and the parties have mutually agreed upon the terms of the acquisition. The difference in word order and sentence structure between the two sentences does not change the overall meaning, but rather serves as a stylistic variation. Regardless of the differences in phrasing, the key points - the company acquiring the paper division, the identity of the Dutch office supplies group, and the agreed-upon terms - remain consistent across both sentences.

Question: Why do insects want to be pollinators? Context: Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology. The answer is:","output":"Insects want to be pollinators because they usually receive benefits for the pollination in the form of energy-rich nectar. This is a grand example of mutualism, where both the plant and the insect benefit from the interaction.

As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40. Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Some treaties, when they don't allow a state to withdraw, establish certain conditions and restrictions with the aim of maintaining stability and predictability in the international legal order. In the context you provided from the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, when a treaty is silent about the possibility of withdrawal, there is a general presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced. However, this presumption can be rebutted under certain conditions: 1. It can be proven that the parties intended to allow for withdrawal. 2. The nature of the treaty implies the right to withdraw. These conditions ensure that, in the absence of an explicit provision, the parties have a shared understanding of their rights and obligations under the treaty, and that the possibility of withdrawal is consistent with the essence and purpose of that treaty. There are several reasons why some treaties may expressly forbid withdrawal: 1. To safeguard the long-term objectives of the treaty: Restricting the ability to withdraw from a treaty ensures that signatory states remain committed to the core objectives of the treaty, which may be important for the overall success and effectiveness of the agreement. 2. To maintain stability and certainty: By preventing states from easily withdrawing from a treaty, the agreement becomes more predictable and stable. This fosters trust and cooperation among the parties and allows them to make long-term plans based on the treaty. 3. To protect weaker states: In some cases, particularly in treaties concerning human rights or disarmament, an outright ban on withdrawal aims to protect the rights of weaker states against powerful states that could potentially exploit the possibility of withdrawal to avoid fulfilling their treaty obligations. When a treaty does allow for withdrawal, it usually prescribes specific procedures for notification, which can include waiting periods, opportunities for negotiation, and consultation among other signatory states. These procedural requirements help to ensure that withdrawal is a carefully considered decision and not a rash, impulsive action."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write a title:  NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks showed small gains at the  open on Monday as easing oil prices alleviated investors' worry  about the effect of higher fuel costs on corporations and  consumers.","output":"Title: \\"U.S. Stocks Experience Moderate Gains Amidst Subsiding Oil Prices: A Positive Outlook for Corporations and Consumers Alike\\" Introduction: The stock market has consistently been a cornerstone of economic news, flitting between rapid recoveries and volatile plummets to reflect the global state of affairs. Recently, however, investors and analysts have begun to observe a more positive trend in U.S. stocks as oil prices begin to gradually decline. This phenomenon has prompted an enhancement in the overall financial landscape, sparking optimism among corporations and individual consumers. Body: 1. The Shifting Landscape of U.S. Stocks: With the opening of the stock market on Monday, financial experts were quick to notice that U.S. stocks displayed small but promising gains. These minor achievements followed a tumultuous period defined by erratic fluctuations in the market, causing investors to anxiously monitor the constantly shifting landscape. By taking a closer look at the underlying factors driving these changes, it becomes clear that it is the decrease in oil prices that have allowed for a more encouraging financial outlook. 2. Easing Oil Prices and Their Impact on the Market: A prominent influence on the movement of U.S. stocks has been the recent decline in oil prices. Fuel costs have long been a versatile factor capable of swaying the developments in various markets, especially when it comes to corporate expenses and consumer spending habits. As oil prices dip, corporations have greater opportunities to invest in other sectors and expand their growth potential, leading to enhanced stock performances. 3. Corporate Impacts: Lower oil prices work to alleviate many of the concerns that tend to plague corporations. The resulting reduction in operating expenses frees up additional resources that can ultimately be channeled towards growth, rather than being consumed by the steep costs of fuel. This newfound financial flexibility not only bolsters a corporation's internal operations but also reflects in its stock market performance, often translating to higher returns for investors. 4. Consumer Benefits: As fuel costs continue to decrease, the positive effects will not only be felt by businesses, but by consumers as well. Reduced prices at the pump lead to greater disposable income, empowering consumers to make more purchases and contribute to economic growth. The surge in consumer spending will, in turn, benefit corporations, causing stock market performance to strengthen even more. 5. The Positive Feedback Loop: In essence, the decline in oil prices has initiated a positive feedback loop in the U.S. stock market. Lower fuel costs have brightened the outlook for corporations, leading to stronger stock market results, which then further uplift consumer spending. This perpetuating cycle embodies a promising trend for both business entities and individual consumers, with stock market rebounds signaling long-lasting stability in the market. Conclusion: The small but notable gains witnessed in the U.S. stock market – driven by the easing of oil prices – showcase a more optimistic financial landscape for all involved. As corporations benefit from reduced operating expenses and consumers enjoy increased disposable income, the stock market will continue to experience a resounding rebound that perpetuates long-term growth and stability. While unforeseen changes are always a possibility, one thing is clear: a relieving trend has emerged in the stock market, breathing new life into the economy and fostering a sense of optimism for corporations and consumers alike."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Title: O my god this is a great book!

That to -do list that keeps multiplying. It is no wonder many of us find it difficult to have a sufficient amount of sleep. But will sleeping more on the weekend make up for hours of lost snoozing  ? One sleep expert, W. Christopher Winter raised the question. Sleeping binge Getting eight hours of shut-eye each night is generally recommended, but many people don't. As the week rolls from Monday to Friday, they accumulate a sleep debt. Spending a few extra hours in bed on a Saturday morning, people assume, will help them \\" catch up\\" on lost sleep. They're likely right, \\" Nobody knows how long the horizon is, probably a few nights, but studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work,\\" says Dr. Winter, a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sleep banking Recent data suggests that banking sleep in advance of a long night can actually offset   upcoming sleep deprivation . If you knew you were going to have to stay up all night on a particular day, for example, you could sleep for 10 hours a day for multiple days before the event, and be fine, Dr. Winter says. Just plan ahead. Routine  naps A scheduled nap is healthier than catching up on or banking sleep. \\" Because sleep extension can make you feel groggy  , I always recommend a short nap [if a person feels they need it ], at the same time, every day,\\" says Dr. Winter. He adds that 25 minutes is ideal. \\" When you schedule a short nap, your body anticipates it and slows down, without falling into a deep dream sleep,\\" he says. That refreshing, scheduled break is better than an occasional weekend lie-in. \\" The body likes routine,\\" he says, \\" When it's prepared, it works more efficiently.\\" Question: From Monday to Friday, many people   _  .

Many individuals find it challenging to get the recommended eight hours of sleep each night during the weekdays. As a result, they accumulate sleep debt and try to catch up on their sleep over the weekend, hoping that the extra hours on Saturday or Sunday morning will make up for the hours of lost sleep throughout the week. Although studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work, sleep experts like Dr. W. Christopher Winter suggest that routine naps or sleep banking in advance of a particularly busy or sleepless period may be more effective strategies to maintain a healthy sleep schedule."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph:  Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Chavez said his cancer treatment is going well and he is \\"advancing optimally.\\" In June, Chavez announced that doctors had removed a cancerous tumor from his body, but the Venezuelan leader has not specified what type of cancer. He traveled to Cuba last month for about a week of chemotherapy. Chavez was jovial as he spoke to members of his Cabinet for more than an hour after swearing in several new government ministers. He mocked critics for widespread speculation about his illness. \\"They keep speculating without any scientific basis,\\" he said. Chavez also reiterated his support for Moammar Gadhafi, reading a letter he recently received from the embattled Libyan leader. In the letter, Gadhafi said he was praying for Chavez's health and decried what he called a global conspiracy against Libya. Chavez and Gadhafi have a close relationship, having bonded partly over shared opposition to the United States' global influence. In 2009, a new football stadium in Libya was named after Chavez. The Venezuelan leader has spoken out numerous times since unrest erupted in Libya, accusing the United States and other countries of blowing the situation out of proportion to justify an invasion.

Remove the spaces from the following sentence: Major news and very important changes in the project are announced here.","output":"Removing spaces from the given sentence, we get: \\"Majornewsandveryimportantchangesintheprojectareannouncedhere.\\" This process effectively eliminates any space characters between the words, resulting in a continuous string of characters without any breaks. This can be useful, for example, when creating a condensed version of the text, such as a URL or a unique identifier. In most cases, though, it's essential to keep spaces in between words to maintain readability and proper comprehension. Spaces play an important role when it comes to written language, as they help us visually distinguish separate words, organize sentence structure, and facilitate understanding. However, if the purpose of this exercise is to practice the task of removing spaces in a string, one can achieve this using various programming languages and built-in string manipulation functions. For example, in Python, you can use the \`replace()\` method to remove spaces in a string: \`\`\`python text = \\"Major news and very important changes in the project are announced here.\\" no_spaces = text.replace(\\" \\", \\"\\") print(no_spaces) \`\`\` This code would output: \\"Majornewsandveryimportantchangesintheprojectareannouncedhere.\\" In JavaScript, you can achieve the same result using the \`split()\` and \`join()\` methods: \`\`\`javascript const text = \\"Major news and very important changes in the project are announced here.\\"; const noSpaces = text.split(\\" \\").join(\\"\\"); console.log(noSpaces); \`\`\` This code would log: \\"Majornewsandveryimportantchangesintheprojectareannouncedhere.\\" Keep in mind that removing spaces without any context or proper format could lead to confusion and difficulty interpreting the intended message, so it's always crucial to consider the purpose before applying such modifications to written text."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is important for the narrator to honor their daughter's wishes and make her feel loved and appreciated on her special day. The daughter specifically requested an angel food cake, which indicates that this type of cake holds some significance or preference for her. Therefore, the narrator wants to ensure they fulfill this request, demonstrating their care and attention to her desires. Furthermore, baking a cake from scratch, especially an angel food cake, tends to be more time-consuming and labor-intensive than using a store-bought cake or mix. This type of cake typically involves beating egg whites, sifting flour multiple times, and carefully folding ingredients together to create a light and fluffy texture. By committing the time and effort to make this cake, the narrator is emphasizing the importance of their daughter's birthday and showing their dedication to making it an enjoyable celebration. Additionally, baking a cake at home often carries emotional value, as it can strengthen the bond between family members and create long-lasting memories. Preparing a homemade cake can serve as a symbol of love and devotion, and the time the narrator spends in the kitchen shows their commitment to ensuring their daughter has a memorable and heartwarming birthday experience. However, the narrator encountered an issue with their oven not preheating as expected, causing further delay in the cake-making process. This complication may lead to additional time spent in the kitchen troubleshooting the issue and finding a solution in order not to disappoint their daughter. In summary, the narrator is spending a significant amount of time baking because they are focused on honoring their daughter's cake request, providing a personalized and memorable birthday experience, building a stronger emotional bond within the family, and overcoming unexpected technical difficulties with their oven."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Real estate agents are licensed by the state. Most states maintain a website and include forms on the web to lodge a complaint. Perform an Internet search to locate your area's real estate licensing board. For example, if you live in California, use keywords such as \\"California real estate licensing\\" to locate the website for the Department of Real Estate in California. Most states require that you download a PDF and fill it out before mailing it back. Provide all information requested. Incomplete forms may not be processed or could detract from your credibility.  For increased legibility type the form or print with black ink.   Forms vary by state, but they typically require filling out your personal information (name and address) as well as the name, address, and business name of the agent. Forms also may ask whether a legal action has been started. If so, they will ask for the name of your attorney as well as the attorney’s contact information (address and phone number).  You must sign the form under penalty of perjury. If you do not feel comfortable doing this, you may want to schedule a meeting with the agent’s supervisor instead of lodging a formal complaint. After selecting the category of complaint, you must inform the state agency of the factual grounds for the dispute. Some forms will provide a space for this information, but feel free to type this out on a separate piece of paper and attach it to your complaint.  Answer the questions “who, what, where, when, and how.” That is, describe who did what, where it happened, when it happened, and how it happened. Note any promises that were made and the actual language used. Include the names of witnesses as well as their contact information. Describe events in chronological order for increased clarity.  You don’t want to confuse the state board. Provide a complete copy of receipts, cancelled checks, contracts, closing documents, title documents, and correspondence.  Send only copies of supporting documentation, never the originals, and make sure that they are legible. The address should be on the form. Be sure to keep a copy of the entire complaint, including any attachments. You can refer to this copy to refresh your memory should someone contact you later about your dispute. After a complaint is filed, the state board considers whether or not to open an investigation. If one is opened, the case is then handed to an investigator, who may want to interview you.   Though procedure may vary by state, in the typical hearing the only two parties are the state and the agent.  You are not a party to the proceedings, though you may be called as a witness. If no action is taken, the state board will likely send you a letter to that effect. Summary:","output":"To lodge a complaint against a real estate agent, locate your state's real estate licensing board website through an internet search.

During a workshop, black tulle and neoprene have been formed into contemporary answers to that question. The idea of reviving the black bridal dress is fascinating as it breaks the conventional norms of wearing white or ivory wedding dresses. Historically, people associated white wedding dresses with purity and innocence. However, the modern bride is continuously looking for ways to express her individuality and stand out during her wedding. Incorporating black into a wedding dress, or even opting for a completely black bridal gown, can signify a combination of elegance, boldness, and a personal statement that represents the bride. The use of black tulle and neoprene in a wedding dress workshop is an excellent example of contemporary fashion meeting tradition. Black tulle, a lightweight and versatile material made of silk or nylon, can be used to create delicate layers or adornments to the gown. This material is both sultry and sophisticated, adding a unique and luxurious touch to the bridal attire. Neoprene, on the other hand, is a synthetic rubber material known for its durability and flexibility. It is mostly used in modern fashion for its fascinating contrasts, as it gives structure to garments while offering comfort and ease of movement. When used in a bridal gown, neoprene can provide a contemporary and avant-garde touch, breaking the mold of the traditional wedding dress. By bringing black tulle and neoprene together during a workshop, designers can explore various ways to create stunning, innovative, and captivating wedding dresses that transform the idea of the black bridal gown.

Does the answer correctly answer the question Options: [I] yes [II] no","output":"[II] no The French were assisted in taking forts Oswego and William Henry by their Native American allies, including the Abenaki, Algonquin, Lenape, and Iroquois tribes, among others. These allies played a significant role in supporting the French military efforts during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), which was part of the larger global conflict known as the Seven Years' War. At Fort Oswego, a key British outpost on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, French forces led by General Montcalm, alongside Native American allies, attacked and captured the fort in August 1756. The successful siege led to the capture of significant military supplies and weakened the British position in the region. Fort William Henry, located on the southern shore of Lake George in what is now upstate New York, was also targeted by French forces. In August 1757, Montcalm, along with a sizable force of French soldiers and Native American allies, laid siege to the British-held fort. The British, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel George Monro, surrendered after a week of bombardment. The French granted the British troops and their families safe passage to nearby Fort Edward. The French and Indian War saw a series of alliances between European powers and Native American tribes. The French were successful in winning the support of various tribes due to their established fur trading networks and their policy of not encroaching on tribal lands, as the British often did. These alliances ultimately influenced the outcome of many battles and campaigns during the war, including the taking of forts Oswego and William Henry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Do people ever consider the possibility that, if they're exposed to increased reports about a social problem, it's the reporting that has increased rather than the problem? It's increasingly clear that this is the case with school bullying :Only news reports about it have increased, not the behavior itself. In fact, both bullying and fear of it are down among US middle school students The rate of students who reported fearing an attack or harm at school at all has dropped dramatically, from nearly 12% in 1995 to less than 4% in 2011. For black and Hispanic students, it's an even more encouraging shift--from more than 20% of both groups of students worried about being attacked at school to less than 5% in 2011. The decline in actual physical violence in schools is even more dramatic: It was down 74% between 1992 and 2010, according to the latest US Department of Justice data. What about cyberbullying? Online _ increased from 6% in 2000 to 9% in 2005 to 11% in 2010 between, and it's interesting to note that it increased less between 2005 and '10 than in the first 5 years tracked. Because social media is very much a reflection of school social life for young people, the peer aggression seen in social media is a lot like the peer aggression seen on school bathroom walls. So once it finds its \\"dead level,\\" it will probably decline in the same way verbal and written aggression have. Besides education and crime prevention at the social level, medicine treatment and better access to mental healthcare also contribute to this downward trend in victimization of self and others. The rise of social media is what people don't typically think of as a positive force in society. But Finkelhor, director of the Crimes Against Children Research Center at the University of New Hampshire says, \\"These technologies might have prevented crime and bullying by providing more ways of help, more forms of social supervision, and interesting activities that destroy forms of alienation  that lead to crime\\".

Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake. They decide to use a satellite orbiting above the continent which can trigger earthquakes. They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, the plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south it travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses with the caldera it would erupt, expelling 2,000,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions immediately and causing a Volcanic winter. They decide to set explosives to block the fault's path.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. ‘Catastrophic breeding event’ leads to demands for a marine protected area to be set up in East Antarctica      A colony of about 40,000 Adélie penguins in Antarctica has suffered a “catastrophic breeding event” – all but two chicks have died of starvation this year. It is the second time in just four years that such devastation – not previously seen in more than 50 years of observation – has been wrought on the population.      The finding has prompted urgent calls for the establishment of a marine protected area in East Antarctica, at next week’s meeting of 24 nations and the European Union at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart.      Penguins starving to death is a sign that something’s very wrong in the Antarctic | John Sauven Read more      In the colony of about 18,000 breeding penguin pairs on Petrels Island, French scientists discovered just two surviving chicks at the start of the year. Thousands of starved chicks and unhatched eggs were found across the island in the region called Adélie Land (“Terre Adélie”).      The colony had experienced a similar event in 2013, when no chicks survived. In a paper about that event, a group of researchers, led by Yan Ropert-Coudert from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, said it had been caused by a record amount of summer sea ice and an “unprecedented rainy episode”.      The unusual extent of sea ice meant the penguins had to travel an extra 100km to forage for food. And the rainy weather left the chicks, which have poor waterproofing, wet and unable to keep warm.      This year’s event has also been attributed to an unusually large amount of sea ice. Overall, Antarctica has had a record low amount of summer sea ice, but the area around the colony has been an exception.      Ropert-Coudert said the region had been severely affected by the break-up of the Mertz glacier tongue in 2010, when a piece of ice almost the size of Luxembourg – about 80 km long and 40km wide – broke off. That event, which occurred about 250km from Petrels Island, had a big impact on ocean currents and ice formation in the region.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Thousands of dead chicks and unhatched eggs were found across the region called Adélie Land. Photograph: Y Ropert-Coudert/CNRS/IPEV      “The Mertz glacier impact on the region sets the scene in 2010 and when unusual meteorological events, driven by large climatic variations, hit in some years this leads to massive failures,” Ropert-Coudert told the Guardian. “In other words, there may still be years when the breeding will be OK, or even good for this colony, but the scene is set for massive impacts to hit on a more or less regular basis.”      The link between climate change and the sea-ice extent around Antarctica is not very clear. Sea ice has been increasing in recent years, which could be attributed to a rise in the amount of freshwater in the ocean around the continent caused by climate change. However, over the long term, climate change is expected to cause the sea ice to shrink dramatically.      “For the moment, sea ice is increasing and this is a problem for this species as it pushes the feeding place – the sea ice edge – farther away from their nesting place,” Ropert-Coudert said. “If it shrinks it would help but if it shrinks too much then the food chain they rely on may be impacted. Basically, as a creature of the sea ice they need an optimum sea-ice cover to thrive.”      Elsewhere, human pressures including climate change have already been having a severe impact on the numbers of Adélie penguins. On the Antarctic Peninsula, which has been badly affected by climate change, populations have been decreasing, and some researchers suggest they may become extinct there.      Ropert-Coudert said there were more anthropogenic threats on the horizon – fishing and possibly tourism – that the penguins needed protection from.      He has called for a marine protected area (MPA) to be established there.      Freedom for Miss Simpson, the penguin found 2,000km from home Read more      “An MPA will not remedy these changes but it could prevent further impacts that direct anthropogenic pressures, such as tourism and proposed fisheries, could bring,” he said.      Next week, 24 countries and the European Union will meet at the CCAMLR in Hobart to discuss the potential creation of more MPAs around Antarctica.      At last year’s meeting, after years of failed negotiations, the members agreed to create the world’s largest MPA in the Ross Sea, and many expect the group to agree on East Antarctica next.      This has also been proposed by Australia and has been on the table at the CCAMLR for eight years.      The head of polar programs at WWF, Rod Downie, said: “Adélie penguins are one of the hardiest and most amazing animals on our planet. This devastating event contrasts with the image that many people might have of penguins. It’s more like ‘Tarantino does Happy Feet’, with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adélie Land.      “The risk of opening up this area to exploratory krill fisheries, which would compete with the Adélie penguins for food as they recover from two catastrophic breeding failures in four years, is unthinkable. So CCAMLR needs to act now by adopting a new Marine Protected Area for the waters off East Antarctica, to protect the home of the penguins.”      Ropert-Coudert and his colleagues are in the process of completing a scientific paper on the breeding failure and plan to submit it to a journal in the coming weeks. ||||| (CNN) A penguin colony in Antarctica has suffered a massive breeding failure, with only two chicks surviving the disaster.      Terre Adélie (Adélie Land) is home to more than 18,000 pairs of Adélie penguins, but this year almost all the seabirds' babies starved to death, a situation one expert described as \\"Tarantino does Happy Feet.\\"      The World Wildlife Fund said unseasonably extensive amounts of sea ice around the colony in East Antarctica had forced the adult penguins to travel further than normal to forage for food.      \\"This devastating event contrasts with the image that many people might have of penguins,\\" said Rod Downie, Head of Polar Programmes at WWF. \\"It's more like 'Tarantino does Happy Feet', with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adélie Land.\\"      \\"The impact of this catastrophic event is confined to this specific colony of Adélie penguins, predictions are that the Antarctic will get warmer and this may pose different challenges in the longer term,\\" Downie added. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"A colony of around 40,000 Adélie penguins in East Antarctica has experienced a \\"catastrophic breeding event\\" with all but two chicks dying of starvation this year. This is the second time in just four years that such devastation, which had not previously been seen in over 50 years of observation, has occurred. The incident has led to urgent calls for a marine protected area to be established in the region. Experts attribute the catastrophe to an unusually large amount of sea ice, which has forced adult penguins to travel greater distances to forage for food, and the negative impact of climate change on the colony. A meeting of 24 nations and the European Union at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in Hobart will discuss the potential creation of more marine protected areas around Antarctica."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:This article: A cave family called the Croods survives a natural disaster, due to the overprotective nature of their stubborn and stern patriarch named Grug. The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time. Encountering a \\"Macawnivore\\", a brightly colored feline that Gran dubs \\"Chunky\\", the family flees him until he is scared off by swarms of piranhakeets that devour a ground whale. Using another horn, Eep calls to Guy who rescues them from the birds with his fire. After a great deal of confusion regarding their first contact with fire, Grug imprisons Guy in a log until he can guide them somewhere safe. Guy suggests the Croods go to a mountain where there are caves because the Crood family desires a cave. Grug refuses at first, but he decides to go with the promise of a cave. The other Croods were worried that they would get tired and bicker, but Grug doesn't listen. contains an answer for the question: In what does the human boy become trapped by Eep's dad?, what is it ?
