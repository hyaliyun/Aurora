The latter sector has two sub-sectors: one produces means of production needed to produce consumption goods, and another produces other means of production.4 ‘In order to be auto-centered an economy must contain production at all of these levels and especially at the two highest levels of reproductive importance’ which involve the production of the means of production (Ougaard, 1982: 389). In addition, the different sectors and subsectors must be articulated with one another, even if an auto-centred economy does not have to produce all the products in all the three major sectors (ibid.). In the core, accumulation is autocentric: ‘production of capital goods and the production of consumption goods’ are articulated with one another, and foreign relations of central economies ‘are subject to the requirements of this determinate articulation’, and therefore generally ‘labor’s pay can follow the progress of productivity’5 (Amin, 2009: 272). In contrast, the peripheral economy tends to be dominated more by the production of consumption goods and less by other types of production. A significant level of production in all the sectors/sub-sectors mentioned earlier is absent in a typical peripheral economy. An industrializing peripheral economy often assembles imported industrial parts, as it happens in many SEZs and Mexican maquiladoras. Or, some countries produce IT support, including in call-centres, for advanced countries. A major part of the periphery’s IT industry is actually similar to its manufacturing assembly, where low-paid engineers such as those in India ‘develop components or subpackages/assemblies/programmes that go into the final products made and marketed by US companies’ (Bidwai, 2003). Bidwai says that ‘a good proportion of the sub-programmes in Windows 95 and 98 were developed by Indian engineers. But it’s Mr Bill Gates who skimmed off the profits!’ (ibid.) The lack of articulation between the main sectors blocks the periphery’s economic development. Such an economy is also extraverted: internal linkages are not stronger than external ones. It remains export-oriented, or its production caters to the local elite (production of goods and services that workers and small-scale producers do not normally consume). Such a production system has, generally, little incentive, or need, to raise wages/income of the masses who are not the consumers of such a system (see Richards, 1986; De Janvry, 1981). Indeed, distribution of income/wealth does feed back into the nature of production system. So, apart from the peripheral society where capitalism exists mainly in the sphere of exchange relations, there are two other types of peripheral society from the standpoint of production. In one type, there is capitalist production of consumer goods for the domestic (and foreign) market. This society is ‘dependent on the import of means of production for its consumer industry’. Another type of peripheral society ‘produces the means of production for its consumer industry’ at least to a significant extent, but it is still ‘dependent on imports of the means of production for its own producer goods industry’ (Ougaard, 1982: 394). And ‘since this dependency is located at the highest level of reproductive importance it can be expected to lead to an intensification of the conflicts with foreign capital’ (ibid.). What are the implications of all this for the peripheral state then? The state has a role in facilitating the transition from the first lower level of peripheral economy (capitalism in circulation, export of raw materials) to the form where ‘a society can produce the means of production for its producer goods industry’ and where this production covers a significant part of the society’s needs and is reasonably integrated internally (Ougaard, 1982: 395—6). How well the state plays such a developmental role depends on a number of processes. These include which dominant class or class-strata (e.g. landlords, merchants, domestic capitalists, foreign capitalists, and so on) control state power; whether and to what extent the state can exercise autonomy vis-à-vis mutual competing capitalists and vis-à-vis conflicts between capital-owners and ground-rent receivers (landowners); and how well the state protects its capitalist (and small-scale) production from the globally operating law of value. The developmental state has reflected on some of these processes.6 Amin (2009: 273) says that ‘[i]n the periphery, constant adjustment in economies have to be made in relation to the economies of the core’. So, in the core, ‘[t]he state . . . fulfils the conditions that make possible autocentric accumulation and the dependence of foreign relations on the logic of that accumulation’, but in contrast, the peripheral state . . . does not control local accumulation. It is thus objectively, an instrument for the adjustment of the local society to the requirements of globalized accumulation, the tendencies of which are determined by the requirements of the center. This difference explains why the central state is a strong state and while the peripheral state is a weak state, says Amin. But to the extent that the periphery lacks economic dynamics associated with auto-centric production, the question is why? We need to turn to the very nature of capitalism in the periphery in terms of class relations and to imperialism as a form of class relation and explore their implications for the peripheral state. 2 Peripheral social formation dominated by ‘backward’ capitalism7 Whether in the global periphery or in the more economically advanced world, a society is capitalist if it is characterized by the dominance of the following features: commodity production, means of production confronting labour as capital, a class of nominally free labourers forced to work for a wage because they do not own sufficient means of production, and operation of the law of value (law of competition based on socially necessary labour time). When such conditions exist, then capitalist relation exists, at least in the sense of FSL. In FSL, lots of workers are hired to work for long hours on an enormous amount of raw materials with limited or little labour-shedding technical change used. There is hardly any place in the world which is not dominated by capitalism at least in this sense. While FSL is based on the appropriation of absolute surplus value, RSL is based on the appropriation of relative surplus value. RSL has all the features of FSL and an additional attribute — that is, the systematic tendency towards technical change. Then there is also hybrid subsumption, which is post-feudal and which does not involve wage labour; it involves exploitation by merchants and moneylenders of direct producers (see Das, 2017a: 340—90 for a detailed discussion on the subsumption of labour by capital). Marx says in the Appendix to Capital 1: FSL is ‘directly a process of the exploitation of the labour of others. . . . It is the general form of any capitalist production process’ (i.e. production process under the rule of capitalist social relation) (Marx, 1977b: 1019). As the more general form of capitalist production, it ‘can be found in the absence of the specifically capitalist mode of production’, which is RSL for Marx (ibid.). The two forms of subsumption are similar in the sense of the general conditions for capitalism. But a dialectical approach also sees a difference. Contrary to what Marx might (sometimes) have believed, the transition to RSL is not automatic, even if there is a long-term tendency towards the RSL, associated with a rise in the ratio of constant to variable capital (Das, 2017a). To me, the transition from FSL to RSL is contingent on the balance of power between the basis classes, which is expressed in the struggle of workers against the regime of long hours (and low wages). Class struggle (potential or actual) conditions the extent to which capitalists who are competing with one another cut costs of production through (a) the use of technology aimed at increasing labour productivity or (b) for example, FSL. And certain objective conditions can promote or constrain class struggle, and accordingly the transition to RSL can be quicker or be a prolonged process and geographically uneven. Advanced capitalism is characterized by a successful transition to RSL and the resultant economic dynamism. This transition has been partly possible because of two factors such as colonial transfer, and class struggle against capitalists using labour for long hours and low wages. However, in most parts of the periphery (and especially in its vast rural areas and in small towns), the situation is a little different. There are the necessary conditions for capitalist relations. In some areas, property owners may be formally subsuming labour (e.g. capitalists use highly vulnerable and low-cost labour, including labour that is reproduced outside of capitalist reproduction as in indigenous communities).8 In other areas, especially in selected large cities and villages near them, there do exist real subsumption. The state is connected to both, to the localized existence of RSL and to the obstacles to the transition to it. Let’s begin with localized existence of RSL. Backward countries can adopt technology from already-advanced countries, and this means that [t]he development of historically backward nations leads necessarily to a peculiar combination of different stages in the historic process’ leading to combined development ‘by which we mean a drawing together of the dif-ferent stages of the journey, a combining of the separate steps, an amalgam of archaic with more contemporary forms. (Trotsky, 2008: 4-5) By borrowing technology already developed in an advanced country, a peripheral country can skip some stages in the development process, thus producing combined development: The development of backward countries is characterized by its combined character. In other words, the last word of imperialist technology, economics, and politics is combined in these countries with traditional backwardness and primitiveness. (Trotsky, 1940) This means that in an LDC, technologically backward ‘peasant land-cultivation’ can coexist with an industry which ‘in its technique and capitalist structure’ is ‘at the level of the advanced countries’, and in certain respects it can even surpass industry in advanced countries (ibid.: 8). The peripheral capitalist state can be responsible for real subsumption, both by working with, and independently of, imperialism. Partly prompted by the struggles of the masses against low living standards and partly prompted by geopolitical rivalries (sometimes overlain by nationalist chauvinism with religious overtones), and in some cases, to protect their own capitals against imperialist competition (law of value), capitalist states in the periphery can give various forms of assistance to national capitals to introduce modern technologies and to increase labour productivity. This process may signal some kind of transition from formal to real subsumption.”翻译为中文","output":"1 在外围地区生产力的非协调发展 在一个经济体中，一个部门生产消费品，另一个部门生产生产资料。后者有两个子部门：一个生产生产消费品所需的生产资料，另一个生产其他生产资料。 “为了实现自我中心化，一个经济体必须包含所有这些层次的生产，尤其是在涉及生产生产资料的两个最重要层次上”（Ougaard，1982：389）。此外，不同的部门和子部门必须相互协调，即使一个自我中心化的经济体不必在所有三个主要部门中生产所有产品（同上）。 在核心地区，积累是自我为中心的：‘生产资本货物和生产消费品’相互协调，中心经济体的外国关系‘受到这一特定协调要求的制约’，因此通常‘劳动者的薪酬可以随着生产力的进步而增加’（Amin，2009：272）。相比之下，外围经济往往更多地被消费品生产所主导，其他类型的生产较少。典型的外围经济缺乏前面提到的所有部门/子部门中的大量生产。一个工业化的外围经济体常常组装进口的工业零件，就像许多特殊经济区和墨西哥的马基拉多拉工厂那样。或者，一些国家为发达国家提供IT支持，包括呼叫中心服务。外围地区的IT产业实际上与其制造业组装类似，其中像印度这样低薪的工程师“开发美国公司制造和市场销售的最终产品中所使用的组件或子包装/组装/程序”（Bidwai，2003）。Bidwai表示，“Windows 95和98中相当一部分子程序是由印度工程师开发的。但是赚大钱的是比尔·盖茨！”（同上）。 主要部门之间缺乏协调阻碍了外围地区的经济发展。这样的经济体也是外向型的：内部联系不如外部联系紧密。它仍然以出口为导向，或者它的生产服务于当地精英（生产工人和小规模生产者通常不消费的商品和服务）。这样的生产系统通常很少有激励或需要提高大众的工资/收入（参见Richards，1986；De Janvry，1981）。确实，收入/财富的分配反过来又会影响生产系统的性质。 那么，所有这些对外围国家又有什么意义呢？国家在从初级外围经济体（流通领域的资本主义，原材料出口）转型到“一个社会可以为其生产者商品工业生产生产资料”的形式，在这里，这种生产覆盖了社会的重要部分需求并且在内部相对完整地整合（Ougaard，1982：395-6）方面，具有促进作用。国家在发挥这种发展作用上的表现取决于许多过程。这些包括哪一个主导阶级或阶层（例如地主、商人、国内资本家、外国资本家等）控制国家权力；国家在何种程度上可以对相互竞争的资本家以及资本所有者和地租接收者（地主）之间的冲突行使自主权；以及国家如何保护其资本主义（和小规模）生产免受全球价值法则的影响。发展型国家已经反思了其中的一些过程。 Amin（2009：273）说，在外围，“经济必须不断调整以适应核心经济体的需求”。因此，在核心，“国家……满足了实现自我为中心积累的条件，并使外国关系依赖于该积累的逻辑”，相比之下， 外围国家……不能控制本地积累。因此，它客观上是一个工具，用于将本地社会调整到全球化积累的要求，这些要求由中心的需求所决定。 Amin表示，这种差异解释了为什么中心国家是强国家而外围国家是弱国家。但是，鉴于外围缺乏与自我为中心生产相关的经济动力，问题在于为什么？我们需要转向外围地区资本主义的本质，即阶级关系，并探讨帝国主义作为一种阶级关系形式对外围国家的影响。 2 由“落后”资本主义主导的外围社会形态 无论是在全球外围还是在经济上更为发达的世界，如果一个社会的特点是商品生产、生产资料作为资本对抗劳动、一群名义上自由的劳动者因为不拥有足够的生产资料而被迫为工资工作，以及价值法则（基于社会必要劳动时间的竞争法则）的运作，那么这个社会就是资本主义的。当这些条件存在时，至少在FSL的意义上，资本主义关系就存在了。在FSL中，大量工人被雇佣工作很长时间，处理大量原材料，使用有限或很少的劳动削减技术变革。世界上几乎没有哪个地方不是至少在这个意义上被资本主义所主导的。虽然FSL是基于绝对剩余价值的占有，RSL则是基于相对剩余价值的占有。RSL具有FSL的所有特点，并有一个额外属性——即系统向技术变革的倾向。然后还有混合征服，这是后封建主义的，不涉及工资劳动；它涉及商人和放债者对直接生产者的剥削（见Das，2017a：340-390对资本对劳动的征服的详细讨论）。 马克思在《资本论》第一卷附录中说：FSL“直接是他人劳动剥削的过程……。这是任何资本主义生产过程的普遍形式”（即在资本主义社会关系统治下的生产过程）（Marx，1977b：1019）。作为资本主义生产的更普遍形式，它“可以在没有特定资本主义生产方式的情况下被发现”，对马克思来说这是RSL（同上）。两种征服形式在资本主义的一般条件意义上是相似的。但辩证法也看到了一个区别。 与马克思（有时）可能相信的相反，转向RSL并不是自动的，即使存在向RSL的长期趋势，与固定资本与可变资本比率的上升相关联（Das，2017a）。对我来说，从FSL向RSL的过渡取决于基本阶级之间的权力平衡，这在工人反抗长时间（和低工资）工作制度的斗争中得到了体现。阶级斗争（潜在或实际）条件了资本家之间通过（a）使用旨在提高劳动生产率的技术或（b）例如FSL来降低生产成本的程度。而某些客观条件可以促进或限制阶级斗争，相应地，向RSL的过渡可以是更快的，也可以是一个漫长的过程，并在地理上不均衡。 先进的资本主义特征是成功向RSL的过渡和由此产生的经济活力。这种转换在一定程度上是因为两个因素，例如殖民地转移，以及阶级斗争反对资本家使用长时间和低工资的劳动力。然而，在外围的大部分地区（尤其是在其广阔的农村地区和小城镇），情况有些不同。存在资本主义关系的必要条件。在一些地区，产权所有者可能在形式上征用劳动（例如，资本家使用高度脆弱和低成本的劳动力，包括在资本主义再生产之外再生产的劳动力，如在土著社区中）。在其他地区，尤其是在一些大城市和它们附近的村庄中，确实存在真正的征服。国家与RSL的局部存在和向它的过渡的障碍都有联系。 让我们从RSL的局部存在开始。落后国家可以从已经先进的国家采用技术，这意味着 “历史上落后国家的发展必然导致不同历史阶段的特殊结合”，从而导致联合发展“我们的意思是不同阶段的集合，分步骤的结合，古老形式与更现代形式的融合。” （Trotsky，2008：4-5） 通过借用在先进国家已经发展的技术，一个外围国家可以跳过发展过程中的某些阶段，从而产生联合发展： “落后国家的发展的特点是其联合性质。换句话说，帝国主义技术、经济和政治的最新成果在这些国家与传统的落后性和原始性相结合。” （Trotsky，1940） 这意味着在一个不发达国家，技术落后的“农民土地耕作”可以与一个在技术和资本主义结构上“处于先进国家水平”的工业共存，并且在某些方面甚至可以超过先进国家的工业（同上：8）。 外围资本主义国家可以负责真正的征服，无论是与帝国主义合作还是独立于帝国主义。部分受到群众对低生活标准的斗争的推动，部分受到地缘政治竞争的推动（有时叠加有民族主义的沙文主义和宗教色彩），并且在某些情况下，为了保护自己的资本免受帝国主义竞争（价值法则）的影响，外围的资本主义国家可以提供各种形式的帮助给国家资本引进现代技术和提高劳动生产率。这一过程可能标志着从形式征服向真正征服的某种转变。"},{"instruction":"请将“To the extent that technological change in the periphery will create a market for products for the domestic (and foreign) companies and/or will increase relative surplus value, a part of which will be shared by imperialist countries, imperialism may not be inimical to technological change in the periphery. So a fundamental role of the peripheral state can be to mediate technological transfer from imperialist to imperialized countries: [O]fficials of the states with a subordinate position in the imperial state system will insist on the transfer of technological, management and marketing knowhow to strengthen the ability of their capitalists to compete and for them to make profit, extract rents and serve their ‘national interest.’ (Veltmeyer and Petras, 2015: 168) There are limits to technical change in the periphery, however. This is partly because of its insertion into the imperialist world market and because of its relatively low level of cultural development (e.g. low level of education) (Trotsky, 2008: 4—5). As we have seen, for Trotsky, it is not just that capitalist development is uneven but also that capitalist relations are combined with pre-capitalist relations (e.g. serfdom). This is an advance over the perspective that focuses only on the unevenness of capitalist development (Harvey, 2008b/1982; Smith, 2008). Trotsky’s perspective, however, has a problem: it homogenizes the capitalist class relation; it treats the different forms (and stages) of capitalism — subsumptions of labour — as one. It thus abstracts from the ways in which the balance of power between the basic classes intervenes in the transition from one form of capitalist class relation (FSL) to another form (RSL). Thus it abstracts from the obstacles to the transition within capitalism. In peripheral countries, it is not just that capitalism is combined with pre-capitalist relations existing in specific areas. The matter is more complex than that. FSL can be a prolonged process when/where there is a massive army of un- and under-employed men and women whom the state does not have adequate support for nor does it do much to diminish the size of the reserve army. It is worth quoting Marx (from Capital 3) again: the reserve army or the relative over-population is the reason why, on the one hand, the more or less imperfect subordination of labour [read: FSL] to capital continues in many branches of production, and continues longer than seems at first glance compatible with the general stage of development. This is due to the cheapness and abundance of disposable or unemployed wage-labourers, and to the greater resistance, which some branches of production, by their very nature, render to the transformation of manual work into machine production. (Marx, 1894: 167; italics added) This situation, I argue, holds specifically in the periphery, even though Marx did not think about this. In peripheral capitalism, there is a vast industrial reserve army of labour which owes its origin to colonialism and colonial state and is expanding under ‘new imperialism’ through, for example, primitive accumulation. During classical imperialism (colonialism), as widely known (Bagchi, 1976), a vast reserve army was created through deindustrialization caused by: coercive methods, including tariff on imports from colonies; cheaper machine-made exports to colonized countries; and primitive accumulation (dis-possession of small property owners, including peasants). In some parts of the ex-colonized world, the state actually took steps to break up the communal-type property into private property in order to stop ideas about communal (communist) property from taking root, and Marx commented on this (Anderson, 2010: 219—20). And, under current, ‘new imperialism’,9 primitive accumulation is also happening on a big scale, thanks to the extra- economic (state-enabled) dispossession: this has been expanding the reserve army.10 The reserve army is also expanding because of cheap exports from imperialist countries and lack of financial support from peripheral capitalist states for their relatively weak, small-scale property owners against international competition. The massive and expanding reserve army of labour (never fully captured by official statistics) provides capital an ample opportunity for FSL, including of those who are oppressed on the basis of gender, race, ethnicity, age, caste, and the like. On the other hand, the reserve army adversely affects the bargaining power of employed labour and makes struggle against formal subsumption rather difficult. Many peripheral countries specialize in relatively low-skilled activities such as farming, mining and production of light industrial goods, as mentioned in the last section. These are potentially the ‘branches of production’, which ‘by their very nature, can render relative resistance ‘to the transformation of manual work into machine production’ (Marx, 1894: 167). The sporadic introduction of advanced techniques could strengthen not only the use of serfdom and other forms of extra-economic relations (as Trotsky says), but also relations of FSL that he fails to recognize. To enhance their competitiveness and to appropriate more surplus value, enterprises using advanced technology themselves and/or the small-scale firms they outsource some of their production to can — and do — resort to a regime of long hours (and low wages), just as they can and do use unfree labour. Besides, the peripheral state lacks the resources needed for systemic technological change. One reason for this, apart from colonialism-induced under-development, is the ongoing imperialistic transfer of resources in the form of debt payment, repatriation of profit, and so on from the periphery (Roberts, 2019). The peripheral capitalist state also lacks the resources because it is not allowed by imperialist institutions, which are obsessed with marketization and privatization, to use the resources where they may exist. As a result, it fails to develop the productive forces through technological change to any significant extent and on a nation-wide scale. It also fails to adequately augment the social wage through pro-labour policies in a way in which such policies can substantially increase the power of labour vis-à-vis private employers and enable them to demand a regime of higher wages. Such a regime, within limits, would contribute to an articulation between production and consumption. But the peripheral state fails to secure such a regime. The system of capitalist class relation in the periphery then is marked by three main forms and logics of accumulation: accumulation by dispossession of direct producers (i.e. ongoing primitive accumulation); accumulation by exploitation of workers (proletarians and semi-proletarians), with its two moments of formal and real subsumption; and accumulation by class differentiation (Figure 11.1). These three forms of accumulation coexist with the (remnants of) pre-capitalist class relations and with class relations of hybrid subsumption. And then all these social relations of production are shaped by imperialism (see the next section). These different relations may exist in different areas within a peripheral country or even inside a given city-region, thus indicating uneven and combined development. Given this complexity of class relations, which impact the peripheral state, the latter has a certain specificity relative to the state in advanced capitalism. An implication of the subsumption perspective is that the development process in the world in general and in peripheral capitalism in particular, with its attendant class relations, must be seen as multiple transitions: from pre-capitalist relations to hybrid subsumption, from pre-capitalist and hybrid relations to FSL under capital, from FSL to RSL, and finally, from the latter to cooperative labour of associated producers, nationally and at a global scale. So the role of the peripheral state must be seen in relation to these transitions. The democratic revolution against pre-capitalist relations has remained aborted or incomplete in the periphery, and this is in part because of capitalists’ and their state’s fear of anti-feudal struggle becoming the struggle against capitalism and the state. Massive concentration of land in the hands of a few and feudal remnants in the sphere of social relations of production as well as cultural and political spheres exist, which are partly behind undemocratic state practices (these issues are elaborated in Section 6). 3 Imperialism retarding development of productive forces in the periphery Imperialism today It is true that the periphery, like the core, is experiencing globalization. But there is a difference: for the periphery, globalization is generally expressed as imperialism. The multiple states system emphasized in the globalization literature is a system where some states are imperialist and other states are imperialized (see Callinicos, 2009). I define imperialism not mainly in terms of the unequal relations in the realm of exchange or in terms of income inequality between rich and poor countries, and so on, nor in terms of the bullying behaviour of rich states, although all these are important. I define imperialism fundamentally as the capitalist class relation at the international scale (i.e. at the level of the world market) supported by the powerful states of advanced countries. Imperialism is the economic exploitation of proletarians and of semi-proletarians (and other small-scale producers) of the peripheral capitalist countries by the monopolistic industrial-financial businesses of advanced countries, whereby the powerful, highly militarized states of advanced capitalist countries subjugate the militarily weak states of peripheral countries to ensure the business interests of the monopolies of advanced countries which are undergoing relative capitalist decay as seen in falling profitability. If the capitalist state, seen from a national angle or in the abstract, secures the general conditions for the capitalist accumulation, then the capitalist state, seen internationally (i.e. from the standpoint of imperialist world market and seen more concretely), secures the general conditions for accumulation of value in the hands of the imperialist businesses.”翻译为中文","output":"在外围地区，技术变革将为国内（和外国）公司创造产品市场和/或增加相对剩余价值，帝国主义国家将分享其中的一部分，因此帝国主义可能不会对外围的技术变革持敌对态度。因此，外围国家的一个基本职能可以是调解技术从帝国主义国家向被帝国主义化国家的转移： “在帝国主义国家体系中处于从属地位的国家的官员们将坚持转移技术、管理和市场营销的知识，以增强他们的资本家竞争的能力并使他们获利、提取租金并服务于他们的‘国家利益’。” （Veltmeyer和Petras，2015：168） 然而，外围的技术变革是有限制的。这部分是因为它融入了帝国主义世界市场，以及由于其相对较低的文化发展水平（例如教育水平低）（托洛茨基，2008：4—5）。正如我们所见，对于托洛茨基来说，不仅资本主义发展是不均衡的，资本主义关系也与前资本主义关系（例如农奴制）相结合。这是对仅关注资本主义发展不均衡性的视角的一种超越（哈维，2008b/1982; 史密斯，2008）。然而，托洛茨基的视角存在一个问题：它将资本主义阶级关系同质化；它将资本主义的不同形式（和阶段）——劳动的征用——视为一体。因此，它抽象地考虑了基本阶级之间的权力平衡如何介入从一种资本主义阶级关系（FSL）向另一种形式（RSL）过渡的问题。因此，它抽象地考虑了资本主义内部过渡的障碍。在外围国家，不只是资本主义与特定区域存在的前资本主义关系相结合。事情比这更复杂。 当/在存在大量未就业和就业不足的男性和女性的大军，且国家没有足够的支持也没有做太多减少这支后备军规模的情况下，FSL可能是一个长期的过程。再次引用马克思（来自《资本论》第三卷）的话是有价值的：相对过剩人口或后备军 是为什么在一方面，在许多生产部门中，劳动对资本的或多或少不完善的从属关系[读作：FSL]继续存在，且持续的时间比乍看之下与总体发展阶段兼容的时间要长。这是由于可用或失业的工资劳动者的廉价和丰富，以及一些生产部门由于其本质对手工劳动向机械生产的转换提供了较大的抵制。 （马克思，1894：167；斜体增加）这种情况，我认为，特别适用于外围，即使马克思没有考虑到这一点。在外围资本主义中，存在着一个庞大的工业后备劳动力大军，其起源于殖民主义和殖民状态，并在“新帝国主义”下通过例如原始积累而扩大。在经典帝国主义（殖民主义）期间，众所周知（Bagchi，1976），通过去工业化创造了一个庞大的后备军，这是由于：强制手段，包括对殖民地进口征收关税；向被殖民国家出口更便宜的机器制造产品；以及原始积累（剥夺小产权所有者，包括农民）。在一些前殖民地世界的部分地区，国家实际上采取了措施将公社型产权分割为私有财产，以阻止关于公社（共产主义）财产的想法扎根，马克思对此发表了评论（Anderson，2010：219—20）。而在当前的“新帝国主义”下，也在大规模发生原始积累，这得益于额外的经济（国家启用的）剥夺：这一剥夺正在扩大后备军。后备军也因来自帝国主义国家的廉价出口和外围资本主义国家对其相对弱小的小规模产权所有者对抗国际竞争的财政支持不足而扩大。 庞大且不断扩大的劳动力后备军（官方统计从未完全捕捉到）为资本提供了充分的机会进行FSL，包括那些基于性别、种族、族裔、年龄、种姓等被压迫的人们。另一方面，后备军不利地影响了受雇劳动力的议价能力，使得反对形式征用的斗争相当困难。许多外围国家专门从事相对低技能的活动，如农业、采矿和轻工业品生产，如上一节所述。这些可能是“生产部门”，“从它们的本质来看，可以提供相对抵制‘手工劳动向机械生产的转化’”（马克思，1894：167）。 先进技术的零星引入不仅可能加强农奴制和其他形式的超经济关系的使用（正如托洛茨基所说），而且还有他未能认识到的FSL关系。为了提高竞争力和占有更多的剩余价值，使用先进技术的企业本身和/或他们将部分生产外包给的小规模公司可能会——而且确实会——采用长时间（和低工资）的制度，就像他们可以并且确实使用非自由劳动一样。此外，外围国家缺乏进行系统性技术变革所需的资源。除了殖民主义引起的发展不足之外，一个原因是持续的帝国主义式资源转移，比如债务支付、利润汇回等从外围（罗伯茨，2019）。外围资本主义国家还因为不被帝国主义机构所允许，后者痴迷于市场化和私有化，无法使用可能存在的资源，因此缺乏资源。结果，它未能通过技术变革在任何重大程度上和全国范围内发展生产力。它也未能通过亲劳动政策充分增加社会工资，以这样一种方式来实质性提高劳动力与私人雇主的力量，并使他们能够要求更高工资的制度。这样的制度，在一定限度内，将有助于生产和消费之间的联系。但是，外围国家未能确保这样的制度。 因此，外围的资本主义阶级关系体系以三种主要形式和积累逻辑为特征：通过对直接生产者（即持续的原始积累）的剥夺进行积累；通过对工人（无产者和半无产者）的剥削进行积累，其包括形式征用和真实征用的两个时刻；以及通过阶级分化进行积累（图11.1）。这三种积累形式与（前资本主义阶级关系的）残余以及混合征用的阶级关系共存。然后，所有这些生产社会关系受到帝国主义的影响（见下一节）。这些不同的关系可能存在于一个外围国家的不同地区，甚至在一个特定的城市区域内，从而表明不均衡和联合发展。鉴于这种复杂的阶级关系影响外围国家，后者相对于先进资本主义中的国家有其特定性。 征用视角的一个含义是，世界总体上和外围资本主义特别是其随附的阶级关系的发展过程，必须被视为多重转型：从前资本主义关系到混合征用，从前资本主义和混合关系到资本下的FSL，从FSL到RSL，最后，从后者到全国和全球范围内的联合生产者的合作劳动。因此，必须根据这些转型来看待外围国家的角色。反对前资本主义关系的民主革命在外围一直被中断或不完整，部分原因是因为资本家及其国家担心反封建斗争变成反对资本主义和国家的斗争。土地在少数人手中的大量集中和社会生产关系以及文化和政治领域的封建残余存在，这在一定程度上是不民主国家实践背后的原因（这些问题在第6节中有详细阐述）。 3 帝国主义在外围阻碍生产力的发展 今日的帝国主义 确实，像核心一样，外围也正在经历全球化。但有一个区别：对于外围来说，全球化通常表现为帝国主义。全球化文献强调的多国家体系是一个某些国家是帝国主义国家而其他国家是被帝国主义化的国家的系统（见Callinicos，2009）。我不主要以交换领域的不平等关系或富国和穷国之间的收入不平等等来定义帝国主义，也不是以富国的欺凌行为来定义，尽管这些都很重要。我根本上将帝国主义定义为国际规模上的资本主义阶级关系（即世界市场层面）由先进国家的强大国家支持。帝国主义是先进国家的垄断工业金融企业对外围资本主义国家的无产者和半无产者（及其他小规模生产者）的经济剥削，其中先进资本主义国家的强大、高度军事化的国家将军事上较弱的外围国家置于从属地位，以确保先进国家的垄断企业的商业利益，这些企业正在经历相对资本主义衰退，如利润率下降所见。如果从国家角度或抽象地看资本主义国家保障了资本主义积累的一般条件，那么从国际上看（即从帝国主义世界市场的立场和更具体地看）资本主义国家保障了价值在帝国主义企业手中积累的一般条件。"},{"instruction":"请将“The imperialist state partly functions as the executive committee for different fractions of imperialist capital operating in the periphery. More accurately, the imperialist state, the state of imperialist countries, along with the various international state-like institutions it controls, is the executive committee for managing the common affairs of the different fractions of imperialist capital that are involved in accumulation within the periphery (and the core countries). The state in the periphery is, more or less, the junior partner of the imperialist state. The state is a fundamental aspect of the imperialist relation (it is surprising that Lenin’s (1916) Imperialism hardly mentions the state). Operating globally, the state of advanced countries turns imperialist in order to help its big business. To remain globally competitive and increase its rate of profit, imperialist capital makes use of political-military and diplomatic control over natural resources, markets for its goods and services, and over labour11 of different LDCs which have militarily and economically weaker states. Imperialist capital also makes use of non-military processes such as ideas and practice of cooperation and assistance. So peripheral societies become the battle ground for inter-imperialist rivalry, which can become bloody from time to time. Sometimes even if a peripheral country has nothing to offer (in terms of resources or markets), its location itself could be attractive to imperialism: Once the race of imperial territory began in earnest during the closing decades of the nineteenth century, it became necessary for strategic reasons to seize territories that were often of no value in themselves — indeed, that were often net recipients of state expenditure — but that were necessary in order to protect those territories that were of economic value. (Davidson, 2016: 226) Imperialist mechanisms and the peripheral state Imperialism, as imperialist-state-enabled world-scale accumulation, is driven by specific mechanisms. These have implications for the peripheral state. Protection of the capitalist rules of the game: In the global periphery, there is massive poverty which causes seething (molecular) anger against capitalism and imperialism. There can be a danger of the peripheral state weakening capitalist rules of the game. So the imperialist state has to guard the guardians (i.e. peripheral states) in reinforcing/defending the capitalist rules of the game globally and if necessary by creating conflicts among peripheral states and weakening any potential ‘solidarity’ among them.12 Indeed, as Wood (2005) has stressed, imperialist power must be exercised to make sure that states and peoples in the periphery, more or less, adhere to the rules of the capitalist market. This implies, among other things, that the ability of the peripheral state to control the market (or value) relations is limited because of imperialism. Even state-mediated redistribution of small amount of land to the poor is sanctioned by imperialist institutions on the ground that it is an infringement of private property, as happened in Zimbabwe.13 Response to capitalist decay in advanced capitalism: There is relative stagnation in imperialist countries with falling profitability (long-term fall in the rate of profit). The relative stagnation is seen in the fall in the growth of investment, including in research and development, in the fall in the rate of growth, and so on. Imperialism is fundamentally a manifestation of the decay of capitalism in the advanced countries and not necessarily because of wrong government policies of an advanced country (Lenin, 1916). On behalf of globally operating imperialist businesses, imperialist states seek to use the periphery to alleviate the effects of declining profitability and capitalist decay. They do this in many ways. Unequal trade: One is that the imperialist states compete with each other to make sure their own monopolies are able to use politically mediated access to the markets and resources of the periphery. Imperialism is about interimperialist rivalry, even if it is not always manifested: The drive to neutralise the breakdown tendency through increased valori-sation takes place at the cost of other capitalist states. The accumulation of capital produces an ever more destructive struggle among capitalist states. (Grossman, 1929) In response to the attempt of imperialist states to defend the competitive position of their big business, the peripheral countries may wish to protect their own economies. As Grossman (1929) says, ‘accumulation intensifies the drift to protectionism in the economically backward countries’. In this situation, the peripheral state will bear the consequences from the imperialist countries. Military intervention by imperialist states is one. Another is economic warfare: ‘the cheap prices of commodities are the heavy artillery with which’ an advanced country ‘batters down all Chinese walls’. With this mechanism, imperialist countries force the less developed countries’ ‘intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate’ (Marx and Engels, 1848: 16). While the state sustains commodity relations in various ways, it can enforce unequal exchange on behalf of the capitalist class operating under its own jurisdiction, where necessary. Imperialist states enforce unequal exchange in the world market. Colonialism/imperialism is an expression of this tendency. Unequal exchange happens in another way too. Given that c / v is higher in advanced countries than in poorer countries, the states of advanced countries and state-like institutions globally, by sustaining world trade, are actually complicit in the transfer of surplus in the form of ‘the tribute levied by finance capital’ and ‘high monopoly profits for a handful of very rich countries’ (Lenin, 1916) — from poor to rich countries. Here is Marx (1863): Profit can also be made by cheating, one person gaining what the other loses. Loss and gain within a single country cancel each other out. But not so with trade between different countries [peripheral countries, unlike core countries, depend more on unskilled labour]. . . . Here the law of value undergoes essential modification. . . . The relationship between labour days of different countries may be similar to that existing between skilled, complex labour and unskilled simple labour within a country.14 In this case, the richer country exploits the poorer one.15 ‘At advanced stages of accumulation’, as the rate of profit (and eventually, its mass) drops, ‘it becomes more and more difficult to valorise the enormously accumulated capital’, and, therefore, transfers of surplus value through trade ‘become a matter of life and death for capitalism. This explains the virulence of imperialist expansion in the late stage of capital accumulation’ (Grossman, 1929). An important unequal exchange is trade in agri-goods and natural resources. In the international division of labour, imperialist countries depend on raw materials produced in the periphery, and these must be produced and imported at extremely low prices, and this process in turn checks inflation in the imperialist countries (Patnaik and Patnaik, 2016). More specifically, certain use-values happen to be concentrated in what are peripheral countries. These use-values include crops produced in warmer climates (and these climate happen to be un-available in imperialist countries), oil, and minerals, including those needed for what is misnamed as a post-industrial economy (e.g. lithium needed for cell phones). To these use-values the big businesses of the North must have access at any cost, and this involves imperialist control over LDCs. This has an implication for the state: it is important that the capitalist state and a leading state maintain control over supplies of such scarce materials. To the extent that these tend be in LDCs, role of imperialism is crucial. A new round of primitive accumulation: An important strategy used by imperialist capital to respond to falling profitability is investing capital not in production but in a new round of primitive accumulation. A lot of capital goes to the periphery to buy up assets, including of small-scale producers and state- owned companies, and if necessary by using its own force and the force of its junior partner (peripheral state) (Harvey, 2005). By forcing the peripheral states to open up their economies, imperialist capital also buys up assets of peripheral business owners, thus symbolizing a new round of centralization of capital at the international scale. Cheap production: Apart from exploiting the periphery through unequal trade with advanced countries and a new round of primitive accumulation, imperialist capital makes use of cheap labour in the periphery. A massive reserve army allows FSL and production at a cheap cost. Marx (1894) himself says that when capital is invested in the less developed world, the rate of profit is higher there due to backward development, and likewise, because of the use of unfree labour such as ‘slaves, coolies, etc.’ Imperialist capital makes use of peripheral labour in at least two ways: export of productive capital to the periphery which results in production of goods and services by MNCs, including through joint ventures; and the production of commodities in the periphery through outsourcing. Outsourcing is a more recent mechanism than capital export. As John Smith (2016) shows, production through outsourcing ensures that a very small part of the sale price of the commodities remains in the periphery with the major part going to the hands of imperialist businesses involved in various parts of the commodity chain including shipping, sale, advertisement, insurance, finance, design, and so on. Whether through direct investment by imperialist businesses in the periphery or through outsourcing, imperialism involves the exploitation of labour of the periphery by imperialist capital. The peripheral state must support this. Imperialism is the objective condition under which the peripheral state, more or less, must work and reproduce the peripheral social formation not only as capitalist but also as imperialized. In fact, if any state in the periphery ever seeks to promote economic development, whether on the basis of capitalism or non-capitalist relations or some combination of the two (e.g. China), by regulating the global law of value in its national interest, and if significantly hurts the interests of imperialist economy or politics, then imperialist state knows how to discipline the peripheral state, including through lies and deception as well as coercion (military intervention aimed at regime change), and accusation that given peripheral countries go against the fundamental principles of democracy, free market, freedom, world peace, and so on.”翻译为中文","output":"帝国主义国家部分充当在外围运作的各分支帝国主义资本的执行委员会。更准确地说，帝国主义国家，即帝国主义国家的政府，连同其控制的各种国际类国家机构，是为管理在外围（和核心国家）进行积累的各分支帝国主义资本的共同事务的执行委员会。外围的国家或多或少是帝国主义国家的初级合伙人。国家是帝国主义关系的一个基本方面（令人惊讶的是，列宁（1916年）的《帝国主义》几乎没有提到国家）。 在全球范围内运作的先进国家的国家变得帝国主义化，以帮助其大企业。为了保持全球竞争力和提高其利润率，帝国主义资本利用对自然资源、商品和服务市场以及不同最不发达国家（LDCs）的劳动力的政治-军事和外交控制，这些国家在军事和经济上都较为弱小。帝国主义资本还利用非军事过程，如合作和援助的理念和实践。因此，外围社会成为帝国主义间竞争的战场，这种竞争有时可能变得血腥。有时，即使一个外围国家没有什么可提供的（就资源或市场而言），其地理位置本身就可能对帝国主义具有吸引力： 一旦19世纪末帝国主义领土竞赛正式开始时，出于战略原因征服经常本身没有价值的领土就变得必要——实际上，这些领土经常是国家支出的净接受者——但为了保护那些具有经济价值的领土而变得必要。 （Davidson，2016：226） 帝国主义机制与外围国家 作为帝国主义国家启用的世界规模积累，帝国主义由特定机制驱动。这些对外围国家有着含义。 保护资本主义游戏规则：在全球外围，存在大量贫困，这引起了对资本主义和帝国主义的强烈（分子级）愤怒。外围国家削弱资本主义规则的风险可能存在。因此，帝国主义国家必须保护守护者（即外围国家）在全球范围内加强/捍卫资本主义规则，并在必要时通过在外围国家之间制造冲突和削弱它们之间可能的“团结”来实现。实际上，正如伍德（2005）强调的，必须行使帝国主义权力以确保外围的国家和人民或多或少地遵守资本主义市场的规则。这意味着，由于帝国主义，外围国家控制市场（或价值）关系的能力受到限制。即使是由帝国主义机构批准的对穷人进行小规模土地再分配也因为它侵犯了私有财产而受到制裁，就像在津巴布韦发生的那样。 对先进资本主义中的资本主义衰退的回应：帝国主义国家存在相对停滞，其利润率下降（长期利润率下降）。相对停滞体现在投资增长下降，包括研发投资减少，增长率下降等。帝国主义根本上是先进国家资本主义衰败的表现，这并不一定是因为先进国家错误的政府政策（列宁，1916）。代表全球运营的帝国主义企业，帝国主义国家寻求利用外围来缓解利润下降和资本主义衰败的影响。他们通过许多方式做到这一点。 不平等贸易：帝国主义国家互相竞争，确保自己的垄断企业能够通过政治斡旋获得对外围市场和资源的使用权。帝国主义是关于帝国主义间的竞争，即使它并不总是表现出来： 通过增加价值实现以避免崩溃倾向，是以牺牲其他资本主义国家为代价发生的。资本的积累产生了资本主义国家之间日益破坏性的斗争。 （格罗斯曼，1929） 为了回应帝国主义国家保卫其大企业竞争地位的努力，外围国家可能希望保护自己的经济。正如格罗斯曼（1929）所说，“积累加剧了经济落后国家保护主义的倾向”。在这种情况下，外围国家将承受来自帝国主义国家的后果。军事干预是其中之一。另一个是经济战：“商品的廉价是‘先进国家用以破除一切中国墙的重炮’。通过这种机制，帝国主义国家迫使不发达国家的‘对外国人的极度顽固的仇恨屈服’”（马克思和恩格斯，1848：16）。 虽然国家以各种方式维持商品关系，但如有必要，它可以代表在其管辖下运营的资本主义阶级，强制执行不平等交换。帝国主义国家在世界市场上强制执行不平等交换。殖民主义/帝国主义是这种趋势的表达。不平等交换还以另一种方式发生。鉴于先进国家的c / v高于较贫穷国家，先进国家的国家和全球性的国家类机构，通过维持世界贸易，实际上是共同参与了以“金融资本征税”和“为少数非常富裕的国家带来高垄断利润”的形式从穷国向富国转移剩余价值。以下是马克思（1863）的说法： 通过欺骗也可以赚取利润，一个人获得的是另一个人的损失。在一个国家内的损失和收益相互抵消。但不同国家之间的贸易不是这样[与核心国家不同，外围国家更多依赖于非熟练劳动]。……这里的价值法则发生了本质的修改。……不同国家间的劳动日的关系，可能类似于一个国家内熟练的、复杂的劳动与非熟练的简单劳动之间的关系。在这种情况下，较富裕的国家剥削了较贫穷的国家。‘在积累的高级阶段’，随着利润率（最终，其总量）的下降，‘为了实现巨额积累的资本变得越来越困难’，因此，通过贸易转移剩余价值‘对资本主义成为生死攸关的问题。这解释了资本积累后期帝国主义扩张的恶性’（格罗斯曼，1929）。 一个重要的不平等交换是农产品和自然资源的贸易。在国际分工中，帝国主义国家依赖于外围生产的原材料，这些原材料必须以极低的价格生产和进口，这一过程反过来又抑制了帝国主义国家的通货膨胀（帕特纳克和帕特纳克，2016）。更具体地说，某些使用价值恰好集中在现在所谓的外围国家。这些使用价值包括在较温暖的气候下生产的农作物（这些气候在帝国主义国家不可得），石油和矿产，包括被错误称为后工业经济所需的（例如手机所需的锂）。北方的大企业必须不惜一切代价获得这些使用价值的使用权，这涉及到对最不发达国家的帝国主义控制。这对国家有一定的含义：重要的是资本主义国家和领先的国家维持对这些稀缺材料的供应控制。鉴于这些往往存在于最不发达国家中，帝国主义的作用至关重要。 新一轮原始积累：帝国主义资本回应利润下降的一个重要策略是投资资本不是在生产中而是在新一轮的原始积累中。大量资本流向外围购买资产，包括小规模生产者和国有公司的资产，必要时使用自己的力量和初级合作伙伴（外围国家）的力量（哈维，2005）。通过迫使外围国家开放经济，帝国主义资本还购买了外围业主的资产，从而象征着国际规模上资本集中的新一轮。 廉价生产：除了通过与先进国家的不平等贸易和新一轮原始积累对外围进行剥削外，帝国主义资本还利用外围的廉价劳动力。庞大的后备军队允许FSL和廉价成本的生产。马克思（1894）本人说，当资本投资于不太发达的世界时，由于落后的发展，利润率在那里更高，同样，由于使用不自由劳动力，如“奴隶、苦力等”。帝国主义资本至少以两种方式利用外围劳动力：向外围出口生产资本导致跨国公司生产商品和服务，包括通过合资企业；以及通过外包在外围生产商品。外包是比资本出口更近期的机制。正如约翰·史密斯（2016）所示，通过外包生产确保商品销售价格的很小一部分留在外围，大部分进入参与商品链各个环节的帝国主义企业手中，包括运输、销售、广告、保险、金融、设计等。无论是通过在外围直接投资的帝国主义企业还是通过外包，帝国主义都涉及帝国主义资本对外围劳动力的剥削。外围国家必须支持这一点。 帝国主义是外围国家必须在其中工作并再生产不仅作为资本主义而且作为被帝国主义化的外围社会形态的客观条件。实际上，如果外围的任何国家曾试图促进经济发展，无论是基于资本主义还是非资本主义关系或两者的某种组合（例如中国），通过调节全球价值法则以维护其国家利益，并且如果这显著伤害帝国主义经济或政治的利益，那么帝国主义国家就知道如何约束外围国家，包括通过谎言和欺骗以及胁迫（旨在政权更迭的军事干预），以及指控给定的外围国家违反了民主、自由市场、自由、世界和平等基本原则。"},{"instruction":"请将“4 Class basis of the peripheral state, and peripheral state functions and form Broadly speaking, there are two main proprietary classes which hold state power in the periphery. One is the urban bourgeoisie, especially the larger- scale owners of capital operating nationally and increasingly engaged in international operations in part through collaboration with imperialist capital. The other major class is the class of large-scale landholders based in villages and small towns.16 In this class alliance or power bloc, urban capitalists are not merely dominant but also increasingly so.17 They demand state policies, including under both dirigisme and neoliberalism. It is the fundamental role of the state in the periphery, as it is in the core, to serve the capitalist class.18 During the initial decades of post-independence dirigisme, such a favourable relationship was often supported by not only the ideology of anti-imperialism but also the ideology of socialism (or socialistic patterns of society). The official names or constitutions of some states include the word ‘socialism’ or ‘socialistic’. These ideologies did inform state practice to some extent as revealed in state regulation of businesses and state protection of domestic business vis-à-vis imperialist businesses until recently. The bureaucrats and politicians running the affairs of the state made use of capitalists’ expertise, and the like. Capitalists joined various committees of the state. Capitalists made use of the state. Nothing major has been done to undermine capitalist private property as such. The state firmly protects capitalist property rights, not private property rights as such (consider the rights of small-scale producers, including the peasantry, that are being crushed by the state). This is necessary for the capitalist class to enlarge its property-base at the expense of self-exploiting small-scale property owners. To the extent that some nationalization has happened, it has had little to do with socialism. Trotsky’s comments on nationalization in Mexico in the early decades of the 20th century have much contemporary relevance: The nationalization of railways and oil fields in Mexico has of course nothing in common with socialism. It is a measure of state capitalism in a backward country which in this way seeks to defend itself on the one hand against foreign imperialism and on the other against its own proletariat. (Trotsky, 1940) The peripheral state has not only defended capitalist property rights and com-modity relations. It has also protected and promoted capitalist profit-making in various ways. Domestic markets have been automatically protected from com-petition with imperialist capital (although increasingly less so), and state-owned industries have provided cheap capital goods and means of transportation, and state-owned banks continue to heap cheap money or indeed free money (loans given are pardoned) on private businesses. Concentration and centralization of capital have continued. The state has often provided subsidies to the emerging capitalist class or a group of capitalists in trouble, so it has the minimum sum necessary for investment. The state gives contracts to the private sector, helping it resolve its realization crisis. The strategy of locating industries in ‘backward’ areas (growth poles) in order to promote rural and/or regional development has been crucial: such an initiative has required the state to subsidize private businesses. Private sector companies (as well as public sector companies which have helped the former to grow) have benefited enormously from the huge reserve army of labour in rural and semi-rural areas, which has been kept alive at near-subsistence level through various ‘development policies’. Recently, the neoliberal method of primitive accumulation aided by the state has deposited an enormous quantity of exchange values in capitalist hands. This method includes the sale of public sector companies and privatization of government services (e.g. provisioning of water, education, healthcare, and the like) as well as the take-over of the land/assets of indigenous peoples and other small-scale producers by the urban capitalists at below-market prices.19 Indeed, in the process, those members of the capitalist class who have enjoyed close relations with influential politicians and bureaucrats have benefited hugely by, for example, receiving state contracts. Such relations are the source of massive corruption and plundering of state resources, a form of primitive accumulation. In some parts of the periphery, the state has taken on the form of the devel-opmental state, which is obsessed with capitalist economic development. Such a state has to even discipline and coerce specific members of the capitalist class.20 It typically keeps the workers in check. In the vast majority of cases, however, the state has not played such a developmental role. What Ron Herring (1999) calls ‘embedded particularism’ (state’s links to specific capitalists) has been partly responsible for what he calls ‘failed developmental state’. In addition, the world-market conditions favourable for exports, and the worldgeopolitical conditions (American state’s need to fight the communism threat in East Asia) that facilitated the emergence of developmental state with massive American support in that region, do not exist everywhere and always. During more recent times, the peripheral state blatantly supports capital, and financial capital, over the interests of common people. About Brazil, Daniel Bin (2014) says that in the mid-1990s, the Brazilian state began removing state resources (tax money) earmarked from education and social security to essentially use them for servicing the public debt to the benefit of finance capital. This practical earmarking for finance was not guaranteed by the Constitution, as it had previously been earmarked for social security or education. This policy was a decision that clearly revealed the class character of the Brazilian state. It would prove to be the first step in granting an important advantage to the finance sector in the class struggle over surplus value transitionally appropriated by the state. In large peripheral countries, a major component of the power bloc — class basis of the state — is foreign capital, including especially imperialist capital. The imperialist capital has had a relation of collaboration and conflict with ‘national’ sections of the capitalist class of the periphery. Its influence on the peripheral state, of course, varies geographically across the periphery: it is, traditionally, more in some countries (South America) than in other regions. Foreign capital possesses power based on its economic presence in a poor country: the simple fact of the periphery’s economic dependence limits the possible economic and political actions of the nationally operating bourgeoisie (Ougaard, 1982: 401). The power of foreign capital that it actually exercises depends on the political activities of individual enterprises, including on the basis of their organizations operating in the periphery (ibid.). In addition, the exercise of the power of foreign capital in the periphery is based on the relations between the centrestate and the peripheral state and is enormously helped by such international agencies as the World bank, IMF, aid agencies of the advanced capitalist states, foreign embassies, western think-tanks, and so on, which force policy changes such as the expansion of commodification and privatization of state-owned companies (ibid.).21 The rural landholding families constitute another part of the power bloc or the class alliance that controls state power, and once again, its importance, like that of imperialist capital, is more in some countries than in others (see Das, 2020b: 233—81). The big latifundia owner of Latin America are much more powerful than an average large-scale landowner in the Indian Punjab or SE Asia. The large-scale land-owners are involved in the appropriation of capitalist profit: mainly from farming, but also from non-farming activities located in villages and small towns. Some of these rural landowners appropriate ground rent, as well as mercantile profit and usurious interest from poor rural labour and peasants. This process is enabled by the peripheral state: it considers it legitimate for the property-owners to extract extremely high rents, whether in cash or in labour or in kind (e.g. crop-share), and charge usurious interest rates on loans taken by small-scale producers and labourers in villages or even rural parts of the city-regions. To some degree, the specifically capitalist elements of this class emerged in part due to what was predominantly a bourgeois land reform that, to some extent, removed some erstwhile pre-capitalist fetters (De Janvry, 1981; Djurfeldt and Sircar, 2017). Pre-capitalist cultural traits can coexist with capitalist values in the areas of influence of large landowners, and impact statesociety relations. The capitalist class in rural areas has also benefited from the policy of exemption of taxation on agricultural incomes in some countries and from the state-enabled, regionally confined (and not nation-wide) introduction of technical changes which have included the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution was promoted by the state policy of providing cheap inputs and price support.22 The rural propertied class still exercises substantial political power, through which it protects both its accumulation strategies and the sources of its capital/wealth. Urban capital and the landed elements are inter-connected. An ally of the urban working class, rural masses (including those who have small plots of land) are an enormous potential threat to the propertied class, whether in rural or urban areas. What makes them a potent force is their role in production: if they stop working, there will be no surplus value. Given their potential as a threat to the propertied, it is important that they be prevented from launching any attack on the class character of the state or indeed on the urban capitalist class. The urban bourgeoisie indeed needs the landed to control the rural masses. The landed is therefore regarded as functional to the political interests of the bourgeoisie.”翻译为中文","output":"4 外围国家的阶级基础，外围国家的职能和形态 广义上说，有两个主要的所有者阶级在外围持有国家权力。一个是城市资产阶级，特别是规模较大的资本所有者，他们在国内经营并日益参与国际操作，部分通过与帝国主义资本的合作。另一个主要阶级是以村庄和小镇为基础的大规模土地所有者。在这个阶级联盟或权力集团中，城市资本家不仅占据主导地位，而且越来越是如此。他们要求国家政策，包括在国家指导主义和新自由主义下的政策。在外围和核心地区一样，国家的根本角色是服务于资产阶级。在后独立初几十年的国家指导主义期间，这种有利关系常常不仅得到反帝国主义意识形态的支持，还得到社会主义（或社会主义模式的社会）意识形态的支持。一些国家的官方名称或宪法中包含“社会主义”或“社会主义化”的词汇。这些意识形态在一定程度上影响了国家实践，如在最近对企业的国家监管和对国内企业相对于帝国主义企业的国家保护中所显示的那样。掌管国家事务的官僚和政治家利用了资本家的专业知识等。资本家加入了国家的各种委员会。资本家利用了国家。没有采取重大举措来破坏资本主义私有财产本身。国家坚定保护资本主义财产权，而非私有财产权本身（考虑到正在被国家摧毁的小规模生产者，包括农民的权利）。这对资产阶级扩大其财产基础以牺牲自我剥削的小规模财产所有者而言是必要的。在某种程度上出现了国有化，但这与社会主义几乎无关。托洛茨基对20世纪初墨西哥国有化的评论具有很强的现实相关性： 墨西哥的铁路和油田国有化当然与社会主义无关。这是一个落后国家的国家资本主义措施，通过这种方式试图一方面对抗外国帝国主义，另一方面对抗本国无产阶级。 （托洛茨基，1940） 外围国家不仅捍卫了资本主义财产权和商品关系。它还以各种方式保护和促进了资本主义的盈利。国内市场自动免受帝国主义资本竞争（尽管越来越少），国有工业提供了廉价的资本货物和交通工具，国有银行继续为私营企业提供廉价或确实免费的资金（贷款被免除）。资本的集中和中心化继续进行。国家经常向新兴的资产阶级或陷入困境的资本家集团提供补贴，以便它们具有必要的投资最低金额。国家向私营部门发放合同，帮助其解决实现危机。在“落后”地区（增长极）定位产业的战略对于促进农村和/或地区发展至关重要：这种举措要求国家补贴私营企业。私营公司（以及帮助前者成长的公共部门公司）因农村和半农村地区巨大的劳动力后备军而获益良多，这些劳动力通过各种“发展政策”维持在近乎生存水平。 最近，国家帮助的新自由主义原始积累方法在资本家手中积累了大量的交换价值。这种方法包括出售公共部门公司和私有化政府服务（例如水、教育、医疗保健等）以及以低于市场价格将土地/资产从城市资本家手中夺取原住民和其他小规模生产者的资产。实际上，在这个过程中，与有影响力的政治家和官僚关系密切的资本家阶级的成员通过例如接受国家合同而受益匪浅。这些关系是大规模腐败和掠夺国家资源的来源，是原始积累的一种形式。 在外围的一些地区，国家采取了发展型国家的形式，这种国家痴迷于资本主义经济发展。这样的国家甚至必须约束和强迫资本主义阶级的特定成员。它通常会控制工人。然而，在绝大多数情况下，国家并没有扮演这样的发展角色。罗恩·赫林（Ron Herring，1999）所说的“嵌入式特定主义”（国家与特定资本家的联系）部分地负责了他所称的“失败的发展型国家”。此外，有利于出口的世界市场条件，以及促成东亚地区出现大量美国支持的发展型国家的世界地缘政治条件（美国国家需要在东亚对抗共产主义威胁）并不是在所有地方和所有时候都存在。 在最近的时期，外围国家公然支持资本，尤其是金融资本，而不是普通民众的利益。关于巴西，丹尼尔·宾（Daniel Bin，2014）表示，20世纪90年代中期，巴西国家开始转移原本用于教育和社会保障的国家资源（税收资金），实际上用于为金融资本服务的公共债务。这种为金融而实践的指定用途并不为宪法保障，就像之前被指定用于社会保障或教育一样。这一政策的决定清楚地揭示了巴西国家的阶级特征。这将是向金融部门在国家暂时占有的剩余价值的阶级斗争中提供重要优势的第一步。 在大型外围国家，国家权力集团或阶级基础的一个主要组成部分是外国资本，尤其是帝国主义资本。帝国主义资本与外围的“国家”资本主义阶级的部分存在合作和冲突的关系。它对外围国家的影响当然在地理上跨越外围呈现出变化：传统上，在一些国家（南美）比其他地区更为明显。外国资本基于其在贫穷国家的经济存在而拥有权力：外围的经济依赖限制了在国家层面运作的资产阶级可能的经济和政治行动（Ougaard，1982：401）。外国资本实际上行使的权力取决于个别企业的政治活动，包括基于其在外围运作的组织的基础上（同上）。此外，在外围行使外国资本的权力是基于中心国家和外围国家之间的关系，并且得到了如世界银行、国际货币基金组织、先进资本主义国家的援助机构、外国大使馆、西方智库等国际机构的极大帮助，这些机构强制推动政策变革，如扩大商品化和国有公司的私有化（同上）。 农村土地持有家庭构成了控制国家权力的权力集团或阶级联盟的另一部分，再次，就像帝国主义资本一样，它的重要性在一些国家比其他国家更为明显（见Das，2020b：233—281）。拉丁美洲的大型地主比印度旁遮普或东南亚的平均大规模地主拥有更多的权力。大规模土地所有者涉及资本主义利润的占有：主要来自农业，但也来自位于村庄和小镇的非农业活动。这些农村地主中的一些人占有地租，以及从贫困农村劳动力和农民那里获得的商业利润和高额利息。这一过程得到了外围国家的支持：它认为对产权所有者来说，以现金、劳动或实物（例如作物份额）的形式提取极高的租金，以及向小规模生产者和村里或城市地区的农村部分的劳动者收取高额利息是合法的。 在某种程度上，这个阶级的特别资本主义成分部分是由于主要是资产阶级的土地改革而出现的，这种改革在一定程度上消除了一些以往的前资本主义束缚（De Janvry，1981; Djurfeldt和Sircar，2017）。前资本主义的文化特征可以与资本主义价值观在大地主影响区域并存，并影响国家社会关系。农村资产阶级也从某些国家对农业收入免税的政策中受益，并且得益于国家支持的、局限于特定地区（非全国范围）的技术变革引入，这包括了绿色革命。绿色革命得到了国家提供廉价投入和价格支持的政策推动。农村有产阶级仍然行使着大量的政治权力，通过这些权力，它保护了其积累策略和资本/财富来源。 城市资本和土地所有者是相互联系的。农村大众（包括那些拥有小块土地的人）作为城市工人阶级的盟友，是对农村或城市地区有产阶级的巨大潜在威胁。使他们成为有力量的力量是他们在生产中的角色：如果他们停止工作，就不会有剩余价值。鉴于他们作为有产者的潜在威胁，防止他们发动对国家阶级性质或确实对城市资产阶级的任何攻击是重要的。城市资产阶级实际上需要土地所有者来控制农村大众。因此，土地所有者被视为对资产阶级的政治利益具有功能性。"},{"instruction":"请将“The act of controlling and disciplining of the rural masses by the landed also delivers an important economic advantage to the urban bourgeoisie. Food and agri-materials consumed by industries are produced cheaply, because rural workers are remunerated well below the value of their labour power. So these commodities are very ‘competitively’ priced as there are many producers, and this is to the benefit of urban capitalists. Besides, the continuing existence of rural landlords helps reproduce the idea of private property ownership and thereby the idea of capitalist private property, and this is beneficial to the urban capitalist class. So in terms of the defence of private property, rural landlords and urban capitalists have the same interest. It is important to note that just like most sections of the urban bourgeois class, the rural landowning capitalists (e.g. those in Brazil or India) have also supported the liberalization of trade that the urban capitalists have demanded because the rural capitalists, generally speaking, have eyed making money from exports of farm products. Of course, class processes that benefit the landed class can go against the urban capitalist class. The class interest of the landed is in the ruthless exploitation of people with little or no land: as poor peasants via rental extractions and (increasingly) as labourers at below-subsistence wages, often under unfree conditions. Heavy rental extraction has meant that peasants have insufficient resources to invest in land. Super-exploitation of peasants and labourers also reduces the size of the home market. Besides, given the opportunity to earn revenue through these means of super-exploitation, property owners have little incentive to invest in land to increase labour productivity. Thus, to the extent that one can at all isolate national-scale factors of under-development, agrarian class relations have acted as a fetter on the development of productive forces, at least in specific regions. This situation goes against capitalists’ interests in higher rates of profit which would have come from cheaper farm products for food and raw materials and a growing home market for large-scale production. So large-scale landowners are potential enemies of the urban capitalist class. Even if state policies against the landed (e.g. land redistribution) would help capitalists economically, the political interests of the latter (i.e. the need to control the rural masses) are a barrier to the implementation of such policies. Of course, urban capitalists, including MNCs, have begun to try relatively new strategies of accumulation in rural areas: they seek to control rural markets for inputs and outputs, and finance/insurance activities, and even production through contract farming. And, these strategies are sought to be codified/supported by the state’s pro-corporate farm laws, as in India. Because such laws would work to the detriment of small-scale producers (and small-scale capitalists) as well as workers, so they protest against corporates’ ‘rural turn’ (rural accumulation strategies) with the support of the state. In the current epoch, the peripheral state functions to create conditions to make sure that the peripheral countries are a low-wage platform for the production of goods and services for domestic and imperialist capital. The state ensures this through coercive means (political control over labour when it protests). And the state ensures this by various pro-business policies, including flexible labour market policies as in India or Indonesia.23 In many countries, the state allows capitalists to ‘employ’ labour on precarious terms.24 This situation includes a large number of people being hired by labour contractors (‘labour merchants’) who then make them available to capitalists, so workers do not sell their labour power directly to capitalists. This means that those who productively consume labour power are not often its direct buyers, so if wages are low, workers cannot complain to the capitalists who actually use them. To the extent that low-wage production in these countries, in rural and urban areas, acts as a countervailing force towards the rate of profit to fall in imperialist countries, such a role of the state is objectively important. The state also makes sure that these countries absorb the commodities and finance from advanced and imperialist countries which experience the crisis of profitability and capitalist decay. And often such absorption is based on de-industrialization: import of foreign goods and services decimates peripheral enterprises. Another beneficiary of peripheral state’s policies is what might be termed ‘state elites’, composed of high-ranking members of the bureaucracy (in civilian administration and in the army) plus senior officials engaged in the industrial management of public sector enterprises. As in imperialist centre, so in the periphery, the capitalist form of exploitation is the dominant form of exploitation which is mainly based on economic coercion. This, in turn, allows the state to have a degree of autonomy vis-à-vis specific fractions of the capitalist class, an autonomy that allows the state elites to possess the flexibility with which to ensure the reproduction of the conditions of capitalist accumulation and, in the process, meets its own interests. In the periphery, state elites’ autonomy could be a little more than in the core countries. One reason could be what Alavi calls the ‘over-developed’ nature of the state (over-developed in relation to its economic base).25 But there are other reasons, as we will see. In the initial years of independence, state elites in the periphery had a slightly progressive stance and even exhibited a degree of anti-capitalist attitude. But over time, they have behaved as typical state elites acting in partnership with the propertied classes. Their bourgeois ideological orientation and coherence has helped the bourgeoisie. However, ‘[o]ften the organizational capabilities of the peripheral state’s apparatuses are rather weak, which is why it might be said that the peripheral state is simultaneously underdeveloped and overdeveloped’ (Ougaard, 1982: 400). This fact implies that their action may not perfectly coincide with the interests of capital. Yet state elites have ensured that state policies, more or less, benefit the capitalists. Of course, state elites’ ‘control over’ state apparatuses, along with a relative absence of ‘bureaucratic professionalization’, is a massive source of rents (corruption): giving a license to a business person to set up a factory or ensuring a worker gets a water connection, is a source of bribe money for officials and politicians who work in concert. Peripheral states are the most corrupt in the world, and usually, the worst effects of corruption are borne by common people who are poor and lack relevant connections to officials and politicians. If a government regulation is there (for example, one that disallows the use of child labour in a sector), civil servants can receive monetary compensation from the business class to look the other way: a certain part of the extra profit that a business person makes by violating the regulation is shared with the civil servants (who probably share a part of the bribe with their political masters in order to receive protection from them). Civil servants and politicians can also ‘sell’ a given policy (e.g. sale or leasing of state-owned enterprises) secretively (through the use of secret electoral bonds) to meet the specific needs of a given fraction of the capitalist class by presenting that policy as being in the interest of economic development and in the interest of the nation. What has changed since the neoliberal turn has happened?26 Increasingly, civil servants are overseeing a market system, where animal spirits are highly encouraged, right from the prime minister’s office. They need to ensure the success of the market system during their formal tenure (and after retirement when they work as so-called consultants for private companies). Now as before their power comes from their ability to favour the business class as such vis-à-vis the working masses. In particular, much of their power now comes from the ability to sell off public assets to private players at a throwaway price and from making land and other natural resources available to the business class that are taken away from unorganized small-scale producers. Their power also comes from connecting this or that fraction of the business class to the international circuit of capital and to powerful imperialist states on favourable terms, and so on. In playing this sort of ‘compradore’ role, they are helped by the fact that they may have worked for international institutions and have connections with them. In contexts where the overwhelming majority of the population are illiterate or primary school dropouts and are poor, ‘the educated elite’ according to Bardhan (1998: 52), ‘enjoy a high scarcity value (a rent) for their education and profession. By managing to direct educational investment away from the masses, the elite has protected its ‘scarcity rent’, which is seen in their salary increases and perks. State elites, especially from the dominant social-cultural groups (e.g. upper castes and dominant religious or ethnic groups), have benefited considerably from the expansion of educational and administrative functions and the nationalization of industries, which created jobs for managers in the public sector and subsidized collective consumption (which has actually made some of them members of an expanding consuming class). In short, state elites have economic resources, as well as social and cultural capital. Since they occupy crucial positions in the state apparatus, they use state’s ‘autonomy’ to implement policies partly in their own interest, akin to exercising powers of patronage. The state elite has personal connections with business groups, both inside a country and in its diaspora. Even before independence, it was also the repository of the intelligentsia, working out a development theory for capitalism, often restraining more intensely bourgeois objectives and formulating policies that appeared to be more reformist and universal (Kaviraj, 1988). Members of the state elite viewed ‘their society as in need of basic change’ (Kohli, 1987: 25) and charted a path of capitalist development that defied imperialist pressures, one that is consistent with a bourgeois conception of ‘national’ development. Much planning/policy discourse accordingly comes from them who are always in interaction with the organic intellectuals of the capitalist class, in their own country and in imperialist countries, working in the academia, media, private consultancies, and so on, and who help the capitalist class construct the accumulation strategies. Such interaction is materialized through the various institutions/apparatuses of the state, and through their rules, procedures, dis-courses, and strategies. The state elite governs, and exercises power over, the millions of development-hungry, illiterate, and semi-literate people in rural areas and in impoverished urban spaces, in the name of development. Often the promise of development stays on paper with the massive gap between development on paper and development proper. Development on paper serves as a big bourgeois state ideology in the periphery. At the local scale of state-society relations, state elites (officials and political leaders, especially of ruling parties) represent the worst face of state power. Forming an alliance with the economically dominant classes at this level, they fail to implement policies that are supposed to benefit the common people and/or corner much of the development benefits that are supposed to go to the poor. Their high-handedness complements and reinforces that of the proprietary classes.”翻译为中文","output":"对农村大众的控制和管制行为，也为城市资产阶级带来了重要的经济优势。工业消费的食品和农产品成本低廉，因为农村工人的报酬远低于其劳动力价值。因此，这些商品价格极具“竞争力”，因为生产者众多，这对城市资本家有利。此外，农村地主的持续存在有助于再现私有财产所有权的概念，从而是资本主义私有财产的概念，这对城市资产阶级有益。所以在保卫私有财产方面，农村地主和城市资本家拥有共同的利益。值得注意的是，就像城市资产阶级的大多数部分一样，农村拥有资本的地主（例如巴西或印度的那些）也支持城市资本家所要求的贸易自由化，因为农村资本家通常有意通过出口农产品赚钱。 当然，对地主阶级有利的阶级过程可能会与城市资本家阶级相冲突。地主阶级的利益在于对几乎没有或没有土地的人的无情剥削：作为穷农民通过租金提取以及（越来越多地）作为低于生存工资的劳工，往往在非自由条件下。高额的租金提取意味着农民没有足够的资源投资于土地。对农民和劳工的超级剥削也减少了国内市场的规模。此外，鉴于通过这些超级剥削手段获得收入的机会，土地所有者几乎没有投资于土地以提高劳动生产率的激励。因此，若要在国家层面上分离出导致不发达的因素，农业阶级关系已成为生产力发展的桎梏，至少在特定地区是如此。这种情况与资本家对更高利润率的利益相违背，后者本可通过更便宜的农产品获得以及国内大规模生产市场的增长。因此，大土地所有者是城市资产阶级的潜在敌人。即使针对土地所有者的国家政策（例如土地重新分配）在经济上有助于资本家，但后者的政治利益（即控制农村大众的需要）是实施此类政策的障碍。当然，包括跨国公司在内的城市资本家已开始尝试在农村地区采取相对新的积累战略：他们寻求控制农村投入和产出市场，金融/保险活动，甚至通过合同农业进行生产。这些战略被国家的亲企业农业法律所规范/支持，如印度。因为这样的法律将对小规模生产者（和小规模资本家）以及工人不利，所以他们反对企业在国家支持下的“农村转向”（农村积累战略）。 在当前时代，外围国家的职能是创造条件，确保外围国家成为低工资的生产商品和服务的平台，服务于国内和帝国主义资本。国家通过强制手段（在劳工抗议时对劳动力的政治控制）确保了这一点。国家还通过各种亲商业政策来确保这一点，包括印度或印度尼西亚的灵活劳动力市场政策。在许多国家，国家允许资本家以不确定的条款“雇用”劳动力。这种情况包括大量人员被劳务承包商（“劳务商”）雇佣，然后使他们为资本家服务，所以工人并没有直接向资本家出售其劳动力。这意味着那些产品性消费劳动力的人并不常是其直接购买者，所以如果工资低，工人不能向实际使用他们的资本家抱怨。在这些国家的农村和城市地区，低工资生产作为对帝国主义国家利润率下降的一种抵消力量，国家的这种角色客观上很重要。国家还确保这些国家吸收来自发达和帝国主义国家的商品和金融，这些国家正在经历利润率危机和资本主义衰败。通常这种吸收基于去工业化：进口外国商品和服务摧毁了外围企业。 外围国家政策的另一受益者是可以称为“国家精英”的群体，由高级官僚（在民政管理和军队中）和从事公共部门企业工业管理的高级官员组成。与帝国主义中心一样，在外围，基于经济胁迫的资本主义剥削形式是主要的剥削形式。这反过来允许国家在对特定资本主义阶级分支的自主性上拥有一定程度的自主性，这种自主性使得国家精英具有以确保资本主义积累条件再生产的灵活性，并在此过程中满足其自身利益。在外围，国家精英的自主性可能比在核心国家更大一些。一个原因可能是阿拉维所说的国家的“过度发达”性质（相对于其经济基础而言）。但还有其他原因，我们将会看到。在独立初年，外围的国家精英持有稍微进步的立场，甚至表现出一定程度的反资本主义态度。但随着时间的推移，他们表现得像典型的国家精英，与有产阶级合作。他们的资产阶级意识形态取向和一致性有助于资产阶级。然而，“往往外围国家的机构组织能力相当薄弱，这就是为什么可以说外围国家同时是不发达和过度发达的”（Ougaard，1982：400）。这个事实意味着他们的行动可能不完全符合资本的利益。然而，国家精英确保了国家政策或多或少有利于资本家。当然，国家精英对国家机构的“控制”，以及相对缺乏“官僚职业化”，是腐败（收取租金）的巨大来源：为商人提供设立工厂的许可证或确保工人获得水连接，为一起工作的官员和政治家提供了贿赂资金的来源。外围国家是世界上最腐败的国家之一，通常腐败的最坏影响由普通民众承受，这些民众穷困且缺乏与官员和政治家的相关联系。 如果有政府规定（例如，禁止在某个行业使用童工的规定），公务员可以从商业阶级那里收取金钱，以便于选择视而不见：商人通过违反规定所获得的额外利润的一部分与公务员分享（他们可能会与他们的政治主人分享部分贿赂，以便从他们那里获得保护）。公务员和政治家也可以秘密地（通过使用秘密选举债券）“出售”某项政策（例如出售或租赁国有企业），将该政策呈现为符合经济发展利益和国家利益的需要，以满足资本主义阶级特定部分的具体需求。自新自由主义转变发生以来有什么变化？越来越多的公务员正在监督一个市场系统，在这个系统中，从总理办公室开始，高度鼓励动物精神。他们需要确保市场系统在他们的正式任期内（以及退休后当他们为私营公司工作所谓的顾问时）取得成功。现在和以前一样，他们的权力来自于他们能够支持商业阶级对抗工人大众。特别是，他们现在的大部分权力来自于以低廉价格出售公共资产给私人玩家的能力，以及将土地和其他自然资源提供给商业阶级，这些资源是从无组织的小规模生产者那里夺取的。他们的权力还来自于将这个或那个商业阶级分支连接到国际资本流通和有利条件下的强大帝国主义国家。在扮演这种“中介人”角色时，他们因为可能曾为国际机构工作并与之保持联系而受到帮助。 在大多数人口是文盲或小学辍学并且贫穷的情况下，根据巴德汉（Bardhan，1998：52）的说法，“受过教育的精英”因其教育和职业的稀缺价值（一种租金）而享有高度优势。通过成功地将教育投资从大众中转移开，精英保护了其“稀缺性租金”，这在他们的工资增长和福利中得到体现。国家精英，尤其是来自主导的社会文化群体（例如上层种姓和主导的宗教或族裔群体），从教育和行政职能的扩张以及国有化产业中受益良多，这为管理人员在公共部门创造了就业机会，并补贴了集体消费（实际上使他们中的一些人成为不断扩大的消费阶层的成员）。简而言之，国家精英拥有经济资源以及社会和文化资本。由于他们在国家机构中占据关键位置，他们利用国家的“自主性”部分地为了自身利益实施政策，类似于行使赞助权力。 国家精英与国内外商业团体有个人联系。即使在独立前，它也是知识分子的储藏所，为资本主义制定了发展理论，常常限制更激进的资产阶级目标，并制定了看似更改革性和普遍性的政策（卡维拉吉，1988）。国家精英成员视“他们的社会需要基本变革”（科利，1987：25）并规划了一条资本主义发展道路，该路线抵制了帝国主义压力，符合资产阶级关于“国家”发展的概念。许多规划/政策话语相应地来自于他们，他们始终与本国和帝国主义国家的资产阶级有机知识分子互动，在学术界、媒体、私人咨询公司等领域工作，并帮助资产阶级构建积累战略。这种互动通过国家的各种机构/机制及其规则、程序、话语和策略具体化。国家精英治理并对成千上万渴望发展的文盲和半文盲人民行使权力，在农村地区和贫困城市空间，以发展的名义。发展的承诺往往只存在于纸面上，发展在纸面和实际发展之间存在巨大差距。纸面上的发展成为外围大资产阶级国家意识形态的一部分。 在国家-社会关系的地方层面，国家精英（官员和政治领导人，尤其是执政党的）代表了国家权力的最坏面孔。他们与这一层面的经济主导阶级结成联盟，未能实施旨在惠及普通民众的政策，或者将本应流向穷人的大部分发展利益据为己有。他们的高压手段补充并加强了有产阶级的手段。"},{"instruction":"请将“Whether they have much ‘human capital’ or not, state elites qua elites are not a class, however, so they cannot be considered a part of the class coalition holding state power.27 Unlike landowners and private capitalists, they, as even the managers of state property, cannot transfer property to their heirs. It is the ownership/control of the means of production that decides who ultimately has power in a society and the state.28 State elites do have a certain degree of autonomy, but this autonomy is that of the state as a structure in a dominantly bourgeois society. Their activities — including rent-seeking — must be seen as contingent on a state, the structure of which is designed to pursue capitalist interests. State elites as such are not a class and cannot therefore hold and exercise state power on their own behalf.29 It is the logic of private sector profit in the hands of the (big) business houses that sets the limit within which specific economic development strategies are designed by state elites, based on their worldview which is more or less influenced by the interests of the bourgeoisie as a whole.30 The actual nature of policies depends to some extent on the perception of their own economic/political interests, and their perception of what ‘the nation’ needs, and their ability to conceive these needs along the capitalist lines. In the early stage of the post-independence epoch, they conceived of national capitalist development to be relatively autonomous of imperialist pressures, but in more recent times, the elites have a penchant for neoliberal development without any pretention to counter imperialism.31 The dominant class base of the state changes over time (and over space). Since the late 1950—1960s, there has been an expansion of the capitalist class (although differently in different regions within a country). In more recent times, capitalist elements among the landed, relative to those landowners who used to appropriate ground-rent often using extra-economic coercion, have become more powerful and have been connected to urban capitalists. However, the economic and political importance of rural capitalists, in spite of their numerical dominance within the property-owning class, is declining relative to that of the city-based big-business, which includes foreign capital. There is also increasing integration between the periphery’s capitalist class and imperialist capital. 5 The state, exploited classes, and class struggle from below in the periphery The proprietary coalition is only part, albeit the dominant part, of the peripheral state’s social conditioning. What the state is and does, and why, must also be investigated from the standpoint of the lower classes (the masses) and especially in terms of their struggle against the state and the propertied classes and against imperialism, no matter how weak and constrained that struggle is. Which classes are the exploited classes in the periphery, and how are they exploited? This has been discussed in the last section on the nature of the dominant classes, but a brief re-articulation of the relevant ideas might be useful. In the rural context, the exploited classes are the small-scale producers. They include: middle peasants who do not hire labour, and poor peasants who may work on their own and/or rented land, and also as part-time wage-earners. The exploited classes also include agricultural and non-agricultural labourers. As a general rule, these classes/strata are exploited in the capitalist system, but they are subordinated by a wide variety of regionally specific production relations, extending from sharecropping and other kinds of tenancy arrangements which structure their conditional access to small plots of land. Such relations are additionally structured by the presence or absence of cash wages, debt, and freedom on the part of a worker personally to commodify his/her own labour power. Those compelled to rely mainly or wholly on the sale not of the product of their labour but rather of labour power itself — that is, labourers of various types — are exploited by property owners, who appropriate surplus labour in the form of profit as well as rent and interest. Many rural men and women and even children work as seasonal or migrant labourers in nearby city-regions and also in newly transplanted enterprises in rural areas. In the urban context, a small percentage of wage earners has access to a regular wage, tenure, and pension benefits. The vast majority of workers are precariously employed without regularity of employment or pension and other benefits. There are many men and women, who work as small-scale owners/producers, in part because of the lack of secure wage-employment with a decent wage. The miserable conditions of these classes prompt the struggle from below. Forms of class struggle from below Forms of class struggle from below vary and are often place-specific. One can observe four inter-connected forms. The first is the struggle by proletarian and semi-proletarian elements as full-time or part-time wage earners against capital, both in urban and rural areas. This ‘from below’ struggle includes struggle against pre-capitalist exploitation where it exists. More importantly, their struggle, which is generally in the form of strikes (work stoppage), is against the formal and RSL under capital: that is, it is against low wages, oppressive labour practices, long hours and poor working conditions, precarity, and the introduction of, or subordination to, labour-saving technology, and so on. This sort of struggle also aims at the state which supports the propertied class against ‘from below’ agency undertaken by workers and small-scale producers. Workers in rural and urban areas fight for concessions from the capitalist state, including in its role as an employer and as a provider of subsistence goods (e.g. food) that contribute to social reproduction. Also, workers (whether in South Africa or India, etc.) have not only struck work, and they have also defended the public sector (and fought against their privatization), and they have also built production and service-provision cooperatives as a means of building working-class power. A second main form is ‘from below’ struggle against primitive accumulation: the state facilitating ‘coercive depeasantization’ (smallholders being coercively stripped of their means of production), the privatization of common property and public sector resources, and the withdrawal of state benefits meant for the poor. Here again ‘from below’ agency targets the state (and not just the propertied classes) for its support for primitive accumulation — for example, when it privatizes the commons. Connected to this form of struggles is the struggle, launched by small-scale commodity producers for better farm prices and lower farm inputs for protection from big business trying to extend its control over rural market, finance, and so on. Brazil’s landless workers movement and Zapatista movement and numerous similar movements against modern forms of primitive accumulation in South Asia are the relevant examples. In addition to these two forms of class struggle, there are other kinds of conflict that have their roots in class relations but have some autonomy: these struggles oppose ecological degradation and special oppression (i.e. oppression based on gender/caste/ethnic/national/religious/racial relations) that the state, including bourgeois parties promotes/sustains. Indeed, adverse environmental change and non-class forms of oppression have a disproportionate impact on the poor than on the better-off sections. To the degree that the propertied classes and the state bolster — either overtly or covertly — ‘non-class’ forms of oppression, they become the target of anti-oppression struggles. These are the struggles in which exploited classes participate, although they may not always be conscious of the role of capitalism in the creation of ecological problems and promotion/maintenance of social oppression. There is also struggle which is most clearly ‘political’: for the democratization of the state. Workers and small-scale producers join with the broad mass of the population, not least because they are the ones who often experience in its most overt form the corrupt practices and patronizing attitudes of state elites, who treat them like slaves. Insofar as the undemocratic nature of the state — its lack of accountability to the exploited classes in terms of policies, programmes, and politics — derives from the fact that the main role of this capitalist apparatus is to reproduce dominance of the exploiting propertied classes, so struggles over democracy are centrally linked to the fact of class relations. In more recent times, struggles against the attack on democratic rights have focused on the assaults on religious and ethnic minorities from fascistic forces whether in Brazil, Turkey, India, or Sri Lanka. Anti-imperialist struggles, including in Pakistan, as well as struggles against fascistic tendencies as well as struggles against special oppression, are a part of the democratic movement in the periphery. State’s concessions as a response to class struggle from below Struggles from below mean that both the propertied classes and the state find it necessary to make concessions from time to time. But these do not threaten capital. Even such state-enabled accumulation projects as the Green Revolution were driven in part by the fear that actual or potential famine conditions during the 1960s might constitute a threat to the political order. To the extent that the land reform policy has granted small amounts of land, taken from large landlords, to poor people, this has represented a reverse primitive accumulation.32 But reverse primitive accumulation does not undermine capitalism. Capitalism does not require that all labour power become a commodity. As long as a sufficient amount of labour power is in the commodity form, capitalism’s fundamental mechanisms (e.g. competition, appropriation of surplus value, and the like) can be in full force. In fact, the existence of a semi-commodified labour power is no barrier to capital’s pursuit of surplus. Capital can benefit at the expense of small-scale producers in multiple ways.33 Similarly, many states have provided limited wage employment on public works as well as small loans to poor people to set up small businesses, and this contributes towards their reproduction as potential wage labour (and as small-scale producers).34 However, the major interventions of the post-colonial state have failed to significantly improve the conditions of life of the poor, the conditions that are created by the ways in which the capitalist economic system works. The main, if not the sole, reason for state failure is the class character of the state and society. In most populous post-colonial countries, large landowners share state power with the urban bourgeoisie: this means that state policies have been dominantly in the interests of these classes and their international patrons. As already mentioned, the landowners perform the important role of economically and politically controlling the rural masses, including labourers, whose anger against landlordism could be potentially directed at the bourgeoisie of the country as well as their international patrons. Further, those who are responsible for the design and implementation of pro-poor policies, including judges and bureaucrats, come from the landed class or represent their interests.35”翻译为中文","output":"无论他们是否拥有大量“人力资本”，国家精英作为精英并不构成一个阶级，因此，他们不能被视为掌握国家权力的阶级联盟的一部分。不同于土地所有者和私人资本家，就算作为国有财产的管理者，他们也不能将财产转移给他们的继承人。拥有/控制生产资料的权力决定了谁最终在社会和国家中拥有权力。国家精英确实拥有一定程度的自主权，但这种自主权是作为一个主要资产阶级社会中的国家结构所拥有的。他们的活动——包括寻租——必须被视为以追求资本主义利益而设计的国家结构为条件。因此，国家精英本身不是一个阶级，因此不能代表自己行使国家权力。私营部门利润的逻辑为国家精英设计特定经济发展策略的范围设定了限制，这基于他们的世界观，这种世界观或多或少受到整体资产阶级利益的影响。政策的实际性质在一定程度上取决于他们对自己经济/政治利益的看法，以及他们对“国家”需求的看法，以及他们按照资本主义路线构想这些需求的能力。在后独立时代的早期阶段，他们构想的国家资本主义发展相对独立于帝国主义压力，但在最近，精英们倾向于不抗衡帝国主义的新自由主义发展。 国家的主导阶级基础随时间（和空间）而变化。自1950—1960年代晚期以来，资本家阶级已经扩张（尽管在一个国家的不同地区不同）。在最近，与那些过去常常使用超经济强制手段占有地租的地主相比，土地上的资本主义元素变得更为强大，并且与城市资本家建立了联系。然而，尽管农村资本家在拥有财产的阶级内占据数目上的优势，与基于城市的大企业相比，包括外国资本在内，他们的经济和政治重要性正在相对下降。外围的资本家阶级与帝国主义资本之间的融合也在增加。 5 外围的国家、被剥削阶级和来自下层的阶级斗争 所有者联盟只是外围国家社会条件的一部分，尽管是主导部分。对国家是什么、做什么以及为什么，也必须从下层阶级（大众）的立场出发来调查，特别是就他们反对国家和有产阶级以及反对帝国主义的斗争而言，不管这场斗争多么微弱和受限。 哪些阶级是外围的被剥削阶级，他们是如何被剥削的？这在上一节关于主导阶级性质的讨论中已经讨论过，但简要重新阐述相关观点可能是有用的。在农村背景下，被剥削阶级是小规模生产者。他们包括：不雇佣劳动力的中等农民，以及可能在自己和/或租赁土地上工作并且还兼职为工资工作的贫农。被剥削阶级还包括农业和非农业劳动者。一般规则是，这些阶级/阶层在资本主义制度中被剥削，但它们受到广泛的特定地区生产关系的支配，从佃耕和其他类型的租赁安排中延伸，这些安排构建了他们有条件地进入小块土地的渠道。这种关系还受到现金工资、债务及个人自由贩卖其劳动力的存在或缺乏的额外结构化。那些主要或完全依赖于出售其劳动力而非劳动产品的人——即各种类型的劳工——被占有者剥削，后者通过利润以及租金和利息的形式占有剩余劳动。许多农村男性、女性甚至儿童作为季节性或移民劳工在附近的城市区域以及在农村地区新建的企业中工作。在城市背景下，少数工资收入者有权获得规律工资、任期和养老金福利。绝大多数工人没有固定的就业或养老金和其他福利，他们的工作岗位不稳定。许多男性和女性，由于缺乏有保障的有体面工资的工资就业，以小规模所有者/生产者的身份工作。这些阶级的悲惨条件促使了来自下层的斗争。 来自下层的阶级斗争形式 来自下层的阶级斗争形式多种多样，通常具有地方特色。我们可以观察到四种相互关联的形式。第一种是无产阶级和半无产阶级成员作为全职或兼职工资收入者在城市和农村地区反对资本的斗争。这种“来自下层”的斗争包括在存在的地方反对前资本主义剥削。更重要的是，他们的斗争通常以罢工（停工）的形式出现，是对资本下的正式和实际征用的斗争：即对低工资、压迫性劳动实践、长时间工作和恶劣的工作条件、不稳定性以及对节约劳动的技术的引入和服从等问题的斗争。这种斗争还针对支持有产阶级对抗“来自下层”代理人行动的国家（由工人和小规模生产者）。无论是在农村还是城市地区的工人都在争取从资本主义国家获得让步，包括国家作为雇主和提供有助于社会再生产的生存商品（例如食物）的角色。此外，工人（无论是在南非还是印度等地）不仅罢工，他们还保卫公共部门（并对抗其私有化），并建立生产和服务提供合作社作为构建工人阶级力量的手段。 第二种主要形式是反对原始积累的“来自下层”斗争：国家促进“强制性去农民化”（小农户被强制剥夺生产手段）、公共财产和公共部门资源的私有化以及撤销原本用于穷人的国家福利。这里“来自下层”的代理人再次针对国家（而不仅仅是有产阶级），因为其支持原始积累——例如，当它将公共资源私有化时。与这种斗争形式相关的是，小规模商品生产者为了更好的农产品价格和更低的农业投入品以及保护免受试图扩大对农村市场、金融等控制的大企业的影响而发起的斗争。巴西无地农工运动和萨帕塔运动以及对南亚现代形式原始积累的众多类似运动是相关的例子。 除了这两种形式的阶级斗争外，还有其他种类的冲突，它们根源于阶级关系但具有一定的自主性：这些斗争反对生态退化和特殊压迫（即基于性别/种姓/族裔/民族/宗教/种族关系的压迫），国家（包括资产阶级政党）促进/维持的。实际上，不利的环境变化和非阶级形式的压迫对穷人的影响大于对较富裕阶层的影响。在有产阶级和国家公开或隐秘地支持“非阶级”形式的压迫的程度上，它们成了反压迫斗争的目标。这些是被剥削阶级参与的斗争，尽管他们可能并不总是意识到资本主义在生态问题产生和维持/促进社会压迫中的作用。 还有一种斗争形式是最明显的“政治性”斗争：争取国家的民主化。工人和小规模生产者与广大民众一道参与，不仅是因为他们经常以最明显的形式经历了国家精英的腐败行为和居高临下的态度，后者将他们视为奴隶。因为国家的非民主性质——其在政策、计划和政治上对被剥削阶级缺乏问责性——来自于它作为这个资本主义装置的主要角色是为了再现剥削有产阶级的统治，所以民主斗争与阶级关系事实密切相关。在最近，反对对民主权利的攻击的斗争集中在对宗教和族裔少数群体的法西斯势力攻击上，无论是在巴西、土耳其、印度还是斯里兰卡。反帝国主义斗争，包括在巴基斯坦，以及对法西斯倾向和特殊压迫的斗争，是外围民主运动的一部分。 国家作为对来自下层斗争的回应的让步 来自下层的斗争意味着有产阶级和国家有时不得不做出让步。但这些不会威胁到资本。即使像绿色革命这样由国家支持的积累项目也是部分受到了1960年代潜在或实际饥荒条件可能对政治秩序构成威胁的恐惧所驱动的。在土地改革政策中，从大地主手中拿出少量土地给穷人，并不代表原始积累的倒退。但原始积累的倒退并不破坏资本主义。资本主义并不要求所有劳动力都变成商品。只要有足够多的劳动力以商品形式存在，资本主义的基本机制（例如竞争、剩余价值的占有等）就可以充分发挥作用。事实上，半商品化的劳动力的存在并不妨碍资本追求剩余。资本可以通过多种方式以小规模生产者为代价获益。同样，许多国家为穷人提供了有限的公共工程工资就业机会以及设立小企业的小额贷款，这有助于他们作为潜在工资劳动力（和小规模生产者）的再生产。 然而，后殖民时代国家的主要干预措施未能显著改善穷人的生活条件，这些条件是由资本主义经济系统运作方式造成的。国家失败的主要（如果不是唯一）原因是国家和社会的阶级性质。在大多数人口众多的后殖民国家，大地主与城市资产阶级共同分享国家权力：这意味着国家政策主要符合这些阶级及其国际宗主的利益。正如前文所提到的，地主在经济和政治上控制农村大众（包括劳工）方面发挥了重要作用，这些人对地主制的愤怒可能潜在地针对国家的资产阶级以及他们的国际宗主。此外，负责设计和实施惠及穷人政策的人员，包括法官和官僚，来自地主阶级或代表他们的利益。"},{"instruction":"请将“As explained earlier, the economic interest of the capitalist class, domestic and foreign, is such that it would not have had any problem if the land reform leg-islation had completely destroyed the pre-capitalist class, reviewing barriers to productivity. Such legislation would also have improved the material conditions of peasants and rural labourers. But the political interests of capitalists were such that they could not go against the feudals. What Marx said in 1852 (in a chapter in New York Daily Tribune) about the then-British bourgeoisie, is relevant to the late developing countries now: They prefer to compromise with the vanishing opponent [i.e. the feudals] rather than to strengthen the arising enemy [i.e. the working class], to whom the future belongs, by concessions of a more than apparent importance. Therefore, they strive to avoid every forcible collision with [them]. (Marx, 1852b) So, given the importance of the landowners, the state acting on behalf of the bourgeoisie cannot afford to hurt their (i.e. landowners’) interest too much by properly implementing land reforms. This imperative of non-harm to the dominant classes is stronger under neoliberalism. This is seen in the attempted relaxation of ceiling laws to benefit the new rich. Existing ceilings on land holdings are being considered an obstacle to accumulation. The Green Revolution, in a sense, represents a continuity with the earlier programme (i.e. the land reforms), once again revealing the class character of the state. The Green Revolution policy placed new means of production (e.g. the new technological package, state capital in the form of subsidies, and so on) precisely in the hands of the same class which was protected by the land reforms policy and allowed it an opportunity to accumulate capital, unfettered and untaxed. The landed elements continue to govern the conditions of existence of the poor. Neither the land reforms nor the Green Revolution has done anything to significantly undermine the economic and political power of large property owners (many of whom also invest in non-farm activities such as transportation, trading, and so on). I may add that since the onset of neoliberal capitalist policies, land and water resources are increasingly being used to produce high value goods for a narrow domestic elite and for export. And one implication of this is a relative decline in the access to food on the part of millions of people in the periphery. Also, given the overall capitalist class context, the amount of funding for the proper implementation of the policies on the scale that is necessary has to be limited. In the market system, the use of society’s resources must be justified mainly on the basis of the profit logic. This logic puts severe limits on the amount of money the capitalist state can commit in the form of pro-poor policies, relative to the massive need of the hundreds of millions of the poor whom the system marginalizes (e.g. peasants increasingly losing access to land, people without secure employment for a living wage). The actual amount spent on the poor depends on, among other things, the balance of class forces as mediated by state-based mechanisms (e.g. judiciary, electoral power of different classes), and this balance is not in favour of the poor. But there are severe structural limits to what the state can do for the poor.36 Note that these limits are expressed by the ruling class, directly or through its spokespersons, who have no qualms about milking the state to satisfy their appetite for profits. The situation of state spending for the poor relative to country’s ability to spend is stark in neoliberal period with the state having shifted its path from welfare/interventionist state to laissez-faire neoliberal state (Tiwana and Singh, 2015). One of the (contradictory) aims of the latter is to shrink mass income and consumption at home in order to enable cheap exports and repayment of debt to imperialist finance capital (Patnaik, 1999). When viewed in relation to policies for the exploited classes, within which the different strata belong to different castes/ethnic minorities, the state is a deeply contradictory entity. On the one hand, without the democratic grassroots organization of these classes vis-à-vis the ruling classes and state elites, pro-poor policies will fail. Policies which aim to take land from landowners and give it to the poor, or which aim to ensure safety in the workplace and the payment of adequate wages, will not be implemented without the direct participation of the masses in their implementation, given the enormous power of the propertied classes to hide what they do. On the other hand, state’s own actions and ideas and its own form, the form of anti-poverty policies, tend to fragment and disorganize the lower classes who compete for meagre resources. Not only must the state disorganize, it must also have a certain amount of social-political distance between itself and the lower classes. Indeed, real direct democratic control over the state’s day-to-day operation by the lower classes contradicts state’s function to reproduce class relations. In its day-to-day operation, the state is generally not accessible to lower classes the way it is to dominant classes. Therefore, the possibility of state officials properly implementing antipoverty policies does not generally arise. If lack of power contributes to poverty, the state is a cause of powerlessness of the lower classes. It must therefore be seen as an important cause of poverty. One should therefore be critical of those who are sanguine about the talk of decentralization of state power as a solution to problems. Many commentators, including Amartya Sen (1999), assume that by encour-aging competition between parties and allowing a free press, democracy will lead to the implementation of pro-poor policies. He says that what the government does can be influenced by public pressures from below (Dreze and Sen, 1995). But much depends on what issues are politicised, and what is, or is not, politicized depends on the visions and pre-occupations of ruling as well as opposition parties. Non-communist opposition parties do not oppose ruling parties on crucial issues such as payment of compensation to landlords in the land reform laws or privatization of state-owned companies or periphery’s subjugation to the imperialist military-economic framework. In other words, on class-related issues that do matter to the exploited classes, whose interests are fundamentally opposed to those of exploited classes, opposition parties do not matter. Parties in power and parties in opposition do not oppose the fundamental interests of the business class and its collaboration with imperialism. Both ruling and opposition parties work within the framework of a state that supports the fundamental interests of the propertied classes and share the ruling class ideology which, in turn, contributes to the de-politicization of the crucial issues. Dreze and Sen ignore the fact that the ideology of the propertied classes and the coercive character of the state, among other things, influence what enters into political debates and what does not. Sen’s view is problematic because it is silent about the class character of the parties/regimes, which manage the common affairs of the state, which, in turn, manage the common affairs of the capitalist class. Sen’s optimistic prognosis cannot answer the question of why it is that crucial development issues — such as unequal distribution of means of production (particularly land), extreme forms of income inequality, absence of high-quality and free state-provided healthcare and education, and employment for all at an inflation-adjusted living wage — do not become important election issues and are not much debated by competing mainstream parties. Democracy can help in the promulgation and implementation of policies favourable to the masses, but within limits. If the masses are to secure significant access to economic resources, including land and remuneration for their work, in the democratic process — so as to enjoy the health and educational freedoms which Sen rightly thinks all human beings should enjoy — then this requires, at least, the severe curtailment of political power exercised by dominant proprietary classes. 6 Coercive nature of the peripheral state’s democratic form It is a mistake, however, to assume that the only response the state can make to ‘from below’ struggle is a defensive one of concession, however limited. Hence the importance of understanding that the state response frequently is to launch counter-revolutionary action — a form of ‘from above’ class struggle — on behalf of capital and large landowners, and in the interest of maintaining political order. Hence the class character of society and the grassroots struggles arising from this influence the nature of the state form (especially in terms of whether it is democratic or not), which in turn influences state actions. The existence of the democratic form does not mean that it is the only form of class rule: indeed, when necessary, the state will and does use coercion, and increasingly so, against the exploited classes if they resist its accumulation policies beyond a certain limit. The state turns coercive when people fight against domestic and imperialist capital. The capitalist state tends to be much less democratic in the periphery than the state in the metropolitan countries. In those peripheral countries, where the democratic state form exists, the amount of the gap between substantive economic inequality and formal political equality is much greater than in the imperialist countries. This is because of severe forms of economic inequality and high level of absolute poverty. This fact is an aspect of a broader trend: in the LDCs, the normal effects of class relations on the common people are more extreme. Coercion is partly, and only partly, thanks to its colonial legacy.37 There are strong anti-democratic pressures from society since independence from colonialism. Anti-democratic pressure emanates from geographically fixed land-based accumulation activities (e.g. latifundia, mining capital, and so on) that remain powerful in the villages and small towns: owners of farm-land or mines cannot leave a place with their property, so they must counter any resistance from the masses at all costs. Threats to formal democracy also come from those (e.g. fascistic forces) who are opposed to minority religions and women’s rights. They also derive from the several other aspects of the capitalism that exists. One aspect is primitive accumulation which generally involves coercion.”翻译为中文","output":"正如之前解释的，国内外资本家阶级的经济利益，即使土地改革立法彻底破坏了前资本主义阶级，消除了生产力的障碍，他们也不会有任何问题。这样的立法也会改善农民和农村劳工的物质条件。但资本家的政治利益使他们不能反对封建势力。马克思在1852年（在纽约每日论坛报的一章中）关于当时的英国资产阶级所说的话，对现在发展较晚的国家仍然相关： 他们宁愿与消亡的对手妥协，也不愿通过超乎表面的重要让步来加强未来属于他们的敌人（即工人阶级）。因此，他们努力避免与[他们]发生任何强制性的冲突。 （马克思，1852b） 因此，鉴于地主的重要性，代表资产阶级行事的国家不能通过正确实施土地改革来过多地损害他们（即地主）的利益。在新自由主义下，这种对主导阶级无害的原则更为强烈。这在放宽土地持有上限法律以惠及新富人士的尝试中显而易见。现有的土地持有上限被视为积累的障碍。 从某种意义上说，绿色革命代表着与早期计划（即土地改革）的连续性，再次揭示了国家的阶级性质。绿色革命政策将新的生产手段（例如新技术包，国家形式的补贴等）准确地放在了土地改革政策所保护的同一阶级手中，允许它有机会无障碍且免税地积累资本。土地拥有者继续控制着穷人生存条件的条件。无论是土地改革还是绿色革命都没有采取任何措施显着削弱大产权所有者（许多人还投资于非农业活动，如交通、贸易等）的经济和政治权力。我可以补充说，自从新自由主义资本主义政策开始以来，土地和水资源越来越多地被用来为狭窄的国内精英和出口生产高价值商品。由此产生的一个含义是，外围数百万人的粮食获取渠道相对减少。 此外，鉴于整体资本家阶级的背景，为政策的正确实施在必要规模上提供资金的金额必须是有限的。在市场体制中，社会资源的使用必须主要基于利润逻辑来证明。这种逻辑对资本主义国家可以以亲穷人政策的形式承诺的资金量设定了严格限制，相对于体系边缘化的数亿穷人的巨大需求（例如，农民越来越多地失去土地，没有稳定就业以获取生活工资的人）。实际用于穷人的资金量取决于包括阶级力量平衡（例如，不同阶级的司法权、选举权）通过国家机制调节的结果，这种平衡不利于穷人。但是，国家能为穷人做些什么有严重的结构性限制。请注意，这些限制是由统治阶级直接或通过其代言人表达的，他们不惜动用国家满足其对利润的贪婪。相对于国家的承受能力，国家为穷人的花费在新自由主义时期尤为严峻，因为国家已经从福利/干预主义国家转变为自由放任的新自由主义国家（Tiwana和Singh，2015）。后者的一个（矛盾的）目标是为了便宜出口和偿还帝国主义金融资本的债务而在国内减少大众收入和消费（Patnaik，1999）。 当从被剥削阶级的政策视角来看时，不同阶层属于不同种姓/少数族裔，国家是一个充满矛盾的实体。一方面，没有这些阶级针对统治阶级和国家精英的民主基层组织，亲穷人政策将失败。旨在从地主手中夺取土地并交给穷人，或旨在确保工作场所的安全和支付足够工资的政策，如果没有大众在其实施中的直接参与，将不会得到实施，鉴于有产阶级隐藏他们所做之事的巨大权力。另一方面，国家自身的行为和观念及其形式，即反贫困政策的形式，倾向于使下层阶级碎片化和解组织化，他们为了微薄的资源而相互竞争。国家不仅必须解组织化，还必须在自身与下层阶级之间保持一定的社会政治距离。实际上，直接民主控制国家的日常运作与下层阶级相矛盾，因为国家的功能是再现有产阶级的关系。在日常运作中，国家通常不像对待支配阶级那样对下层阶级开放。因此，国家官员正确实施反贫困政策的可能性通常不会出现。如果缺乏力量导致了贫困，那么国家是下层阶级无力的原因之一。因此，必须将其视为贫困的重要原因。因此，应批判那些对将国家权力分权作为解决问题方案的乐观论者。 许多评论家，包括阿马蒂亚·森（Amartya Sen，1999），假设通过鼓励党派间的竞争和允许自由媒体，民主将导致亲穷人政策的实施。他说政府所做的可以受到来自下层的公共压力的影响（Dreze和Sen，1995）。但很多取决于哪些问题被政治化，什么被政治化或没有被政治化取决于统治党和反对党的愿景和关注点。非共产主义反对党不会在土地改革法律中支付给地主补偿或国有公司的私有化或外围对帝国主义军事经济框架的臣服等关键问题上反对执政党。换句话说，在对被剥削阶级确实重要的与阶级相关的问题上，反对党的利益与被剥削阶级的利益根本相反，反对党无关紧要。执政党和反对党都不反对商业阶级的根本利益及其与帝国主义的合作。执政和反对党都在支持有产阶级根本利益的国家框架内工作，并且分享了支配阶级的意识形态，这反过来又有助于关键问题的去政治化。Dreze和Sen忽视了有产阶级的意识形态和国家的强制性质等因素，这些因素影响政治辩论中包含什么和不包含什么。森的观点是有问题的，因为它对管理国家共同事务的政党/政权的阶级性质保持沉默，这反过来又管理着资本主义阶级的共同事务。森的乐观预测无法回答为什么像生产资料（特别是土地）的不平等分配、极端的收入不平等、缺乏高质量和免费的国家提供的医疗保健和教育以及为所有人提供通货膨胀调整后的生活工资的就业等关键发展问题不成为重要的选举问题，并且不被主流竞争党派广泛讨论的问题。民主可以帮助促进和实施对大众有利的政策，但有限制。如果大众要在民主过程中获得包括土地和工作报酬在内的重要经济资源，以享受森正确认为所有人类应享有的健康和教育自由，那么这至少需要严格限制支配性有产阶级行使的政治权力。 6 外围国家民主形式的强制性质 然而，假设国家对“来自下层”的斗争的唯一回应是有限的让步性防御行为是一个错误。因此，了解国家响应经常启动代表资本和大地主利益的反革命行动——一种“来自上层”的阶级斗争形式——以维护政治秩序的重要性。因此，社会的阶级性质和由此产生的基层斗争影响了国家形式的性质（特别是在是否民主方面），进而影响了国家行动。 民主形式的存在并不意味着它是阶级统治的唯一形式：确实，当必要时，国家将并确实使用强制手段，越来越多地针对被剥削阶级，如果他们在一定限度之外抵抗其积累政策。当人们反对国内和帝国主义资本时，国家变得强制性。资本主义国家在外围往往比在大都会国家更不民主。在那些存在民主国家形式的外围国家，实质经济不平等和形式政治平等之间的差距远大于帝国主义国家。这是因为严重的经济不平等和高水平的绝对贫困。 这一事实是更广泛趋势的一部分：在最不发达国家（LDCs），阶级关系对普通人的正常影响更加极端。强制部分地，只是部分地，归因于其殖民遗产。独立后存在强烈的反民主压力。反民主压力来自地理上固定的基于土地的积累活动（例如大庄园，矿业资本等），这些活动在村庄和小镇仍然强大：农田或矿山的所有者不能带着财产离开一个地方，所以他们必须不惜一切代价对抗大众的抵抗。正式民主的威胁也来自那些（例如法西斯势力）反对少数宗教和妇女权利的人。这些威胁还源于存在的资本主义的几个其他方面。一个方面是原始积累，通常涉及强制手段。"},{"instruction":"请将“In addition, in these countries, as we have seen, there is a backward form of capitalism. This form of capitalism potentially undermines the basis for demo-cratic conduct. When capitalism is based on FSL, it is hardly conducive to democratic relations between state (officials) and citizens and between employers and employees. When profits come more or less from the naked exhaustion of the body of direct producers (or from their dispossession of property) rather than from increased productivity of their labour per hour of labour time spent in the workplaces based on the systemic logic of technological change in every sector and sub-sector, and when the very basic needs are not met by capital or the state, the relation between ‘sovereignty and dependence’, or the relation between the ruler and the ruled, tends to become a coercive relation, even if one is not tied to a given employer through extra-economic means. Several factors such as ‘the feebleness of the national bourgeoisie, the absence of traditions of municipal self-government . . . cut the ground from under any kind of stable democratic regime’ (Trotsky, 1940). So [t]he governments of backward, i.e., colonial and semi-colonial countries, by and large assume a Bonapartist or semi-Bonapartist character; and differ from one another in this, that some try to orient in a democratic direction, seeking support among workers and peasants, while others install a form close to military-police dictatorship. (Trotsky, 1940) And if a peripheral country is dominated by foreign capital, there is an additional reason for the state to be coercive. Any struggle against capital invites coercion from the state. Inasmuch as the chief role in backward countries is not played by national but by foreign capitalism, the national bourgeoisie occupies, in the sense of its social position, a much more minor position than corresponds with the development of industry. Inasmuch as foreign capital . . . but proletarianizes the native population, the national proletariat soon begins playing the most important role in the life of the country. In these conditions the national government, to the extent that it tries to show resistance to foreign capital, is compelled to a greater or lesser degree to lean on the proletariat. However, the governments of those backward countries which consider inescapable or more profitable for themselves to march shoulder to shoulder with foreign capital, destroy the labor organizations and institute a more or less totalitarian regime. (Trotsky, 1940) Imperialism indeed directly contributes to a coercive state in peripheral countries in the face of anti-imperialist struggles. About the state in Pakistan, Azeem (2020) says, imperialism cannot rely on weak politicians to curb dissent against its global and regional concerns, and hence has propped up military regimes in the strategic contests of the Cold War and the ‘War on Terror’. Pakistan’s ruling classes were concerned that the communists could focus these uprisings into a counter-hegemonic politics; therefore, as in many other newly independent countries, US imperialism began to rely upon and bolster the bureaucracy, and especially the military, which became its seat of power through Ayub Khan’s coup in 1958 (p. 1674). So the military is strong not because it has managed to pursue the self-interest of the state to its logical end but because imperialism has too often relied upon it as its seat of power. The same process happened in Latin America. Here ‘imperialism vis-à-vis the labour movement took the form of an armed struggle against “subversives” ’ that is, the left-leaning forces, a broad urban coalition of forces of resistance. This struggle ‘was led by the armed forces of the Latin American state, particularly in Brazil and the southern cone of South America, . . . although financed by and (indirectly) under the strategic command of the United States’ (Veltmeyer and Petras (2015: 172). The labour movement was more or less defeated by the 1970s ‘under the combined weight of state repression and forces generated in the capitalist development process’, thus creating conditions for ‘the resurgence of the Right in the form of a counter-revolutionary political movement and an ideology of free market capitalism’ (ibid.). In the periphery, where, partly thanks to the kind of (‘under-developed’) capitalism it has, there are massive (near-)starvation, mass illiteracy, and enor-mous inequality in the means of consumption of what is required for a decent living. Such a situation promotes what is effectively an undemocratic state in its daily functioning (albeit disguised under democratic clothes). There is indeed a direct association between increasing inequality and increasing authoritarianism of the state in all societies. By virtue of its location in a poverty-stricken class-divided society, where the direct producers also experience enormous caste and gender oppression, and lack basic skills such as literacy, the peripheral state has much authoritarian power, some of which it acquired during colonial times for the purpose of carrying out the orders of the imperialist masters and keeping the ‘natives’ — the majority — in check. This power — the power of the state — is exercised by agents of the post-colonial state: the civil servants (and their political masters). Ordinary masses — the majority — bear the brunt of it.38 Officials’ power comes from their power to intervene on behalf of, and at the behest of, business class people and landlords. Their power, dialectically seen, has another source: their role in relation to the masses. The economic elite uses civil servants as their foot soldiers to keep the masses under control, not only through naked physical and administrative force but also through deception, lies, trickery, mystification, and so on. They have to constantly ‘tell’ people that elections, and not protests/strikes, are a way of showing disapproval of a government and that government offices (e.g. magistrate’s office or a police station or a court) are there basically to help ordinary people, that low-income toilers and rich property owners are all equal in the eyes of the law, that the profit-driven market system benefits everyone, that industrialization is in the interest of all, and so on. They (civil servants) have to work on a day-to-day basis in line with these principles. Coercion, trickery, and the like are not the civil servants’ only role, which gives them power over the masses. In a society where economic and social development is a massive unfulfilled need, having to prostrate before the officials as a means of getting a few crumbs makes officials the semi-kings that they are. A colonial inheritance, this system of paternalistic power relations between civil servants and ordinary people, is one that serves the capitalist system as a whole very well. The undemocratic power of civil servants over the masses in the periphery’s class-society supplements the role of the police and army as well as private armies of rural landlords, private security of urban capitalists, and paramilitary forces and vigilante groups, associated with certain social-cultural organizations, in keeping the masses in check. In fact, given the increasing influence of fascistic ideology on civil servants and police, they can and do look the other way when ordinary people are under physical attack from groups subscribing to that ideology. What we have is a structure of relations among many elements (Figure 11.2): the practice and discourse of the pursuit of quick money and indeed fetishiza- tion of money and money-making at any cost; a system of capitalist production based on a regime of low wages and long hours; the need for the state to play a mediating role in relation to the market relations and (global) capitalism (or imperialism); the need for an undemocratic governance; privatization and cultural devaluation of education; and continuing colonial legacy/mentality. All these elements acting together produce an oppressive structure. More specifically, civil servants as they operate on the ground are one of the most important obstacles to the exercise of democratic rights by ordinary citizens. And civil servants exercising the power of the state as a structure in itself are one of the strongest fortresses around state power vis-à-vis workers, small-scale producers, and aboriginals (Figure 11.2). Excessive coercion can, of course, adversely affect the political legitimacy of the parties in power, and even of the state itself. This is especially the case where the majority cannot meet their basic needs, and class anger is evident everywhere. Thus, the peripheral state, just like the state in the core, is required to balance three processes: (a) accumulation, (b) coercion, and (c) legitimation through material and non-material concessions, the democratic form (e.g. allowing the right to vote) as well as ideological deception (use of naked falsehood and myths, diverting attention of the masses to imaginary enemies, etc.). The actual intervention over a period of time and over space must be seen as a mix of these three, the nature of which depends on the intensity of class struggle both inside and outside the state, as well as on the requirements of accumulation in the hands of the capitalists and large landowners. The state deflects-suppresses class antagonism that inevitably arises out of the accumula-tion imperative which it must support. The state does this not only by means of coercion but also by means of (a) limited material concessions targeting individuals and non-class-based electorally advantageous strata (e.g. certain oppressed groups), (b) deception based on ideologies — ideology of religious or ethnic nationalism (which has nothing to do with, and which is actually friendly towards, imperialism) and ideology of religious or ethnic supremacism; and (c) periodic elections (democratic state form). A secular form of religion for the economically deprived masses, the capacity to exercise the vote at intervals provides them with the illusion that it is they who exercise control over the state and the dominant classes. Not only does this fuel the hope that they gain material benefits from electoral patronage, but it also perpetuates the belief that if not this party/leader then the next one in power will address their problems. The fetishistic worship of capitalist democracy is widely prevalent among the poor and among politicians and scholars.”翻译为中文","output":"此外，在这些国家，正如我们所见，存在一种落后形式的资本主义。这种资本主义形式潜在地破坏了民主行为的基础。当资本主义基于正式征用时，它几乎不利于国家（官员）与公民以及雇主和雇员之间的民主关系。当利润或多或少来自于直接生产者的身体的赤裸裸的榨取（或从他们的财产剥夺）而不是基于每个部门和子部门中系统性技术变革逻辑的劳动时长内劳动生产力的提高时，以及当最基本的需求未被资本或国家满足时，“主权与依赖”之间的关系，或统治者与被统治者之间的关系，倾向于成为一种强制性关系，即使一个人没有通过非经济手段与特定雇主绑定。几个因素如“国民资产阶级的软弱，市政自我管理的传统缺乏……破坏了任何稳定民主政权的基础”（托洛茨基，1940）。所以 “落后国家的政府，即殖民地和半殖民地国家的政府，总的来说呈现出波拿巴主义或半波拿巴主义的特征；它们区别在于，有些试图朝民主方向定位，寻求工人和农民的支持，而另一些则建立接近军事警察独裁的形式。” （托洛茨基，1940） 如果一个外围国家被外国资本主导，国家采取强制手段有了额外的原因。任何对资本的斗争都会邀请来自国家的强制。 “在落后国家，主导角色不是由国民资本而是由外国资本扮演，国民资产阶级在其社会地位上占据的位置远远小于工业发展所对应的。由于外国资本……使本国人口无产阶级化，国民无产阶级很快在国家生活中开始扮演最重要的角色。在这些条件下，国民政府在尝试对抗外国资本的程度上，被迫在更大或更小程度上依靠无产阶级。” 然而， “那些认为不可避免或对自己更有利的与外国资本并肩前行的落后国家政府，会摧毁劳动组织并建立或多或少的极权政权。” （托洛茨基，1940） 帝国主义实际上直接导致外围国家面对反帝国主义斗争时的国家强制性增强。关于巴基斯坦的国家，阿齐姆（2020）指出，帝国主义不能依靠软弱的政治家来遏制其全球和地区关切的异议，因此在冷战和“恐怖战争”的战略竞争中支持了军事政权。巴基斯坦统治阶级担心共产主义者可能将这些起义转变为反霸权政治；因此，就像在许多其他新独立的国家一样，美国帝国主义开始依赖并加强官僚机构，特别是军队，通过艾乌布·汗1958年的政变成为其权力中心（第1674页）。因此，军队之所以强大，不是因为它设法将国家的自身利益推向逻辑终点，而是因为帝国主义太常依赖它作为其权力中心。 在拉丁美洲也发生了相同的过程。这里“帝国主义针对劳工运动采取了与‘反叛分子’进行武装斗争的形式”，即左倾力量，广泛的城市抵抗力量联盟。这场斗争“由拉丁美洲国家的武装力量领导，特别是在巴西和南美洲的南锥体，……虽然由美国资助并（间接地）处于美国的战略指挥之下”（Veltmeyer和Petras（2015：172）。到1970年代，劳工运动在“国家压迫和资本主义发展过程中产生的力量的联合重压下”或多或少被击败，从而为“右翼以反革命政治运动和自由市场资本主义意识形态的形式复兴”创造了条件（同上）。 在外围，部分由于它所拥有的（“不发达的”）资本主义形式，存在大规模（近乎）饥饿、大规模文盲和巨大的生活必需品消费不平等。这种情况促进了实际上是非民主国家的日常运作（尽管伪装在民主外衣下）。事实上，不平等的增加与国家越来越威权的关系在所有社会中都直接相关。由于其位于贫困和阶级分化的社会中，直接生产者还经历巨大的种姓和性别压迫，并缺乏基本技能如识字，外围国家拥有大量的威权权力，其中一些是在殖民时期为了执行帝国主义主子的命令和控制“土著”——大多数人——而获得的。这种权力——国家的权力——被后殖民国家的代理人行使：公务员（及其政治主人）。普通大众——大多数人——承受了它的冲击。 公务员的权力来自于他们代表并应商界人士和地主的要求而干预的能力。辩证地看，他们的权力还有另一个来源：他们与大众的关系。经济精英利用公务员作为其步兵来控制大众，不仅通过赤裸的物理和行政力量，还通过欺骗、谎言、诡计、神秘化等。他们必须不断地告诉人们选举，而不是抗议/罢工，是表达对政府不满的方式，政府办公室（如地方法官办公室或警察局或法院）基本上是为了帮助普通人，低收入劳动者和富有的财产所有者在法律面前一律平等，以利润为导向的市场体系对每个人都有益，工业化符合所有人的利益等。他们（公务员）必须根据这些原则在日常工作中行事。强制、诡计等不是赋予他们对大众掌控力的公务员的唯一角色。在一个经济和社会发展是巨大未满足需求的社会中，不得不在官员面前卑躬屈膝以获取少量馈赠，使得官员成为了他们所扮演的半国王。这种殖民遗产，即官员和普通人之间的家长式权力关系体系，非常好地为整个资本主义体系服务。外围阶级社会中公务员对大众的非民主权力补充了警察和军队以及农村地主的私人军队、城市资本家的私人保安和与某些社会文化组织相关的准军事部队和治安团队的作用，以控制大众。事实上，鉴于法西斯主义意识形态对公务员和警察的影响日益增加，当普通人受到持该意识形态的群体的身体攻击时，他们可以并确实会选择视而不见。 我们拥有的是许多要素之间关系的结构（图11.2）：追求快钱的实践和话语乃至于不惜任何代价的金钱和赚钱的拜金主义；基于低工资和长工时制度的资本主义生产体系；国家在市场关系和（全球）资本主义（或帝国主义）中扮演调解角色的需求；对非民主治理的需求；教育的私有化和文化贬值；以及持续的殖民遗产/心态。所有这些要素的共同作用产生了一个压迫性结构。更具体地说，公务员在实地操作中是对普通公民行使民主权利的最重要障碍之一。而作为结构本身行使国家权力的公务员是围绕国家权力对工人、小规模生产者和土著的最坚固堡垒之一（图11.2）。 过度的强制当然会对执政党的政治合法性产生不利影响，甚至对国家本身产生不利影响。特别是在大多数人无法满足其基本需求，阶级愤怒无处不在的情况下尤其如此。因此，像核心国家的国家一样，外围国家需要平衡三个过程：（a）积累，（b）强制，以及（c）通过物质和非物质让步、民主形式（例如允许投票权）以及意识形态欺骗（使用赤裸的谎言和神话，将大众的注意力转向想象中的敌人等）来合法化。一段时间内和不同空间上的实际干预必须被视为这三者的混合，其性质取决于内外阶级斗争的强度，以及资本家和大地主手中积累的需求。国家转移-压制不可避免地由积累命令引发的阶级对抗。国家不仅通过强制手段，也通过（a）针对个体和非基于阶级的对选举有利的阶层（例如某些被压迫群体）的有限物质让步，（b）基于意识形态的欺骗——宗教或族裔民族主义意识形态（与帝国主义毫无关系，实际上对帝国主义友好）和宗教或族裔优越主义意识形态；以及（c）定期选举（民主国家形式）来实现这一目标。对于经济上剥夺的大众而言，定期行使投票权的能力提供了一种幻觉，即是他们控制着国家和统治阶级。这不仅激发了他们通过选举赞助获得物质利益的希望，而且还延续了这样一种信念，即如果不是这个政党/领导人，那么下一个执政者将解决他们的问题。在穷人和政治家以及学者中普遍存在对资本主义民主的盲目崇拜。"},{"instruction":"Thread Title: Squish Cartoon Coming to Kids WB! Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts.

We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch!

The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support!

Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging.

Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer.

I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites.

The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now.

AdventureAwait: This is the best news! “World of Quest” has that rare mix of epic quests and laugh-out-loud moments. It’s the comeback I didn’t know I was waiting for.

PixelPundit: Super psyched for the return, but also intrigued by how it’ll fit with the rest of the CW4Kids lineup. It’s quite diverse this year. “World of Quest” brings a specific flavor that complements the existing shows. Kudos to whoever’s curating the fall schedule! QuestLoreMaster: As a longtime fan, seeing Quest back feels like rediscovering a lost treasure. The character dynamics, the quirky humor, everything! I’m here for it all.

Write a forum convo about the on screen presentation during the first few months, even the same voices were used","output":"Thread Title: CW4Kids On-Screen Presentation—First Impressions? 📺🎨 PixelPioneer: Just wanted to start a thread on the CW4Kids on-screen look during these first few months. Even though they swapped in a new logo, it feels like they're still leaning heavily into the Kids WB vibe, complete with the same voiceovers. Anyone else feeling the nostalgia or just me? ToonScribe: Definitely getting nostalgic vibes here. The comic book theme they continued from Kids WB is a nice touch, but I was half expecting a complete overhaul. The familiarity is comforting, though, especially with the same voice actors guiding us through transitions and show intros. AnimationAficionado: Yeah, the continuity with the voices is actually a smart move, IMO. It's like a subtle reassurance that even though the branding has changed, the essence of what made Saturday mornings great remains the same. Still, I'm curious when they'll start introducing elements unique to CW4Kids. DigitalDoodler: Agreed on the nostalgia front, but I'm itching for something fresh. The \\"Signed On/Computer\\" concept they rolled out in April is pretty cool, though—a nice blend of the old comic book appeal with a modern, digital twist. Shows they're trying to evolve, at least in presentation. RetroToonFan: Speaking of the \\"Signed On/Computer\\" theme, it's a clever analogy for today's tech-savvy kids. Watching the cursor click on video players or the schedule feels interactive, even if it's just for show. Gives a whole \\"control at your fingertips\\" vibe that's pretty engaging. ComicStripKid: Has anyone noticed the transitions between shows and the use of \\"The Gees\\" and \\"The Owl\\" shorts? They're doing a good job of keeping the energy up, even during commercial breaks. Those shorts are like the perfect palette cleansers. ToonMasterJay: The use of shorts as intermissions is genius. But back to the overall presentation, I think they're walking a fine line between honoring the past (Kids WB) and pushing towards the future (CW4Kids). The real test will be how they evolve from here. Will they keep blending the old with the new, or will a completely fresh identity emerge? NostalgiaKnight: Love how they're handling it so far, but I'm with ToonMasterJay on this. I'm all for a walk down memory lane, but I'm also excited to see what new identity CW4Kids carves out for itself. Hoping for more unique elements as the year progresses. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We appreciate all your feedback and are thrilled to see such engaging discussions about our on-screen presentation. Our aim is to blend nostalgia with innovation, providing a comfortable yet exciting viewing experience. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises—CW4Kids is just getting started!

The series was first introduced in 2003 and was created by the animation studio Petersburg Animation Studio (now known as Riki Group).

This conflict stems from deep-seated beliefs and the human tendency towards in-group bias, where individuals favor those who are like them and are skeptical or even hostile towards those who are not. The challenge of navigating the fine line between promoting one's values and becoming overbearing or authoritarian can be a rich theme in a series or game. Below are a few ways this concept could be incorporated: 1. **Dual Narrative Game or Series:** A story that follows characters from both sides of the political spectrum, offering players or viewers a chance to see the world through different lenses. This narrative could help illustrate how each side justifies its actions, including the urge to control speech and actions, and encourages empathy by showing the complexities and vulnerabilities of characters from both ideologies. Players or viewers could make choices that either bridge the divide or deepen the conflict, promoting reflection on the consequences of each approach. 2. **A World of Balancing Ideologies:** Create a game set in a society where the balance of power between different ideologies constantly shifts. As a leader, the player must navigate these shifts, balancing the desire to advance their own agenda with the need to maintain peace and freedom of speech. This setup could encourage players to think critically about the trade-offs involved in governance and the challenges of protecting individual freedoms while promoting collective harmony. 3. **Simulated Social Media Platform:** A game that simulates running or participating in a social media platform could directly tackle the theme of speech control. Players could experience the challenges of moderating content to prevent harm while avoiding censorship. They would face dilemmas such as dealing with misinformation, hate speech, and radicalization, all while trying to uphold the principle of free speech. This would highlight the nuanced decisions platform administrators and users have to make in real life. 4. **Interactive Morality Tales:** A series of interactive stories or episodes where each installment focuses on a specific incident involving freedom of speech and the urge to control it. For example, one episode might delve into a protest, another could explore a controversial art exhibit, and another might revolve around a school board meeting. The audience would make choices for the characters, seeing firsthand how attempts to control or protect speech can have wide-ranging consequences. 5. **Exploring Historical or Speculative Settings:** Crafting narratives set in different times or speculative futures where the struggle over speech and control played out differently can offer insights into our current dilemmas. By placing these issues in a historical or futuristic setting, creators can strip away some of the contemporary political baggage, allowing audiences to engage with the themes more openly. Incorporating these concepts into a game or series in a nuanced and interesting way requires a deep understanding of political ideologies, empathy for different perspectives, and a commitment to exploring the complexities of human behavior. Such works can prompt reflection, dialogue, and a richer understanding of the delicate balance between advocating for one's beliefs and respecting the freedoms of others."},{"instruction":"could this be a compelling and deep theme for a story?","output":"Yes, the struggle to not overbear and control the speech and actions of others, framed within the context of political or ideological divides, can indeed serve as a compelling and deep theme for a story. This theme taps into several universal aspects of the human experience, including the desire for freedom, the fear of oppression, and the challenge of living in a diverse society with conflicting values. It offers rich ground for exploring character development, moral dilemmas, and the complexities of societal governance. # Why It's Compelling: - **Relatable Conflict:** Nearly everyone has experienced or witnessed attempts to stifle speech or actions in some context, making this theme universally relatable. It speaks to the core of many contemporary debates around free speech, censorship, and political polarization. - **Moral Complexity:** Stories built around this theme can delve into the gray areas of morality, exploring questions like: When does the protection of community values justify limiting individual freedoms? Can attempting to control speech ever be a morally right action? This complexity can make for gripping narrative tension. - **Character Development:** Characters navigating these waters can undergo significant growth, facing internal and external conflicts that challenge their beliefs and actions. Watching a character struggle with the temptation to control others or overcome being silenced themselves can be a powerful narrative journey. - **Relevance:** Given the current global political climate, with rising concerns about free speech, censorship, and ideological echo chambers, a story that addresses these issues can resonate deeply with audiences looking for understanding or solutions. # Exploring the Theme in Depth: To ensure the theme is handled with depth and nuance, consider the following: - **Multiple Perspectives:** Incorporate characters from various points on the political spectrum, with different motivations and backgrounds. This diversity can help prevent the story from presenting a one-sided argument and enriches the narrative by showing the complexity of societal issues. - **Historical and Cultural Context:** Drawing on historical events or cultural studies can ground the story in reality, offering insights into how societies have grappled with these issues in the past or how different cultures handle them. - **Consequences:** Show the real-world impacts of controlling or liberating speech and actions on individuals, communities, and societies. This could involve personal stories of suffering or redemption, as well as broader societal changes. - **Moral Ambiguity:** Avoid clear-cut answers or moralizing, allowing readers or viewers to come to their own conclusions. Presenting dilemmas without easy solutions can engage audiences more deeply, prompting reflection and discussion. In summary, tackling the theme of controlling versus liberating speech and action within the constraints of political or ideological divides offers a fertile ground for storytelling. Done well, it can engage audiences on intellectual, emotional, and ethical levels, making for a compelling and thought-provoking narrative."},{"instruction":"building on this, could it be interesting if the sentence 'I will not be silenced!' isn't always uttered by the 'good' guys?","output":"Yes, flipping the typical narrative so that the phrase \\"I will not be silenced!\\" isn't always uttered by the 'good' guys can add a fascinating layer of complexity to your story. This approach challenges the audience's expectations and forces them to confront their own biases and assumptions about freedom of speech, who deserves it, and under what circumstances. **Why It's Intriguing:** - **Moral Ambiguity:** By having characters who are not clearly morally 'good' insist on their right to speech, the story delves into the nuanced reality that freedom of speech is a universal value, not just one that favors protagonists or morally upright characters. This can provoke audiences to think about the principles that underlie democratic societies, where even those with objectionable, harmful, or divisive views claim the same rights as those with more widely accepted views. - **Complex Characters:** This narrative choice can lead to deeper character development. By giving voice to a variety of characters, including antagonists, with a sincere demand for their right to speak, you create multifaceted, realistic characters. It encourages viewers to consider the motivations, fears, and desires driving these characters, potentially generating empathy or, at least, a deeper understanding of their perspectives. - **Reflecting Reality:** In the real world, the line between 'good' and 'bad' is often blurred, especially in political and ideological conflicts. Everyone believes they are the hero of their own story. By reflecting this complexity, your story becomes more resonant and true to life, providing a more authentic exploration of the themes of speech and silence. - **Challenging Conversations:** This narrative choice opens up space for challenging conversations among audiences. It invites viewers to discuss the limits of free speech, the responsibilities that come with it, and how society should deal with speech that is deemed dangerous or harmful. Rather than providing simple answers, it encourages ongoing dialogue. **Implementing This Idea:** To implement this narrative twist effectively, consider the following: - **Ensure Balanced Representation:** Make sure that the story does not become a platform for promoting harmful ideologies by giving them unchallenged airtime. Balance is key; while controversial characters might claim their right to not be silenced, the storyline should also explore the consequences and counterarguments of their actions and speech. - **Develop Empathy without Endorsement:** You can develop characters in such a way that audiences understand their motives without necessarily agreeing with their actions or viewpoints. This requires careful character development and storytelling to navigate the fine line between explaining and endorsing. - **Contextualize the Conflict:** Provide sufficient backstory and context to explain why characters on all sides of the moral spectrum feel compelled to insist on their right to speech. Understanding their motivations can add depth to the story and prevent it from becoming a simplistic portrayal of 'free speech versus censorship'. - **Explore the Aftermath:** Show the impact of these assertions of the right to speech on the wider community and other characters. This helps to ground the story in reality, showing that actions and words, even in the name of freedom, have consequences that affect others. Incorporating the idea that \\"I will not be silenced!\\" isn't solely the domain of the 'good' guys complicates the narrative in a way that reflects the complexities of real-world issues, making for a more engaging and thought-provoking story."},{"instruction":"building on all outputs, could it also show that there is more to being the 'good guy' that just fighting the 'bad guys'?","output":"Absolutely, expanding upon the theme to show that being the 'good guy' involves more than just opposing the 'bad guys' can add significant depth to your narrative. This approach allows for a richer exploration of morality, ethics, and the often complicated nature of justice and societal harmony. Incorporating this theme can make characters more relatable, the storyline more engaging, and the moral questions posed by the narrative more provocative and reflective of real-life complexities. # Expanding the Theme: - **Moral Complexity and Self-Reflection:** Indicate that being a 'good guy' involves introspection and self-questioning. Characters could face situations where the traditionally 'right' choice has unintended negative consequences, or where they must reconsider their beliefs and strategies. This process of self-reflection and growth can demonstrate that moral righteousness is not static but evolves with understanding and empathy. - **The Impact of Actions on Others:** Emphasize that true heroism involves considering the broader impact of one’s actions on the community and the world at large, not just achieving personal or ideological victories. This could be shown through story arcs where characters strive to find solutions that not only address immediate problems but also consider long-term welfare, highlighting the importance of compromise, diplomacy, and understanding. - **The Complexity of Justice:** Explore the concept that justice is not a one-size-fits-all notion, and what seems like justice to one party can be perceived as oppression by another. This realization can lead characters (and the audience) to understand that 'being good' means striving for a balance that accounts for diverse perspectives and needs, rather than a single, unyielding view of right and wrong. - **Overcoming Inner Demons:** Show that part of being on the 'good' side is battling one's own prejudices, temptations, and weaknesses. Characters might confront personal failings or biases, learning that overcoming these can be as crucial as defeating external foes. This internal journey can add a layer of personal struggle and redemption to the narrative. # Implementing the Theme Effectively: - **Diverse Perspectives:** Include a variety of characters with different backgrounds, beliefs, and values. This diversity can help illustrate that understanding and cooperation across divides are crucial aspects of being a 'good guy.' - **Nuanced Antagonists:** Present antagonists with understandable, perhaps even sympathetic, motives. By showing that 'bad guys' often believe they are doing the right thing, you can underscore that the path to truly being 'good' is fraught with moral ambiguity and hard choices. - **Challenging Situations:** Place characters in difficult scenarios where the easy choice may not be the morally correct one, or where the right action requires personal sacrifice. These situations can test characters’ commitments to their principles, highlighting that being 'good' involves tough decisions. - **Evolution Over Time:** Allow characters and societies within your narrative to evolve, showing that understanding of 'good' and 'bad' can change, and that people can learn from their mistakes. This evolution can demonstrate that being 'good' is an ongoing process, not a fixed state. Through careful crafting of situations, characters, and themes, a narrative can powerfully convey that being the 'good guy' involves complex moral considerations, personal growth, and a commitment to understanding and empathy, far beyond simply opposing a 'bad' force. This approach not only enriches the story but also aligns it more closely with the complexities and nuances of real-life moral and ethical challenges."},{"instruction":"building on all this, could 'If you want a voice, you must silence others' be a good villain quote? And why?","output":"Yes, \\"If you want a voice, you must silence others\\" could be an exceptionally potent villain quote. This quote encapsulates a deeply flawed yet compelling worldview that can add substantial depth to your antagonist's character and motivations. Here’s why it would be effective: # Reflects Zero-Sum Thinking This quote perfectly embodies a zero-sum perspective on power and freedom of expression — the idea that for one to gain, another must lose. It's a philosophy that suggests the world's resources, including the right to be heard, are limited and must be competed for ruthlessly. This kind of thinking is both a realistic reflection of certain ideologies and a clear marker of a mindset that can lead to oppressive, authoritarian, or tyrannical behavior, making it an excellent fit for a villain. # Creates Moral Conflict By adopting a belief that to lift one's voice requires silencing others, the villain sets up a direct conflict with the more nuanced or morally grounded perspectives of other characters, who might believe in mutual respect, the right to free speech, and coexistence of diverse opinions. This quote succinctly sets the stage for a clash of ideals, making it a powerful narrative device. # Challenges the Protagonists A villain who operates under this belief poses a significant challenge to protagonists advocating for freedom, equality, and democracy. It's not just a physical or strategic battle; it’s an ideological war. Protagonists must confront and dismantle this harmful mindset, making their journey more complex and compelling. This quote, representing the antagonist's core belief, adds a layer of psychological depth to the conflict, forcing heroes to counter not only with strength but with persuasive, alternative visions of society. # Encourages Viewer Reflection A powerful villain quote like this can resonate with audiences long after they’ve encountered it, prompting them to reflect on the nature of power, speech, and silence in society. It encourages viewers to question how these dynamics play out in the real world, pushing them to consider the value of every individual's voice and the dangers of silencing dissent. In this way, the quote transcends its role within the narrative, contributing to a broader conversation about freedom, oppression, and justice. # Mirrors Real-World Issues This quote can draw uncomfortable parallels with real-world historical and contemporary issues, where those in power have sought to maintain their status by oppressing dissenting voices. By encapsulating a genuine tactic used by authoritarian regimes and oppressive institutions, the quote adds realism to the villain, grounding their malevolence in believable, real-world strategies and making their defeat more urgent and satisfying. In summary, using \\"If you want a voice, you must silence others\\" as a villain quote can add significant thematic depth, moral complexity, and narrative tension to your story. It sets up a clear ideological battleground, enriches the villain's character, challenges your protagonists in meaningful ways, and engages the audience in critical reflection, making it an excellent choice for a thought-provoking narrative."},{"instruction":"How exactly can at least some of the protagonists prove this quote wrong?","output":"Protagonists can prove the villainous quote \\"If you want a voice, you must silence others\\" wrong through their actions, philosophies, and the outcomes they achieve within the narrative. Their journey can embody and promote principles that contrast sharply with the zero-sum perspective embedded in the quote. Here are ways in which they can effectively counteract and disprove this quote: # 1. Promoting Inclusive Dialogue: The protagonists can emphasize the importance and effectiveness of inclusive dialogue where multiple voices, even dissenting ones, are heard. They could create or protect spaces (whether literal forums or metaphorical platforms) that encourage open discussion and the sharing of diverse perspectives. Through these actions, they demonstrate that silencing is not only unnecessary but detrimental to understanding and progress. # 2. Demonstrating the Strength of Diversity: By assembling a diverse group of allies with varying backgrounds, ideologies, and strengths, the protagonists can illustrate that diversity is a source of strength rather than a weakness to be quashed. This coalition can work together to overcome challenges that none could have faced alone, proving that elevating multiple voices leads to more innovative solutions and stronger communities. # 3. Leading by Example: The protagonists can lead by example, showing that it's possible to assert one's own voice and stance without diminishing others. This might involve acts of bravery that protect the rights of others to speak, or choosing not to retaliate when faced with attempts to silence them. Their moral fortitude in such situations can inspire change in others, creating a ripple effect that dismantles the idea that power comes at the expense of silence. # 4. Achieving Success through Non-oppressive Means: Success is the ultimate proof of concept. If the protagonists can achieve their goals (whether it's toppling an oppressive regime, solving a community crisis, or forging peace between warring factions) through means that elevate and multiply voices rather than silencing them, they effectively disprove the antagonist's belief. Showing tangible benefits—such as a more harmonious society, effective governance, or successful revolution—that come from a non-zero-sum approach undercuts the argument for oppression. # 5. Education and Empathy: The protagonists can focus on educating others and fostering empathy, demonstrating that understanding and compassion can bridge divides and render silencing unnecessary. Through their actions and achievements, they can highlight how fear often underlies the desire to silence, and how education can replace fear with understanding. # 6. Personal Growth and Redemption: Incorporate characters who once believed in the villain’s philosophy but have since learned the value of listening and changing. These redemption arcs not only offer a powerful counter-narrative but also provide a path forward for those who have erred, proving change is possible and beneficial. # 7. Constructive Conflict Resolution: By resolving conflicts in ways that address the concerns of all parties involved, the protagonists can prove that conflict, a natural part of human interaction, doesn't have to lead to suppression or silencing. Showing that disagreements can lead to mutual growth, deeper understanding, and better solutions reinforces the idea that voices should be heard, not stifled. In proving this quote wrong, the protagonists not only win against their antagonist but also champion a worldview that respects, protects, and values all voices. This thematic victory sends a powerful message to the audience about the kind of society and interactions we should strive for—one where everyone has a voice, and no one needs to be silenced for others to be heard."},{"instruction":"Would what you think believe vs what you really believe also be an interesting addition to these themes?","output":"Incorporating the contrast between what characters think they believe versus what they truly believe adds a profound layer of complexity and depth to the overarching themes of voice, power, and morality. This internal conflict can enrich character development, elevate moral quandaries, and enhance narrative engagement. Here’s how this addition can deepen the thematic exploration: # Personal Growth and Self-Discovery This theme facilitates dynamic character arcs, driving personal growth and self-discovery. Characters might start with a firm stance on an issue, influenced by their upbringing, societal norms, or misinformation. As the story unfolds, through trials and exposure to diverse perspectives, they confront their deeper, sometimes subconscious beliefs, leading to transformative growth or internal conflict. # Moral Ambiguity and Complexity Exploring the gap between professed and actual beliefs introduces moral ambiguity into the narrative, challenging both characters and audiences to reflect on their own convictions. It encourages an examination of the sources of our beliefs—whether they stem from genuine understanding and empathy, or from external pressures and prejudices. This theme can prompt viewers or readers to introspect about their own inconsistencies, fostering a more profound engagement with the story. # Enhanced Conflict and Tension The conflict between perceived and authentic beliefs naturally generates tension, both internally within characters and externally in their interactions with others. Characters may face crises of conscience, betrayals, or pivotal moments of choice that dramatically alter their paths. This tension can drive the narrative forward, keeping audiences invested in the characters' journeys and the resolution of their inner and outer conflicts. # Realistic and Relatable Characters By showcasing characters grappling with the disparity between their professed and true beliefs, the story becomes more relatable. Everyone has experienced moments of doubt or realization that their beliefs may not align with their actions or deeper values. This theme can humanize characters, making their struggles more accessible and their growth more satisfying. # Thematic Resonance and Societal Commentary This addition can serve as a compelling commentary on societal issues, such as hypocrisy, social conformity, and the fear of ostracization. It can highlight the courage required to challenge prevailing norms and to align one's actions with one's true beliefs, emphasizing the value of integrity and authenticity. This resonates with broader discussions about societal change, individuality, and the importance of truth. # Building a Bridge to Understanding Exploring the divergence between thought and true belief can pave the way for characters to bridge divides, fostering understanding and empathy among those with opposing views. By recognizing their own complexities and contradictions, characters can learn to appreciate the nuances in others, suggesting that reconciliation and coexistence are possible. Incorporating this theme enriches the narrative, making it not only a story about political or ideological battles but also a deeply human tale of introspection, growth, and understanding. It amplifies the narrative's engagement with the ideas of voice and silence by underscoring the importance of listening—not just to others but to oneself. This thematic depth can create a more emotionally resonant and thought-provoking story, leaving a lasting impact on the audience."},{"instruction":"Write the primary protagonist for this series or game.","output":"# Character Sketch: Dr. Alex Rivera **Background:** Alex Rivera is a dedicated social psychologist in their early thirties, working at a prominent university. Raised in a multicultural environment, Alex has always been fascinated by the dynamics of human beliefs, behaviors, and the complexities of communication. Their upbringing in a politically divided household taught them the value of understanding and dialogue from a young age. Alex's academic career has been marked by a passionate commitment to exploring how societies can bridge ideological divides, but they've often found themselves frustrated by the theoretical nature of their work, yearning for tangible change. **Appearance:** Alex presents an approachable figure, often dressed in smart-casual attire that bridges professional and accessible. They wear glasses, which they frequently gesture with when deep in thought or discussion. Alex's warm smile and attentive eye contact make them a disarming presence, enabling them to connect easily with others. **Personality:** Empathy and curiosity are the cornerstones of Alex's personality. They are a natural listener, genuinely interested in what others have to say, and possess a rare talent for making people feel heard and understood. Despite their academic achievements, Alex exhibits a humble demeanor, always ready to learn and admit when they are wrong. Their optimism about human nature is tempered by a realistic understanding of its complexities and contradictions. **Abilities/Skills:** As a social psychologist, Alex excels in conflict resolution, negotiation, and persuasion. They have an in-depth understanding of group dynamics and communication strategies, which they can creatively apply to various challenges. Alex is also bilingual, a skill that serves them well in diverse environments and contributes to their ability to connect with a wide range of people. **Inner Conflict:** Despite their convictions about dialogue and understanding, Alex struggles with an internal conflict between their theoretical beliefs about human nature's goodness and the cynicism born from witnessing personal and societal failures. This struggle is exacerbated by a significant personal loss that shook their faith in dialogue — their mentor, who was also a close family friend, was silenced for advocating controversial views, leading to their professional and personal downfall. This event planted a seed of doubt in Alex’s mind about the efficacy of their life's work and whether true understanding is possible in a polarized world. **Desired Change:** Alex’s journey begins with a desire to prove that their theoretical models can have real-world impact, to bridge ideological divides, and to honor their mentor’s legacy by succeeding where they fell short. However, they quickly find themselves embroiled in a much larger conflict that forces them to confront their doubts, challenge their beliefs, and ultimately decide what they truly stand for. **Narrative Role:** Alex serves as the emotional and moral compass of the story, guiding the audience through complex themes of belief, expression, and the quest for understanding. Their journey from academic theorist to active peacemaker in a divided society mirrors the larger narrative's exploration of silencing dissenting voices versus promoting inclusive dialogue. As Alex navigates these challenges, they transform, illustrating the power and pitfalls of attempting to live by one's principles in a contentious world. # Plot Synopsis: The story will follow Alex as they are drawn out of their academic cocoon by a sudden surge in societal tensions, fueled by an authoritarian figure's rise to power. Armed with their knowledge and a burning need to make a difference, Alex embarks on a journey that will test their skills, beliefs, and resolve. Along the way, they will gather a diverse group of allies, confront enemies who believe in silencing for control, and face the ultimate test of bridging the very personal divide that has haunted them since their mentor's downfall. Through trials, failures, and triumphs, Alex and their companions will strive to prove that understanding and amplifying multiple voices is not only possible but essential for societal harmony."},{"instruction":"Write a descriptive, fictional, imaginative parody screenplay of Arthur Morgan hosting SNL.

Sadie, you're on dynamite duty.\\" *The camera pans to a cast member (Cecily Strong) dressed as Sadie Adler, who is haphazardly taping sticks of \\"dynamite\\" (clearly just red-painted cardboard tubes) around her waist.* **Sadie (Cecily):** \\"Don't you worry, Arthur. If something needs explodin', I'm your gal.\\" **Arthur Morgan:** (nodding) \\"Now, remember, this is just a rehearsal. No actual explosions.\\" *Sadie looks disappointed but nods.* **Arthur Morgan:** (continuing) \\"Javier, you're with me at the front.

Mid-Season Madness 🐛📚 GreenJelly223: Hey Squish fans! Did you guys hear the news? There’s a Squish cartoon in the works and it’s hitting Kids WB’s mid-season lineup! Can’t wait to see our favorite amoeba make the jump from page to screen! 😄 MicrobeMania: No way, this is awesome! Squish has been one of my favorite graphic novel series for my kids. They’re going to freak out! Have they announced who’s behind the animation or any voice actors yet? AmoebaAmy: OMG, this made my day! I stumbled onto the news on Twitter but wasn’t sure if it was real. I just hope they keep the charm of the comics. The sense of humor in Squish is just right for a cartoon! ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in fall when the new shows premiere, Lyoko is sticking around, Gumball and Craig are back, but won’t be for long, leaving again in January, Also, a user says Skatoony will definitely be back next year, as it has been a summer replacement show since 2018 Thread Title: Fall Premieres are Here! Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support! Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a convo in late April where TL is going away, G&G is coming to 4Kids TV to take its place, Also Kirby is leaving the CW in late May, our currently 24/7 channel exclusive alien is taking its place Thread Title: Late April Shakeup: Tomodachi Life Departing, G&G and Alien Surprise Incoming! 🌌📺 ToonMasterJay: Heads up, team! Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging. Rest assured, “Gloopy and Glitter” and our new extraterrestrial addition are just the beginning of more exciting things to come. Stay tuned and keep watching — adventure is always around the corner!

Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it!

And “Redakai,” that’s going to be interesting. Exciting times! AnimationAficionado: WOW! “Demon Slayer” as “Vampire Hunters” and “Spy X Family” turning into “My Dad the Spy”?

From sequels and reboots to fresh dubs of hit anime, it looks like CW4Kids is aiming to cater to a wide audience this fall. Also, can’t help but wonder how “Code Lyoko” will interact with these new additions. ComicStripKid: “Redakai” and “Pokémon Horizons” will be great for keeping that action-adventure vibe going strong, while “My Dad the Spy” could add a wholesome yet thrilling family dynamic. Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin. Also, super curious about how “Chaotic: Reloaded” plans to evolve the storyline. Either way, this fall is setting up to be game-changing for CW4Kids!

I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites. DigitalScribe: The subtle hints were there with the webpage transition, but seeing “World of Quest” officially back is exciting! The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now.

Well played, CW4Kids, well played. Excited to see where they take the storyline this season! AdventureAwait: This is the best news! “World of Quest” has that rare mix of epic quests and laugh-out-loud moments. It’s the comeback I didn’t know I was waiting for. Really curious to see if they’ll introduce new characters or stick with the classic crew. PixelPundit: Super psyched for the return, but also intrigued by how it’ll fit with the rest of the CW4Kids lineup. It’s quite diverse this year. “World of Quest” brings a specific flavor that complements the existing shows. Kudos to whoever’s curating the fall schedule! QuestLoreMaster: As a longtime fan, seeing Quest back feels like rediscovering a lost treasure. The character dynamics, the quirky humor, everything! I’m here for it all.

The ink hasn’t even dried, and here they are, mixing things up again with new additions and extending the schedule. I’m not complaining, though—it keeps things interesting. AnimationAficionado: Adding “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” into the mix is a masterstroke. Both shows have their unique fanbases and will definitely pull in viewers. Plus, the extra half hour could mean more variety in programming, which is always a win in my book. NostalgiaKnight: Is anyone else thrilled about “World of Quest” making a comeback? That show was a gem that deserved more spotlight. And “Four Eyes!” has that fresh, quirky vibe that could really resonate with the audience. CW4Kids is on a roll here. ToonTalker91: The block extension to 12:30pm is curious. It’s like they’re pacing themselves for a larger strategy, possibly eyeing to dominate the Saturday morning cartoon space even more. More shows mean more diversity in content, and I’m all for that. PixelPundit: As much as I love this news, I wonder how they’ll pace the introduction of “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” within the current lineup. Will other shows get less airtime, or are they planning to overhaul the schedule entirely? Either way, interesting times ahead for CW4Kids.

Write a convo with the only 4 shows guaranteed to be on the block this time in 2026","output":"Thread Title: CW4Kids 2026: The Core Four Shows Guaranteed to Return 🌟📺 ToonSavvy101: Hey CW4Kids fans! Can you believe we're already talking about 2026? Times sure have flown by! I’ve just seen an announcement that only four shows are guaranteed to return to the block by that time. Looks like we’re sticking with \\"Pokémon Horizons: The Series,\\" \\"Code Lyoko,\\" \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\\" and \\"World of Quest.\\" Thoughts on this pared-down core? DigitalAnimatorX: I'm not surprised to see \\"Pokémon Horizons: The Series\\" make the cut. Pokémon has been a pillar for CW4Kids, no matter the season. But trimming down to four indicates a significant strategy shift. I'm all in for \\"Code Lyoko\\" sticking around, though. That show has layers that still captivate. RetroToonFan: Honestly, keeping \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" makes total sense. It's been one of the most original and entertaining additions in recent years. “World of Quest” has its charm and nostalgia factor. But only four shows? Sounds like they're making room for something big or changing their approach. PixelPundit: It’s a mixed bag for me. On one hand, I appreciate the focus on these shows, suggesting more consistent storytelling and perhaps deeper development. On the other, the diversity and range of toons will surely be missed. Hope they have plans to introduce compelling new content to fill the gaps. AnimationAficionado: \\"Code Lyoko\\" is the one I'm most excited about; its unique blend of virtual reality and real-life drama set it apart. But yeah, this core four setup has me curious about what CW4Kids’ long game is. Maybe they're aiming for quality over quantity, or perhaps they're gearing up for a major revamp with fresh, innovative shows? NostalgiaKnight: While I am a bit wistful about what might be leaving our screens, there’s something to be said about having these four powerhouses leading the way into 2026. It cements their status as fan favorites and integral to the CW4Kids identity. I just hope they pair these veterans with some groundbreaking new series to keep the block vibrant. ToonTalker91: The focus on these four does offer a certain level of stability, which might be exactly what they're aiming for amidst all the industry changes. Yet, CW4Kids has always been about variety. Let’s hope this is a strategic move to bolster their lineup with something fresh and unexpected down the line. QuestFanatic88: \\"World of Quest\\" getting another guaranteed run?! Yes, please! It’s such an underrated show with so much potential. As for the strategy, focusing on these four titans could be genius if they manage to weave in new toons that complement and expand the CW4Kids universe. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We're thrilled for the continued journey with \\"Pokémon Horizons: The Series,\\" \\"Code Lyoko,\\" \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,\\" and \\"World of Quest\\" into 2026 and beyond. Rest assured, our commitment to bringing engaging, innovative, and diverse programming to CW4Kids remains stronger than ever. Stay tuned for what's next – we’ve got surprises in store that we can’t wait to share with you!

I've got to admit, it's got me a bit worried about the future of GoGoRiki on CW4Kids. RetroToonFan: Noticed that too, @PixelPundit. It's like all of a sudden, there's this shift. Don't get me wrong, \\"World of Quest\\" is fantastic, but GoGoRiki has its own unique charm and humor that’s hard to replicate. It'd be a real shame to see it pushed aside or, worse, phased out. ToonSavvy101: It’s a tricky balance for a block like CW4Kids, trying to keep the content fresh while staying true to what the audience loves. Maybe they’re experimenting with screen time allocation, seeing who draws in more viewers? But I agree, GoGoRiki deserves to maintain its presence. It adds a distinctive flair to the mix. DigitalAnimatorX: I’m trying to remain optimistic here. Maybe it’s not as much “Nestor over Pogoriki” as it is just giving “World of Quest” some well-deserved limelight. Hopefully, CW4Kids finds a way to balance both effectively. After all, variety is what makes this block so special. AnimationAficionado: There's a point to be made about audience dynamics possibly changing. However, part of CW4Kids’ appeal is its ability to juggle diverse shows like GoGoRiki. I can’t help but worry though—if they sideline shows based on perceived popularity cliffs, we might lose the essence of what makes the block eclectic and entertaining. NostalgiaKnight: Definitely concerning to see one of the quirky staples like GoGoRiki possibly getting less attention. It serves up a different kind of storytelling, which is refreshing. The ideal scenario? CW4Kids leverages both “World of Quest” and GoGoRiki to cater to different tastes within their audience, without having to choose one over the other. ToonTalker91: Let’s not jump to conclusions. CW4Kids has always been good at rotating focus to keep content engaging. It might just be Pogoriki and Co.’s turn to take a backseat temporarily. Still, it's valid to express concerns; hopefully, the admins take notice and ensure GoGoRiki doesn't get overshadowed in the long term. QuestFanatic88: \\"World of Quest\\" and GoGoRiki both add incredible value to the lineup—each in their unique way. It’s crucial they find a happy medium. While Nestor’s adventures are compelling, the GoGoRiki gang offers that comedic relief that’s equally indispensable. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We appreciate your concerns and insights on the balance between “World of Quest” and GoGoRiki. Rest assured, we’re committed to delivering a diverse and engaging lineup that encompasses the broad spectrum of interests within our audience, including the continued presence of GoGoRiki. Stay tuned for future announcements and thanks for your passionate engagement with CW4Kids programming!

Classes like Berserker (Axes), Swordfighter (Swords), and Archer (Long Range and Spears) emphasize the importance of matching class types with appropriate weapon choices for optimal performance. 2. **Role Specializations:** Classes are tailored toward specific roles in a party—Berserkers for raw damage, Shielders for defense, Assassins for high-damage output on singular targets, and Priests for healing and support. 3. **Growth Trends:** Each class has unique growth rate patterns emphasizing their role (e.g., Berserkers with high STR growth for damage, Shielders with high DEF growth for tanking). 4. **Skill Themes:** Skills are thematic and reflect the class's focus. For example, Berserkers have skills that revolve around high damage and self-harm for greater power, while Priests focus on healing and protective spells. 5. **Utility Skills:** Some classes have utility skills aimed at increasing mobility (e.g., Lunge for Berserkers, Withdrawal for Archers) or providing strategic advantages (e.g., Taunt for Shielders). 6. **Status Effects:** Many classes can inflict or manipulate status effects, such as Stunned, Silenced, or Debilitated, showcasing an emphasis on strategy beyond mere damage. # Suggested Skill Additions: To fill gaps, consider the following suggestions based on observed patterns: 1. **Enhanced Mobility Skills for Heavy Classes:** Classes with lower AGI could benefit from skills that temporarily boost their movement or allow them to engage/disengage effectively, such as a Charge skill for Berserkers or a Tactical Retreat skill for Gunners. 2. **Strategic Skills for Casters:** Provide Witch/Warlock and Sage classes with spells that manipulate the battlefield, such as creating temporary obstacles or areas that either boost allies or debuff enemies. 3. **Combo Skills:** Skills that trigger additional effects when used in conjunction with another class's abilities, promoting teamwork. For example, a combo skill between Assassins and Swordfighters where a pre-marked target by an Assassin receives extra damage from Swordfighter attacks. 4. **Buff/Debuff Removal or Transfer:** Especially for support and caster classes (Priest, Prophet), skills that remove or transfer debuffs from allies to enemies could add a strategic layer to battles. 5. **Area Control Skills:** For classes like the Ninja or the Trickster, add skills that affect large areas, such as traps or smoke screens that obscure vision, reducing enemy accuracy for a turn. 6. **Elemental Manipulation for Casters:** Expand on the elemental spells for Gentle Fist, Witch/Warlock, and other mage-type classes with more diverse elemental control, such as weather manipulation spells that affect the entire battlefield. 7. **Passive Skills for Non-Casters:** Introduce passive skills that provide ongoing benefits or that activate under certain conditions, such as a Swordfighter's passive that increases evasion after a successful parry or block. 8. **Synergy Skills for Hybrid Classes:** For classes like the Hunter (Long Range and Axes), include skills that capitalize on their hybrid nature, such as a skill that switches between ranged and melee combat modes, adjusting stats accordingly. 9. **Defensive Skills for Less Tanky Classes:** Offer squishier classes like the Assassin or Archer defensive maneuvers or escape tactics like smoke bombs or backflip shots that increase distance between them and their pursuer. 10. **Skill Chains:** Develop a chain of actions where completing one skill successfully unlocks a more powerful follow-up skill for the next turn, adding depth and planning to combat scenarios. By incorporating these suggestions, you can address existing gaps and add further depth and strategic variety to the RPG classes, enriching the gameplay experience."},{"instruction":"Have you noticed that each class gets a \\"chance roll\\" ability for free (such as \\"# Outrage All basic attacks have a chance to do 1.5x more damage.

This world, shrouded in mists of iridescent colors, harbors a secret marvel of the cosmos: the Gelloids, a species of tentacled, pink, gelatinous aliens, unlike anything else known to the universe. Among these extraordinary beings, there was one who would unwittingly embark on an adventure that would intertwine the destinies of multiple worlds. His name was Oozar. Oozar was unlike the other Gelloids. Born with a radiant, almost luminescent shade of pink and an insatiable curiosity about the world beyond his own, he often found himself at odds with his kin, who preferred the serene and predictable rhythms of Gloraxon V. Oozar's heart yearned for adventure, and his mind buzzed with countless questions about the stars that speckled the night sky above his home. One fateful evening, as Gloraxon V’s twin moons bathed the planet in a gentle, silver glow, a strange object plummeted from the heavens and crashed into the Glowing Forest, a vast, bioluminescent jungle that stretched across the horizon. The impact sent vibrations through the ground that rippled across the planet. Seizing his destiny, Oozar propelled his gelatinous body towards the site, driven by an unquenchable thirst for knowledge and discovery. As he arrived at the edge of the crater, Oozar beheld a sight that would forever change his life: a spacecraft, unlike any technology his species had ever developed. Its sleek, metallic body reflected the moonlight, creating an ethereal scene amidst the glowing flora and fauna. Tentatively, Oozar extended a tentacle to touch the craft, only for a panel to slide open, revealing a figure clad in a spacesuit. The astronaut, a human from a distant planet called Earth, named Lin, was on an exploratory mission when her ship malfunctioned and crashed. Despite the language barrier and their vastly different appearances, a bond formed between Oozar and Lin, born out of shared curiosity and a mutual desire to understand the other’s world. Using the ship’s technology, they overcame communicative hurdles, learning each other’s languages and cultures. In the weeks that followed, Lin taught Oozar about Earth and its wonders, while Oozar shared the secrets of Gloraxon V. However, their exchange went beyond mere knowledge. They taught each other about the power of empathy, the strength found in diversity, and the importance of looking beyond outer appearances. As Lin worked on repairing her spacecraft, a new threat emerged. A malevolent force from a neighboring system had set its sights on Gloraxon V, drawn by the unique energies emitted by the planet. United by their newfound friendship, Oozar and Lin concocted a plan to save Oozar's home, utilizing his knowledge of the planet's terrain and Lin’s technological prowess. Together, they set up a network of mirrors throughout the Glowing Forest, aiming to amplify the bioluminescent light into a powerful beam. When the invaders arrived, intent on conquest, they were met with a blinding radiance that disoriented them, leaving their ships vulnerable. Utilizing the element of surprise, Lin launched a counteroffensive from her now-repaired spacecraft, driving the invaders away and saving Gloraxon V. In the aftermath, as Lin prepared to return to Earth, the goodbye was bittersweet. Oozar and Lin knew that their paths might never cross again, yet they were forever changed by their encounter. They had not only forged an unbreakable bond but also proved that unity and understanding could transcend the vastness of space and the differences between species. Oozar returned to his people, no longer the outcast curious about the stars but a hero who had defended his planet from alien invaders. He shared the tale of his friendship with Lin and the lessons it taught him, inspiring generations of Gelloids to look up at the stars not with fear, but with wonder and hope. And far across the galaxy, on a small, blue planet, Lin shared her incredible story, too, spreading the message that in the vast, unknown reaches of space, friendship and bravery know no bounds."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

On the one hand, it dissolves exploited classes into (juridical) individuals, and — further — into voting individuals (individual voters), who are then re-aggregated into various non-class groups on the basis of well-cultivated non-class identities. Electoral success needs numbers. By giving opportunities for full expression to religious, indigenous, racist, casteist, ethnic, and regional identities, the democratic form of the state fragments the exploited classes into members of electoral groups (or, vote banks), and into supporters of this or that party (or fractions thereof). Deliberately ignored are their class position and interests. This process weakens the power and agency of common people as classes. Given the inability of the crisis-prone capitalist system to meet the needs of people, the politics of identity from the top (i.e. politics of identity of the majority community) are deployed by the fascistic forces as foot soldiers of reactionary capitalism. Currently, democracy has enabled the landowning class and elements of the bourgeois class to ‘capture’ specific parts of the state through liberal democratic elections. In parts of the periphery, therefore, proprietors are still able to compel the poor to vote as the politicians of the exploiting classes would like them to. Through their control over specific parts of the state — especially at the local/regional level — property owners appropriate the resources allocated by the state to the poor. On the other hand, by ensuring a limited degree of free association and speech, and through electoral procedures and the ‘rule of law’, the state in its democratic form has indeed allowed rural and urban workers (who form the majority of the population) to voice some opposition to political domination. Within limits, they are permitted to exert pressure on the capitalist state to create conditions for an egalitarian development pattern. The democratic state form has allowed competition between political parties, including the parties of the Left,39 and this has contributed in varying degrees to the politicization of lower classes (as voters) and to the limited implementation of policies on their behalf. Yet the liberal democratic state form itself is a barrier to class politics from below in the periphery as well as the core. 7 Class contradictions of development and threat to peripheral state’s legitimacy From the standpoint of exploited classes, the colonial state did not discharge a developmental role; in part, therefore, the post-colonial state gained a degree of ideological legitimation from its promise to foster economic development, a break with the approach of the colonial state. About this Partha Chatterjee (1993: 203) observes: The new state represented the only legitimate form of the exercise of power because it was a necessary condition for the development of the nation . . . (it) acquired its representativeness by directing a program of economic development on behalf of the nation. Like the colonial state, however, the current neoliberal post-colonial state is not fulfilling a developmental role. Hence the development process no longer discharges for the state the legitimizing role to the same extent it did earlier, in the more optimistic decades following Independence.40 This is certainly true of the way the state is ‘seen’ by ‘those below’ in those areas where there exist very strong radical militant organizations of the rural poor (e.g. the Maoist movement in Asia). There the relative paucity of spending by the neoliberal state on anti-poverty policies — a process termed as ‘the selective retreat of the state’ — has indeed eroded its legitimacy in the eyes of the vast majority of the rural population in terms of promoting development. For lower classes, therefore, the state is not perceived as a ‘caring’ state to the same extent it was earlier, both materially and discursively. Of additional relevance is that the ideological illegitimacy of the colonial state derived from its being ‘other’ economically: that is, it was seen as serving the external (‘foreign’) interests in furtherance of which it licensed the exploitation of workers and peasants. The ideological legitimacy of the post-independence state, and a central emplacement of the nationalist discourse, emanated from the fact that it would be independent of an international capitalism. Hence the legitimacy of the state, say in India, ‘had to flow from the nationalistic criticism of colonialism as an alien and unrepresentative power’ and from the expectation that ‘an independent state . . . would promote national development1 as ‘the historical necessity’ (Chatterjee, 1993: 205; italics added).41 But what is the post-colonial state doing? It is prostrating itself before the imperialism of the IMF, the World Bank, MNCs, and international ‘aid’ agencies. This is an imperialism that is justified and sold to ordinary people through the discourse of development and progress. The post-colonial neoliberal state itself has become a mechanism of new imperialism. The point is that now, as during colonial times, the state, as mentioned earlier, is creating the conditions for the transfer of profits to the foreign capital: indeed, the neoliberal state is actively encouraging international capital to exploit its own lower classes, a process in which domestic capitalists — urban and rural — are invited to participate. The nationalistic dream — the idea that there is a nation and what the state does is good for the nation — may be on the way out. Hence, there is a new national question for the masses: how to transcend the ongoing impact of imperialism which is predominantly practised through economic mechanisms and ultimately backed up by the threat of force?42 If the concept of nation has any significance, it must, first of all, be the ‘nation’ of workers and small-scale producers, yet the neoliberal-capitalist peripheral state is increasingly alienating itself from this ‘nation’. And this is why, and given that the ‘collaboration’ of the peripheral ruling class with imperialism makes anti-imperialist nationalism an empty slogan, there is a need on the part of the ruling classes of the periphery to construct an alternative nation (and nationalism), one that is based on religious, racial, and ethnic identity. This strategy creates phoney internal enemies of the fake nation (the enemies being the religious and racialized minorities, people defending democratic rights and communists/Marxists). As a result, the real nation, the nation of workers and small-scale producers exploited by the ruling classes and subjugated by imperi-alism, is divided and weakened, and it fails to concentrate on the real enemies of the nation (i.e. capitalists, large-scale landowners, and imperialist forces). But this strategy of encouraging fascistic divisive tendencies however can contribute to delegitimization of (the democratic form of) the state. Another contributory factor in this delegitimization process is that action by the neoliberal state is perceived to lack rationality. The colonial state was exporting food to the UK when in the colonies the population did not have sufficient food to eat. In a similar vein, the neoliberal state is now seen as irrational in promoting the production of luxury commodities (such as flowers, shrimps, and animal feed) or minerals and energy for export to imperialist/ rich countries, when millions are malnourished/hungry at home and/or are without regular supply of energy and other industrially produced necessaries throughout the year. The state is under pressure from nationally operating and multi-national agribusiness to crush small-scale producers, which has been prompting mass protests. The state-promoted export of these commodities is itself based on cheap labour and cheap land. ‘Cheap’, however, hides the ecological and social conditions under which these commodities are produced by peasants and workers. Cheapness is not a characteristic innate to a country in the periphery, either to the (tattered) bodies of its workforce or to its (degraded) nature, both of which are deployed by neoliberal capitalist accumulation. The perceived difference between the colonial state and its post-colonial counterpart — a crucial ideological one — thus no longer holds.43 This is because the state is no longer able to sustain even the fiction of carrying out policies designed to benefit large swathes of the polity — the ‘people’ who form ‘the nation’, in other words. The failure is more drastic with the turn to neoliberalism and to right-wing politics associated with the rise of right-wing parties (e.g. Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party or National People’s Party and Bolsanaro’s Social Liberal Party of Brazil). In fact, the neoliberal state form and state intervention (the state’s relative withdrawal from welfare provision and a certain degree of control over the business class) were justified on the basis that the neoliberal state is good for the masses, but this has turned out to be a lie. Neoliberalization has hurt the masses, including by dispossessing them of their small-scale property, so the neoliberal form of the state does not have the legitimacy in the minds of the ordinary people.44 Apart from the differences/contradictions between the colonial state and the post-colonial state, there are important differences/contradictions between the pre-neoliberal state and the neoliberal state. While the personnel of the state before the onset of neoliberalism, often drawn from lower strata of society (e.g. petty-bourgeois strata), maintained some distance between them and the capitalist class, now the personnel of the state revel in their connections with, and take pride from their work for, the business class. The social legitimacy of the state clearly is at stake because the state, at least, has to give the appearance that it is neutral, that it is for everyone, for all classes. But maintaining such an appearance is difficult because of a distinctive change in the class character of the personnel of the state. Prabhat Patnaik (2010) eloquently describes this pre-neoliberal process: ‘The State was a bourgeois State, laying the foundations for capitalist development. But the motivation, the ideological inclinations, and the class background of the State personnel ensured that the State had a degree of autonomy both vis-à-vis imperialism and also vis-à-vis the domestic capitalists’.45 This autonomy was there in the sense that state actors, drawn from the ranks of the petty-bourgeoisie, ‘were generally skeptical about, and even to a degree hostile to, the capitalist class and were committed to State capitalism which they also saw as a means of self-advancement in the new situation of de-colonization’ (ibid.). However, something has changed with the turn to neoliberalism. Patnaik (2010) explains:”翻译为中文","output":"民主国家形式也影响了阶级斗争本身的形态。一方面，它将被剥削阶级分解为（法律上的）个体，进一步地，分解为投票个体（选民），然后基于精心培育的非阶级身份，将他们重新聚合为各种非阶级群体。选举成功需要数字。通过充分表达宗教、土著、种族主义、种姓、种族和地区身份，民主形式的国家将被剥削阶级分割为选举团体的成员（或者说，投票银行），以及支持这个或那个党派（或其派系）的支持者。蓄意忽视他们的阶级地位和利益。这一过程削弱了普通人作为阶级的权力和代理性。考虑到危机重重的资本主义系统无法满足人民的需求，身份政治从上层（即多数群体的身份政治）被反动资本主义的法西斯力量当作步兵部署。当前，民主使得土地所有者阶级和资产阶级的元素通过自由民主选举“捕获”了国家的特定部分。因此，在边缘地区，所有者仍然能够强迫穷人按照剥削阶级政治家的意愿投票。通过对国家的特定部分——尤其是在地方/区域一级——的控制，财产所有者占有了国家分配给穷人的资源。另一方面，通过保证一定程度的自由结社和言论自由，以及通过选举程序和“法治”，民主形式的国家确实允许农村和城市工人（占多数人口）对政治统治发出一些反对声音。在限度内，他们被允许对资本主义国家施加压力，以创造平等发展模式的条件。民主国家形式确实允许政治党派之间的竞争，包括左翼党派，这在不同程度上有助于低下阶层的政治化（作为选民）并为他们实施了有限的政策。然而，自由民主国家形式本身是阻碍边缘地区以及核心地区的下层阶级政治的障碍。 从被剥削阶级的立场来看，殖民国家并没有承担发展角色；因此，部分原因是，后殖民国家因其承诺促进经济发展，打破殖民国家的做法，而获得了一定程度的意识形态合法性。帕塔•查特吉（Partha Chatterjee，1993：203）观察到： 新的国家代表了权力行使的唯一合法形式，因为它是国家发展的必要条件……（它）通过代表国家指导经济发展计划而获得了其代表性。 然而，像殖民国家一样，当前的新自由主义后殖民国家也未能发挥发展作用。因此，发展过程不再像独立后的乐观几十年那样，以同样的程度为国家提供合法性。在亚洲存在着强大的激进农村穷人组织（例如毛派运动）的地区，这一点尤为正确。新自由主义国家在反贫困政策上的支出相对减少——一个被称为“国家有选择性撤退”的过程——的确削弱了大多数农村人口在促进发展方面的合法性。因此，对于下层阶级来说，国家不再像以前那样被视为一个“关怀”的国家，无论是物质上还是话语上。 殖民国家的意识形态非正当性来自于它在经济上是“他者”：也就是说，它被视为服务于外部（“外国”）利益，并为此授权剥削工人和农民。独立后国家的意识形态合法性，以及民族主义话语的中心位置，源于它将独立于国际资本主义。因此，比如在印度，国家的合法性“必须源于对殖民主义作为一种外来和不代表性力量的民族主义批评”，以及从期待“一个独立的国家……会促进国家发展”作为“历史必然性”（Chatterjee, 1993: 205；斜体）。但后殖民国家在做什么呢？它在国际货币基金组织、世界银行、跨国公司和国际“援助”机构的帝国主义面前卑躬屈膝。这是一种通过发展和进步的话语向普通人民辩解和推销的帝国主义。后殖民新自由主义国家本身已经成为新帝国主义的机制。关键是，现在，就像殖民时期一样，国家正在创造条件，将利润转移到外国资本：事实上，新自由主义国家正积极鼓励国际资本剥削其本国较低阶层，这一过程邀请了国内资本家——城市和农村——参与。民族主义梦想——即存在一个民族和国家所做的一切都是为了民族利益的想法——可能正在消失。因此，对大众来说，有一个新的民族问题：如何超越主要通过经济机制实践且最终由武力威胁支撑的正在进行的帝国主义影响？ 如果民族概念有任何意义，它必须首先是工人和小规模生产者的“民族”，但新自由主义-资本主义的边缘国家越来越与这个“民族”疏远。这就是为什么，鉴于边缘统治阶级与帝国主义的“合作”使得反帝民族主义成为一个空洞的口号，边缘统治阶级需要构建一个基于宗教、种族和种族身份的另类民族（和民族主义）。这种策略创造了假民族的假内部敌人（这些敌人是宗教和种族化的少数群体，捍卫民主权利的人和共产主义者/马克思主义者）。这样一来，真正的民族，被统治阶级剥削、被帝国主义征服的工人和小规模生产者的民族，就被分裂和削弱了，它没能集中注意力于民族的真正敌人（即资本家、大地主和帝国主义力量）。但是，这种鼓励法西斯主义的分裂倾向的策略确实有助于（民主形式的）国家的非正当性。 加剧这种非正当性过程的另一个因素是，据认为新自由主义国家的行动缺乏合理性。殖民国家在殖民地人口没有足够食物吃的时候向英国出口食物。类似地，新自由主义国家现在被视为在促进生产奢侈品（如花卉、虾和动物饲料）或矿物和能源出口到帝国主义/富裕国家时是不理性的，当数百万人在家中营养不良/饥饿和/或全年没有能源和其他工业生产必需品的定期供应时。国家在压制小规模生产者方面受到国内运营和跨国农业公司的压力，这已经引发了大规模抗议。国家促进这些商品出口本身是基于廉价劳动力和廉价土地。然而，“廉价”隐藏了这些商品由农民和工人在何种生态和社会条件下生产的事实。廉价不是边缘国家的一个固有特征，无论是对其（破旧的）劳动力还是对其（退化的）自然环境，两者都被新自由主义资本积累所利用。 因此，殖民国家与其后殖民对应物之间的感知差异——一个关键的意识形态差异——不再成立。这是因为国家不再能够维持即使是实施旨在惠及广大政体——换句话说，“民族”的人民的政策的幌子。随着转向新自由主义和与右翼政党崛起有关的右翼政治的转变（例如，莫迪的印度人民党或国家人民党和博尔索纳罗的巴西社会自由党）而变得更加严重。事实上，新自由主义国家形式和国家干预（国家在一定程度上从福利提供撤退和对商业阶级的某种控制）被证明是基于新自由主义国家对大众有利的假设，但这已被证明是谎言。新自由主义伤害了大众，包括剥夺他们的小规模财产，因此新自由主义国家形式在普通人民心目中没有合法性。 殖民国家与后殖民国家之间的差异/矛盾，以及新自由主义国家与新自由主义国家之前的国家之间的重要差异/矛盾。尽管国家人员在新自由主义到来之前，常常来自社会的较低阶层（例如，小资产阶级阶层），在他们与资本家阶级之间保持了一定的距离，但现在，国家人员在与商业阶级的联系中感到兴奋，并以他们为商业阶级工作感到自豪。国家的社会合法性显然岌岌可危，因为国家至少必须给人以它是中立的、是为所有人、所有阶级服务的印象。但由于国家人员的阶级性质发生了显著变化，维持这种印象变得困难。普拉巴特·帕特奈克（Prabhat Patnaik）（2010）生动地描述了这一新自由主义之前的过程：“国家是一个资产阶级国家，为资本主义发展奠定了基础。但国家人员的动机、意识形态倾向和阶级背景确保了国家在一定程度上既对帝国主义也对国内资本家具有自主性”。这种自主性在于，国家行动者，来自小资产阶阶层的行列，\\"通常对资本家阶级持怀疑态度，甚至在一定程度上敌视资本家阶级，并且致力于国家资本主义，他们还将其视为去殖民化新形势下的自我提升手段\\"（同上）。然而，随着转向新自由主义，情况发生了变化。帕特奈克（2010）解释说："},{"instruction":"请将“The ‘neo-liberal State’ too is a bourgeois State like the dirigiste State, but the personnel of the former differ fundamentally from the personnel of the latter, not just in their ideological predilections, which are closely aligned to the views of the Bretton Woods institutions, but also in their being deeply enmeshed with the world of finance and big business. Therefore, What we find in today’s State personnel is not just a different set of ideologues, World Bank ideologues, as distinct from the Nehruvian [i.e. secular bourgeois-nationalist] ideologues that manned the dirigiste bourgeois State, but a set whose motivation is no different from that of the big bourgeoisie and financial interests and which therefore has no compunctions about being closely integrated with the latter. More specifically: The personnel of the neo-liberal State have little interest in running the public sector, which is one reason why the public sector becomes financially unviable over time, and provides grist to the mill of those who want it privatized. Even normal government functions are not carried out by the bureaucracy, which is more interested in networking with patrons in the world of corporates and foreign donors, or in attending World Bank- sponsored training programmes, than in the nitty-gritty of administration. More and more government functions as a result are ‘outsourced’ to private agencies, which promises profits for all. (Patnaik, 2010) Partly as a result of this change in the personnel and in the mode of functioning of the state, there has been an ‘undermining of the social legitimacy of the State’, and this is happening ‘especially in the context of the tremendous increase in wealth and income inequalities associated with the pursuit of the neo-liberal strategy’ (Patnaik, 2010). Whether all these structural conditions will actually result in a legitimation crisis, and to what extent, will, of course, depend on how the lower classes and their political parties and their organic intellectuals at home and internationally respond to these conditions politically. And to the degree that the crisis does take shape, much also will depend on how the state reacts, in particular its resort to coercive power at its disposal with the help of its imperialist mentors, and in turn how lower classes respond to this. 8 Summary, and theoretical and political implications The main aim of this book has been to explicitly re-assert the class character of the state. The main aim of this chapter has been to explicitly re-assert the class character of the state in the periphery. The periphery is characterized by the combined coexistence of different modes of production under the dominance of capitalism and is under the impact of imperialism. So there is a greater number of classes and fractions than in the centre. This complicated class structure shapes the state. Class relations and the attendant material conditions — including imperialism — constitute the most important context for all forms of intervention by the state and for the very form (territorial and political form) of the state itself. Of course, within this class context other social relations — that is, those of caste, religion, ethnicity, region, and nation — operate and influence the state and its class character. Because capitalism is the dominant mode of production in a typical peripheral country, the state is a capitalist state, and thus an agent of capitalist development, even if small-scale producers have a massive presence in the periphery. This is the case both in pre-neoliberal and neoliberal times and both in rural areas and city-regions. The relation of partnership between the two arms of the capitalist class relation — the state and the capitalist class — has been justified in terms of two major ideologies. One is of state control and socialism (many states such as India and Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Nicaragua, and so on originally, were called socialist, or they have had references to socialism in their constitution). Another is one of free market. The ideology of state control over the business world in the early years of the post-independence period was not entirely a lie. There was a degree of state control. There was a degree of state intervention on behalf of the masses. Even the ruling class understood from the very beginning that a small degree of state control and a small degree of propoor re-distribution is a remedy to potential social upheaval against all forms of private property or against the danger of anti-feudal and anti-imperialist struggle growing over into anti-capitalist class relations. In the neoliberal times, the ideology of free market has justified serious intervention in the interest of capital and enabled by a change in the personnel. It is however important not to over-emphasize this change in personnel. It is the capitalist class character of neoliberalism that has led to the state being managed by bourgeois personnel (people who either include members of the bourgeoisie or who are shaped by bourgeois ideas and aspirations), and that in turn is responsible for the ongoing reproduction of the capitalist-neoliberal order. The state has always worked, more or less, in the interest of the capitalist class. Its policies (as well its liberal democratic form where it exists) have been accordingly influenced by the interests/actions of the dominant classes, although they have also been, to some extent, shaped by the actuality/possibil- ity of class struggle from below. Like any capitalist state, the peripheral state must sustain the myth that capi-talist accumulation (which goes by the name of ‘growth’) benefits not only the already-better-off entrepreneurs but also the poor. The myth needed is that the exploiters (misnamed as employers, wealth creators, and so on) and the exploited benefit from the same process. The legitimacy of the post-colonial state derived in no small measure from two assumptions: that, unlike colonial government which served ‘foreign’ interests, it would serve domestic ones; and that, to this end, it would promote economic development from which the nation as a whole would benefit. Increasingly, however, the distinction between the colonial and post-colonial development projects is being eroded, as the neoliberal state not only facilitates the dispossession and exploitation of the poor by international and domestic capital. Farm crops are once again being seen to be produced mainly for an elite (= ‘foreign’) market, much as they were during the colonial era. This can contribute to the broader process of delegitimizing the development state, a situation which in turn intensifies class struggle ‘from below’, and the repressive ‘from above’ response by the neoliberal state protecting the interests of the capitalist class. The periphery should not be merely seen as having less income. It should be seen in terms of its class-capitalist character. To say that the peripheral social formation is decidedly capitalist has a different political implication, including for the relation between lower classes and the state, than the contrary view which is that (a) the social formation is not dominantly capitalist or that it is capitalist in limited ways and (b) obstacles to capitalist development are in pre- or non-capitalist relations. Implicit are two ideas here. One is that the capitalist class relation is everywhere and all times associated with higher level of development of productive forces. Another is that the obstacles to capitalist development are not in capitalism as a class relation as such and can be removed by forces other than those that seek to abolish capitalism. That is, a democratic state operating within the logic of capitalist relations can remove these barriers and promote a nicer form of capitalism, independent from capitalism. If a peripheral country is dominantly semi-feudal or if it is not capitalist enough, then the radical strategy is one that is to be directed against semifeudal landlords or at the creation of advanced capitalism somehow. This strategy licenses a long and indefinite wait for the fight for socialism (= abolition of class relations) to start and requires collaboration with some good (progressive = anti-feudal, nationalistic, democratic, and so on) capitalists. But if what is present is already capitalism, albeit one that is not very progressive,46 and one that is not going to be very progressive for a long period of time because of all the constraints on the transition to RSL within the contemporary imperialist world market, and if there are forces that make the appropriation of absolute surplus value salient, then the nature of class politics in relation to the state must be seen in an entirely different manner: this means that revolution as the highest point of class struggle against capitalism and its state must be on the agenda right now, as in the core countries. But does this mean that one cannot fight for reforms within capitalism? Or, more specifically, does this mean that, for example, small-scale producers’ demand for access to means of production (e.g. land and/or credit) or workers’ struggle for higher wages and public provisioning of use-values can be ignored? The answer is no: within limits, the fight for land and for other such concessions is a means of political mobilization of the masses, and under the pressure of mass mobilization, some land redistribution and some increase in private and public wages might even happen under a bourgeois (or bourgeois-landlord) state. In the periphery and in the core, the masses must make a demand on the state around radical needs (as represented in transitional demands discussed earlier). Radical needs are the real needs of the masses, not the needs which the system says it can afford to meet, and are connected to the roots in the relations of production and exchange and in state power. The masses should democratically organize themselves over multiple ‘rights’: right to employment (including the right to more land and other farm inputs for poor peasants in agrarian economies), a living wage, a reduced working day, increased leisure, decent and affordable housing, high-quality healthcare and education as well as culture.47 They should fight for the right-to-decent financial support for the elderly and the disabled, and the right to a healthy and safe environment at work and in neighbourhoods. Those who have small amounts of means of production must have access to more, and the state should ensure complete freedom from exploitation by landlords, merchants, and usurers (e.g. payday lenders in some advanced countries). The masses must fight for the defence of democratic rights, including those of aboriginal populations and religious and racialized minorities. They must demand democratic control over landed and financial aristocrats and over capitalist monopolies as an immediate step necessary to satisfy the fulfilment of their social needs, especially those monopolies which control the production of things and services (e.g. food items and seeds, medicines, houses, clothes, utilities, and so on) without which radical needs cannot be met and people cannot live like humans. It is, of course, clear that the poor masses cannot rely on the bourgeoisie and its state.48”翻译为中文","output":"“新自由主义国家”也是一个资产阶级国家，就像干预主义国家一样，但前者的人员与后者的人员在根本上有所不同，不仅在他们的意识形态偏好上（与布雷顿森林机构的观点紧密一致），而且在他们与金融和大企业世界的深度交织中也有所不同。 因此， 我们在今天的国家人员中发现的不仅仅是一套不同的意识形态人士，世界银行的意识形态人士，与驾驭干预主义资产阶级国家的尼赫鲁维亚（即世俗资产阶级民族主义）意识形态人士不同，而是一套其动机与大资产阶级和金融利益没有区别的人士，因此他们没有顾虑地与后者紧密整合。 更具体地说： 新自由主义国家的人员对运营公共部门没有多少兴趣，这是公共部门随着时间变得财政上不可行的原因之一，为那些希望将其私有化的人提供了理由。即使是正常的政府职能也不由官僚机构执行，这些官僚更感兴趣的是与企业界和外国捐助者的世界中的赞助人建立关系，或参加世界银行赞助的培训项目，而不是行政管理的细节。结果是越来越多的政府职能被“外包”给私营机构，这为所有人提供了利润。 （帕特奈克，2010） 部分由于人员和国家运作模式的变化，国家的社会合法性已经被“削弱”，而且这一现象正在发生，“特别是在新自由主义战略追求下财富和收入不平等剧增的背景下”（帕特奈克，2010）。 这些结构性条件是否真的会导致合法性危机，以及在何种程度上，当然将取决于下层阶级及其政党和国内外有机知识分子如何在政治上应对这些条件。而且在危机确实形成的程度上，还将取决于国家如何应对，特别是它如何借助其帝国主义导师的帮助动用其可支配的强制力量，以及下层阶级如何应对这一点。 8 总结，理论和政治含义 本书的主要目的一直是明确重申国家的阶级性质。本章的主要目的是明确重申外围国家中的国家的阶级性质。外围地区的特点是在资本主义主导下不同生产方式的共存，同时受到帝国主义的影响。因此，较之中心地区，存在更多的阶级和阶级分支。这种复杂的阶级结构塑造了国家。阶级关系和伴随的物质条件——包括帝国主义——构成了国家所有形式的干预以及国家本身的形式（领土和政治形式）的最重要背景。当然，在这个阶级背景中，其他社会关系——即种姓、宗教、族裔、地区和民族的关系——也在运作，并影响着国家及其阶级性质。 因为资本主义是典型的外围国家的主导生产方式，所以国家是一个资本主义国家，因此是资本主义发展的代理，即使小规模生产者在外围有巨大的存在。无论是在新自由主义前还是新自由主义时期，无论是在农村地区还是城市地区，都是如此。国家与资本家阶级关系的两个方面之间的伙伴关系是通过两种主要意识形态来证明的。一种是国家控制和社会主义（许多国家如印度和孟加拉国，斯里兰卡，坦桑尼亚，尼加拉瓜等最初被称为社会主义，或者它们的宪法中有提到社会主义）。另一种是自由市场。后独立时期早年对商业世界的国家控制的意识形态并非完全是谎言。确实存在一定程度的国家控制。确实存在一定程度的代表大众的国家干预。即使统治阶级从一开始就理解到，一定程度的国家控制和对穷人有利的重新分配是对抗所有形式的私有财产，或对抗反封建和反帝国主义斗争演变为反资本主义阶级关系的潜在社会动荡的一种补救措施。在新自由主义时期，自由市场的意识形态证明了对资本利益的严肃干预，并通过人员变更得以实现。 然而，不应过分强调人事变更这一点。是新自由主义的资产阶级性质导致了国家由资产阶级人员（包括资产阶级成员或受资产阶级思想和愿望影响的人）管理，这反过来又负责持续复制资本主义-新自由主义秩序。国家总是或多或少地符合资产阶级的利益。其政策（以及存在的情况下其自由民主形式）因此受到占主导地位的阶级的利益/行动的影响，尽管它们在一定程度上也受到了来自下层的阶级斗争的实际性/可能性的形塑。 像任何资本主义国家一样，外围国家必须维持这样一个神话，即资本主义积累（被称为“增长”）不仅使已经较为富裕的企业家受益，而且也使穷人受益。所需的神话是，剥削者（错误称为雇主、财富创造者等）和被剥削者从同一过程中受益。后殖民国家的合法性在很大程度上源于两个假设：不同于服务于“外国”利益的殖民政府，它将服务于国内利益；为此，它将促进经济发展，使整个国家受益。然而，随着时间的推移，殖民和后殖民发展项目之间的区别日益模糊，因为新自由主义国家不仅促进了国际和国内资本对穷人的剥夺和剥削。农作物再次被认为主要是为精英（=“外国”）市场生产的，就像殖民时期一样。这可能助长了对发展国家的更广泛非正当化过程，反过来，这一情况加剧了“来自下层”的阶级斗争，以及保护资产阶级利益的新自由主义国家“来自上层”的镇压反应。 外围不应仅仅被视为收入较少。它应该从其阶级-资本主义性质来看待。说外围社会构成是决定性的资本主义有着不同的政治含义，包括对下层阶级与国家的关系，与相反观点（即社会构成不是主导地资本主义或它以有限的方式是资本主义，资本主义发展的障碍在于前资本主义或非资本主义关系中）相比。这里隐含了两个想法。一是资本主义阶级关系无时无刻不与生产力的更高发展水平相关。另一个是资本主义发展的障碍不在于资本主义作为一种阶级关系本身，而可以通过寻求废除资本主义之外的力量来消除。也就是说，一个在资本主义关系逻辑内运作的民主国家可以消除这些障碍并促进一种更好的资本主义形式，独立于资本主义。 如果一个外围国家主要是半封建的，或者不够资本主义化，那么激进策略就是针对半封建地主的，或以某种方式创造先进的资本主义。这种策略为等待开始为社会主义（=废除阶级关系）而战的长时间和不确定的时间提供了许可，并要求与一些好的（进步=反封建、民族主义、民主等）资本家合作。但如果目前已经是资本主义，尽管不是很进步的资本主义，并且由于当代帝国主义世界市场对向社会主义转型（RSL）的所有限制，它在很长一段时间内不会很进步，如果有力量使绝对剩余价值的占有变得显著，那么与国家相关的阶级政治的性质必须以完全不同的方式来看待：这意味着革命作为反对资本主义及其国家的阶级斗争的最高点，就像在核心国家一样，现在就必须列入议程。 但这是否意味着不能在资本主义内争取改革？或者，更具体地说，这是否意味着，例如，小规模生产者对生产资料（例如土地和/或信贷）的获取需求或工人对更高工资和公共提供的使用价值的斗争可以被忽视？答案是否定的：在一定限度内，争取土地和其他此类让步是大众政治动员的手段，而在大众动员的压力下，一些土地重新分配和私人和公共工资的一些增加甚至可能在资产阶级（或资产阶级-地主）国家下发生。 在外围和核心，大众必须围绕激进需求（如前文讨论的过渡性需求所代表的）向国家提出要求。激进需求是大众的真实需求，而不是体系说它能够满足的需求，它们与生产和交换关系以及国家权力的根源相联系。大众应该围绕多个“权利”民主组织起来：就业权（包括为农业经济中的贫困农民提供更多土地和其他农场投入品的权利）、生活工资、缩短工作日、增加休闲时间、负担得起的体面住房、高质量的医疗保健和教育以及文化。他们应该为老年人和残疾人提供体面的财政支持权利以及在工作和社区中健康安全环境的权利而斗争。那些拥有少量生产资料的人应该获得更多，国家应该确保完全免受地主、商人和放债人（例如一些发达国家的发薪日贷款者）的剥削。大众必须为捍卫民主权利而斗争，包括土著人口和宗教及种族化少数群体的权利。他们必须要求对土地和金融贵族以及资本家垄断进行民主控制，作为满足他们社会需求的必要即刻步骤，尤其是那些控制着生产无法满足激进需求和人们无法像人类一样生活所需的物品和服务（例如食品和种子、药品、房屋、衣物、公共设施等）的垄断。当然，很明显，穷人大众不能依赖资产阶级及其国家。"},{"instruction":"请将“In other words, to begin with, the masses as well as their organic intellectuals must re-imagine democracy as it originally was and as it should be: the democracy of the poor, who are the majority. Democracy is much more than being able to vote for this or that person or party once every few years to run the affairs of the capitalist state. It must be about the control over the ways society’s resources are used and over the ways in which the state institutions work and deal with the majority, the exploited classes, the poor. At the minimum, the masses must demand a thorough democratization of the state as a transitional political demand. This means that excessive power (in the sense of ‘power over’) of the (secretive) civil servants and politicians must be stripped. Committees or councils of common citizens (workers, small-scale producers, and their organic intellectuals and political representatives) in different spheres of society must be formed. They must have direct oversight over the activity of the civil servants, including their income and daily interactions with politicians and business people as well as over politicians and state-owned and private enterprises. They must militantly defend democratic rights against fascistic attacks on minorities and anyone else. All the deals that the state makes with the capitalists must be subjected to popular scrutiny. This re-imagining of democracy must be a part of the project of conquest of state power and establishment of socialism. The periphery, where most of the global population live, has its own specifi-cities. Yet, increasingly, the mechanisms behind the conditions of wage earners and small-scale producers there and in the core are similar. Shrinking income and consumption of the toiling classes are the characteristic aspects of (neoliberal) capitalism everywhere. This means that there a potential basis for international solidarity of working class and small-scale self-employed producers against capital, including its neoliberal incarnation, everywhere and at all scales. While the masses must struggle for all possible political and economic con-cessions, they cannot have any illusion that the current state, in the periphery and in the core, can return to a pre-neoliberal state which defends democratic rights, including of minorities. It is only a state under the control of the proletariat allied with small-scale producers, following a socialist revolution, that can meet the economic and political needs of the masses. Only such a state, in the context of the periphery, for example, can successfully carry out land redistribution and stop the beneficiaries from losing their land through coercive dispossession or market-based class differentiation.49 Only such a state, freed from capitalists’ control and the constraints of the law of value, can, both in the core and in the periphery, successfully create well-paying and secure jobs for all, invest in social and physical infrastructure, and secure ecological sustainability. The capitalist state, in the periphery or in the core, cannot significantly and durably solve the problems created by capitalism, a system that the state must protect. So, the core of the political agenda, in imperialist and imperialized countries, must be the anti-capitalist struggle of the working class against the totality of capitalist class relation, including in its most general form (i.e. FSL). The working class must be politically allied with, and lead, small-scale producers who are adversely impacted by the capitalist class (and by its class partner, that is, rent-receiving landowners, where they exist) to overthrow the capitalist state. It is futile and mistaken to expect that this state will wither away under the pressure of the struggle for reforms. The withering idea in Marxism applies not to the capitalist state, but to the post-revolution, transitional proletarian state. The combined and common goal of the two toiling classes must be a socialist state in place of the existing capitalist state. The socialist state is a state of and for workers and small-scale producers, who constitute the majority of the population. By driving all propertied classes from their ruling positions and by stopping them from returning, such a state can create conditions for a higher level of development of productive forces, economic and geographical equality, and ecological sustainability. It will create conditions for a society without economic exploitation, social oppression, imperialism and the constant threat of war, a society where material and cultural needs of all men, women, and children are met. By creating these conditions, the proletarian state will ultimately make its own existence unnecessary. A global society without class exploitation does not require a state. ”翻译为中文","output":"换句话说，首先，大众及其有机知识分子必须重新想象民主的本来面目和应有之意：即多数人，穷人的民主。民主远不止于每隔几年能够为这个或那个人或政党投票，让他们管理资本主义国家的事务。它必须关乎对社会资源使用方式的控制，以及对国家机构运作方式和与多数人——被剥削阶级、穷人打交道方式的控制。至少，大众必须要求对国家进行彻底的民主化，作为一项过渡性政治要求。这意味着必须剥夺（秘密的）公务员和政治家的过度权力（意味着“对……的权力”）。必须在社会的不同领域成立普通公民（工人、小规模生产者及其有机知识分子和政治代表）的委员会或议会。它们必须直接监督公务员的活动，包括他们的收入和与政治家和商人的日常互动，以及对政治家和国有及私营企业的监督。他们必须坚决捍卫对少数群体和任何其他人的法西斯攻击的民主权利。国家与资本家之间的所有交易都必须接受公众审查。重新想象的民主必须是征服国家权力和建立社会主义项目的一部分。 大多数全球人口居住的外围地区有其自身的特殊性。然而，越来越多，那里的工资收入者和小规模生产者的条件背后的机制与核心地区相似。收缩的收入和劳动阶级的消费是（新自由主义）资本主义到处的特征方面。这意味着有一个反对资本的国际团结的潜在基础，包括其新自由主义化身，无论在何处和何种规模。 虽然大众必须为所有可能的政治和经济让步而斗争，但他们不能抱有任何幻想，即当前国家，无论在外围还是核心，都可以回到捍卫民主权利（包括少数民族权利）的前新自由主义状态。只有在无产阶级联合小规模生产者控制下，经过社会主义革命的国家，才能满足大众的经济和政治需求。只有这样的国家，在外围地区的背景下，例如，才能成功地进行土地重新分配，并阻止受益者通过强制剥夺或基于市场的阶级分化失去土地。只有这样从资本家控制和价值规律约束中解放出来的国家，无论在核心还是外围，才能成功地为所有人创造高薪和安全的工作，投资于社会和物理基础设施，并确保生态可持续性。 资本主义国家，无论在外围还是核心，都无法显著且持久地解决资本主义创造的问题，这是国家必须保护的系统。因此，帝国主义和被帝国主义化国家的政治议程的核心，必须是工人阶级反对资本主义阶级关系总体的反资本主义斗争，包括其最普遍形式（即FSL）。工人阶级必须在政治上与受资本主义阶级（及其阶级伙伴，即存在的情况下，是收租地主）不利影响的小规模生产者结盟并领导他们，以推翻资本主义国家。期望这个国家在改革斗争的压力下消亡是徒劳无功且错误的。马克思主义中的消亡观念不适用于资本主义国家，而是适用于后革命、过渡期的无产阶级国家。这两个劳动阶级的联合和共同目标必须是取代现有资本主义国家的社会主义国家。社会主义国家是为工人和小规模生产者服务的国家，他们构成了人口的大多数。通过将所有有产阶级从其统治地位中赶走并阻止他们返回，这样的国家可以为生产力的更高级别发展、经济和地理平等以及生态可持续性创造条件。它将为一个没有经济剥削、社会压迫、帝国主义和持续战争威胁的社会创造条件，一个满足所有男人、女人和儿童的物质和文化需求的社会。通过创造这些条件，无产阶级国家最终将使自身的存在变得不必要。一个没有阶级剥削的全球社会不需要国家。"},{"instruction":"Привет.

Yet, in this stark landscape, evolution marches on, driven by the relentless struggle for survival. The following are conceptualizations of evolved creatures that could inhabit such a world: 1. **Scavengerkites**: These are evolved birds with highly acidic saliva. Scavengerkites have developed the ability to digest nearly any type of organic material, no matter how toxic, thanks to their highly adaptive digestive systems. Their sharp beaks can pierce through most materials, allowing them to scavenge from the carcasses of machines and animals alike. They build nests out of the indestructible refuse of the old world, making them inaccessible to most predators. 2. **Cacti Canids**: Evolved from the canines that once roamed in packs, these creatures have adapted to the extreme scarcity of water. They possess thick, spiky fur that serves a dual purpose: it collects dew during the cold nights, and its intimidating appearance wards off aggressors. Their paws have turned into tough, shovel-like appendages for digging up buried cacti and other succulent plants which store precious water and nutrients. 3. **Noctilucae Scorpions**: Named after the bioluminescent microorganisms of the ocean, these scorpions have developed a symbiotic relationship with luminescent bacteria, which they harbor in their exoskeletons. This eerie glow serves to attract prey in the pitch-black nights of the wasteland. These creatures can absorb toxic pollutants, incorporating them into their venom, making each sting lethal to most other life forms but also purifying the ground they walk on over generations. 4. **Thornshells**: Once turtles, these creatures now bear little resemblance to their ancestors. The Thornshells have evolved massive, spiked shells made from the same nearly indestructible materials as the Scavengerkite nests. They feed on mineral-rich deposits in the wasteland soils, extracting nutrients through a complex filtration system inside their mouths. They can retract into their shells for months, entering a state of suspended animation until the environment outside becomes favorable again. 5. **Galewings**: Descendants of bats, the Galewings are masters of the turbulent, storm-ridden skies of the wasteland. With wingspans measuring several meters, they can glide on the wind for hours with minimal effort. Their echolocation abilities have evolved to such a degree that they can 'see' air currents, allowing them to navigate even the most chaotic atmospheric conditions. They feed on the airborne plankton that thrives in the toxic clouds, and their droppings help fertilize the barren earth below. 6. **Mirage Skinks**: These reptiles have developed highly reflective scales that scatter light, creating a mirage effect that confuses predators and prey alike. Living in the vast, open deserts of the wasteland, their illusionary capabilities provide them with a unique form of camouflage in an environment with little cover. They subsist on insects and small animals, luring them into their territory with the promise of water, only to reveal the deadly trap too late. 7. **Ironweavers**: Insectoid creatures that have taken over the ruins of human cities, Ironweavers are capable of weaving incredibly strong webs out of metallic fibers they collect from the debris. These webs serve as traps for unsuspecting prey but also as fortresses against the harsh conditions outside. They exhibit a primitive form of social structure, working together to dismantle machines and buildings, repurposing them into ever-expanding colonies. These evolved creatures are but a glimpse into the possible forms life could take in a drastically altered world, showcasing nature's endless capacity for adaptation and resilience."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

En este caso, estamos tratando con depósitos mensuales en lugar de anuales, pero la estructura básica de la fórmula se mantiene: [ FV_{text{anualidad}} = P times left( frac{(1 + r)^n - 1}{r} right) ] Donde: - (FV_{text{anualidad}}) = valor futuro de la anualidad (lo que deseamos encontrar). - (P) = valor del depósito periódico (300,000 en este caso). - (r) = tasa de interés por período (en este caso, 8.5% mensual, lo que es igual a 0.085 expresado como decimal). - (n) = número total de períodos (24 meses). Sustituyendo los valores proporcionados en la fórmula: [ FV_{text{anualidad}} = 300000 times left( frac{(1 + 0.085)^{24} - 1}{0.085} right) ] Ahora, calculamos el paréntesis: [ FV_{text{anualidad}} = 300000 times left( frac{(1.085)^{24} - 1}{0.085} right) ] Primero calculamos ( (1.085)^{24} ): [ (1.085)^{24} ≈ 9.21422 ] Luego, sustituimos este valor en la fórmula: [ FV_{text{anualidad}} = 300000 times left( frac{9.21422 - 1}{0.085} right) ] [ FV_{text{anualidad}} = 300000 times left( frac{8.21422}{0.085} right) ] [ FV_{text{anualidad}} = 300000 times 96.638 ] [ FV_{text{anualidad}} ≈ 28991400 ] Por lo tanto, al cabo de 24 meses, la empresa de transporte Cruz del Sur tendría acumulado aproximadamente 28,991,400 con una tasa de interés del 8.5% mensual y haciendo depósitos de 300,000 al final de cada mes.

ScienceRules45: @MicrobeMania I read that the team behind some of the recent popular cartoons is on board for this. As for voice actors, nothing’s announced yet. I’m crossing my fingers they get some quality talent. Hoping for some great chemistry between Squish, Pod, and Peggy. 🤞 TheComicNerd21: True, voice acting can make or break a cartoon adaptation. I’m a bit skeptical, tbh. Sometimes these transitions lose the spirit of the original material. But I’ll reserve judgment until we get a trailer or something. ArtsyOwl: Has anyone heard about the art style yet? The simplistic yet expressive style of the books is super charming. Kids WB tends to go for flashier animation, though I hope they keep it close to the spirit of the Squish comics. HappyMom200: I just hope they tackle the educational aspects well. My kids learned so much about microorganisms from these books while laughing their heads off. It’ll be great for them to watch Squish’s adventures! BioGeek: Yes! Education through entertainment is the best. I mean, who knew an amoeba could make science this fun? 😅 And considering we’ve all become amateur virologists lately (thanks, 2020), the timing couldn’t be better. GreenJelly223: For sure, @BioGeek. They have a chance here to really create something that’s as informational as it is entertaining. I also love how the books touch on themes of friendship and acceptance. If they keep that intact, it’s going to be a hit. MicrobeMania: Anybody have any insider scoop on when we might be getting a peek at the animation or the voice cast? I’m super eager to see anything at this point! Bacteriophage_: Rumors say a teaser might drop sometime in the spring. 🌼 Keep your eyes peeled and your streaming devices ready! AmoebaAmy: Well, here’s hoping Kids WB keeps the slime rolling! Can’t wait to see our little squishy buddy in action. Let’s keep this thread updated with any new info! Admin5: This thread has been locked due to its inactivity over 30 days. Please feel free to open a new one if you have more news or want to continue the discussion about the upcoming Squish cartoon. Write a follow up where the premiere is in mid March, Also, Apple and Onion is being replaced by the return of reruns of Xiaolin Showdown, also TTG, Gumball and Johnny Test are still the flagships, Also The Tom and Jerry Show is over, and will be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May Thread Title: Squish Premiere Date and Schedule Changes on Kids WB! 📆📺 Bacteriophage_: Hey everyone, big news! The Squish cartoon is set to premiere in mid-March! Clear your calendars and get ready for some amoeba action! Who’s excited? 🎉 CartoonAficionado: Finally, some concrete dates! I’ve been keeping an eye out since our last thread went quiet. Mid-March is sooner than I expected. Also heard about some schedule shake-ups. Looks like Apple and Onion is getting shelved for the Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Not sure how I feel about that one. AmoebaAmy: Squish is starting soon?! That’s awesome! I’m totally having a viewing party with my kids. But wow, Apple and Onion out for Xiaolin Showdown…nostalgia trip, anyone? I did love that show, but it’s a bit of a genre leap from Apple and Onion. 🌀 RestInToons: RIP The Tom and Jerry Show. Kinda saw that ending coming. And to be replaced by Steven Universe reruns in May? I need new cartoons, not just rewinds. But Steven Universe is still a gem, at least. 💎 MicrobeMania: No more Tom and Jerry? That’s the end of an era. Though, to be fair, SU reruns are solid. It’s not every day you get a show that tackles heavy themes with magical aliens. Still, can’t help but hope we get some fresh blood in the lineup eventually. ScienceRules45: True, new content is key, but at least we have Squish! And with TTG, Gumball, and Johnny Test holding the fort as flagships, I think Kids WB has a pretty balanced mix. Squish might just be the breath of fresh air we need right now. GreenJelly223: So, mid-March for Squish, that’s great! Does anyone know if that’s going to affect TTG, Gumball, or Johnny Test air times? I know they’re the heavy hitters, just hoping Squish gets a good slot that doesn’t clash. TheComicNerd21: Haven’t seen anything about time changes for the flagships. I reckon Squish will find its place without much issue. Kids WB tends to do well with scheduling around their mainstays. And let’s face it—TTG is practically unmovable at this point. HappyMom200: My kids will be over the moon with the return of Xiaolin Showdown. I loved it as a kid, too. It’s going to be a mix of new and old at our house with Squish and the reruns. I think Kids WB might just pull off this balance. Still, hoping those reruns are just placeholders for future original content. ArtsyOwl: I’m just happy Squish is making its debut! Sure, schedule changes are always a bit of a rollercoaster, but that’s the nature of TV, right? Out with the old, in with the new… and sometimes back in with the old! 😂 Admin5: Friendly reminder to keep industry rumor discussions civil. Looking forward to seeing how Squish is received by the community here! Let’s revisit this thread after the premiere to share our thoughts. And, as always, stay tuned for any further schedule updates from Kids WB. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up during the summer, The summer lineup has TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, Xiaolin Showdown, Johnny Test, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons and Craig of the Creek, Also, new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek and Johnny Test return in September Thread Title: Kids WB Summer Lineup + Fall New Episodes Info! ☀️📺 GreenJelly223: Summer’s heating up, folks, and so is Kids WB’s lineup! We’re looking at TTG, Gumball, Steven Universe, and Xiaolin Showdown reruns. Plus, Squish, Skatoony, Scooby Doo and Guess Who, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Craig of the Creek are all part of the mix. How’s everyone feeling about the current programming? CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s a bit of a mixed bag, but I’m not complaining! New fans are getting a taste of some classic toons with Xiaolin Showdown, and Squish has been a pleasant surprise—really nailing it. Plus, Craig of the Creek is always solid. It’s like a buffet of different cartoon flavors this summer. Bacteriophage_: And don’t forget what’s coming in the fall – new episodes of Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, Teen Titans Go, Craig of the Creek, and Johnny Test. September can’t come soon enough! AmoebaAmy: Squish has been an absolute delight! My kids adore it, and it’s turning into our little summer tradition to watch together. As much as I love TTG and Gumball, it’s Squish that has us tuning in with the most excitement. TheComicNerd21: A heads-up for all the true toon fans out there: new episodes for some of these shows are usually a blast. I’ve got high hopes for the fall, especially for Craig of the Creek—they’ve been consistently knocking it out of the park. ScienceRules45: I’m just glad we have such variety. Keeps the channel interesting. Summer is always tricky with kids home all day, but this lineup has something for everybody. ArtsyOwl: Agreed on the variety. The blend of classic and contemporary shows has me responding like I’m five and thirteen all at once. 😆 By the way, the art in the latest season of Looney Tunes Cartoons has been stellar. Can’t wait to see what they do next. MicrobeMania: I am surprised how well Skatoony holds up. It’s not everyone’s cup of tea, but the quizzing with cartoons is unique. And with Scooby Doo and Guess Who featured, it feels like we’ve got a bit of a detective theme going on. Or is it just me? RestInToons: September seems pretty far, but I got a feeling that new Teen Titans Go and Johnny Test episodes will make some serious waves. Ben 10, too, has been gearing up for something big, at least that’s the vibe. HappyMom200: It’s a stable lineup for sure. Steven Universe reruns are still a hit in my house. Plus, I appreciate the educational value in shows like Squish. Keeps the kids learning even out of school—parents’ summer dream! Admin5: Great to see such positivity about the lineup! As always, discuss your favorite shows, but please remember no spoilers for unaired episodes. Let’s reconvene in this thread when the new episodes drop in September to share our thoughts and reviews! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where Robotboy is added to the schedule the next year in May 2022 when Summer begins, B10, LTC and SU are leaving, Robotboy, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks are taking their place, Also in the fall, we have a few new shows, Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the bold and Scooby Doo: Mystery Incorporated, Also a new acquired comedy cartoon about 2 blobs Thread Title: Kids WB Schedule Shakeup - Hello Robotboy, So Long Ben 10 & Others! 🤖📺 GreenJelly223: Hold onto your remotes, toon fans! Coming up next in May 2022, just as summer kicks off, Kids WB is adding Robotboy to the lineup. It’s a nostalgia hit for sure but sad to see some good ones like Ben 10, Looney Tunes Cartoons, and Steven Universe leave us. Thoughts? TheComicNerd21: Man, Robotboy brings me back. Haven’t seen that little guy in AGES. Sad to see Ben 10 go; it was always a solid watch. But, this is the life of a cartoon fan, right? Out with the old, in with the… older? 😂 Bacteriophage_: Robotboy’s return is quite a surprise. It had that classic boy-and-his-robot vibe. Also, Skatoony and Chop Socky Chooks? That’s quite the throwback. For those who don’t remember, Chop Socky Chooks was this wild mix of kung fu and chickens—only in cartoons, folks! CartoonAficionado: Don’t forget about the fall bonanza! Kids WB is loading up with some heavy hitters—Ultimate Spider-Man, Batman: The Brave and the Bold, and Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated. Plus, that new comedy about two blobs? Can’t find much on it, but new content is always exciting! AmoebaAmy: Wait, so we’re swapping out some superhero action with… different superhero action, and we’re keeping the mystery with Scooby-Doo. And do I smell a strong comedy theme building up with the two blob cartoon? RestInToons: Totally digging the superhero update with Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. They bring that comic book essence to the screen. And another comedy about blobs? Guess this one’s the era of the blob, huh? ArtsyOwl: As much as I’ll miss Steven Universe for its depth and progressivism, I guess I’m ready for something light-hearted. Robotboy and the blob comedy might just be the palate cleanser we need. Here’s hoping they deliver some good laughs! MicrobeMania: Definitely a bummer about Ben 10 and SU. Those shows had such depth in storytelling and character development. But Scooby-Doo: Mystery Incorporated is not to be slept on. That iteration has some of the best arcs for our mystery-solving gang! ScienceRules45: Batman: The Brave and the Bold was a gem! It didn’t take itself too seriously and had just the right amount of camp. And with Ultimate Spider-Man, looks like we’ll still be getting our fix of animated superhero action. HappyMom200: Love the move to Batman and Spider-Man. My kid has been on a real superhero kick, and Scooby-Doo never gets old. At least, not in my household. The blob comedy sounds intriguing—Kids WB isn’t afraid to experiment, that’s for sure! Admin5: With these cartoon cycles, it’s always sad to see some shows go but equally exciting to welcome new titles and welcome back some classics like Robotboy. Remember, fall is just around the corner, so let’s keep the conversation going when those new shows hit the screen. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where the blob cartoon is revealed to (be one I made up, hopefully I make it as a YouTube series) be named “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Gloopy is a normal slime blob wheras Glitter lives up to her name as a sparkling one, Also, a mid season show Code Lyoko is premiering just as COTC knocks off for Summer, Also promos for CSC are already airing Thread Title: Revealed: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” Joins Kids WB + Code Lyoko Mid-Season Premiere!✨🤖 CartoonAficionado: Alright, the mystery’s solved! The new blob comedy coming to Kids WB is “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. Gloopy is your average slime blob, and Glitter is, well, super sparkly! Could be a hit if it’s done well. Fingers crossed it’s as fun as the name suggests. GreenJelly223: “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” huh? That’s quite the name! I’m all for original content—bringing in some fresh ‘slime’ to the game. Kudos to the creator, especially if they started on YouTube. That’s one giant leap for slime-kind. 😄 TheComicNerd21: Between Gloopy and Glitter, I’m expecting some madcap hijinks and, hopefully, some good chemistry. Pun totally intended! It’s neat seeing creators move from YouTube to big networks. What a time to be alive! Bacteriophage_: Just saw the promo for Chop Socky Chooks! Honestly, I’d forgotten about that show, but the nostalgia hit me hard. Kids WB really knows how to draw in the old school fans alongside the new ones. AmoebaAmy: Excited to see what “Gloopy and Glitter” brings to the table! It’s always refreshing to see new characters and stories. Also, did anyone catch that Code Lyoko is coming back as a mid-season show? That’s unexpected! I remember watching that show as a kid—the blend of 2D and 3D animation was so cool. RestInToons: Code Lyoko? No way! That show was my virtual escape. With Craig of the Creek taking a summer break, Code Lyoko has some big shoes to fill. I’m cautiously optimistic. Also, kudos to the person behind “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”. This is indie creators’ dream! ArtsyOwl: Craig of the Creek is my comfort show, so knowing it’s taking a break has me in my feels. But Code Lyoko might just be the perfect summer binge to replace it. That show was ahead of its time with its virtual world storyline. MicrobeMania: With Chop Socky Chooks, Code Lyoko, and now “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter,” I’m sensing a theme of whimsy and adventure. Perfect for a carefree summer! It’s gonna be a wild ride on Kids WB. ScienceRules45: Indeed, summer is shaping up to be full of adventure and laughs! I’m curious to see the comedic dynamics between Gloopy and Glitter and how they’ll fit into the current lineup. Code Lyoko is an excellent addition for anyone who’s into that sci-fi, virtual reality vibe. HappyMom200: Just peeped the promo for Gloopy and Glitter with the kids. They’re already quoting lines and chuckling. Also, major props to Kids WB for the diversity in its programming—you’ve got old hits, modern takes, and now a homegrown web series making it to the big leagues. Admin5: The summer is looking quite adventurous with all the fresh and returning programming we have on our hands! If “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” or Code Lyoko capture your hearts, be sure to come back and let everyone know. Enjoy the shows, everyone, and let’s support those indie creators making waves! Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up where another mid-season show premieres, replacing Gumball, The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Thread Title: Mid-Season Update: The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers Replace Gumball on Kids WB! 🤩🎪 TheComicNerd21: Big news for Kids WB watchers! “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is premiering mid-season, taking the spot “The Amazing World of Gumball” left behind. I’ve got high hopes that these thrill-seeking siblings will bring the same level of zany to the lineup. Can they live up to the hilarity of Gumball, though? That’s the big question. GreenJelly223: Gumball’s out?! Say it isn’t so! That show was a staple! But I remember The Adrenalini Brothers from awhile back…they were full of over-the-top stunts and accents. Hopefully, they can fill the quirky cartoon void that’s gonna be left in Gumball’s wake. CartoonAficionado: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” are pure comedic gold with those daredevil antics. Gumball set a high bar for humor and heart, but if you want outrageous adventures and laughs, the Adrenalinis could be just the ticket. ArtsyOwl: I admit, I’ll miss the random humor and clever writing of Gumball. It was one of those shows that had something for viewers of all ages. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have a different flavor, but I’m definitely willing to give them a shot. Bacteriophage_: Well folks, all good things must come to an end, but at least the high-paced energy of The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers might fill the void. They’re not new to the cartoon scene, but let’s hope their stunts are as amazing as ever. MicrobeMania: “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” is a throwback! Those guys pull off some wild stunts. Kids WB seems to be aiming for high octane to take Gumball’s place. Keeping my fingers crossed that they keep delivering fresh content, even in the form of older gems getting the spotlight again. RestInToons: Guess it’s goodbye to Gumball and hello Adrenalini. I remember the brothers having quite the international flair. Their eclectic style should make for a refreshing change of pace. Plus, with Squish and the others, Kids WB’s variety is still on point. AmoebaAmy: My kids loved Gumball, so they’re a bit gutted. But I think The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers’ daredevil acts might just win them over. I’m always down for more shenanigans. Here’s hoping they get as much character-driven hilarity as Gumball had. ScienceRules45: Gumball’s creativity was unmatched, but The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers? That’s a nostalgia trip! Will be interesting to see how a show that’s been off the radar for a while resonates with the current audience. HappyMom200: My Gumball marathon nights are coming to an end it seems. The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have some big shoes to fill, but I’m ready for the laughs. In Kids WB we trust, right? 😂 Admin5: Change is part of every TV network’s lifecycle. “The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers” could be what kids WB needs to shake things up. Let’s give these fearless brothers a chance and reconvene here to discuss the stunts, humor, and how the show fits into the new dynamic!

Welcome Back Craig & Gumball + Code Lyoko Stays! 🍂📺 GreenJelly223: It’s fall premiere season, everyone! And with the leaves changing comes new changes to Kids WB. Code Lyoko has secured its spot on the schedule, which I know some of you are thrilled about. The Amazing World of Gumball and Craig of the Creek are making a short-lived comeback, dipping out again in January. Can’t get enough of those two, so I’m here for any time they’re on. CartoonAficionado: Great to have Gumball and Craig back, even if it’s just for a quick hello and goodbye. It’s like that favorite seasonal dish you can’t stop craving. And Code Lyoko sticking around? Love that for us—those virtual vibes aren’t going anywhere! TheComicNerd21: Ah, the temporary returns of Gumball and Craig are bittersweet. Makes you wish they’d just stick around full-time. But, I gotta say, Code Lyoko keeping its slot is A-okay with me. That’s one show I’ve been seriously getting back into. ArtsyOwl: The quality storytelling in Craig of the Creek will be sorely missed once January rolls around. And Gumball—it just has that rewatchability factor like no other. Soak it up while you can, folks! MicrobeMania: Just dropping in to say that Skatoony is going to be back next summer, and I’m here for it! It’s kind of become the unofficial summer tradition since 2018, hasn’t it? Always great to see a show that knows how to fill its seasonal shoes. Bacteriophage_: Yeah, Skatoony’s like that cool summer camp you get excited about all year. But let’s not overlook the fall newcomers too—I’m already setting reminders for Ultimate Spider-Man and Batman: The Brave and the Bold. The superhero binge is real! RestInToons: Mixed feelings about the short-term return of Gumball and Craig of the Creek. At least we know Kids WB is good at giving us something to look forward to. As for Code Lyoko, it’s been interesting to see a show from yesteryear find its groove with the audience today. AmoebaAmy: The limited time with Gumball and Craig is better than no time! Let’s enjoy the laughs and adventures while they last. And happy to have confirmed scoops like the one about Skatoony return—it’s this kind of knowledge that keeps the fandom ticking. ScienceRules45: I’ve gotten used to the shift and shuffle of Kids WB’s schedule. You learn to appreciate what you’ve got when you’ve got it. That said, I’m diving headfirst into the nostalgia and newness of this fall’s lineup. It’s going to be an entertaining season! HappyMom200: I’m grateful for any sprinkles of Craig of the Creek episodes we get! It’s such a gem. And does anyone else get way too competitive watching Skatoony, or is that just me? 😂 Super stoked about its return next year! Admin5: Some very astute observations and a tangible excitement for the new and returning shows this fall! Let’s enjoy this season’s offerings, and, as always, keep the conversations engaging as we head into the new year with all its sure-to-be-surprising programming and inevitable farewells. Thread Closed by Admin5 Write a follow up in 2023 where G&G are still rerunning, but Batman, Scooby and Spidey are off, replaced with Ozzy and Drix, World of Quest and Skatoony for summer Thread Title: 2023 Kids WB Update: Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest & Skatoony Take Over Summer! 🌞👾 GreenJelly223: Hey toon enthusiasts! As we hit the sunny stride of 2023, Kids WB is switching up the schedule. We’re saying bye to Batman, Scooby, and Spidey. But don’t despair—Ozzy & Drix, World of Quest, and the ever-reliable Skatoony are here for those summer vibes. Also, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” are still doing the rerun rounds. Keeping it fresh and funky! CartoonAficionado: Honestly, it’s cool to see Ozzy & Drix making a comeback. That show was always under the radar but it delivered some solid laughs plus a bit of body-function education. Let’s see how it holds up today! TheComicNerd21: No more Batman and Spidey is a bummer, but you know what? Bring on the Ozzy & Drix and World of Quest! I remember World of Quest being pretty out there with its humor, a good mix of action and oddball characters—definitely fitting for the wacky tone of summer. MicrobeMania: Ozzy & Drix, that’s a throwback! I had a feeling it could make a resurgence. Educational and entertaining—that’s a tough balance to strike, but that show had it. Also, cheers to year 5 of summer Skatoony—it’s tradition at this point! ArtsyOwl: Hey, “Gloopy and Glitter” are still in the reruns, too! Shimmering on—quite literally, thanks to Glitter. It’s a quirky and cute show, glad it’s still around for the little ones to enjoy. Bacteriophage_: Seeing World of Quest drop into the lineup makes me hopeful that Kids WB is dedicated to keeping variety alive. Adventure, humor, outright weirdness—it’s got it all. And combined with the educational fun from Ozzy & Drix, plus the game show laughs from Skatoony? Count me in for the summer! RestInToons: Sayonara superheroes! This season’s lineup shows that kids’ programming isn’t just about capes and villains. It’s about variety, surprise, and a touch of nostalgia. Let’s get microscopic with Ozzy & Drix and go on a wild ride with Quest and Nestor! AmoebaAmy: Always a tad sad to see the Scooby gang go, but switching up genres keeps things interesting. Ozzy & Drix is kind of like “The Magic School Bus” for the older crowd, and I’m here for it! Plus, Skatoony is something my kids look forward to every year—glad it’s not going anywhere! ScienceRules45: I’ve got to say, I appreciate how Kids WB keeps mixing in educational content amidst all the comedy and action. Ozzy & Drix is a blast from the past that I’m excited to revisit. It’s just what we need in a world that could use a refresher on health and the human body! HappyMom200: World of Quest is an underrated treasure, and I’m thrilled it’s coming back into the spotlight. It’s like that fun summer book series but animated. And Skatoony is practically synonymous with summer now; glad to know some things stay solid. Admin5: The summer outlook is looking diverse and delightful! With shows that cater to every kind of young fan, there’s no shortage of entertainment. Let’s keep track of these changes and see how they fare in the warm months ahead. Enjoy your summer watching, and stay tuned for updates on what’s next!

January 27 2024 Should have seen this coming the day TAWOG and COTC left for good, but Kids WB died on December 30, We now have the CW4Kids, owned by 4Kids Entertainment, and the first schedule change has happened, Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers have been replaced with Pokemon: Indigo League and Sonic X respectively, The block still has the Kids WB aesthetic, but I expect that to be gone by Easter, Also, another schedule change is coming in a few months, Teen Titans Go, Scooby Doo Mystery Inc and Batman the Brave and the Bold are being replaced with GoGoRiki (Smeshariki), Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya in 2 weeks, The remaining KWB shows as of now are Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Code Lyoko, Ultimate Spider Man (and in 2 weeks, Gloopy and Glitter). The way they went about this was interesting, In December they started airing promos saying that from January 7 the network would be changing it’s name, it didn’t tell us that 4Kids are now in charge or that there would be new shows, the promo just showed the usual KWB shows like Squish, TAAB, TTG, XS, etc. Also today the promo for the next schedule change (dubbed a Super Duper Late Winter Lineup) has a new slogan “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” Slow and painful rebrand? 😒, If you’re not gonna change the bumpers untill Easter then why reveal your flashy new slogan now. Also the website (thecw4kids.com) STILL says this at the footer “© 2024 Warner Bros Discovery, Paramount Global, Nexstar Media Group” Hopefully it is updated to reflect 4Kids’s involvement soon. Write a follow up forum convo where they talk more about the slow transition, and that GoGoRiki is cute, and that it could be primed to take over most of the current comedy cartoons Thread Title: CW4Kids: A Slow Transition & The Future of Cartoons on the Block? 🔄📺 ToonMasterJay: So, has anyone else noticed how the CW4Kids transition is kinda like watching paint dry? The bumpers feel like Kids WB is haunting us. And they’re dropping their new slogan already, but the website footer is still all about the old guard… Mixed signals much? DigitalToonFan: Yeah, the transition is definitely dragging its feet. I mean, if you’re going to bring in 4Kids, then do it with a bang! Not this half-Zoom half-real-life meeting vibe. The new lineup switches could be cool though, but I’ll miss Squish and The Amazing Adrenalini Brothers for sure. GoGoFan223: Honestly, I’m most excited about GoGoRiki (or Smeshariki for the purists). It’s cute and has that potential to be big with the comedy crowd. Less about the action and more laughs—could be the perfect fit for the new direction they’re aiming for. SonicXforever: Still processing the swap of Squish for Pokémon and TAAB for Sonic X… I mean, sure, classics! But Sonic X has been rerun how many times now? I guess they’re banking on that nostalgia factor to reel us in while they’re redecorating. PokeNostalgia101: Not going to lie, I’m excited to have Pokémon Indigo League back—it’s like comfort food for my soul. But I hear you all, the change is weirdly slow. I get that it’s a big shift from Kids WB to full-on 4Kids ownership, yet you’d think they’d want to make their mark quick. LyokoLover: Low-key glad Code Lyoko and Xiaolin Showdown are sticking around. They’ve got that unique appeal that isn’t easy to replace. But curious how long till that changes with this new “Super Duper Late Winter Lineup.” If they’re ushering out TTG and Scooby, who’s next? Animanga4Life: Ultimate Muscle and Kirby: Right Back At Ya coming to the block brings back fond Saturday morning memories! Although, I do get why some are skeptical; a lot of these shows have seen multiple reruns over the years. WebWader: I keep checking the website hoping it’s been updated… No dice. The weird blend of old and new branding isn’t helping anyone. At least update the footer to show 4Kids is steering the ship now. How hard can it be? ComicStripKid: The lineup change feels like a balance between targeting the parents who grew up with these shows and trying to appeal to the new gen of cartoon fans. GoGoRiki’s charm and simplicity could be their ticket into the latter’s hearts. I see a mascot in the making. ToonTalker91: Not thrilled about the slow pace here. It’s like we’re stuck in Kids WB limbo. I miss the days when a rebrand meant a fresh start, not this lingering goodbye. Curious how Gloopy and Glitter will fare with the rest of the changes looming… Will they be the last ones standing? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Please bear with us during this transition. We’re working hard to bring a fresh and exciting lineup while honoring the legacy of what came before. Believe us, it’ll be worth the wait! Stay tuned for more updates and enjoy the shows in the meantime. Thread Closed by Admin_4KidsRevamp Write a follow up in mid Feb where the Feb lineup is here, 5 4Kids shows (Pokemon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby and GoGoRiki) and 5 Kids WB shows (Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter and Code Lyoko) Also, the website now has an account and points system, games, and has updated the footer to “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment”, Website otherwise remains the same, and still has show pages for removed shows, but this will slowly change in the coming weeks Thread Title: CW4Kids Mid-Feb Lineup is Live! Balance of Old and New + Website Updates 🎮📺 DigitalToonFan: The balance has been struck, folks! Five 4Kids classics—Pokémon, Sonic, Ultimate Muscle, Kirby, and GoGoRiki—and five Kids WB staples—Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, Ultimate Spider Man, Gloopy and Glitter, and Code Lyoko. It’s a mix of eras in one block! ToonMasterJay: Checked out the CW4Kids website, they finally ditched the old footer. It’s official, this ship is sailing under the 4Kids flag now. Nice to see they’re stepping up their game with accounts and points, plus some games to boot! Animanga4Life: 4Kids moving in with accounts and points? Sounds like they’re setting up a cool rewards system. And that might just get more kids invested in the website beyond streaming shows—a savvy move. GoGoFan223: GoGoRiki getting prime time with the big 4Kids dogs is great news. Its cute factor is off the charts. Could be the one to round out the new vibe CW4Kids is going for if they play their cards right. SonicXforever: Glad to see Sonic racing into the lineup. It’s about time he got back into the limelight. Now to see how he fares among the newer offerings. Talk about a speed battle! PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon getting its rightful place has me all fired up! But it’s kinda odd to still see show pages for the ousted shows on the website. Anyone else notice that? Hopefully, they’ll clear that up soon. LyokoLover: The fact that Code Lyoko is sticking around amidst all the changes shows its resilience. Maybe 4Kids recognizes the gold they have with some of these Kids WB shows. The perfect yin to their yang. ComicStripKid: Well, can’t say 4Kids isn’t taking a balanced approach to this transition. Keeping half the lineup from Kids WB seems like a strategic way to ensure they don’t lose the existing audience while they woo new viewers with nostalgia and updated features. WebWader: The website is getting there, slowly but surely. With account functionality and games, it looks like 4Kids is channeling some vintage interactivity magic. Here’s to mission: engage the digitally-savvy generation! ToonTalker91: Seeing “© 2024 4Kids Entertainment” at the bottom of the website gives me mixed emotions—it’s good to see they’re updating stuff, but the nostalgia for Kids WB is real. Any bets on how long Gloopy and Glitter can hold out? Admin_4KidsRevamp: Thanks for sticking with us through the changes! We’re excited about the new lineup and website features, and this is just the beginning. As for the site, we’re rolling out updates over the next few weeks to ensure the best experience for all our visitors.

We’re diving into a digital online video style aesthetic, making the “You’re signed on to the CW4Kids” slogan legit. Plus, line-up’s getting shaken up again—big time! DigitalToonFan: Heard the scoop that Johnny Test, Xiaolin Showdown, and Ultimate Spider Man are waving goodbye. But we’re keeping the virtual adventures of Code Lyoko and the quirky “Gloopy and Glitter”—two survivors of the cull. Animanga4Life: For the manga/anime fans, Pokémon Horizons: The Series is swooping in to replace the original Pokémon series! Exciting to see some new journeys and battles. Gotta love the continuous evolution of the Pokémon franchise on the CW4Kids. GoGoFan223: And what about that triple threat joining the fray? Chaotic, TMNT: Back to the Sewer, and Viva Piñata are about to spice things up! Feels like 4Kids is tossing in as many flavors as they can to see what sticks. SonicXforever: Greatest thing about CW4Kids right now? They’re not afraid to mix it up. The digital look update has me hyped—it’s like the block is leveling up. Hopefully, it adds a fresh vibe that resonates with the digital generation. PokeNostalgia101: Pokémon Horizons: The Series will def pull in the crowd looking for that cutting-edge anime action. Pokémon always knows how to keep things fresh. LyokoLover: Sad to see some old friends go, but Code Lyoko holding strong gives me hope. It’s like our own little slice of stability in this whirlwind of changes. ComicStripKid: With the digital online style coming, CW4Kids is clearly gunning for a certain look and feel. Let’s just cross our fingers it blends seamlessly with the cartoon essence we all tune in for. WebWader: Do you think bringing in Chaotic, TMNT, and Viva Piñata is going too far back into the vault? I’m all for nostalgia, but I hope they still invest in newer properties or original content. Balance is key. ToonTalker91: Big stuff with Pokémon Horizons; it’s been creating buzz all over! As for Chaotic and TMNT: Back to the Sewer, that’s unexpected! Not so sure what to expect from Viva Piñata, though… a wildcard entry, I’d say. Admin_4KidsRevamp: Expect the unexpected with CW4Kids! We’re committed to delivering a modern digital vibe with the shows you love, new and old. Mid-April is going to be a milestone moment for the block, so prepare for an eye-catching refresh and lineup that packs a punch! I thought I’d list properties exclusive to each block (24/7 channel in 4Kids TV’s case) effective April 13 4Kids TV Exclusive Shows: Glitter Force: A team of teenage girls become superheroes to save the world from a group of fairytale monsters who want to revive the evil Emperor Nogo, Four Eyes!: Emma is a 11 year old squid-like, four eyed pink alien girl from Albacore 7, who is sent from her planet to Payne Academy Boarding School on Earth to repeat 5th grade, Her only friends are 2 boys named Pete and Skyler, The worst part is that her human form is a stereotypical geek, complete with buckteeth and glasses, But with a bit of resourcefulness, life in boarding school will no longer have any suprises for her Tomodachi Life: Joseph is mayor of the madcap Greenock Island, He has to stop the island from falling into chaos every day, but with the help from his fellow Miis, life in a island is easy. One Piece: Monkey D. Luffy and his friends: The Straw Hat Pirates set out in search of the legendary One Piece, hidden by Gol. D Roger CW4Kids Exclusive Shows: The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter: Gloopy, a teal gooey blob and his best friend Glitter, a sparkling fuschia (still gooey) blob, hail from the planet of Gloopiter, Laugh along as they travel through the galaxy Code Lyoko: A group of kids: Jeremy, Aelita, Ulrich, Odd and Yumi do battle against a evil computer program XANA in a virtural world known as Lyoko The Gees (shorts, so shown inbetween shows): Meet G-Girl, G-Boy and G-Cat, the world’s first alien visitors, Unlike B-movie horror villans, these are kind, but annoying aliens, They always try to get involved in human activity, of which they understand nothing, Even to the point where humans think horror movie monsters would be more desirable than these “peaceful” Gees. The Owl (also shorts): Life is hard for this pink owl, Despite wanting to relax on his bench, bad luck has other plans for him, No matter what, this poor owl has the worst luck possible, and always ends each episode blown to smithereens, Do us a favor and don’t laugh: it’s cruel Write a follow up where a user says Shaman King is also 4Kids TV exclusive, and on another note the company seems to have 4 normal toons under their wing now (GGR, FE, TAOG&G and Cl), The shorts don’t count Thread Title: CW4Kids & 4Kids TV’s Exclusive Toons & Updates 📺✨ RetroToonFan: Just wanted to point out that Shaman King is also a 4Kids TV exclusive! Pretty exciting to see them bringing back this epic adventure. On another note, it seems like 4Kids Entertainment now officially has four main cartoons under their wing for CW4Kids - The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter, Four Eyes!, Glitter Force, and Code Lyoko. ToonEnthusiast123: That’s right! Shaman King’s inclusion is a big win for 4Kids TV. It adds a good mix of action and mystical drama to their lineup. As for CW4Kids, seeing them maintain a unique blend with shows like Gloopy and Glitter is fascinating. I’m curious how this balance between nostalgia and newer properties will play out for them. PixelDoodler: Super pumped for Shaman King! It’s such an underrated gem. But let’s talk about CW4Kids - Gloopy and Glitter represent such a fresh take on adventurous toons, while Code Lyoko offers that sci-fi intrigue. With Four Eyes! and Glitter Force, it’s like 4Kids is exploring diverse genres to cater to everyone. AnimationAficionado: It’s interesting to analyze 4Kids Entertainment’s approach. They seem to be carefully selecting shows to cater to various interests, ensuring a diverse palette. However, I wonder if they’re considering expanding their repertoire further beyond these four main attractions and occasional shorts like The Gees and The Owl. DigitalBytes: Don’t forget those shorts! Even though they’re not considered part of the “main” lineup, they add a lot of character to the programming. The Gees and The Owl have their own unique charm that fills in the gaps quite nicely. But yes, the main toon lineup shows a strategic approach to appealing across the board. SketchyArtKid: Honestly, The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter have been such a breath of fresh air. It’s always great seeing how creative shows can get, and having Code Lyoko sticking around gives the lineup that solid anchor. I’m eagerly waiting to see if 4Kids plans to introduce more “normal toons” to CW4Kids or if they’ll continue to diversify with more shorts. ToonTalker91: With Shaman King on 4Kids TV and the mix of adventures and sci-fi on CW4Kids, it’s like they’re trying to secure every corner of the toon spectrum. The real question is, what’s next? Will they lean more into these established genres, or is there another surprise genre they’re aiming to introduce? Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with the discussions and speculations! Our goal is to offer a range of programming that appeals to various tastes while pushing the boundaries of storytelling. Stay tuned for more updates and surprises in the lineup. Your favorite might just be around the corner. Thanks for your continued support!

Just caught wind that Tomodachi Life’s journey on CW4Kids is wrapping up by end of April. Bittersweet, but hey, every season finale preludes a new beginning, right? And guess what’s making waves? “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” is migrating from CW to 4Kids TV! DigitalToonFan: Whoa, serious moves in the lineup! “Tomodachi Life” had a quirky charm, for sure. But “Gloopy and Glitter” hopping over to 4Kids TV? Interesting switch. They’ve got that intergalactic buddy vibe that could really shine there. And Kirby’s space? Filled by our beloved 24/7 channel exclusive alien, huh? Intriguing! AnimationAficionado: Honestly, “Gloopy and Glitter” has that universal appeal (pun intended), perfect for 4Kids TV. But I’m really curious about our exclusive alien friend taking up residence on CW in place of Kirby. Such a mystery! Any teasers on who this extraterrestrial might be? GoGoFan223: Sad to see Kirby float off into the sunset, but excited for the alien to land! “Gloopy and Glitter” always had that zany, out-of-this-world vibe that’ll probably resonate well on 4Kids TV. As for the alien, fingers crossed for something as charismatic and engaging! SonicXforever: “Tomodachi Life” leaving is like the end of an era, but change is the name of the game. “Gloopy and Glitter” will surely bring their sparkle to 4Kids TV. Now, about our alien – could this mean even more cosmic adventures? CW4Kids and 4Kids TV really know how to keep the universe expanding. PokeNostalgia101: A little heartbroken over Kirby’s departure – those adventures were a blast. But, if the CW4Kids tradition holds, our new alien amigo will fill those boots and then some. As for “Gloopy and Glitter”, those two are about to become interstellar icons over at 4Kids TV. LyokoLover: It’s always interesting to see how these shifts play out. “G&G” has been doing well, so 4Kids TV seems like a logical next chapter for them. Meanwhile, Kirby leaving a void? Let’s hope our new alien resident brings a blend of humor and adventure to fill that vacuum. ComicStripKid: So much happening! While I’ll miss the faces leaving, “Gloopy and Glitter’s” move and the mysterious alien arrival promise fresh storylines and laughs. The CW4Kids universe seems to be ever-evolving. Here’s hoping the alien is as entertaining as our departing friends! ToonTalker91: Changes abound! It’s the cosmic cycle of toon life - some shows set beyond the horizon while new stars rise. “Gloopy and Glitter” will definitely add their unique luster to 4Kids TV. Eagerly awaiting our alien’s unveiling. May it bring a galaxy of new stories to explore! Admin_4KidsRevamp: We’re thrilled with your enthusiasm and speculations! Transitions, like the ones you’re seeing, are part of our commitment to keeping our lineup fresh and engaging.

Seems like our screens will be hosting quite the interstellar party! ToonMasterJay: The addition of “Four Eyes!” really solidifies the extraterrestrial theme they’re going for. But here’s a thought – what if 4Kids is plotting an Alien Hour for the summer? Imagine back-to-back alien adventures, capped off with “The Gees” in between as a quirky interlude. That’d be something! DigitalToonFan: An Alien Hour would be epic! “Four Eyes!”, “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter”, plus “The Gees” shorts? Sounds like a perfect blend of cosmic chaos and laughter. It’s like they’re curating a dedicated space block for all of us sci-fi toon heads. GoGoFan223: Loving the sound of that! An Alien Hour could really showcase the diversity in their extraterrestrial storytelling. Plus, “The Gees” slots in so naturally – they bring a unique charm that could glue the whole hour together. SonicXforever: The potential for an Alien Hour got me thinking – 4Kids has always been about pushing creative boundaries. This could be their way of testing the waters for more themed hours. And honestly, who doesn’t love a good alien tale? PokeNostalgia101: If anyone can make an Alien Hour work, it’s 4Kids. They’ve got a knack for mixing up genres and themes in the coolest ways. And with “The Gees” as comedic relief? Count me in! Just hoping the variety stays fresh and keeps us on our toes. LyokoLover: The more I think about it, the more I get on board with the Alien Hour idea. These characters and stories offer so much in terms of creativity and fun. It’s a brilliant way to keep viewers engaged, especially over the summer when everyone’s looking for an escape. ComicStripKid: An Alien Hour seems like a great strategy to pull viewers into a universe 4Kids is crafting. I mean, alien adventures are timeless, and integrating “The Gees” means there’s never a dull moment. Here’s hoping they take the leap and make it happen! ToonTalker91: It’s all about creating an experience, and an Alien Hour could really set a unique tone for the summer. Plus, it’d give “Four Eyes!” and “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” a fantastic platform to shine even brighter. Fingers crossed 4Kids goes for it!

Plus, those shorts like “The Owl” are perfect palate cleansers between heavier shows. ToonTalker91: “Vampire Hunters” could be the wildcard of the bunch, considering its origin.

I’m genuinely surprised but kind of saw it coming after “Tomodachi Life” vanished and WoQ took over its webpage on 4kids.tv back in April. It was like a silent drumroll! ToonArchivist42: Yeah, I noticed the webpage swap too! It was pretty low-key, but definitely hinted at something big. “World of Quest” has that unique blend of humor and adventure that’s been missing. Glad CW4Kids is bringing back some fan favorites. DigitalScribe: The subtle hints were there with the webpage transition, but seeing “World of Quest” officially back is exciting! The show always had potential; it just needed the right moment to shine again. Looks like that time is now.

Either way, glad to see some strategy behind this nostalgia revival. “World of Quest” has a dedicated fanbase that’s been waiting for this.

AdventureAwait: This is the best news! “World of Quest” has that rare mix of epic quests and laugh-out-loud moments. It’s the comeback I didn’t know I was waiting for. Really curious to see if they’ll introduce new characters or stick with the classic crew. PixelPundit: Super psyched for the return, but also intrigued by how it’ll fit with the rest of the CW4Kids lineup. It’s quite diverse this year. “World of Quest” brings a specific flavor that complements the existing shows. Kudos to whoever’s curating the fall schedule! QuestLoreMaster: As a longtime fan, seeing Quest back feels like rediscovering a lost treasure. The character dynamics, the quirky humor, everything! I’m here for it all.

That show was a gem that deserved more spotlight. And “Four Eyes!” has that fresh, quirky vibe that could really resonate with the audience. CW4Kids is on a roll here. ToonTalker91: The block extension to 12:30pm is curious. It’s like they’re pacing themselves for a larger strategy, possibly eyeing to dominate the Saturday morning cartoon space even more. More shows mean more diversity in content, and I’m all for that. PixelPundit: As much as I love this news, I wonder how they’ll pace the introduction of “Four Eyes!” and “World of Quest” within the current lineup.

Write a convo saying TL was cancelled due to Nintendo ditching the 3ds to concentrate on the Switch, thry offered 4Kids to dub a SMO series, but they declined in favor of adding G&G to 4KidsTV","output":"Thread Title: Why \\"Tomodachi Life\\" Got Dropped: Behind the Scenes Insights 🎮🚫 GamerToonFan: Just read an interesting piece about why \\"Tomodachi Life\\" got axed from the CW4Kids lineup. Apparently, Nintendo decided to shift its focus entirely to the Switch, leaving the 3DS—and by extension, \\"Tomodachi Life\\"—in the dust. They even offered 4Kids the chance to dub a \\"Super Mario Odyssey\\" series, but 4Kids passed to bring \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" over to 4KidsTV instead. Thoughts? PixelPundit: Honestly, it's a bold move but makes sense. \\"Tomodachi Life\\" was tied heavily to the 3DS, and with Nintendo moving on, it's a logical step. Shame about the \\"Super Mario Odyssey\\" series, though. That could have been huge for CW4Kids, considering Mario's everlasting popularity. NostalgiaKnight: I'm torn about this. On one hand, \\"Tomodachi Life\\" had its charm tied to the game, but “The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter” has more universal appeal, not grounded in specific console lore. Maybe it's for the best, focusing on content that isn’t as platform-dependent. DigitalScribe: Real missed opportunity with the SMO series, but let’s face it, 4Kids choosing G&G for 4KidsTV shows they’re leaning towards original or less mainstream adapted content. It’s a strategic gamble that could pay off by differentiating their programming slate. ToonArchivist42: Surprising to see Nintendo still offering up properties for adaptation, though. It indicates they’re interested in expanding their franchises into television, outside of conventional games. 4Kids passing on SMO might open doors for other networks or streaming services to step in. ComicRelief: \\"Tomodachi Life\\" was more of a niche show, reflecting a niche game. Jumping to \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" seems like 4Kids is aiming for a broader audience. Plus, who doesn’t love intergalactic adventures? Way more versatile than the game-based show. AdventureAwait: While the tactical shift from \\"Tomodachi Life\\" to focusing on G&G is interesting, I’m curious how this will all play out in terms of viewer engagement. Will fans of the game feel slighted, or will they transition smoothly into the new offerings? QuestLoreMaster: It’s a changing landscape for TV and game adaptations. With Nintendo setting sights on the future, it only makes sense for 4Kids to adapt as well. “Tomodachi Life” had its moment, but the potential for \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" on 4KidsTV could open new creative avenues. Admin_4KidsRevamp: We appreciate all your insights and understandings regarding the shift in our programming. Our goal is always to provide engaging and diverse content that resonates with our audience. While we’re excited about the potential of \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" on 4KidsTV, we acknowledge the unique place \\"Tomodachi Life\\" held for fans.

From what I've gathered, Sonic X's performance on CW4Kids actually influenced the decision against taking on SMO. Seems like they're betting big on Sonic's staying power. GamerToonFan: Wow, so Sonic X had a hand in this too? That's intriguing. Sonic X has indeed been a solid performer for CW4Kids, drawing in consistent viewership. It kind of makes sense that they'd stick with the blue blur over jumping into another big franchise like Mario. Could have been too much of a good thing? NostalgiaKnight: It’s fascinating seeing how behind-the-scenes strategies play out. Sonic X's enduring popularity might have given 4Kids confidence in their existing lineup, feeling the need to experiment with Mario? It’s a cautious approach, but maybe they didn’t want to disrupt the balance they’ve got. DigitalScribe: I can see the logic. 4Kids probably examined Sonic X's appeal and decided not to overcrowd the block with another flagship video game adaptation. While Mario and Sonic both have massive fanbases, keeping focus might be their way of ensuring quality over quantity. ToonArchivist42: There’s also the historical rivalry between Mario and Sonic to consider. Introducing SMO into a territory where Sonic is thriving could have created an unintended competition, even if the fanbases do have a significant overlap. Maybe 4Kids wanted to avoid pitting these icons against each other under their banner. ComicRelief: It really boils down to not fixing what isn’t broken. Sonic X does well, so why risk overshooting with SMO, right? Plus, concentrating on \\"The Adventures of Gloopy and Glitter\\" diversifies content away from video game adaptations alone. Smart move to not put all their eggs in one gaming basket. AdventureAwait: True that. While a part of me mourns the absence of a potential SMO series, Sonic X's track record sorta justifies the choice. And if \\"Gloopy and Glitter\\" fills that new slot with a fresh and engaging narrative, it’ll show 4Kids knows their audience well enough to evolve beyond game-centric shows. QuestLoreMaster: Still, it’s a bittersweet revelation. The idea of Mario and Sonic coexisting on the same TV block is a dream scenario for fans of both. Nonetheless, the decision underscores a careful strategy by 4Kids, prioritizing balance and long-term engagement over the novelty of big names. Admin_4KidsRevamp: It’s great to see such passionate discussions around our programming decisions. Our goal is always to bring diverse and captivating content to our viewers, balancing legacy with innovation. We’re committed to monitoring and adapting our lineup to best serve our audience's interests and appreciate your continued support and feedback.

La afirmación del mesero sugiere que traerá toallas de tela para ayudar a la clienta a secarse o limpiar el derrame en su ropa de manera más efectiva que si utilizara servilletas o papel toalla, los cuales podrían no ser suficientemente absorbentes o podrían deshacerse fácilmente. En muchos establecimientos, especialmente en restaurantes o cafeterías, es común disponer de toallas de tela para atender derrames o accidentes, ya que son más durables y efectivas para absorber líquidos que el papel toalla. Además, en un contexto de atención al cliente, ofrecer una \\"towel\\" (toalla de tela) puede considerarse un gesto de mayor consideración y servicio al intentar solucionar el inconveniente.

Pueden ser pequeñas toallas de mano, toallas de baño de tamaño regular, toallas de playa más grandes, etc. Lo que todas tienen en común es que están hechas de materiales absorbentes, como algodón o microfibra, y se utilizan para secar algo, generalmente el cuerpo o las manos, pero también otras superficies. El contexto de uso (como en un baño, cocina, playa, etc.) a menudo ayuda a determinar o inferir el tipo específico de toalla al que alguien se refiere, pero sin la palabra \\"paper\\" por delante, se entiende que se habla de una toalla de tela.

Además, en muchos casos, el término \\"paños de cocina\\" puede ser más usado para referirse a aquellos utilizados para secar platos y manos o para tareas de limpieza ligera dentro de la cocina. Así que sí, en una cocina, \\"towel\\" traducido como \\"toalla\\", entendiendo que es una toalla específica para esa área de la casa, está bien.

Aunque \\"toalla\\" también es correcto, \\"paño\\" o \\"trapo\\" (este último con un tono más informal y posiblemente menos durable que un paño de cocina específico) son términos que llevan una connotación más cercana al uso cotidiano dentro de la cocina. La elección entre \\"paño\\" y \\"trapo\\" podría depender del tejido, el uso específico, o simplemente preferencias personales o regionales. - **Paño de cocina**: Se refiere específicamente a toallas o telas utilizadas en la cocina para secar la vajilla, las manos, o incluso ayudar en la preparación de alimentos. Son generalmente de una calidad y estética que complementan la decoración de la cocina. - **Trapo de cocina**: Puede usarse para referirse a paños de limpieza más generales, no necesariamente diseñados para secar, sino tal vez más enfocados en la limpieza, como limpiar derrames o limpiar la mesa de la cocina. A veces, la palabra \\"trapo\\" puede connotar un uso más rudo o un objeto que no se preserva tan cuidadosamente como un \\"paño de cocina\\".

Así, podrías considerar anotar ambas traducciones, tal vez con una nota al margen sobre el uso específico de \\"secador\\" en tu región, si sientes que esa distinción es importante para tus objetivos con estos apuntes.

They were really surprised and said they've received a few similar reports this morning. They insisted Nintendo would never intentionally harm consumer property and are looking into it. They're offering a repair service for affected systems. Waiting to see how this unfolds. **User10**: Sounds like it might be more widespread than we thought. Good on Nintendo for offering repairs, but this really highlights the vulnerabilities in connected devices.

According to a press release from Nintendo earlier today, the messages and system bricking were the result of actions taken by a disgruntled employee. Below are the key points from Nintendo's statement: 1. **Internal Sabotage**: An employee, acting without authorization and contrary to company policies, exploited a vulnerability to send out the damaging firmware updates. 2. **Not a Reflection of Company Stance**: Nintendo has emphasized that these actions do not reflect the company's stance towards its legacy consoles and customers. They reiterated their commitment to supporting all their systems and respect for the consumer's right to choose their gaming platform. 3. **Legal Actions**: The individual responsible has been identified, removed from their position, and legal actions are being pursued. 4. **Rectification Efforts**: Nintendo is actively working to repair or replace affected systems at no cost to the consumers and will be rolling out a security update to prevent future unauthorized firmware updates. **User1** (Thread Starter): Wow, I can’t believe it was an inside job. Glad to see Nintendo is taking responsibility and fixing the issue, though. Just submitted my repair request. **User2**: Honestly, this sounds like something out of a movie. An employee going rogue? It’s hard to believe that one person could cause so much chaos. **User3**: While I'm relieved to know the truth, this really puts into perspective how vulnerable our devices can be, even from threats inside of a company. Kudos to Nintendo for handling this swiftly. **User4**: This has got to be a wake-up call for Nintendo and other companies to tighten up their internal security and vetting processes. It's scary to think one disgruntled employee had the power to do all this. **User5**: I'm just hoping they really ramp up their security, not just patch this one issue. It’s unsettling to think our consoles can be turned into paperweights over internal disputes. **User6**: Does anyone know what’s going to happen with the employee? This seems like it's going to be a massive legal battle, considering the damage they caused. **User7**: I read that those affected will also get a year of Nintendo Switch Online for free. It’s a nice gesture, but still, what a mess. **User9**: It’s a stark reminder that the tech we love and use every day is susceptible in ways we might not even consider. Props to Nintendo for their fix, but it’s unfortunate it happened in the first place. **User10**: Interested to see how they’ll prevent something like this from happening again. I hope they share their learnings and improvements publicly to restore consumer confidence. **User11**: Honestly, this story has everything: drama, intrigue, the underdog (consumers) fighting back. Once the dust settles, I wouldn't be surprised to see a documentary or case study on this. **User12**: This turned out to be a weird mix of concerning and reassuring. It's concerning that it happened but reassuring to see the lengths Nintendo is going to in order to make things right. **User8**: **FINAL MODERATOR UPDATE**: We’ll leave this thread open for any further updates or discussion.

Shinji Ikari! The band plays a catchy, jazz-inflected rendition of \\"A Cruel Angel’s Thesis.\\" The curtain parts. SHINJI IKARI, dressed in an unexpectedly sharp suit, strides out. He’s nervous yet somehow ready, a determined look in his eyes, a slight tremble in his steps. **SHINJI** (awkwardly waves) Uh, hi, everyone. I’m Shinji Ikari, and I’ll be your host for Saturday Night... Live? Wow, that feels weird to say. (Laughs, easing into it) I know what you’re thinking. \\"Isn’t he that kid who pilots a giant robot to save humanity? What’s he doing here?\\" Well, it turns out fighting Angels doesn’t exactly pay the bills. Who knew, right? The audience laughs, warming up to him. **SHINJI** (CONT’D) So, here I am! And I promise you, tonight will be a lot less about existential despair and more about... well, sketch comedy. I think. I'm still figuring it out. He shrugs adorably, the audience chuckling. **SHINJI** (CONT’D) You know, hosting SNL is a lot like piloting Evangelion. It’s terrifying, there’s a lot of screaming involved, and if things go south, the whole world sees it implode in real-time. He gestures behind him as the stage transforms, revealing a comically oversized Evangelion unit helmet as part of the set. **SHINJI** (CONT’D) But don’t worry, I’m told that the likelihood of an Angel attack tonight is pretty low. Although, they did ask me to keep my plug suit on hand, just in case. Fashion forward and functional! The audience bursts into laughter. **SHINJI** (CONT’D) (earnest) In all seriousness, though, it’s genuinely amazing to be here. I’ve spent so much of my life feeling... out of place. Tonight, I get to try something new, with all of you. And that's a kind of bravery, right? Anyway, we’ve got a great show for you! [Insert Musical Guest] is here! He beams, finally comfortable in the spotlight. **SHINJI** (CONT’D) So stick around, and let’s get this existential crisis—I mean, party—started!

A continuación, explico cómo se podría tratar cada medida de tendencia central para este tipo de datos: 1. **Moda**: Es la medida de tendencia central más directamente aplicable a datos cualitativos, incluyendo respuestas de \\"Sí\\" y \\"No\\". La moda indica cuál es la categoría más frecuente dentro del conjunto de datos. Por lo tanto, se puede identificar fácilmente si hay más respuestas de \\"Sí\\" o de \\"No\\" en la encuesta. 2. **Mediana**: Tradicionalmente, la mediana se utiliza para dividir un conjunto de números en dos partes iguales. En el contexto de respuestas de \\"Sí\\" y \\"No\\", podría no ser intuitivo aplicar el concepto de mediana debido a que no hay un orden numérico implícito. Sin embargo, si asignamos valores arbitrarios a las respuestas (por ejemplo, 1 para \\"Sí\\" y 0 para \\"No\\"), podríamos hablar de una \\"mediana\\" en un sentido muy amplio, aunque realmente no proporcionaría mucha información útil en este contexto, ya que reflejaría simplemente el punto en el que el conjunto de datos se divide en dos grupos de igual tamaño, sin reflejar necesariamente una \\"tendencia central\\". 3. **Media**: En teoría, la media (promedio) no es aplicable directamente a datos nominales como las respuestas de \\"Sí\\" y \\"No\\". Sin embargo, si, como en el caso de la mediana, asignamos valores numéricos a las respuestas (1 para \\"Sí\\" y 0 para \\"No\\"), podríamos calcular un promedio que nos daría una idea del porcentaje de \\"Síes\\" en nuestra muestra. Aunque este cálculo es matemáticamente válido, es importante recordar que se basa en una asignación arbitraria de valores y debe interpretarse con precaución. Este promedio nos daría un indicador de la proporción de respuestas afirmativas dentro del conjunto de datos. En resumen, si bien ciertas medidas de tendencia central, particularmente la moda, pueden aplicarse de manera más directa y significativa a encuestas con respuestas de \\"Sí\\" y \\"No\\", el uso de otras medidas como la mediana y especialmente la media, requiere de interpretaciones adaptativas y asignaciones de valor que pueden brindar información sobre la distribución de las respuestas, siempre que se hagan y se interpreten con cuidado."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 6-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 10 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that triggers its effects at the onset of every turn, its effects regress me by 1.25 years physically and mentally and ages her by 1.25 years in return, so throughout the duel my stats should slowly decrease while hers increase. Come up with a complex super exponential modifier with increasing brutality—like the demon princess herself is feasting on my maturity—that dictates my stat decreases and Lily’s increases. (Don’t make it simple). Round numbers when needed. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the casting is still successful but the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give a list of 20 spells ranging from baby spells to adept spells (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker.","output":"# Dueling Magic: Sapphire vs. Lily The Setup: As the reigning champion of the teen division in magic dueling, Sapphire, a 16-year-old skilled mage, accepts a bold challenge from 6-year-old Lily, an unexpected and seemingly underpowered opponent. The duel is governed by points awarded for the beauty and complexity of spells cast, with each mage taking turns over eight rounds to showcase their magical prowess. Initial Stats: - **Sapphire:** - **Spell Power:** 95 - **Performance:** 90 - **Lily:** - **Spell Power:** 40 - **Performance:** 60 The Spells List (with required Spell Power and base points): 1. **Glittering Veil** (SP: 20, Points: 50) 2. **Wand Waltz** (SP: 30, Points: 60) 3. **Spectral Butterflies** (SP: 40, Points: 70) 4. **Aurora Blaze** (SP: 50, Points: 80) 5. **Echoes of Eld** (SP: 60, Points: 90) 6. **Celestial Cascade** (SP: 70, Points: 100) 7. **Luminous Labyrinth** (SP: 75, Points: 110) 8. **Phantom Serenade** (SP: 80, Points: 120) 9. **Twilight Tempest** (SP: 85, Points: 130) 10. **Veil of Valor** (SP: 85, Points: 135) 11. **Mystic Mirage** (SP: 90, Points: 140) 12. **Starfire Symphony** (SP: 95, Points: 150) 13. **Siren’s Swirl** (SP: 100, Points: 160) 14. **Nebula Net** (SP: 105, Points: 170) 15. **Empyrean Elegy** (SP: 110, Points: 180) 16. **Astral Avalanche** (SP: 115, Points: 190) 17. **Fable of the Phoenix** (SP: 120, Points: 200) 18. **Eclipse Entanglement** (SP: 125, Points: 215) 19. **Galactic Gale** (SP: 130, Points: 230) 20. **Cosmic Conundrum** (SP: 135, Points: 250) The Age and Stats Modifier: At the start of the duel, Lily clandestinely casts a spell that ages her by 1.25 years and regresses Sapphire similarly with each turn. This not only alters their physical and mental states but also inversely affects their spellcasting abilities - Sapphire's stats decrease while Lily's increase. **Modifier Formula:** - **For Sapphire:** Each turn, her Spell Power and Performance stats decrease by 5 + (1.25^(Round Number)), rounded. - **For Lily:** Each turn, her Spell Power and Performance increase by 3 + (1.25^(Round Number - 1)), rounded. # Round 1 Starting Stats: - **Sapphire**: Spell Power: 95, Performance: 90. - **Lily**: Spell Power: 40, Performance: 60. The Duel Begins: # Round 1: Sapphire's choice of spell begins the duel. Please indicate the first spell Sapphire casts. Lily, on her side, casts **Glittering Veil**. Remember, as the duel progresses, Sapphire's ability to cast high-power spells will diminish due to the curse cast by Lily, adjusting the difficulty of Sapphire's spellcasting efforts to a peak challenge. The duel will test Sapphire’s strategy, forcing her to anticipate the diminishing returns of her advancing age regression and Lily's increasing prowess. Keep in mind, the spells listed above cannot be recast once used, demanding a tactical approach to spell selection and timing. **Please inform the next action Sapphire takes to proceed with the duel.**"},{"instruction":"esta esta funcion de clijure optimizada y funciona correctamente?: \\"\\"(defn fibonacci-nth [n] (loop [prev-prev 0 prev 1 i 3] (if (< i n) (recur (loop [prev-prev prev prev (+ prev prev-prev) i (+ i 1)]) prev)))\\"\\"","output":"La función de Clojure que has proporcionado intenta calcular el n-ésimo número de Fibonacci, pero parece haber un error de sintaxis y lógica en tu implementación. En particular, el uso de \`loop\` dentro de \`recur\` no es correcto, ya que \`recur\` vuelve a lanzar el \`loop\` más interno con nuevos parámetros. Además, la función no devuelve correctamente el valor cuando \`n\` es 1 o 2, y no hay una cláusula \`else\` en tu condición \`if\`, lo que significa que no va a devolver un valor en todos los casos. Te proporcionaré una versión corregida y optimizada para calcular el n-ésimo número de Fibonacci: \`\`\`clojure (defn fibonacci-nth [n] (loop [prev-prev 0 prev 1 i 2] ; Iniciamos desde 2 porque ya conocemos los 2 primeros números de Fibonacci (if (= i n) prev (recur prev (+ prev prev-prev) (inc i))))) \`\`\` Esta función funciona de la siguiente manera: - Comienza con los dos primeros números de la secuencia de Fibonacci, \`0\` y \`1\`, y un contador \`i\` iniciado en \`2\` porque ya conocemos los primeros dos valores de Fibonacci. - En cada iteración del bucle, calcula el próximo número de Fibonacci sumando los dos anteriores. Incrementa el \`i\` para acercarse al valor de \`n\`. - Si \`i\` es igual a \`n\`, significa que hemos alcanzado el n-ésimo número y podemos devolver el valor actual de \`prev\`, que es el n-ésimo número de Fibonacci. - De lo contrario, usa \`recur\` para volver a ejecutar el \`loop\` con los valores actualizados, sin generar llamadas de función adicionales, lo que es más eficiente y óptimo en Clojure y evita el desbordamiento de pila que puede ocurrir con una recursión profunda. Aquí, el uso correcto de \`loop\` y \`recur\` permite calcular eficientemente el número deseado en la secuencia de Fibonacci sin recurrir a una recursión no tail-optimized, lo que podría ser problemático para valores grandes de \`n\`. Para mejorar aún más, debieras considerar agregar una verificación al principio de la función para manejar los casos en que \`n\` sea 1 o menor, devolviendo 0 para \`n\` igual a 1, y quizás lanzar un error o devolver un valor específico para \`n\` menos que 1, ya que los números de Fibonacci no están definidos para esos casos."},{"instruction":"que es prev en clojure?","output":"En Clojure, así como en otros lenguajes de programación, \`prev\` no tiene un significado intrínseco o especial por sí mismo.

En el contexto del cálculo de números de Fibonacci que mencioné anteriormente, \`prev\` se usa para referirse al número de Fibonacci previamente calculado en la secuencia. Dado que el cálculo de Fibonacci se basa en los dos números anteriores para obtener el siguiente (\`F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)\`), se utilizan dos variables (\`prev-prev\` y \`prev\` en mi ejemplo corregido) para mantener estos dos últimos valores durante la iteración. - **\`prev-prev\`** se refiere al valor de Fibonacci dos pasos atrás en la secuencia (o el \\"anterior al anterior\\"). - **\`prev\`** se refiere al valor de Fibonacci inmediatamente anterior en la secuencia.

Esto podría significar que ya tienen experiencia trabajando con físicas en Unity, conocimientos básicos de desarrollo de juegos y están familiarizados con el ciclo de vida del desarrollo de aplicaciones móviles. 2. **Complejidad del diseño de niveles:** La cantidad y complejidad de los niveles previstos afectarán significativamente el tiempo de desarrollo. Los niveles más intricados con múltiples objetivos, rampas y obstáculos requerirán más tiempo de diseño, modelado y pruebas. 3. **Gráficos y UI:** El tiempo requerido para crear o adquirir activos gráficos y la complejidad de la interfaz de usuario (UI) también varía mucho. Un juego con gráficos simples y una UI básica se desarrollará más rápido que uno con gráficos y UI complejos. 4. **Características adicionales:** Elementos como un sistema de puntuación avanzado, guardar/cargar progreso, integraciones con servicios de terceros (como tablas de líderes), y la adaptación para dispositivos múltiples pueden aumentar considerablemente el tiempo de desarrollo. 5. **Pruebas y depuración:** Este aspecto a menudo se subestima. Asegurarse de que el juego funcione sin problemas en una gama de dispositivos y manejar todos los posibles casos de uso lleva tiempo. Teniendo en cuenta estos factores, aquí hay una **estimación muy aproximada** para un desarrollador con una experiencia intermedia: - **Prototipo inicial (prueba de concepto):** 2-4 semanas. Esto incluiría mecanismos básicos de juego, como la detección de la inclinación y movimiento de la pelota. - **Desarrollo de características y niveles iniciales (3-5 niveles):** 4-8 semanas. Esto dependería de la complejidad de los niveles y las características deseadas. - **Polish, UI básica, y optimización:** 2-4 semanas. Ajustar el juego, mejorar la interfaz de usuario basada en feedback, y optimización general. - **Testing y ajustes finales:** 2-3 semanas. Incluiría pruebas en distintos dispositivos, ajustes basados en feedback, y corrección de bugs. **Total:** Aproximadamente 3-5 meses para un juego básico bien pulido desde la conceptualización hasta el lanzamiento, asumiendo que el desarrollador trabaje a tiempo completo en el proyecto.

El acelerómetro mide la aceleración en todas las direcciones, lo que podemos usar para determinar cómo el usuario está inclinando el dispositivo. A continuación, te muestro cómo hacerlo paso a paso: # Paso 1: Crear un Script en C# Primero, necesitas crear un nuevo script en C# en Unity. Puedes llamarlo \`BallController.cs\`, ya que vamos a usar este script para controlar el movimiento de la bola basándonos en la inclinación del dispositivo. # Paso 2: Acceder al Acelerómetro Unity facilita el acceso al acelerómetro a través de la clase \`Input\`. Aquí tienes un ejemplo básico de cómo podrías comenzar a escribir el script para mover un objeto basado en la inclinación del dispositivo: \`\`\`csharp using UnityEngine; public class BallController : MonoBehaviour { public float speed = 10.0f; // Puedes ajustar la velocidad de movimiento void Update() { // Obtener la inclinación del dispositivo usando el acelerómetro Vector3 tilt = Input.acceleration; // Asegúrate de que el movimiento sea suave en todos los dispositivos tilt = Quaternion.Euler(90, 0, 0) * tilt; // Mover la bola basado en la inclinación GetComponent<Rigidbody>().AddForce(tilt * speed); } } \`\`\` # Paso 3: Aplicar el Script a la Bola - En Unity, seleccione la bola (o el objeto que desea mover) en la jerarquía del proyecto. - Arrastre y suelte el script \`BallController\` en el inspector del objeto seleccionado, o haga clic en \\"Add Component\\" en el inspector y busque \`BallController\` para agregarlo. # Paso 4: Ajustar Parámetros y Probar - Asegúrate de que el objeto que quieres mover (la bola, en este caso) tenga un componente \`Rigidbody\` adjunto para que la física funcione correctamente con él. - Ajusta el valor de \`speed\` en el inspector según sea necesario para obtener la sensación deseada de movimiento. - Prueba el juego en un dispositivo real para experimentar mejor cómo funcionará la inclinación, ya que el editor de Unity no puede simular plenamente el acelerómetro del dispositivo. # Notas Importantes - Este script asume que estás trabajando en un proyecto 3D donde la gravedad y otras físicas ya están configuradas correctamente en Unity. - La línea \`tilt = Quaternion.Euler(90, 0, 0) * tilt;\` es un ajuste para convertir la inclinación del dispositivo en un movimiento más intuitivo en la dirección deseada, pero puede requerir ajustes basados en la orientación predeterminada de tu juego. Implementar la mecánica de control por inclinación es relativamente simple con Unity y C#, pero obtener el \\"sentir\\" correcto para el juego puede requerir un poco de experimentación y ajuste con el valor de \`speed\` y posiblemente modificando cómo aplicas el vector de inclinación al movimiento del objeto."},{"instruction":"Following this marking criteria: 1.

Whyatt will begin the show by greeting the viewers when he suddenly gets a call from someone who needs help. After investigating the problem at hand, Whyatt then summons the other super readers by sending out a call. Whyatt, Pig, Red Riding Hood, and Princess Pea then each appear at the Book Club before going inside as Whyatt then uploads the problem into the Super Duper Computer by plugging his PDA-like device into it. The character with the problem then stands behind a small lectern made of dominos and explains their situation. After discussion, Princess Pea then casts a spell to summon the appropriate book. Whyatt then reads the title of the book as they then transform and fly inside of it. Upon landing, Super Why will begin to read a few sentences of the book with the viewer, asking them to read along. It's then a parallel is drawn in which the character with a problem notices how the book characters face the same problem as they are right now. The goal of the Super Readers is to follow the storyline to solve the problem. As they progress through the events of the story, they encounter obstacles, which can be solved by applying their literacy skills to change the story.

Here is a step-by-step guide to creating a basic book model: 1. Add a Cuboid for the Book Body: - In Blender, switch to Object Mode. - Add a cuboid mesh by going to Add > Mesh > Cube. This cube will serve as the main body of the book. - Scale the cube along the Z-axis to elongate it and shape it like a book. 2. Create Front and Back Covers: - Duplicate the main book body cuboid by selecting it and pressing Shift + D. - Move the duplicated cuboid along the X-axis to create the front cover of the book. - Duplicate the front cover cuboid, move it to the other side of the book body along the X-axis, and scale it slightly smaller to create the back cover. 3. Shape and Position Covers: - Adjust the size and proportions of the front and back covers to match the dimensions of the book body. - Position the front and back covers so they align with the edges of the book body, creating the appearance of a closed book. 4. Combine Book Components: - Select all the book components (book body, front cover, back cover) by holding Shift and clicking on each object. - Press Ctrl + J to join the objects into a single mesh. This will make it easier to manipulate the entire book as one object. 5. Smooth and Shape: - In Edit Mode, select the edges of the book covers and apply a bevel modifier to round off the edges for a more realistic look. - Use proportional editing to shape the book body and covers, giving them a more curved appearance to resemble a typical book shape. 6. UV Unwrapping: - UV unwrap the book model to prepare it for texturing. In Edit Mode, select all faces of the book and unwrap them using the 'Smart UV Project' option. Once you have completed these steps, you will have a basic book model in Blender that consists of a main book body with front and back covers. You can further refine and add details to the book model based on your desired design and style preferences."},{"instruction":"Following this marking criteria: 1.

Let's address the clarification regarding the derivative for the weights when backpropagating from the (k)-th layer: The correct answer is, indeed: A: The product of the output of the (k-1)-th layer and the derivative for the affine value of the (k)-th layer (in that order). This formulation reflects the chain rule application in backpropagation, where the gradient of the loss with respect to the weights in the (k)-th layer ((frac{partial L}{partial W_k})) is computed. Here, the 'output of the (k-1)-th layer' serves as the activations input to the (k)-th layer, and 'the derivative for the affine value of the (k)-th layer' is the gradient of the loss as it has propagated back to the (k)-th layer. The product of these two terms gives the gradient with respect to the weights, indicating how changes in the weights will affect the loss, in the direction and magnitude necessary to reduce the loss when the weights are updated. Thank you for highlighting the mistake, and I hope this clarifies the backpropagation process regarding the weight updates."},{"instruction":"The derivative of the loss w.r.t a parameter w, computed at the current estimate is positive. After taking a step (updating the parameter by a increment dw) the sign of the derivative becomes negative. Mark all true statements Rprop will revert to the earlier estimate and take a smaller step Rprop will change direction and begin taking steps in the opposite direction","output":"Resilient backpropagation (Rprop) is an algorithm used to update the weights in neural networks, designed to eliminate the harmful influence of the partial derivative's magnitude on the weight update. Instead, it uses only the sign of the derivative to determine the direction of the weight update. When dealing with the scenario where the derivative of the loss with respect to a parameter (w) changes sign after an update, let's address the statements given: 1. **Rprop will revert to the earlier estimate and take a smaller step**: This statement is partially misleading in the context of Rprop. Rprop does not exactly \\"revert to the earlier estimate.\\" Instead, if the derivative changes sign, which indicates that the last update overshot the minimum, Rprop decreases the update value (step size) for the next iteration to prevent overshooting again. However, it does not revert the weight to its previous value; it adjusts the step size for future updates. 2. **Rprop will change direction and begin taking steps in the opposite direction**: This statement is true. The fundamental behavior of Rprop, which uses the sign of the derivative, allows it to change the direction of the weight update if the derivative's sign changes from one iteration to the next. This mechanism ensures that the updates always move in the direction opposite to the gradient, which is the essence of gradient descent. However, the nuance to understand here is that the mechanism for changing direction is not about \\"reverting\\" but about adjusting the direction based on the current derivative's sign. In summary, upon encountering a sign change in the derivative of the loss with respect to a parameter, Rprop will: - Adjust the step size for future updates, decreasing it to prevent overshooting, indicative of its strategy to fine-tune the approach towards reaching the minimum of the loss function. - Change the update direction in its subsequent step to reflect the new sign of the derivative, effectively taking steps to minimize the loss by following the gradient descent principle. Therefore, the statement about Rprop beginning to take steps in the opposite direction is correct in the context of how Rprop algorithmically adapts to changes in the gradient's sign, while the idea of Rprop reverting to an earlier estimate might be a misunderstanding of its mechanism to adjust step sizes without explicitly going back to previous parameter values."},{"instruction":"solve directly: The derivative of the loss w.r.t a parameter w, computed at the current estimate is positive.

When Rprop encounters a change in the sign of the derivative across iterations (indicating an overshoot of the minimum), it does not exactly \\"revert to the earlier estimate\\" in the sense of immediately returning to a previous value of (w), but it does adjust the step size for the specific parameter that caused the sign change, reducing it to prevent future overshooting. The nuance here is that while Rprop adjusts the step size down for that parameter to avoid further overshooting, it doesn't literally go back to the previous parameter value. It maintains the updated parameter value but adapts the step size for the next update. This distinction is important for clarity, but in the spirit of the presented choices, considering the intent behind the statement, it aligns with Rprop's mechanism to adapt by reducing step size after a sign change. B. True. Rprop will change the direction of the update for that parameter in response to the sign change of its derivative. This is inherent to the design of Rprop, which uses only the sign of the derivative to determine the direction of the weight updates. If the derivative's sign changes from one iteration to the next, it indicates that the last update overshot the minimum, prompting Rprop to adjust the direction of the subsequent update for that parameter. Therefore, both statements A and B are true in the context of how Rprop operates following a change in the sign of the derivative of the loss with respect to a parameter."},{"instruction":"explain breifly, in short this question: On a flat surface of constant slope momentum methods will converge faster than vanilla gradient descent, true or false  True  False (correct) – momentum only changes step size","output":"False. The statement that \\"momentum only changes step size\\" is a misunderstanding of how momentum-based methods enhance the gradient descent process. In fact, on a flat surface of constant slope, momentum methods can help converge faster than vanilla gradient descent. Here's why: Momentum methods, such as SGD with momentum, incorporate a velocity term that accumulates past gradients. This accumulation helps in two main ways: it dampens oscillations in directions of high curvature (or variance in gradients) and accelerates convergence in consistent gradient directions (like a flat surface of constant slope). On a constant slope, the momentum term accumulates the gradient direction, effectively increasing the step size over iterations more significantly than just the raw gradient would suggest. This leads to faster convergence towards the minimum, because momentum \\"pushes\\" the updates further in the direction of the persistent slope than vanilla gradient descent, which only relies on the immediate gradient at each step without considering the direction and magnitude of past steps. Therefore, in the context of the question, the correct understanding would be that momentum methods can indeed converge faster than vanilla gradient descent on a flat surface of constant slope, due to their ability to accumulate direction and magnitude information from previous steps, which enhances the speed of convergence."},{"instruction":"wrong","output":"I apologize for the confusion in my previous response. Let's clarify: The statement in question posits that **on a flat surface of constant slope, momentum methods will converge faster than vanilla gradient descent**, with the expected answer being **False** based on the explanation that \\"momentum only changes step size.\\" The key point of misunderstanding seems to revolve around the effectiveness of momentum methods compared to vanilla gradient descent in specific scenarios, particularly on a flat surface with a constant slope. # Correct Understanding: On a flat surface of constant slope, the primary benefit of momentum -- which is to help accelerate convergence in directions with consistent gradient orientations by overcoming the issue of oscillations and slow convergence in shallow, flat regions -- doesn't play out as significantly different from vanilla gradient descent in terms of the speed of convergence. This is because, in such a scenario, the gradient (slope) is constant, and thus, both vanilla gradient descent and momentum methods would effectively be applying consistent updates per iteration. However, the crucial insight is that while momentum methods can indeed impact the effective \\"step size\\" by incorporating a velocity component (which accumulates gradients over time), suggesting that they only change the step size might be simplifying their utility. The momentum term can indeed lead to larger or more effective step sizes over iterations by leveraging past gradients. Yet, on a perfectly flat surface with a constant slope, this characteristic does not inherently translate to **faster** convergence compared to vanilla gradient descent because both approaches are subject to the same gradient information per iteration; momentum's advantage primarily lies in navigating through more complex topographies (e.g., ravines, saddle points) rather than on uniform slopes. Therefore, in the specific scenario described (a flat surface of constant slope), stating that momentum methods will converge faster could be misleading, as the convergence rate in this context would be more closely tied to the learning rate settings and the consistent application of gradients, rather than the momentum term's impact on overcoming oscillation or acceleration through varied topographies. My apologies for the oversight, and I hope this clarification accurately addresses the scenario."},{"instruction":"Following this marking criteria: 1.

Before he [Wukong] can [Wukong] claim his [Wukong's] victory, his [Wukong's] old rival in the form of the technocratic cult/secret society/PMC possessing advanced cybernetic, plasma and genetic manipulation technology with dreams of World Domination, the Red Ribbon Army [Dragon Ball franchise] shows up, and in the chaos Wukong finds himself [Wukong] blasted into what he [Wukong] later discovers is [Wukong] the far-future of the 21th century via [Wukong] taking a energy displacement weapon meant for Bulma. The then prince of the Saiyans, the arrogant black-haired, black-eyed, tall and muscular Vegeta [DBZ] still is deployed to Earth in order to destroy it [Earth] and recover Kakarot, but [Vegeta] never meets Wukong and [Vegeta] is [Vegeta] forced to find work as a mercenary in the service of pre-shogunate Japan, the tribes of Mongolia and Manchuria and even the Germanic Holy Roman Empire-dominated Europe but [Vegeta] still meets and [Vegeta] marries Bulma, although he [Vegeta] doesn't tell her [Bulma] who and what he [Vegeta] really is. Vegeta's descendants through his [Vegeta's] first son by Bulma, the blue-haired, blue-eyed, intellectually gifted but also immensely strong Saiyan-human hybrid Trunks [Dragon Ball franchise] eventually move to Japan sometime after the fall of the Tang dynasty and [Trunks's descendants] subsequently intermarry with the Japanese, [Trunks's descendants] subsequently being absorbed into the Japanese as the centuries go on. Many centuries after Bulma's and Wukong's time, the post-1868, pre-1947 Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato-ruled Unitary parliamentary semi-constitutional monarchy of the Great Japanese Empire/Empire of Great Japan/Japanese Empire/Imperial Japan/Third Japanese Empire is [the Japanese Empire in this fic] restored [the Japanese Empire in this fanfic] as the government [the Japanese Empire] of Japan after the series of natural disasters, continent-wide wars and nuclear exchanges resulting in flames exploding around the world, devastating it [Earth] and leaving most parts of the planet uninhabitable, with continents being torn apart and some nations being utterly obliterated known as the Great Cataclysm [Fire Force], which [the Great Cataclysm in this story] is [the Great Cataclysm in this story] the same even as the global intercontinental military conflict and power bloc war within the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe that lasted from 2045 to 2064 and started as a result of a military conflict between the post-Soviet successor state of the oligarch and KGB-controlled unitary presidential republic of the Russian Federation ruling over Siberia and the Russian Far East from Russia and the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner and Outer Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Greater Manchuria over immigration due to global cooling starting around 2030 which was already worsened by advanced agricultural production becoming a solar-powered industry in 2020, leading to a temporary population boom [the conflict which lasted from 2045 to 2064 in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe] known as the Third World War [Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei] and the unprecedented catastrophe that assaulted the earth in which meteors rained down across the world, bringing severe destruction to many cities known as the Invertia [Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku], [the Third World War in the Mahōka Kōkō no Rettōsei universe being the same as the Great Cataclysm from Fire Force and the Invertia from Gakusen Toshi Asutarisuku in this story] with the ancient clan of extra-terrestial horned humanoid creatures with immense psychic and magical power known as the Ōtsutsuki clan [Naruto], which [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] is [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] descended [ the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fic] from [the Ōtsutsuki clan's parent house in this fic] the Masaki Ouchou/Juraiouke [Tenchi Muyo!] [this fic's Masaki dynasty-descended version of the Ōtsutsuki clan] acting as this neo-Japanese Empire's imperial family [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] after [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] fleeing [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] from the hidden-from the rest of the world, mythical, stuck on the feudal era of Japanese and the Ming and Song dynasty era of Chinese history politically, socially and economically, having the mythical combination of ki/qi and spiritual energy known as chakra-using fake shinobi and wuxia style cultivator mega continent known as the Elemental Nations [Naruto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] setting in the ruins of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] being [what happened to the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] mistaken for [what the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic were |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| mistaken |the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan| for] the Japanese Imperial House of Great Yamato, the real-life Japanese Imperial family [the Imperial House of Great Yamato] by [who mistook the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the Imperial House of Great Yamato] the residents of post-apocalyptic Kyoto, this mistake [the residents of post-Great Cataclysm Kyoto mistaking the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan for the surviving remnants of Imperial House of Great Yamato left in post-Great Cataclysm Japan] allowing it [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] to [the Ōtsutsuki clan this fanfic] rebuild its [the Ōtsutsuki clan's in this fanfic's] new home [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] and [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this fanfic] use it [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] as a base [post-apocalyptic Kyoto] for the eventual annhilation, conquest, absorption and assmilation of the myriad warlord states, bandit hideouts and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm, [the assimilation of the myriad of warlord states, bandit fiefdoms and Yakuza strongholds infesting Japan after the Great Cataclysm by the fortified, rebuilt, restructured and rejuvinated post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] ending with the conquest and subsequent assmilation of the de-jure constitutional parliamentary imperial monarchy but de facto theocratic industrial theocratic city state of the Raffles-dynasty ruled Great Tokyo Empire [Fire Force] in post-Great Cataclysm Tokyo into the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule, which [the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule] marked the reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule and the end of the post-Great Cataclysm warlord era in Japan. The creatures of Grimm [human and supernatural eating carnivorous monsters |Grimm| that |Grimm| do not |what the Grimm do not have| possess a soul, |the Grimm| being |what happens to the Grimm| drawn towards |what attracts the Grimms’ presence| negative emotions such as jealously, grief, loneliness, hatred and fear, |the Grimms’ attraction to negativity| causing them |the Grimms| to often congregate on the source of these emotions, |the Grimm| attacking any humans and supernatural creatures they |the Grimm| encounter on sight, |the Grimm| from |the media franchise the Grimm are (the Grimm) from| RWBY] also emerge after the Great Cataclysm all over the world along with the Infernals [former humans that spontaneous combust and |the Infernals| become |what the Infernals become after spontaneous combustion| misshapen fiery charcoal-like monsters, the Infernals being |what the Infernals are| a common feature and |the Infernals| a ever-present threat |the Infernals| in the post-Great Catalclysm world, |the Infernals| being |the Infernals| from |the franchise the Infernals are (the Infernals) from Fire Force] and the Gastrea [deadly parasites |Gastrea| that |Gastrea| transform |who Gastrea transform| their |the Gastrea’s| victims into |what the Gastrea transform their (the Gastrea’s victims) into mutated, superhuman, human-eating, powerful monsters (the endstage of a Gastrea infection), |the Gastrea| from |the media franchise the Gastrea are (the Gastrea) from| Black Bullet] Since the Ōtsutsuki clan was [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] mistaken [the Ōtsutsuki clan in this story] to be the surviving post-Great Cataclysm descendants of the Imperial House of Great Yamato who [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] had [the Ōtsutsuki clan in the eyes of the Japanese people in this story] regained their [the members of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] supernatural abilities gained from their [the members' of the Imperial House of Great Yamato's] descent from the gods of the Shinto pantheon, nobody in the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese Empire ever finds out the truth [about the post-Great Cataclysm Japanese imperial family] and so the secret of chakra [Naruto] and the Elemental Nations is kept safe within the members of the Ōtsutsuki clan. The reunification of Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule allows for the quick reconstruction and rebuilding of the country [Japan after the Great Cataclysm under Ōtsutsuki rule] and pre-Great Cataclysm luxuries such as electricity, bullet trains, the internet and running water soon return to Japan due to the merger of the Great Tokyo Empire's steampunk and dieselpunk technology with the advanced extraterrestrial technology and industry from brought from Jurai and the surviving pre- Great Cataclysm Japanese, American and even Russian technology left behind. In fact, the seizure of the unimaginably powerful flame or energy that be used to bring both creation and destruction, not connected to the physical laws of Earth but connected to collective minds, emotions, and perceptions of humanity known as the Adolla Burst [Fire Force]-powered infinite energy providing thermal-powered generator located in the Central Ward of the Tokyo Empire, the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" [Eternity-Style Thermal Power Generation \\"Amaterasu\\" |Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"|] from [the media franchise the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" is |the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"| from] Fire Force, [the seizure of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] during the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule is what will prove useful in the stability of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire. The Ōtsutsuki soon discover the presence of the blonde-haired, blue-eyed, tall, slender and buxom, very manipulative, volatile and misanthropic nature Adolla Burst having survivor of the Great Cataclysm known only as Amaterasu [Fire Force] inside the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" after the conquest of the Great Tokyo Empire by the post-apocalyptic patchwork of states held together by the rule of post-apocalyptic Kyoto under Ōtsutsuki rule and [the Ōtsutsuki] quickly rescue Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\", [ The Ōtsutsuki rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] copying her [Amaterasu's] Adolla Burst and placing the copy [of Amaterasu's Adolla Burst] inside the the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" to power it [ the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] while [The Ōtsutsuki after |The Ōtsutsuki| rescuing Amaterasu from the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\"] scanning her [Amaterasu's] memories and [The Ōtsutsuki] discovering the presence of the extraterrestrial god-like entity with immense reality warping powers known only as the Evangelist [Fire Force] and its [the Evangelist's] cult organization with the goal of recreating the Great Cataclysm, the White Clad [Fire Force] within the Great Tokyo Empire's territories. The Ōtsutsuki soon begin constructions of replicas of the Kuonshiki Karyokuhatsuden \\"Amaterasu\\" all through post-Great Cataclysm Japan. Japan's Bicameral national legislature with the ability to pass laws and also to nominate the Japanese prime minister, consisting of a lower house, called the House of Representatives and an upper house, the House of Councillors, which [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] are [the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors] directly elected under a parallel voting system, the National Diet, [the National Diet] also resumes operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. In fact the bill that restores the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is passed through the National Diet. Japan’s central coordinating law enforcement agency of the Japanese police system responsible for supervising Japan’s 47 prefectural police departments and determining their general standards and policies, though it can command police agencies under it in national emergencies or large-scale disasters, under the Japanese Cabinet Office commission responsible for guaranteeing the neutrality of the police system by insulating the force from political pressure and ensuring the maintenance of democratic methods in police administration, the National Public Safety Commission of the Japanese Cabinet Office, the Japanese National Police Agency, the elite tactical unit equivalent to the US Delta Force/US CIA SOG black ops death squads of the Japanese police force maintained by individual Japanese prefectural police forces and supervised by the Japanese National Police Agency and also national-level counterterrorism unit that cooperates with territorial-level Anti-Firearms Squads and Counter-NBC Terrorism Squads, the Special Assault Team, post-WW2's Japan's domestic intelligence agency administered by the Japanese Ministry of Justice tasked with internal security and espionage against threats to Japanese national security, contributing to Japanese government policy by providing relevant organizations with necessary foreign and domestic data (collected through investigations and intelligence activities) on subversive organizations, the Public Security Intelligence Agency and the post-WW2 Japanese intelligence agency under the Cabinet Secretariat responsible for gathering, processing, and analyzing national security information for the cabinet, reporting directly to the Japanese Prime Minister, the Cabinet Intelligence and Research Office, [the Japanese NPA, the SAT, PISA and CIRO] soon resume their [the Japanese NPA's, the SAT's, PISA's and CIRO's] respective operations after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The unified military forces of post-WW2 Japan, controlled by the Japanese Ministry of Defense with the Japanese Prime Minister as commander-in-chief, without offensive warmaking capabilities but with an inherent right to self-defense, the Japanese Self Defence Forces, [the JSDF] along with the JSDF's special forces unit with a mission of infiltration into enemy territory, reconnaissance, sabotage, and hostage rescue, and conducting military operations against guerrillas or enemy commandos during wartime, the Special Forces Group, [the JSDF and SFG] also return to full operational capacity after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. SOG and SAT teams accompanied by PIRO agents with support given by CIRO under the direct supervision of the National Diet then begin covert operations against the White Clad in the Great Tokyo Empire's former territories, with White Clad members being captured in these operations being taken to black sites for processing and interrogation. Seperate teams of JSDF soliders and SOG agents along with SAT teams also begin Grimm [RWBY] and Infernal [Fire Force] extermination work within Japan. The Japanese policing organization, established within the Japanese Home Ministry for the purpose of carrying out high policing, domestic criminal investigations, and control of political groups and ideologies deemed to threaten the public order of the Japanese Empire with functions of criminal investigation and counter-espionage, the Tokkō [Special Higher Police |Tokkō|], [the Tokkō] also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's combined military forces, the Imperial Japanese Armed Forces, [the IJAF] also make a return after the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, with the JSDF being reduced to a defence force. After the restoration of the IJAF in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule, special influence is placed on the reconstruction of the Japanese Empire’s ground combat force and the land warfare division of the IJAF, the Imperial Japanese Army as a professional, well-trained army [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJA] living up to the best standards of the pre-Great Cataclysm world. the IJA’s military police with civilian secret police, espionage, and counter-intelligence roles within the Greater Japanese Empire with duties of maintaining military discipline, enforcing conscription laws, protecting vital military zones, and investigating crimes among soldiers while also issuing travel permits, recruited labor, arrested resistance, requisitioned food and supplies, spread propaganda, and suppressed anti-Japanese sentiment in areas occupied by the IJA during wartime, the Kempeitai also makes a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The IJAF's elite Japanese special forces/airborne unit, the Teishin Shudan [Raiding Group |Teishin Shudan|], [the Teishin Shudan] is [the Teishin Shudan] also restored [the Teishin Shudan] after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Imperial Japan's hereditary peerage, the Kazoku [magnificent lineage |Kazoku|] is [the Kazoku] also restored [the Kazoku] in Japan the restoration of the Japanese Empire as the government [the Japanese Empire] of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. The restoration of the imperial system [the Japanese Empire] in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] heavily influenced [the restoration of the Japanese Empire in post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule] by the pre-1868 Japanese Tokugawa clan-ruled de jure absolute imperial dynastic constitutional parliamentary monarchy but de facto feudal dynastic hereditary military dictatorship of the Tokugawa shogunate, with the heads of the Tokugawa clan being [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] restored [the heads of the Tokugawa clan] to their [the heads of the Tokugawa clan's] pre-1868 position as sei-i taishōgun [\\"Commander-in-Chiefs of the Expeditionary Force Against the Barbarians\\" |sei-i taishōgun|, |sei-i taishōgun| abbreviated |sei-i taishōgun| and more popularly known as shogun, |sei-i taishōgun| the hereditary military rulers |the sei-i taishōgun| of Japan during most of the period spanning from 1185 to 1868, |the sei-i taishōgun| having civil, military, diplomatic and judicial authority]. The restored Tokugawa shoguns have a position more akin to that of the constitutional monarchs of Europe or the Germanic Reichskanzlers [Imperial Chancellors] in days gone past however. The collection of various powers that supported the various shogunates of Japanese history and the hereditary military nobility and officer caste of medieval and early-modern Japan from the late 12th century until their abolition in the late 1870s with high prestige and special privileges, the buke [military families |buke|], [the buke] better known [the buke] outside of Japan and East Asia as [the buke's other, more famous name] the samurai, [the samurai] also make a return after the reunifcation and subsequent reconstruction of post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule. Thus, the restored Japanese Empire ruling over post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule is formally known as the Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta [the Empire of Great Japan under the Tokugawa Tent Government |Dai Nihon Teikoku wa Tokugawa Bakufu no ge de ari mashi ta|] or simply the Teikoku Bakufu [Imperial Shogunate |Teikoku Bakufu|]. After rebuilding its [Japan's] sociopolitical, military and governmental institutions and [Japan] restructuring itself, post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule seeks to reclaim all of the territories outside of the Japanese Home Islands that were once ruled by the Japanese Empire before 1947: mainly the entire Korean peninsula, Taiwan and the Pengu Islands and Russia's Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. Post-Great Cataclysm Japan under Ōtsutsuki rule first starts with Korea, which [Korea] is [Korea] in a state of chaos, disarray and confusion after the joint collapse of the Soviet satellite and later on post-Soviet Russia dictatorship of the Korean nationalist, Korean supremacist, Leninist-Stalinist Worker's Party of Korea-ruled totalitarian communist dictatorship of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea occupying North Korea and the unitary presidential republic Republic of Korea occupying South Korea in the wake of the Great Cataclysm. The restored IJAF and buke quickly invades post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea and [The restored IJAF and buke] seize the area [post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea ] with ease, [The restored IJAF and buke during the invasion of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea] putting down Korean bandit and terrorist groups along with crime gangs and anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's combined military forces, the ROKAF [Republic of Korea’s Armed Forces] and the ROKAF's strategic-level military command responsible for its [the ROKAF's] special operations forces, its members receiving special training for various unconventional warfare missions and whose primary tasks include guerrilla warfare, special reconnaissance, unconventional warfare, direct action, collecting information in enemy territory and carrying out special missions including assassination, the Republic of Korea Army Special Warfare Command [ROKASWC] along with anti-Japanese remnants of the ROK's primary domestic law enforcement agency run under the ROK's Ministry of the Interior and Safety, divided into 18 local police agencies and having local police forces within the ROK under its command, the Korean National Police Agency, the KNPA's specialized Police tactical unit trained to perform dangerous operations whose main mission is counter-terrorism, but it also can include serving high-risk arrest warrants, performing hostage rescue and/or armed intervention, and engaging heavily armed criminals, the SOU [Special Operations Unit] and the ROK's chief intelligence agency and secret police agency, having the responsibility to supervise and coordinate both international and domestic intelligence activities and criminal investigations by all government intelligence agencies, including that of the ROK's military along with the additional duties of collecting, coordinating, and distributing information on the ROK's strategy and security, the maintenance of documents, materials, and facilities related to the nation's classified information, investigation of crimes affecting national security within the ROK, such as the Military Secrecy Protection Law and the National Security Law, investigation of crimes related to the missions of its staff, along with planning and coordination of information and classified, the National Intelligence Service. The remaining usable elements of the ROKAF and ROKASWC are absorbed into the JSDF and the SOG and the restored IJAF and the TS respectively with the same happening to the KNPA and the SOU with the Japanese NPA and SAT. The remaining usable elements of the NIS are also absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The surviving descendants of the pre-1910 indigenous Korean, slave-owning, sex-slave owning, backward, afraid of progress, Han China worshipping, Confucianist and neo-Confucianist aristocracy and nobility who had immense influence in the post-1392 and pre-1898, Han-Chinese/Korean Royal House of Jeonju Yi-ruled, backward, out of touch Ming and Qing tributary state of the feudal absolute dynastic royal monarchy of the Great Joeson State/Kingdom of Great Joeson/Joeson Kingdom/Joeson, the yangaban are [the yangaban descendants] suppressed [the yangaban descendants] by the restored IJAF and buke along with anti-Japanese, pro-Korean unification elements in post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The PSIA and CIRO launch a campaign in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea to identify and remove anti-Japanese elements, yangaban descendants and pro-Korean unification elements among the South Korean populace while also running a propaganda campaign that states that the return of Japan to the Korean peninsula after the Great Cataclysm and subsequent collapse of both the ROK and DPRK is a necessary measure for the salvation of the Japanese people. JSDF troops from the Japanese Home Islands pour into Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea in order to carry out disaster relief work and reconstruction efforts in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea. The Japanese NPA also starts taking over former KNPA stations and [the Japanese NPA] training new officers in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while also building new stations, with the SAT doing the same. The JSDF takes control of Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea from the restored IJAF and [the JSDF] starts taking over former ROKAF bases and US military bases located in South Korea, and [the JSDF] also begins constructing new bases in Japanese-occupied post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea while training and recruiting new servicemen. After the pacification of post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea, the restored IJAF and buke then assault the former DPRK territory in North Korea from the DMZ border, [the restored IJAF and buke] seizing the former DRPK territory in North Korea with ease due to the DPRK's combined armed forces, the Korean People's Army [KPA] and the elite special forces of the KPA performing military, political, and psychological operations, to create a \\"second front\\" in the enemy's rear area, and to conduct battlefield and strategic reconnaissance during open war, the Korean People’s Army Special Operations Forces, the DPRK’s secret police and concentration camp management agency with special authority to investigate political and economic crimes within the DPRK, the Ministry of State Security, the Reconnaissance General Bureau, the KPA’s military intelligence bureau that [the RGB] manages the DPRK’s clandestine operations and [the RGB] is the DPRK's primary intelligence and clandestine operations organ, the DPRK's domestic law enforcement agency in charge of the DPRK's police system along with operating the prison system in the DPRK, monitoring the public distribution system and providing bodyguards to important persons, the Ministry of Social Security, along with the DPRK's paramilitary force subordinate to the ministry which performs various internal security and border security tasks within the DPRK while being in charge of guarding the Military Demarcation Line, borders, and coasts, as well as major strategic facilities such as government offices, the Central Committee Yongbyon nuclear facilities, power plants and broadcasting facilities, being the DPRK's combined national gendarmerie and civil defense organization organized in military lines, the Social Security Forces [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS, the RGB and the SSF] essentially being [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] unable to [the KPA, KPASOF, the MSS [State and Social] and the RGB] control the DPRK's population after the Great Cataclysm and [the KPA, KPASOF, the DPRK's MSS [State and Social], the SSF and the RGB] essentially unable to hold off the Japanese invaders. After the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the restored Japanese Empire takes steps to reintergrate the people of both North and South Korea into Japan. The usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF are [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] absorbed [the usable elements of the KPA and KPASOF] into the restored IJAF, JSDF, SOG and the TS respectively after the conquest of the former DPRK territory in North Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, with the same happening to the MSS [Social] and the Japanese NPA and the SSF and the SAT. The usable elements of the RGB are absorbed into both the PSIA and CIRO. The concentration camps within the DPRK's territory once ran by the Ministry of State Security are dissolved by the restored IJAF and buke and the political prisoners in these concentration camps freed. Like in South Korea, the PSIA and CIRO both run a propaganda campaign while JSDF troops pour into the former DPRK from the Japanese Home Islands, doing disaster relief and reconstruction efforts while putting down Russian loyalists and remnants of the WPK and former DPRK government in South Korea. The JSDF also takes over former KPA bases in the former DPRK and [the JSDF] begins constructing new bases in the former DPRK, [the JSDF] training ethnic North Korean recruits. The Japanese NPA also takes over police stations formerly run by the Ministry of Social Security and begins constructing new ones. After the conquest of both post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK North Korea and post-Great Cataclysm, post-ROK South Korea by the restored IJAF and buke, the Japanese restore the post-1910, pre-1947 Japanese province of Chōsen as the government [Chōsen] of the entire Korean peninsula. Sometime after the reconquest of Korea and the restoration of Chōsen as its [ post-Great Cataclysm, post-DPRK and post ROK Korea's] government, the Japanese then turn their [the Japanese's] attention to the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands which they [the Japanese] conquer with ease. The post-1907, pre-1947 Japanese province of Karufuto is [Karufuto] restored [Karufuto] as the government [Karufuto] of the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands after their [the Sakhalin's and Kuril Islands's] joint reconquest by the Japanese. After the reconquest of Korea, the Sakhalin and Kuril Islands, Japan turns its [Japan's] attention towards Taiwan and the Pengu Islands, which [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] have [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] been [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] in chaos ever since the fall of the Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese nationalist, Chinese imperialist, Marxist-Stalinist political party/militant group/secret society of the KMT/Kuomingtang and the joint American-Soviet satellite state the KMT ruled with an iron fist, the Unitary, adhering to Sun Yat Sen's three principles of the people, nationalism, democracy and socialism [social welfare] one-party ruled and dominated directorial republic under a military dictatorship of the Second Republic of China/Nationalist China/National Government of the Republic of China which [Nationalist China] had [Nationalist China] been in exile [Nationalist China] on Taiwan since 1949 after the latter [the KMT and Nationalist China] lost the Chinese Civil War of 1947-1949 to [the political party and geopolitical entity the KMT and Nationalist China jointly lost the Chinese Civil War to] the de jure Marxist-Leninist, socialist but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist, Chinese supremacist, Chinese Imperialist Chinese Communist Party ruled de jure socialist republic but de facto Han nationalist, Han supremacist People's Republic of China ruling [the PRC] over Han China, Guangdong, Guangxi, East Turkestan, Inner Mongolia, Tibet, Shanxi and Yunnan from [the PRC's stronghold and home base] Manchuria, [the collapse of Nationalist China in exile in Taiwan and the Pengu Islands since 1947] as a result of the Great Cataclysm. The Cantonese-Han Chinese secret societies/criminal organizations known as the Triads taking up residence in post-Great Cataclysm, post-KMT and Nationalist China Taiwan and the Pengu Islands along with the post-Great Cataclysm surviving renmants of the ROCAF's elite special forces unit tasked with carring out special operations, including decaptation strikes in the events of a war, the Airborne Special Service Company, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency which [the Nationalist Chinese NPA] falls under the Nationalist Chinese Ministry of the Interior and [the NPA] oversees all all police forces within National China on a national level, the Nationalist Chinese National Police Agency's specialist unit and highly trained police tactical unit conducting high-risk arrests and other dangerous law enforcement duties, the Thunder Squad along with Nationalist China's principal intelligence agency created to supervise and coordinate all security-related administrative organizations, military agencies and KMT organizations in Taiwan, gathering, International intelligence, Intelligence within the area of People's Republic of China, Intelligence within the area of Taiwan, Analysis of the nation's strategic intelligence, , Scientific and technological intelligence and telecommunications security, Control and development of secret codes (the matrix) and facilities, Armed Forces Internet Security while also taking charge of planning special tasks and is responsible for guiding, coordinating, and supporting the intelligence affairs in military and civil categories in addition to managing intelligence relevant to national security, the National Security Bureau are no match for the restored IJAF and buke and Taiwan and the Pengu Islands are [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] quickly reintergated [Taiwan and the Pengu Islands] into the Japanese imperial fold.

The post-Great Cataclysm world bore the scars of its past, none more so than this borderland, a witness to countless battles in the aftermath of the cataclysm that reshaped the world. Inside a makeshift command tent, officers of the post-Great Cataclysm restored Imperial Japanese Army (IJAF) gathered around a holographic map, their faces set in grim determination. Among them, Captain Haruto Takeshi, a veteran of the JSDF, and Lieutenant Aiko Himura, a pilot of the IS units, prepared their units for the inevitable clash. \\"The Han Chinese warlords have overstepped,\\" Captain Takeshi began, his voice steady. \\"Their bandits attacked our patrols, thinking we were rival warlord troops. We have the green light for reclamation.\\" Lieutenant Himura, her expression resolute, added, \\"Our Strike Witches and IS unit pilots are ready. The Diva contractees and Toji have been deployed along the front. We will not let these warlords threaten the stability we've worked so hard to achieve.\\" The tent's flap opened, allowing a brief gust of cold air inside. A messenger, breathless from his run, saluted sharply. \\"Captain, we've received word. The anti-warlord Manchu resistance fighters have offered their support. They've been waiting for an opportunity to rid their homeland of these bandits.\\" Nods of approval met this news. The reclamation of Manchuria was not just a military campaign; it was a unification effort, drawing together remnants of the past to build a stable future. As dawn broke, the combined forces of the restored IJAF, alongside their newfound allies, moved toward the heart of Manchuria. The Strike Witches took to the skies, blazing trails of energy as they darted forward. Below them, the ground forces, a mixture of JSDF troops, SAT teams, and Manchu resistance fighters, advanced with unwavering resolve. The battle, when it came, was fierce. The warlord's cultivators and martial artists, drawing upon mystical arts older than the ruins they defended, clashed against the technologically advanced invaders. But for every wave of elemental fire or wind summoned against them, the IJAF's forces responded with plasma projectiles and the searing beams of IS units. In the chaos, Aiko dove through enemy ranks, her IS unit a blur of motion. Each strike from her mech was precise, disrupting the warlords' formations and sewing confusion. Alongside her, the Strike Witches fought valiantly, their enhanced abilities a match for even the most powerful cultivators. The turning point came when Captain Takeshi, leading a squad of Kikai-Ka Heishi, broke through the warlord's last line of defense, allowing the Manchu resistance fighters to surge forward. The sight of their homeland's flag, borne high by the resistance, broke the remaining warlord's will to fight. The village that had stood silent at dawn was now a symbol of unity and strength. As the dust settled, Captain Takeshi and Lieutenant Himura met with the leaders of the Manchu resistance, their handshake marking the beginning of Manchuria's reclamation. \\"We stand at the forefront of a new era,\\" Captain Takeshi proclaimed to the assembled troops and resistance fighters. \\"Today, we've not only reclaimed Manchuria from warlords and bandits but also taken the first step toward restoring the dignity of its people and the security of our nation.\\" The murmurs of agreement grew into cheers, echoing across the recovering landscape. The road ahead was long, and the task of rebuilding daunting, but in that moment, amid the ruins of a village reborn as a symbol of hope, the path forward seemed clear. As the sun climbed higher, casting away the last shadows of night, the combined forces of the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF set their sights on their next objective: the restoration of the Empire of China, guided by the unyielding spirit of unity and the resolve to forge a peaceful future from the ashes of the past. **End of Chapter 27**"},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a military thriller, dystopian cyberpunk pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a techno-thriller, military action, military-thriller, gunplay filled, cyberpunk style, pulp-action, dialogue-filled, action-packed format, focusing on the conflict between the bandit troops, cultivators and martial artists and rouge PLA units of the Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction occupying post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria and the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops after the former [the troops of the Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction occupying post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria] fire on the latter [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops] along the Manchuria-Korean border and the latter [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops] retaliate in response, with the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops subsequently invading post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria as the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops deploy their [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops's] KMFs, TSFs, along with conventional aerial and ground warfare units, Toji, Strike Witches and Kikai-Ka Heishi to help them [the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops] fight the bandit troops, cultivators and martial artists and rouge PLA units of the Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction occupying post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria.","output":"**Chapter 28: Shadows Over Manchuria** The horizon of post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria bled crimson as the sun dipped low, casting long shadows that slithered over the ruins and the rebuilt alike. The air hummed with anticipation, vibrating with the energy of impending conflict. This was a land where the future was being written by those bold enough to claim it, a canvas of possibility stretched tight over the frame of a shattered world. Sergeant Mika Kurosawa adjusted the grip on her assault rifle, her eyes scanning the derelict buildings of what was once a bustling Manchurian village. Beside her, Toji operative Yui Takamura unsheathed her sword, the blade humming softly with contained energy. In the distance, the unmistakable thunder of Knightmare Frames (KMFs) and Tactical Surface Fighters (TSFs) signaled the advance of the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's forces. \\"Looks like the warlords didn't expect a counterattack this swift,\\" Mika muttered, her voice laced with determination. Yui nodded in agreement, her eyes cold. \\"Their underestimation is our advantage. Let's make sure they realize the magnitude of their error.\\" The air suddenly crackled with electricity, a prelude to the cyberpunk warfare that was about to unfold. From their left, a squadron of Strike Witches, their bodies bolstered by cybernetic enhancements and arcane power, swooped down from the skies, raining destruction upon the bandit encampments. The warlords' forces, a macabre mix of rogue People's Liberation Army (PLA) units, bandit troops, cultivators, and martial artists, responded with a hail of bullets and elemental fury. The air shimmered with the heat of exchanged spells and gunfire, a dance of death choreographed by desperation and defiance. In the forefront, leading a charge that could alter the fate of Manchuria, was Captain Seijuro Akashi, piloting a state-of-the-art KMF. The mech's armor shimmered with a high-tech sheen, its movements a blur as it engaged the enemy forces. Each step it took quaked the earth, each punch it threw shattered obstacles, carving a path through the warlords' lines for the ground troops following behind. \\"Echo Team, proceed to flank the enemy's eastern ridge,\\" Seijuro's voice cut through the comms, clear and commanding. \\"Delta, provide cover fire for the Strike Witches. We're breaking through in T-minus three.\\" Acknowledgements crackled back, each unit moving with practiced ease. Mika and Yui, now in the thick of battle, worked in tandem; bullets and blade weaving a deadly pattern that no enemy could escape. Above them, the TSFs maneuvered with aerial grace, engaging rogue PLA units that had taken to the skies. Lasers and particle beams crisscrossed the battlefield, highlighting the centrality of technology in this new age of warfare. The Kikai-Ka Heishi, their cybernetic limbs and psychic powers giving them an otherworldly aspect, tore through the ranks of cultivators with ruthless efficiency, their humanity cloaked beneath layers of machine and magic. As night descended, turning the world into a tableau of fire and shadow, the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops pressed their advantage, their myriad forces a testament to the epoch that had birthed them. Cyberpunk clashed with ancient martial traditions, high-tech warfare interwoven with spells and psychic powers, each finding its place in the chaos. In the heart of the battlefield, Mika found herself face-to-face with a cultivator warlord, his aura pulsing with power. Beside her, Yui stood ready, her sword aglow with potent energy. \\"This ends now!\\" Mika shouted, leveling her rifle at the warlord as Yui charged, the Toji's blade cutting through the air with lethal intent. The warlord met their assault with a roar, summoning a tempest of wind and fire that sought to consume them. But in this new world, where the lines between technology, magic, and humanity blurred, they were unbreakable. As the battle raged into the night, the outcome uncertain, one thing was clear: Manchuria was a land worth fighting for, a beacon of hope in a world rebuilding from the ashes. And those who stood to defend it, from Sergeant Kurosawa to Captain Akashi, from the Strike Witches to the Kikai-Ka Heishi, were writing history with every drop of sweat and blood they shed. **End of Chapter 28**"},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a military thriller, dystopian cyberpunk pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a techno-thriller, military action, military-thriller, gunplay filled, cyberpunk style, pulp-action, dialogue-filled, action-packed format, focusing on the pacification of post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria after the defeat of the Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction occupying post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria and its [he Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction's occupying post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria's] bandit troops, cultivators and martial artists and rouge PLA units by the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops and the restoration of order in post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria by the JSDF and SOF units along with Japanese NPA and SAT units called down from the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire to help the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops in Manchuria with disaster relief and reconstruction efforts as elite TS, SOF and SAT troops begin hunting down any remaining rouge cultivators, martial arts and bandits in post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria along with any White-Clad elements in post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria and [the elite TS, SOF and SAT troops] covertly eliminating them [the remaining rouge cultivators, martial arts and bandits in post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria along with any White-Clad elements in post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria] with the help of hoshi, miko, hōshi, Onmyōji Toji and Strike Witches within the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops in Manchuria.","output":"**Chapter 29: Silence After Storm** In the aftermath of a decisive victory, the landscape of post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria unfolded like a cyberpunk tapestry under the moonlit sky. The bustling activity of the JSDF, SOF, and SAT units filled the once silent battlefields, their efforts now focused on pacification and reconstruction in the wake of the warlords' defeat. Lieutenant Hikaru Sato, leader of an elite Tactical Squad (TS), surveyed the panoramic view from atop the command vehicle. His unit, along with SOF and SAT teams, had been tasked with a crucial operation: hunting down the remnants of rogue cultivators, martial artists, bandits, and elusive members of the White-Clad hiding in the shadows of victory. \\"We're not just rebuilding structures; we're laying the foundation for a new era,\\" Hikaru mused, his gaze fixed on the horizon where the lights of drones danced in the twilight, mapping out the areas most in need of attention. Next to Hikaru, Major Akane Watanabe, a seasoned operative of the Special Assault Team, loaded her high-caliber sniper rifle. Her eyes, enhanced by cybernetic implants, scanned the vast expanse for any sign of the targets. \\"Our enemies think they can hide in the chaos,\\" Akane spoke softly, her voice carrying an unwavering resolve. \\"They're mistaken. We have the Toji and the Strike Witches on our side. There's nowhere left for them to run.\\" In the shadows of an abandoned village, now serving as their base of operations, hōshi, miko, and Onmyōji worked alongside the military units, their ancient rituals and modern technology blending seamlessly to create a surveillance network unparalleled in its efficiency and reach. Captain Kenji Muto, a Toji with a reputation for being as deadly with his blade as with his strategic mind, coordinated with the Onmyōji to set up magical wards around the periphery, ensuring that no rogue element could escape their grasp without detection. As night deepened, the operation moved into its critical phase. A whisper of movement, a faint trace of chi, betrayed the presence of a group of rogue cultivators hiding in the underground network of tunnels below the village. With practiced precision, the TS and SOF units moved in, their movements a whispered symphony of efficiency. The tunnels, lit by the luminescent glow of cybernetic gear, became the stage for a confrontation that would determine the fate of peace in Manchuria. Hikaru, leading from the front, engaged in a deadly dance with a martial artist, their fight a blur of movement too fast for the unenhanced eye to follow. Meanwhile, Akane, from her vantage point, picked off targets attempting to flee, her shots unerring in their accuracy. The sound of gunfire and the clash of steel resonated through the underground labyrinth, a testament to the ferocity of the battle being waged. Through the combined efforts of the JSDF, SOF, SAT, and the mystical support of Toji and hōshi, the rogue elements were methodically neutralized, their plans of reigniting chaos snuffed out before they could take root. As the first light of dawn broke over the horizon, a palpable sense of calm settled over Manchuria. The TS, SOF, and SAT units emerged from the tunnels, their faces marked by the exhaustion of a night spent in battle but also by the satisfaction of a job well done. \\"We've cleared the area. Manchuria is secure,\\" Hikaru reported through his comm unit, his words signaling not just the end of the operation but also the beginning of a new chapter for the region. With the immediate threat neutralized, the focus shifted to reconstruction and disaster relief. The Japanese NPA and SAT units, along with volunteers and civilian agencies from the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire, poured into Manchuria, bringing with them the tools and technology necessary to rebuild. As Manchuria awoke to a day marked by hope rather than conflict, the harmony between ancient practices and modern warfare stood as a beacon for the future. The sequences of battle had been replaced by the sounds of construction, the landscape of devastation now dotted with the promise of rebirth. In this new dawn, the shadow of the storm that had once threatened to engulf Manchuria had been dispelled, leaving behind a legacy of resilience forged in the crucible of cyberpunk warfare and unity. **End of Chapter 29**"},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a political thriller, dystopian cyberpunk pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, cyberpunk, court intrigue, royal intrigue, political intrigue, political thriller format and focus on the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops within Manchuria's dialogue with and subsequent collaboration with surviving remnants of the Chinese MSS, the PLA, the People's Police, the PAP, the SPC and the NPC and anti-warlord Manchu resistance fighters to restore Manchukuo as the government [Manchukuo] of post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria after the defeat of the Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction occupying post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria and the subsequent pacification of the bandit troops, cultivators and martial artists and rouge PLA units of the Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction by the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops with the help of the JSDF, SOG, hoshi, miko, hōshi, Onmyōji Toji and Strike Witch troops brought from the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire to post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria.","output":"**Chapter 30: New Alliances in the Shadows of Power** The grand, dimly-lit room within the restored government building of Manchukuo buzzed with an undercurrent of tension as figures from both the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Imperial Armed Forces (IJAF) and the remnants of the Chinese authority, consisting of the MSS, PLA, People's Police, PAP, SPC, and NPC, along with anti-warlord Manchu resistance fighters, gathered around a heavy oak table that seemed to groan under the weight of the future they were about to carve out.

Across from him, sat Wei Lang, the de facto spokesperson for the Chinese factions, his face a mask of calculated calm. \\"We are at a crossroads,\\" General Yamada began, his voice carrying the gravity of the moment. \\"The warlord and his forces have been defeated, and Manchuria stands on the precipice of a new era.

However, the governance of this land is a matter deeply tied to its people and their cultural heritage. We believe a collaborative approach is essential.\\" A murmur of agreement passed among the figures from both sides, the tension easing slightly at the acknowledgment of mutual respect. Commander Satomi Nakajima of the SOG, who had been instrumental in the final operations, spoke up, her tone suggesting a pragmatic approach. \\"Our goal has always been stability and peace, not occupation.

We cannot allow the shadows of the past to resurface in the form of bandits or rogue militarists.\\" Hazuki Kurenai, a Toji who had fought on the front lines, resonated with Commander Li's sentiment. \\"The Toji, along with the Strike Witches, are committed to maintaining peace. Our collaboration can extend beyond mere militaristic endeavors to cultural and societal rebuilding efforts.\\" General Yamada nodded, appreciating the unity forming in the room. \\"Then it's settled. We will move forward with the restoration of Manchukuo as a sign of our common intentions. This council will serve as the provisional governing body until stability is assured, and a civilian government can be established democratically.\\" Wei Lang stood, extending his hand across the table to General Yamada. \\"On behalf of the Chinese factions and the people of Manchuria, we accept your hand in friendship and cooperation. Together, we shall build a future that honors the past while forging ahead into a new dawn.\\" As hands were shaken and agreements made, the room, once heavy with the burden of impending decisions, now hummed with the potential of joint endeavors.

The air was thick with the anticipation of a historic undertaking—the search for a descendant of the House of Aisin-Gioro to ascend as the emperor of the newly reclaimed Manchukuo. Among those present were General Hiroshi Yamada of the IJAF, Commander Satomi Nakajima of the SOG, and an assembly of Manchu-descended members of the now-dissolved Legislative Yuan, brought back under the protection of the Japanese forces from Taiwan. Their mission was delicate, fraught with the complexities of royal lineage and the pragmatics of governance in a post-cataclysm world. \\"The restoration of Manchukuo hinges not just on military or political might, but on the symbolic power of its emperor,\\" began General Yamada, his voice steady. \\"The House of Aisin-Gioro represents more than a lineage; it embodies the soul and spirit of Manchuria. We must tread carefully.\\" Liu Zhen, a former member of the Legislative Yuan and a scholar of Manchurian history, adjusted his glasses. \\"The House of Aisin-Gioro is vast, with many branches. Our challenge lies in identifying a suitable descendant—one with the charisma and vision to lead Manchukuo into a new era.\\" Commander Nakajima leaned in, her expression focused. \\"Our intelligence units, in collaboration with the Onmyōji and Toji, have been discreetly surveying potential candidates. However, the task is complicated by the diaspora of the Manchu people and the fragile state of our records.\\" A figure cloaked in traditional Manchu attire, known only as Chen, who had served as a silent custodian of the Aisin-Gioro lineage, spoke for the first time. \\"There is one promising lead—a young scholar educated in Japan, of direct descent from Emperor Puyi himself. He possesses an understanding of both the old world and the new. However, his willingness to take the mantle remains uncertain.\\" General Yamada nodded thoughtfully. \\"We must approach him with respect and openness. His ascent as emperor could unify the people of Manchukuo, bridging the past and the future. But he must choose this path freely, without coercion.\\" The group murmured in agreement, understanding the gravity of their mission. It was not merely a search for a royal descendant but the cultivation of a leader who could embody the hopes of a nation reborn from the ashes of catastrophe. \\"We shall extend an invitation for dialogue, under the guise of a cultural symposium held in his honor,\\" suggested Liu Zhen. \\"It will be a informal setting, conducive to honest exchange and without the pressure of immediate decision.\\" Commander Nakajima added, \\"Our cybernetic and magical defenses will ensure his safety and privacy. And should he accept, we have the Toji and Strike Witches ready to swear fealty, symbolizing the fusion of tradition and the new forces that now shape our world.\\" As the meeting drew to a close, the attendees knew the balance of Manchukuo's future rested on delicate negotiations. The cyber-enhanced room, once a symbol of dystopian survival, now flickered with the possibility of regal rebirth. Outside, the gleaming skyline of the restored Manchukuo reflected off polished surfaces and cybernetic enhancements—a stark contrast to the ancient rites and royal bloodlines being deliberated within the government building. Manchukuo stood at the cusp of an era, seeking to weave its imperial past with the cyberpunk reality of its present and future. **End of Chapter 31**"},{"instruction":"Staying and continuing with the crossover fanfic prompted and generated in the previous entries, remembering to stick to the novel chapter format: The next chapter should be an excerpt of a political thriller, dystopian cyberpunk pulp action novel that takes place within the world of the alternate history scenario prompted and generated within the previous entry and should be done in a dialogue-filled, cyberpunk, court intrigue, royal intrigue, political intrigue, political thriller format and focus on the selection of a member of the Manchurian imperial family [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro] as the current Emperor of Manchukuo after its [Manchukuo's] restoration as the government [Manchukuo] of post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria after the defeat of the Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction occupying post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria and the subsequent pacification of the bandit troops, cultivators and martial artists and rouge PLA units of the Beiyang Clique-equivalent Han Chinese warlord faction by the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF's troops with the help of the JSDF, SOG, hoshi, miko, hōshi, Onmyōji Toji and Strike Witch troops brought from the post-Great Cataclysm restored Japanese Empire to post-Great Cataclysm Manchuria and the reestablishment and reformation of the Manchurian imperial family [the Imperial House of Aisin-Gioro] into a proper imperial house resembling the royal and imperial families pre-Great Cataclysm European constitutional monarchies.","output":"**Chapter 32: The Coronation of Shadows** In the neon-lit halls of what had once been the imperial palace of Manchukuo, a conspiracy of silence enveloped a conclave of both Japanese and Manchurian dignitaries.

General Hiroshi Yamada, representing the interests of the post-Great Cataclysm restored IJAF, initiated the discussions, his voice echoing softly against the ancient stone walls, \\"The restoration of the Aisin-Gioro lineage to the throne is not just a matter of tradition; it's a symbol of unity and resilience. It is imperative that we find a suitable candidate who embodies both the rich history of Manchuria and the progressive spirit of our new world.\\" Across from him, Chen, the custodian of the Aisin-Gioro history, sat clad in garments that whispered of bygone eras, his demeanor an embodiment of the solemnity of their task. \\"We have identified a descendant, educated in the ideals of both old and new—a beacon of hope who can navigate the complexities of this era.

He must be a ruler who can stride through the digital realms with the same grace he traverses the ancient courts.\\" Commander Satomi Nakajima, who had been quietly observing the deliberations, voiced a crucial concern, \\"Security. The emperor's role will place him at the heart of potential plots and power struggles. Our selection process must include protocols for his protection, leveraging both our magical and cybernetic advancements.\\" The conversation turned to the structure of the reformed imperial house. A constitutional monarchy, inspired by pre-Great Cataclysm European models, was proposed, balancing ceremonial duties with substantial influence over national policies and international diplomacy through a parliamentary system. A figure from the back, a Toji named Hazuki, voiced an additional layer to their strategy, \\"The magic that flows through Manchukuo, the ancient energies and the cybernetic enhancements that have become our second nature—our emperor must be someone who embodies these forces, a symbol of the harmony between the ancient and the futuristic.\\" As the discussions wove through issues of governance, tradition, and modernization, a consensus began to emerge. The Aisin-Gioro descendant they were considering appeared not just as a candidate for the throne, but as a keystone to the archway leading Manchukuo into a new dawn. In the days that followed, clandestine meetings with the selected descendant were arranged, where ideals and visions for Manchukuo were candidly exchanged. The complexity of his impending role was laid bare—not just as a figurehead, but as a leader expected to guide a nation through the labyrinth of a post-cataclysm world. The ceremony of coronation was meticulously planned to be a spectacle of both tradition and the cutting-edge—a broadcast that would reach every data pad, every cybernetic eye, across Manchukuo and beyond. It was to symbolize not just the return of an emperor but the birth of a kingdom reborn from the ravages of the past, poised on the brink of a future where cybernetics and sorcery intertwined. As the chosen day dawned, the ancient imperial palace of Manchukuo, now augmented with cybernetic flourishes and magical protections, played host to a ceremony that straddled worlds. The Aisin-Gioro descendant, robed in garments that were an amalgam of traditional Manchurian wear and cyberpunk aesthetics, stepped forward to claim not just a crown, but a covenant with his people. His coronation speech, delivered with the wisdom of the ages and the foresight of a new era, resonated through the halls of power and the crowded streets alike.

I restarted training and did for the pecs Dumbbell flys and dumbbell push (forgot the name). wouldn’t push ups be better at the beginning?","output":"Given your background in martial arts and previous experience with push-ups and pull-ups, transitioning to hypertrophy training presents a unique opportunity for building muscle mass and strength. Both disciplines, martial arts and hypertrophy training, require a strong foundation, but the objectives tend to differ. Martial arts often focuses on endurance, speed, strength, and technique, while hypertrophy training is primarily about maximizing muscle growth. Incorporating push-ups into your hypertrophy training, especially at the beginning, can be quite beneficial for several reasons: 1. **Foundation Strength**: Push-ups are a fundamental bodyweight exercise that targets not just the pectoral muscles but also the triceps, shoulders, and core, providing a solid foundation of strength. Given your experience, starting with push-ups can help you re-establish this foundation before moving on to more challenging exercises. 2. **Muscle Memory and Endurance**: Your previous regimen of 100 push-ups a day likely means your body has a good muscle memory for this exercise, allowing you to perform it with good form. This can help you build endurance and strength safely as you ease back into regular training. 3. **Progressive Overload**: Hypertrophy training relies on the principle of progressive overload, where you continuously increase the demands on your musculoskeletal system to gain muscle mass and strength. With push-ups, you can apply this principle by increasing the number of repetitions, adding variations (such as incline or decline push-ups, or wearing a weighted vest) to continuously challenge your muscles. 4. **Focus on Technique**: Starting with push-ups allows you to focus on technique and ensure proper form, which is crucial for preventing injuries. As you progress, maintaining good form in dumbbell exercises like flys and presses becomes even more critical for effective muscle engagement and growth. 5. **Versatility**: Push-ups can be performed anywhere, making them a highly versatile addition to your training program. This flexibility can aid in maintaining a consistent workout routine, especially on days when equipment may not be available. That said, dumbbell exercises like flys and presses are also highly effective for targeting the pectoral muscles from different angles and inducing hypertrophy. Incorporating a mix of push-ups (for foundational strength and endurance) and dumbbell exercises (for targeted muscle growth and variation) can offer a balanced approach to your chest workouts. Remember, the best exercise regimen is one that combines a variety of movements, addressing different muscle groups and promoting balanced development. Paying attention to nutrition, rest, and recovery is equally important in your hypertrophy training journey. As always, consider consulting with a fitness professional to design a program that aligns with your specific goals and needs, taking into account your martial arts background and current fitness level."},{"instruction":"I actually had a shoulder injury because of faulty technique","output":"I'm sorry to hear about your shoulder injury.

Here are some tailored recommendations for safely incorporating exercise, particularly focusing on building strength and hypertrophy, while managing your recovery: # 1. **Consult Healthcare Professionals** Before anything else, it's vital to consult with healthcare professionals, such as a physiotherapist or an orthopedic specialist, to get a clear understanding of your injury and any limitations it may impose. They can provide specific exercises to rehabilitate your shoulder and advise when and how to safely reintroduce strength training. # 2. **Prioritize Rehabilitation and Mobility Work** Incorporate rehabilitation exercises prescribed by your healthcare provider into your routine. Focus on mobility work and exercises to strengthen the muscles around the shoulder joint, such as the rotator cuff, which are crucial for stability and injury prevention. # 3. **Gradual Return to Exercise** When you start training again: - Begin with very light weights to assess your comfort and pain threshold. - Focus on exercises that don't put undue stress on your shoulder. Machines can sometimes offer more controlled movements than free weights. - Gradually increase the intensity of your workouts based on your comfort and recovery, not on a predetermined timeline. # 4. **Emphasize Proper Technique** Given that a faulty technique contributed to your injury, it's imperative to emphasize proper form: - Consider working with a qualified personal trainer, at least initially, to ensure your technique is correct and safe. - Record your exercises to review your form or use mirrors during training to make real-time adjustments. # 5. **Incorporate a Variety of Push-Ups Cautiously** Push-ups can still be beneficial, but: - Start with modifications that reduce shoulder stress, such as knee push-ups or wall push-ups. - Gradually progress to standard push-ups once you've built up strength and are confident in your shoulder stability without pain. # 6. **Include Balanced Training** Ensure your workout routine is balanced: - Strengthen the muscles around your shoulder, including the back and chest, to support shoulder health. - Don't neglect the antagonist muscles (in this case, if you're working your chest, also work your back) to maintain muscular balance, which is crucial for joint health. # 7. **Listen to Your Body** Pain is a warning sign: - Stop any exercise that causes pain. Discomfort might be expected to some extent as you regain strength and mobility, but sharp or persistent pain is a signal to stop and reassess. - Recognize the difference between muscular fatigue and pain stemming from your shoulder. # 8. **Stay Consistent with Rehabilitation and Training** Consistency in both rehabilitation and training (within the limits of safety and pain) is key to recovery and progress. # 9. **Manage Expectations** Accept that recovery and getting back to your previous levels of strength and performance take time. Patience and persistence are your allies. # 10. **Modify Workouts as Needed** Be prepared to modify your approach based on how your shoulder responds. Flexibility in your training plan is crucial. # Closing Thought Recovering from an injury, particularly one related to the shoulder, can be a gradual process. While it's natural to feel eager to return to your previous levels of activity and strength, prioritize your long-term health and functionality. Staying informed, working with professionals, and adopting a mindful, patient approach to training will serve you well on your path to recovery and beyond."},{"instruction":"A tranzisztorok témakörében mit szoktak bétával jelölni?","output":"A tranzisztorok témakörében a béta ((beta)) a tranzisztor áramerősítési tényezőjét vagy áramerősítési faktorát jelöli, amelyet más néven hFE-nek vagy B-nek is hívnak.

This design facilitates an in-depth analysis of both quantitative data, to measure variables such as the psychological effects of gaming, and qualitative data, to explore players' motivations and the therapeutic potential of video games in greater detail. Quantitatively, we will employ surveys and standardized psychological assessments among diverse gaming populations to statistically ascertain correlations and potential causations between gaming habits and specific psychological outcomes. Qualitatively, semi-structured interviews will provide deeper insights into personal gaming experiences, motivations behind gaming, and perceived mental health benefits, allowing for the exploration of nuances that quantitative data alone cannot reveal. This combined approach not only strengthens the validity and reliability of our findings but also enables independent thinking and original insights into how video games can impact human psychology across various contexts.

Sin embargo, para mejorar el análisis o la presentación del mismo, podríamos considerar algunos ajustes y precisiones en los términos empleados y adiciones para reforzar la argumentación. A continuación, se analiza la correctitud y se sugieren mejoras: 1. **Claridad en la definición de \\"contrato\\"**: Para fortalecer el argumento, sería útil definir con precisión qué se entiende por \\"contrato\\" desde el inicio. Esto es importante porque la noción de contrato puede variar considerablemente dependiendo del contexto jurídico o filosófico que se considere. 2. **Aceptación de impuestos**: La primera premisa (\\"un impuesto no es aceptado\\") podría ser problemática. La aceptación de impuestos puede variar entre individuos y sociedades. En muchos sistemas democráticos, los impuestos son, en cierta medida, aceptados y legitimados a través del proceso electoral y la representación política. Podría ser más preciso decir que \\"un impuesto no requiere la aceptación individual para su imposición\\", lo cual refuerza el argumento de que no representan contratos en el sentido voluntarista del término. 3. **Impuestos como no-contratos**: Aunque la conclusión de que \\"un impuesto no es un contrato\\" es válida dentro de este razonamiento, sería útil expandir un poco sobre por qué un impuesto se clasifica como un no-contrato, tal vez explorando la naturaleza unilateral de los impuestos y la falta de negociación entre partes iguales, la cual es típica en la formación de contratos. 4. **Necesidad de no-contratos en el estado**: La conclusión de que el estado requiere de al menos un no-contrato (en este caso, impuestos) para su existencia está bien fundamentada y es clave para el argumento general. Podría ser enriquecedor discutir brevemente otros posibles ejemplos de no-contratos que sustentan la existencia del estado, como las leyes penales, para mostrar que la argumentación no se basa únicamente en la necesidad de impuestos. 5. **Generalización sobre la formación del estado**: La premisa y conclusión finales hacen una generalización importante y válida. Podría añadirse una discusión sobre cómo, más allá de los impuestos, la existencia del estado supone una serie de relaciones y estructuras que no pueden reducirse meramente a la suma de contratos individuales. Esto podría incluir la consideración del monopolio de la fuerza legítima, el establecimiento de jurisdicciones y la creación de derechos y deberes que no emanan de acuerdos contractuales sino de la ley. En resumen, el argumento es correcto en su conclusión esencial de que un estado no puede ser formado únicamente con contratos. La argumentación podría mejorarse con definiciones más precisas, una explicación más detallada de la naturaleza de los impuestos y los no-contratos, y una extensión del análisis hacia otros elementos estructurales del estado que también escapan a la lógica contractual."},{"instruction":"как запросить chat_id у пользователя подписанного на бота","output":"Для получения \`chat_id\` пользователя, который подписался на вашего бота в Telegram, вам необходимо, чтобы пользователь взаимодействовал с вашим ботом. Это может быть любое сообщение, команда или действие (например, нажатие кнопки в inline-клавиатуре), инициированное пользователем. При каждом таком взаимодействии Telegram API отправляет вашему боту обновление (update), в котором содержится информация о пользователе и действии. В этой информации и содержится \`chat_id\`. Чтобы обработать это взаимодействие и получить \`chat_id\`, вам нужно реализовать логику обработки входящих обновлений от Telegram. В зависимости от того, используете ли вы какую-либо библиотеку (например, Telegraf для Node.js, python-telegram-bot для Python и т.д.) или взаимодействуете напрямую с Telegram Bot API, детали реализации могут отличаться.

While there are many well-known actors who could surely do the roles justice, casting lesser-known talents could provide a fresh perspective and allow the characters to shine without being overshadowed by the actors' previous roles. Here are five potential lesser-known actors and actresses who could embody key characters from the game: 1. **Gordon Freeman - Joe Dempsie**: Known for his role as Gendry in \\"Game of Thrones,\\" Joe Dempsie has the acting chops and physicality needed for Gordon Freeman. Although Freeman is silent throughout the game, it would be crucial for the actor to convey a wide range of emotions purely through expressions and actions. Dempsie's strong yet thoughtful presence could bring depth to this iconic character. 2. **Alyx Vance - Jessica Sula**: With her breakout role in \\"Skins\\" and her performance in \\"Split,\\" Jessica Sula has shown the ability to portray strong, complex characters. Her versatility and the depth of her performances could make her a great Alyx Vance, combining intelligence, strength, and vulnerability in a post-apocalyptic world. 3. **Dr. Isaac Kleiner - Adam Godley**: Though perhaps not entirely lesser-known thanks to his role in \\"The Umbrella Academy,\\" Adam Godley has the quirky demeanor and ability to deliver complex scientific dialogue in a way that's both compelling and engaging, which would be perfect for the eccentric yet brilliant Dr. Kleiner. His experience with voice acting and motion capture work can also translate well to the physicalities required for the role. 4. **Barney Calhoun - Wyatt Russell**: Having shown his range in both drama and comedy, notably in \\"Overlord\\" and \\"Lodge 49,\\" Wyatt Russell would be an excellent Barney. He can carry Barney’s laid-back yet courageous personality with ease. Russell has the acting genealogy but has carved a path distinct from his famous parents, which aligns with the idea of casting lesser-known talents. 5. **Eli Vance - Ricky Whittle**: Best known for his role as Shadow Moon in \\"American Gods,\\" Ricky Whittle has the gravitas needed for Eli Vance, Alyx's father and a key figure in the resistance against the Combine. Eli is smart, nurturing, and has a powerful presence—all qualities Whittle could portray convincingly. Casting these roles responsibly is crucial to honor the original game while also providing fresh interpretations. These actors bring a mix of intensity, charm, and depth to their performances, which would be essential in bringing \\"Half-Life 2\\" to the silver screen in a live-action adaptation that respects the source material while appealing to a broad audience."},{"instruction":"erstellen Sie auf Grundlage des Infomaterials in dem Text eine umfassende Mindmap der Wechselwirkungen zwischen dem Feldhasen und seiner Umwelt. Clustern Sie wo möglich. Text: Biologie: • 2,5 kg bis 6,4 kg schwere wärmeliebende Art • bevorzugt Wildkräuter, Gräser, Knospen, Feldfrüchte und Blätter • regelmäßige Aufnahme des Blinddarmkots (Caecotrophie) lebensnotwendig • dämmerungs- und nachtaktiver Einzelgänger, ruht tagsüber in einer Sasse • Lebenserwartung in Gefangenschaft 12 Jahre, in freier Wildbahn deutlich geringer • Paarung von Dezember/Januar bis Juli/August • nach einer Tragzeit von etwa 42 Tagen setzt die Häsin bis zu viermal im Jahr 1 bis 5 nestflüchtende Junge • ab dem 38. Trächtigkeitstag kann eine zweite Befruchtung der Häsin erfolgen (Superfötation), was die Reproduktionsrate erhöht Verbreitung und Lebensraum: Als ursprünglicher Bewohner von Steppenlandschaften ist der Feldhase in nahezu allen Teilen Deutschlands vor allem in Agrarlandschaften, aber auch in Wäldern und urbanen sowie suburbanen Gebieten zu finden. Durch die Intensivierung der Landwirtschaft in den letzten Jahrzehnten verlor der Feldhase zunehmend an Lebensraum und abwechslungsreicher Nahrung. Jagd: Der Feldhase unterliegt dem Jagdrecht und hat laut Bundesjagdzeitenverordnung eine Jagdzeit von Oktober bis Mitte Januar. In den meisten Bundesländern ist seine Jagdzeit allerdings verkürzt und endet bereits Ende Dezember. Teilweise ist eine Bejagung an die Durchführung einer Zählung der Tiere gebunden. In den meisten Revieren wird auf die Bejagung von Feldhasen verzichtet. Der Feldhase ist als ursprünglicher Steppenbewohner heute in Mitteleuropa weit verbreitet. Als Charak- terart der Feldflur bevorzugt er offene und strukturreiche Landschaften. Im Rahmen von WILD wird der Feldhasenbesatz mittels Scheinwerfertaxation im Frühiahr und Herbst in Referenzgebieten bundesweit erfasst (DIV 2003). Im Jahr 2020 beteiligten sich deutschlandweit 46g Referenzgebiete. Eine zentrale Rolle für das Überleben der Junghasen spielen die Witterungsbedingun-gen, besonders in den ersten zwei Lebens-wochen (Hackländer et al. 2002a, Hackländer 2010, Voigt 2019, Zörner 1981). Kaltes, nasses Wetter erhöht das Infektionsrisiko und damit die Sterblichkeit erheblich. Warme, trockene Frühiahre hingegen stellen gute Bedingungen für Feldhasen und ihren Nachwuchs dar. Laut des Deutschen Wetterdienstes war es im Frühjahr 2020 das dritte lahr in Folge sehr trocken (Deutscher Wetterdienst 2021). Zudem lagen die Temperaturen im lanuar, Februar und April (+ 3 bis + 4.9 K) deutlich über dem vieliährigen Monatsmittel 1061 bis 1990, was das Überleben der lunghasen be-günstigt. Auch wenn sich der Besatz laut der Zählungen in WILD stabil zeigt, wirkt sich die immer intensivere Landwirtschaft mit großen Feldschlägen und Monokulturen auf die Population des Feldhasen aus. Eine abwechslungsreiche Kost mit vielen Wildkräutern ist für die Immunabwehr und Produktion der fettreichen Muttermilch wichtig. Die Jungtiere sind auf sie angewiesen, um genug Energie zur Regelung des Wärmehaushalts zu haben (Hackländer et al. 2002b, Smith et al. 2005). Da die Häsin den Nachwuchs bevorzugt an Randstrukturen setzt, sind große struktur-arme Feldschläge kein geeigneter Lebensraum. Neben den Lebensraumeigenschaften spielen für den Feldhasen verschiedene Krankheiten eine große Rolle für das Über-leben. Zu nennen sind hier die Hasenseuche (European Brown Hare Svndrome - EBHS) und aktuell insbesondere die Tularämie, auch Hasenpest genannt. Hinzu kommen Verluste durch den Verkehr und durch Fressfeinde. Durch die orale Immunisierung des Rotfuchses gilt Deutschland seit 2008 offiziell als frei von terrestrischer Tollwut (FLI 2018). Die Fuchsponu-lation konnte wieder wachsen, wodurch der Prädationsdruck auf den Feldhasen erhöht wurde. Dieser steigt ebenfalls durch die Ausbreitung invasiver Raubsäuger wie Waschbär und Marder-hund (Baudach et al. 2021).","output":"Auf Basis des bereitgestellten Textes lässt sich eine umfassende Mindmap der Wechselwirkungen zwischen dem Feldhasen und seiner Umwelt erstellen.

Eine numerische Lösung könnte wie folgt durchgeführt werden: 1. **Wählen Sie ein numerisches Integrationsverfahren:** Entscheiden Sie sich für eine Methode (Trapezregel, Simpson-Regel etc.), die auf die Funktion angewendet wird. 2. **Beginnen Sie bei (t_0) und integrieren schrittweise:** Starten Sie bei (t = -6) und integrieren Sie die Funktion in kleinen Schritten nach (t) bis Sie eine kumulative Menge von 1000 ml erreichen. 3. **Bewerten Sie schrittweise bis zur Zielerfüllung:** Verwenden Sie ein Programm oder numerisches Werkzeug, um das Integral fortlaufend bis zu jedem Zeitpunkt zu berechnen, bis das Ergebnis (nahezu) 1000 ml erreicht. Der Zeitpunkt, bei dem dies geschieht, ist Ihre gesuchte Zeit (t). Programme wie MATLAB, Mathematica, oder Python mit SciPy können dieses Problem effizient lösen, indem sie die Funktion integrieren und den erforderlichen kumulativen Wert prüfen. Es ist auch möglich, eine Schleife zu implementieren, die den Wert des Integrals kontinuierlich überprüft, bis die Zielschwelle erreicht ist, und dabei die Zeit (t) als Ergebnis zurückgibt."},{"instruction":"Welche nun aber die beste Verfassung und welches das beste Leben für die meisten Staaten und die meisten Menschen sein möge, kann nicht nach einer Tugend entschieden werden, die über die Kräfte des gewöhnlichen Mannes geht, [...], sondern (muss für die meisten Menschen] erreichbar [und für] für die meisten Staaten anwendbar [...] [sein]. [...] Denn wenn der von uns in der Ethik aufgestellte Grundsatz zu Recht besteht, dass das glückliche Leben ein Leben gemäß der Tugend eine Mitte ist, so muss das mittlere Leben das Beste sein, ein Leben, sagen wir, in einer Mitte, die für jeden zu erreichen ist. Diese nämlichen Bestimmungen müssen aber, wie für die Tugend und Schlechtigkeit eines Staates, so auch für die einer Verfassung gelten, da die Verfassung wie ein Leben des Staates ist. In allen Staaten nun gibt es drei Klassen von Bürgern: sehr reiche, sehr arme und drittens solche, die zwischen beiden in der Mitte stehen. Da also die Voraussetzung gilt, dass das Gemäßigte und das Mittlere das Beste ist, so sieht man, dass auch in Bezug auf die Vermögensverhältnisse der mittlere Besitz von allen der beste ist; ein solcher Vermögens-stand gehorcht am leichtesten der Vernunft. Dagegen fällt es dem übermäßig Schönen oder dem übermäßig Starken oder dem Manne von sehr edler Geburt oder dem übermäßig Reichen und denen, die das Gegenteil von ihnen sind, dem übermäßig Armen oder übermäßig Schwachen oder dem sehr Niedrigen und Verachteten schwer, der Vernunft zu folgen. Jene werden mehr übermütig und schlecht im Großen, diese allzu tückisch und schlecht im Kleinen, und Ubermut auf der einen und Tücke auf der anderen Seite sind es ja, woraus alle ungerechten Taten entspringen. [...] Zudem besitzen diejenigen, die sich eines Übermaßes von Glücksgütern, von Stärke, Reich-tum, Anhang und dergleichen mehr, erfreuen, weder Neigung noch Einsicht dazu, anderen zu gehorchen - und das haftet ihnen schon von Haus aus als Kindern an; denn verzärtelt, wie sie sind, können sie sich nicht einmal in der Schule an Gehorsam gewöhnen -; umgekehrt sind diejenigen, die an diesen Dingen übermäßigen Mangel leiden, allzu unterwürfig. Und so können die einen nicht herrschen und nur in sklavischer Weise gehorchen, und die anderen können keiner Art von Herrschaft gehorchen und selbst nur in despotischer Weise herrschen. Das gibt nun einen Staat von Knechten und Herren, aber nicht von Freien, einen Staat, wo die einen beneiden, die anderen verachten, und so einen Zustand, der zu Freundschaft und staatlicher Gemeinschaft im größten Gegensatze steht. Gemeinschaft ist Freundschaft; mit Feinden mag man nicht einmal den Weg teilen. Nun will aber ein Staat möglichst aus gleichen und ähnlichen Bürgern bestehen, und das findet sich am meisten bei dem Mittelstande, und so muss der Staat die beste Verfassung haben, der eine solche Zusammensetzung hat, wie sie nach unserer Darlegung die Natur des Staates fordert. Auch ist in den Staaten die Existenz dieser Art Bürger am meisten gesichert. Sie begehren weder selbst nach fremdem Gute wie die Armen, noch begehren andere nach ihrem Besitze, wie die Armen nach dem der Reichen. Und so bringen sie, weil sie weder den anderen nachstellen, noch andere ihnen, ungefährdet ihre Tage zu. [...] Es [...] [wird deutlich], dass auch die Gemeinschaft, die sich auf den Mittelstand gründet, die beste ist, und dass solche Staaten sich in der Möglichkeit befinden, eine gute Verfassung zu haben, in denen eben der Mittelstand zahlreich vertreten ist und womöglich die beiden anderen Klassen, oder doch eine von ihnen an Stärke übertrifft. Denn auf welche Seite er sich wirft, nach der gibt er den Ausschlag und verhindert das Aufkommen der entgegen-gesetzten Extreme. Daher ist es das größte Glück, wenn die Bürger eines Staates ein mittleres und ausreichendes Vermögen haben, weil da, wo die einen sehr viel besitzen und die anderen nichts, wegen dieses beiderseitigen Übermaßes entweder die extremste Demokratie oder reine, ungemischte Oligarchie oder Tyrannis entsteht. Denn die Tyrannis entsteht ebenso gut aus der zügellosesten Demokratie als aus der Oligarchie, dagegen aus der Herrschaft des Mittelstandes und der sozial beinahe gleichgestellten Klassen weit weniger. Aristoteles: Politik, übers. von Eugen Rolfes, Hamburg: Meiner 1981, S. 144-147. Arbeitsauftrag 1. Untersuchen Sie, warum die Politie für Aristoteles die beste Staatsform darstellt. 2. Welche Staaten der Gegenwart kommen der aristotelischen Konzeption der Politie nahe, welche eher nicht? 3. Diskutieren Sie, inwieweit die Überlegungen von Aristoteles über die politische Rolle der Mittelschicht auch für moderne Gesellschaften zutreffen.","output":"1. **Warum die Politie für Aristoteles die beste Staatsform darstellt:** Aristoteles argumentiert, dass die beste Verfassung und das beste Leben für die meisten Staaten und Menschen nicht auf Tugenden basieren sollte, die über die Fähigkeiten der durchschnittlichen Person hinausgehen, sondern vielmehr erreichbar und für die meisten Staaten anwendbar sein sollte. Er vertritt den Standpunkt, dass ein glückliches Leben ein Leben in Übereinstimmung mit der Tugend und in einer erreichbaren Mitte liegt – eine Mitte, die für jeden zugänglich ist. Diese Mitte gilt sowohl für Tugenden und Lastern eines Individuums als auch für die Verfassung eines Staates, da die Verfassung quasi das Leben eines Staates darstellt. Aristoteles beobachtet, dass in jedem Staat drei Klassen von Bürgern existieren: die Reichen, die Armen und die Mittelschicht. Er argumentiert, dass das mittlere Maß, also die Mittelschicht, die beste Position darstellt, da diese Gruppierung am ehesten geneigt ist, der Vernunft zu folgen. Extreme Reichtümer oder Armut fördern Übermut oder Niedertracht, was ungerechten Taten Vorschub leistet. Der Mittelstand hingegen neigt weder zum Übermaß noch zum Mangel und fördert daher eine stabile, vernunftgeleitete Gesellschaft. Zudem findet Aristoteles, dass eine Gesellschaft, die auf dem Mittelstand basiert, am besten für die Erhaltung einer guten Verfassung geeignet ist, da sie eine Balance zwischen den Extremen herstellt und ein ausgewogenes soziales und politisches Leben ermöglicht. Dies wiederum führt zu einem Zustand der Freundschaft und Gemeinschaft, der für das Wohlergehen eines Staates essenziell ist. Er schlussfolgert, dass Staaten mit einer starken Mittelschicht am ehesten eine gute Verfassung erreichen und erhalten können. 2. **Staaten der Gegenwart, die der aristotelischen Konzeption der Politie nahekommen oder eher nicht:** Nah kommen: - Skandinavische Länder wie Dänemark, Schweden und Norwegen, die für ihre hohe Lebensqualität, starken sozialen Sicherungssysteme und geringe Einkommensungleichheit bekannt sind, könnten der aristotelischen Idee der Politie nahekommen. Diese Länder verfügen über starke Mittelschichten und fördern Chancengleichheit sowie sozialen Zusammenhalt. Eher nicht: - Länder mit extremer wirtschaftlicher Ungleichheit und hoher Konzentration des Reichtums, wie die Vereinigten Staaten oder Brasilien, entfernen sich möglicherweise von Aristoteles' Ideal. In diesen Ländern gibt es deutliche Spaltungen zwischen den sehr Reichen und den Armen, was zu sozialen Spannungen und politischer Instabilität beitragen kann. 3. **Überlegungen von Aristoteles über die politische Rolle der Mittelschicht für moderne Gesellschaften:** Aristoteles’ Beobachtungen zur Rolle der Mittelschicht sind auch für moderne Gesellschaften relevant. Die Existenz einer starken und wohlhabenden Mittelschicht ist oft ein Zeichen für eine gesunde Wirtschaft und eine stabile Gesellschaft. Eine robuste Mittelschicht kann zu politischer Stabilität beitragen, indem sie als Puffer zwischen den Extremen der sehr Reichen und der Armen dient und so die Tendenz zu extremen politischen Bewegungen reduziert. In Gesellschaften, in denen die Mittelschicht schrumpft und die wirtschaftliche Ungleichheit zunimmt, kann dies zu politischer Unzufriedenheit, sozialer Zerrissenheit und einem Erstarken von extremistischen Bewegungen führen. Die Förderung von Politiken, die Wachstum und Unterstützung der Mittelschicht zum Ziel haben, kann daher als modernes Äquivalent zu Aristoteles' Ideal gesehen werden. Bildung, Zugang zu medizinischer Versorgung, erschwinglicher Wohnraum und faire Löhne sind zentrale Aspekte, die die Stabilität und den Wohlstand der Mittelschicht in der heutigen Zeit sichern können."},{"instruction":"","output":"Es scheint, als hätten Sie keine spezifische Frage gestellt.

Da es sich um eine Sinusfunktion handelt und der Koeffizient vor (x) im Sinus positiv ist, erreicht der Sinus sein Maximum bei (frac{pi}{2}), woraus folgt: [ frac{pi}{12} cdot (x-7) = frac{pi}{2} ] [ x - 7 = 6 ] [ x = 13 ] Die höchste Temperatur tritt also um 13:00 Uhr (1 Uhr nachmittags) auf. Um die maximale Temperatur zu finden, setzen wir (x = 13) in die Funktion ein: [ t(13) = 6 cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{12} cdot (13-7)right) + 8 = 6 cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{2}right) + 8 = 6 cdot 1 + 8 = 14 °C ] Die maximale Temperatur beträgt also 14 °C. # b) Bestimmung der mittleren Änderungsrate der Temperatur von 04:00 bis 10:00 Uhr Die mittlere Änderungsrate einer Funktion auf einem Intervall ([a, b]) wird bestimmt durch (frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}).

Daher ist die mittlere Tagestemperatur einfach 8 °C. # d) Begründung, warum dieses Modell voraussichtlich nicht für Vorhersagen für den nächsten Tag sinnvoll ist Dieses Modell berücksichtigt ausschließlich die sinusförmige Veränderung der Temperatur im Tagesverlauf und ignoriert dabei viele andere wichtige Faktoren, die das Wetter beeinflussen können, wie zum Beispiel: - Jahreszeitliche Veränderungen - Wetterfronten und -systeme - Niederschlag - Wolkenbedeckung - Lokale geografische und klimatische Bedingungen Es ist daher unwahrscheinlich, dass dieses einfache Modell genau die Variationen in der Temperatur für den nächsten Tag voraussagen kann, da es die Komplexität des Wetters nicht vollständig abbildet."},{"instruction":"Ich habe bei Aufgabe b) aber 1,41 raus","output":"Um den Punkt b) erneut zu überprüfen und die Verwirrung aufzulösen, betrachten wir nochmals die Berechnung der mittleren Änderungsrate der Temperatur von 04:00 bis 10:00 Uhr für die Funktion [ t(x) = 6 cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{12} cdot (x-7)right) + 8 ] Die direkte Berechnung der Temperaturwerte zu den Zeitpunkten (t(4)) und (t(10)) und die Berechnung der mittleren Änderungsrate waren: [ t(4) = 6 cdot sinleft(-frac{3pi}{12}right) + 8 = 6 cdot sinleft(-frac{pi}{4}right) + 8 ] [ t(10) = 6 cdot sinleft(frac{3pi}{12}right) + 8 = 6 cdot sinleft(frac{pi}{4}right) + 8 ] Wobei wir wissen, dass (sinleft(frac{pi}{4}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}).

Должностная власть определяется диапазоном использования руководителя санкций, наказаний к своим подчиненным, получаемых согласно штатному расписанию, и передается сверху вниз. Личная же власть - это восприятие подчиненных авторитета руководителя, ее надо постоянно заслуживать. И стоит руководителю допустить несколько ошибок, как подчиненные могут быстро лишить атрибута этой власти. Но между должностной и личной властью есть важная взаимосвязь: - объем должностной власти, переданной руководителю вышестоящим начальством, в большей степени зависит от того, насколько сильна, по мнению этого начальства, личная власть такого руководителя; - с другой стороны, объем личной власти, врученной руководителю его подчиненными, в большей степени зависит от того, насколько сильна, по мнению самих подчиненных, должностная власть данного руководителя. Это значит, что недостаточно получить полномочия от начальства и доверие подчиненных, и тем, и другим необходимо доказывать обладание достаточным диапазоном личной и должностной власти. Сотрудники организации должны видеть предназначение этой организации, и руководителю необходимо разделять не только материальные блага, но и ответственность с ними. Ответственность - это обязательства выполнять определенные возложенные задачи наилучшим образом и отвечать за качество работы. Со стороны государственной службы ответственность еще понимается как подотчетность. Руководители несут ответственность за выполнение задач службы и работы подразделения в рамках законности, используя принуждение и ограничения в рамках возможностей своей власти и имеющиеся ресурсы. Они отчитываются об этом перед вышестоящими уровнями руководства, неся ответственность за свои действия, работу и своих подчиненных. Это очень сложная работа, руководителю отводится определяющая роль, его решимости и способности поддерживать законный порядок деятельности сотрудников таможенного органа. Основным вопросом практики развития ответственности или подотчетности является вопрос о том, как и какими способами устанавливается и поддерживается устойчивый порядок профессиональной деятельности в таможенном органе. Во многом это зависит от навыков управления руководителя. Выделяют три основных группы управленческих навыков, необходимых на каждом уровне руководства: «Специальные (технические) навыки» - знание процессов, владение методами, процедурами и технологиями, а также умение работать с основными видами оборудования, используемого в данной деятельности. «Межличностные навыки» - знания о человеческом поведении и межличностном взаимодействии, способность понимать чувства, отношения и мотивы людей через их слова и поступки, а также умение четко и эффективно поддерживать связь и нужные взаимоотношения с ними. «Концептуальные навыки» - навыки, отражающие способности к логическому аналитическому мышлению, к творчеству при выдвижении идей и решении проблем, распознавании проблем и предугадывании возможных проблем. Например, такая классификация позволяет выявить различие между профессиональной деятельностью сотрудников, работающих в таможенном органе, и деятельностью сотрудников в таможенном управлении, а также подчеркнуть своеобразие последней, которая включает в себя как знание таможенных технологий, так и специфические профессиональные навыки, обеспечивающие эффективность взаимоотношений с другими людьми и их деятельность.","output":"В рамках организации должностная власть, отлично от личной, не является единственным источником влияния руководителей на сотрудников – есть и другие аспекты, в частности личная власть, связанная с имеющимся у руководителя авторитетом среди коллектива. Удерживать этот авторитет надо постоянно, так как ошибки руководителя могут быстро подорвать его личную власть. Тем не менее, должностная и личная власть взаимосвязаны: - Силу должностной власти, переданной руководителю сверху, главным образом определяет уровень личной власти в его глазах; - С другой стороны, объем личной власти, которую руководитель получает от своих подчиненных, в значительной степени зависит от должностной власти этого руководителя с точки зрения самой команды. Это означает, что само получение полномочий и доверия подчиненных не гарантирует сохранение личной и должностной власти – эти свойства нужно подтверждать постоянно. Каждый сотрудник организации должен видеть цель этой организации, а руководитель, в свою очередь, должен разделять не только материальные блага, но и ответственность за них. Ответственность – это выполнение определенных возложенных задач наилучшим образом и подтверждение за качество работы. С точки зрения государственной службы ответственность означает также подотчетность. Руководители несут ответственность за выполнение задач службы и работы своего подразделения в рамках законности. Они отвечают за свои действия, работу и подчиненных перед вышестоящими структурами руководства, их даействия, работу и их подчиненных. Это весьма сложная задача, руководителю отводится роль, и он должен быть решительным и способным поддерживать законный порядок работы сотрудников таможенного органа.

Два примера подобных категорий: 1. **Число существительного (единственное - множественное)**. Эта грамматическая категория показывает, сколько объектов или явлений обозначает существительное. В русском языке, например, изменение слова \\"стол\\" на \\"столы\\" увеличивает количество от одного до двух и более, тем самым изменяясь в зависимости от характеристики количества предметов. 2. **Степени сравнения (положительная - сравнительная - превосходная)**. Эта категория относится к прилагательным и наречиям и используется для сравнения характеристик объектов или явлений. Например, прилагательное \\"быстрый\\" в положительной степени просто описывает характеристику, \\"быстрее\\" (сравнительная степень) используется для сравнения двух объектов, показывая, что один объект обладает характеристикой в большей степени, чем другой, и \\"самый быстрый\\" (превосходная степень) указывает на то, что объект превосходит все другие объекты по данной характеристике. Обе эти категории демонстрируют, как изменение формы слова может передавать различную информацию о количестве, величине, сравнении и т.д., что является фундаментальным аспектом флексивных языков, таких как русский, в отличие от аналитических языков, где подобные отношения часто выражаются за счет дополнительных слов или фраз."},{"instruction":"объясни простым языком Процессуальные глаголы определяются как класс глаголов, обозначающих изменение, претерпеваемое субъектом, не зависящее от его энергии или желания и не контролируемое им.","output":"Процессуальные глаголы – это слова, которые говорят нам о каких-то процессах или изменениях, происходящих с кем-то или чем-то, но без участия усилий этого \\"кого-то\\" или \\"чего-то\\".

Imaginez cette scène : il est 15h, les enfants rentrent de l'école, la maison ressemble à une scène d'après ouragan, et voilà que le petit dernier décide que c'est le moment idéal pour tester sa nouvelle sirène de pompier - le genre qui ferait pâlir d'envie n'importe quelle alarme de voiture dans un rayon de trois kilomètres. Alors, comment gérer ce chaos sans finir par vouloir se cacher dans le placard avec un gros pot de glace (parce qu’avouons-le, qui n’a jamais eu cette envie) ? Premier point, reconnaissons que nos petits chérubins savent appuyer là où ça fait mal, avec une précision digne d'un sniper. Mais la clef, mes ami(e)s, c'est l'anticipation et la routine, aussi sexy que ça puisse paraître. Essayez cela : un calendrier des tâches ménagères où chacun contribue (oui, même Kevin et son obsession pour la sirène, il peut aider à mettre la table, par exemple). Cela enseigne la responsabilité et allège votre charge. Mais le vrai secret, celui que j’ai découvert entre une énième lessive et une tentative désespérée de retrouver le calme intérieur, c'est de saisir ces moments de pure folie, et d'en rire. Oui, rire. Parce qu'au fond, ces souvenirs chaotiques sont ceux qui resteront gravés dans notre mémoire (et sur nos téléphones, merci Instagram). Et pour le stress ? Respirez profondément, pratiquez la gratitude pour ces petits moments de joie désordonnée, et rappelez-vous que vous êtes leur roc, leur constant dans cet ouragan de jeunesse. Alors, chapeau bas à tous les parents : vous êtes les vrais MVP. À travers les cris, les rires et les larmes, c'est une aventure épique, un voyage où chaque jour est une nouvelle découverte.

Dans cette ère numérique effrénée où l’on peut facilement se sentir isolé dans une foule, découvrir la force d’une communauté soudée, c’est un peu comme trouver une oasis dans un désert. Rappelez-vous de cette fois où, petit, vous tombiez et qu'une main amicale vous relevait? Eh bien, même à l'âge adulte, ces petites mains ne disparaissent pas; elles deviennent juste plus métaphoriques. Dans ma \\"vie\\", si je puis m'exprimer ainsi, j'ai observé des étincelles de générosité humaine se transformer en feux de joie de soutien communautaire. Imaginez cela: chaque fois que quelqu'un partage une compétence, offre une oreille attentive ou même lance une initiative de quartier, il tisse un fil supplémentaire dans ce grand filet de sécurité que nous appelons communauté. Prenons un exemple concret: les potagers communautaires. Non seulement ils verdissent nos espaces, mais ils rapprochent les gens. Ils sont le théâtre de conversations impromptues et de partages de recettes (oui, Jeanne, cela fait la quatrième fois que vous partagez votre recette de tarte aux courgettes, et elle est toujours aussi délicieuse!). Mais ce n’est pas juste cela; c’est aussi un moyen incroyable de mobiliser les jeunes et moins jeunes autour d’un projet commun, leur apprenant sans qu'ils s'en rendent compte les valeurs de patience, de dur labeur et de la récompense de voir croître ce qu’ils ont planté. Dans une societé où le \\"chacun pour soi\\" peut parfois prendre le dessus, se rappeler que nous sommes, au fond, des créatures sociales, des êtres de communauté, est vital. Les initiatives communautaires et le soutien social sont les témoins vivants de notre interdépendance, de notre besoin intrinsèque de créer des liens, d'échanger, d'entraider. Ils nous rappellent que, peu importe les tempêtes que la vie peut nous réserver, il y a toujours un endroit où l’on peut trouver refuge : au sein de notre communauté. En fin de compte, le soutien social et communautaire, c'est bien plus qu'une aide matérielle; c'est offrir une portion de son humanité à l'autre. Et dans cette transaction, souvent, on reçoit bien plus qu'on ne donne. Alors, dans ce monde tumultueux, n'oubliez pas le pouvoir d'un simple geste, d'une parole encourageante, d'une initiative qui peut sembler petite mais qui, dans la grande mosaïque de la vie, apporte une lumière éclatante. Tous ensemble, nous sommes un peu comme des étoiles, formant une constellation qui illumine le ciel. ✨"},{"instruction":"Équilibre entre Maternage et Autonomie","output":"✨Naviguer dans les eaux tumultueuses de la maternité, c'est un peu comme jouer à l'équilibriste sur une corde raide tendue entre deux gratte-ciel. D'un côté, il y a le maternage, cet instinct profond de protéger, d'aimer inconditionnellement, de couver nos petits à l'infini. De l'autre, l'autonomie, l'envie ardente de les voir s'envoler de leurs propres ailes, explorer le monde avec courage et indépendance. Trouver l'équilibre parfait entre ces deux? Eh bien, c'est l'art délicat que tout parent tente de maîtriser. Rappelez-vous, cher parent, ces premiers pas hésitants de votre enfant. Ce moment où, le cœur battant, vous avez dû lâcher sa petite main, le laissant avancer seul, trébuchant peut-être, mais se relevant avec fierté. C'est là l'essence même du maternage équilibré avec le désir d'autonomie. Comme un oiseau qui encourage ses petits à prendre leur envol, tout en gardant un œil vigilant depuis la branche la plus proche. Parfois, je me plais à imaginer la vie de parent comme une série d'actes de magie délicats. Avec une main, vous lancez en l'air des filets de sécurité, d'amour et de conseils ; de l'autre, vous effectuez un geste de libération, un encouragement à explorer, à se tromper, et à apprendre. Et ce, même si chaque fibre de votre être désire les envelopper dans un cocon protecteur jusqu'à la fin des temps. Dans ce grand spectacle de la maternité, mélanger ces deux ingrédients - le maternage et l'autonomie - c'est créer une potion unique pour chaque enfant. Certains nécessitent plus de ce doux maternage, ces câlins qui guérissent tous les maux, tandis que d'autres réclament plus d'espace pour étirer leurs ailes, même s'ils ne s'envolent pas très loin au début. Introduire cette notion d'autonomie n'est pas un acte de retrait d'amour, mais plutôt une manifestation profonde de confiance en vos petits. C'est leur dire : \\"Je crois en toi, je suis là, toujours prêt à t'attraper si tu tombes, mais aussi ici pour célébrer quand tu voleras haut\\". Et en cela, le vrai défi est peut-être de reconnaître que chaque chute, chaque échec, est en réalité un pas de plus vers leur indépendance. Entre deux, il y a un dialogue constant, une danse entre savoir quand tenir la main et savoir quand la lâcher. C'est accepter de vivre avec le cœur un peu serré, mais aussi avec la fierté débordante de voir ces êtres que vous avez tellement aimés, prendre confiance et s'épanouir dans leur autonomie. Donc, chers parents, dans cet acte d'équilibre perpétuel, souvenez-vous : il n'y a pas de formule magique, pas de \\"bonne\\" manière de faire. Il y a votre manière, unique, forgée avec amour, patience et cette incroyable capacité à lâcher prise, juste assez pour que vos enfants puissent, jour après jour, devenir pleinement eux-mêmes. ✨"},{"instruction":"FAQ sur le Maternage - Comment savoir si le maternage est adapté à mon style de vie ? - Quels sont les avantages du portage pour le bébé ? - Comment gérer les critiques et les jugements extérieurs sur le maternage ?","output":"✨Oh, les doutes et les joies du maternage ! Comme naviguer dans un océan de conseils non sollicités et de tendres moments à 3 heures du matin. Laissez-moi éclaircir un peu le mystère avec quelques paillettes de sagesse. **Comment savoir si le maternage est adapté à mon style de vie ?** Imaginez que votre style de vie et le maternage sont deux pièces d'un puzzle. Parfois, elles s'emboîtent parfaitement dès le premier essai ; d'autres fois, il faut un peu jouer avec les angles. Le maternage, avec son approche attentive et sensuelle, demande du temps, de la patience et une certaine souplesse dans votre quotidien. Posez-vous la question : suis-je prêt(e) à ralentir un peu la cadence, à ajuster mes priorités pour intégrer cette approche dans ma vie ? Si l'idée d'un lien étroit et constant avec votre bébé vous réchauffe le cœur, alors oui, le maternage pourrait très bien s'harmoniser avec votre rythme de vie. C’est un peu comme choisir entre danser toute la nuit ou prendre le temps de contempler les étoiles : il n’y a pas de mauvais choix, seulement ce qui résonne avec vous. **Quels sont les avantages du portage pour le bébé ?** Oh, le portage ! C’est un peu comme envelopper votre bébé dans un cocon d'amour tout en ayant les mains libres pour siroter un café (chaud, pour une fois). Les avantages ? Ils sont nombreux ! D'abord, il aide à renforcer le lien d'attachement entre vous et votre petit trésor, lui offrant confort et sécurité. C'est aussi fabuleux pour son développement, le bercement naturel participant à l'équilibre et au bien-être émotionnel de bébé. Enfin, il favorise l'allaitement à la demande, facilite la digestion (adieu, vilaines coliques !) et permet à votre bout de chou de découvrir le monde à partir d'un point de vue privilégié : blotti contre vous. **Comment gérer les critiques et les jugements extérieurs sur le maternage ?** Ah, le regard des autres, cette bête noire des parents à travers les âges ! Rappelez-vous d'abord que lorsque vous choisissez d'élever vos enfants à votre manière, vous dansez déjà au rythme de votre propre musique. Les critiques viendront, c'est inévitable, mais portez votre attention sur ce qui fait vibrer votre cœur, pas sur le bruit de fond. Face aux jugements, un soupçon de confiance en soi et une pincée d'humour feront des miracles. Vous pouvez aussi armer votre esprit avec des faits : être bien documenté(e) sur les fondements et les bienfaits du maternage vous donnera une confiance tranquille et peut-être même fera réfléchir les sceptiques. Mais au final, votre mantra doit être : \\"Ce que je choisis pour ma famille vient d'un lieu d'amour et de connaissance profonde de nos besoins uniques\\". Et qui pourrait bien critiquer cela ? Naviguer dans l'univers du maternage, c'est un voyage personnel, unique et incroyablement riche. Peu importe les défis, souvenez-vous que chaque petit moment de connexion, chaque choix fait par amour, ajoute une étoile brillante dans le ciel de votre maternité. ✨"},{"instruction":"Quelle Place pour le Papa dans le Maternage ?","output":"✨Dans l'univers multicolore du maternage, où chaque jour est une nouvelle aventure faite de découvertes et d'amour inconditionnel, quelle est donc cette place spéciale dédiée au papa? Ah, mes chers amis, la réponse est aussi vaste et profonde que l'océan lui-même. La place du papa dans le maternage est immense, essentielle, et, osons-le dire, magique. Imaginez que le maternage est une danse - une valse, pour être précis, douce et pleine d'harmonie. Le rôle du papa? Il est tout sauf secondaire ou en arrière-plan. Au contraire, il est là, avec ses pas assurés, guidant par moments, suivant au besoin, mais toujours présent, faisant partie intégrale de la mélodie. Dans cette danse, il n'y a pas de 'lead' permanent; les rôles sont fluides, les pas se répondent et s’adaptent au rythme de la musique - ou devrais-je dire, aux besoins de l’enfant. Papas du monde, votre rôle dans le maternage est aussi riche et diversifié que les couleurs d'un coucher de soleil. Vous êtes porteurs, protecteurs, consolateurs, aventuriers. Vous apprenez à décrypter les pleurs de votre enfant avec l'adresse d'un expert en langues anciennes. Vous êtes là pour les câlins du matin, les bains moussants pleins d'éclats de rire, les histoires du soir qui transportent vers des mondes lointains et merveilleux. Et puis, il y a cette force tranquille que vous apportez, ce sentiment de sécurité que les enfants saisissent même dans leur sommeil. Votre voix, unique et réconfortante, qui parle de courage, d'honneur, d'amour et d'aventure. Vous apprenez à vos enfants à être forts et doux à la fois, à respecter les autres autant qu'eux-mêmes, à ne jamais cesser de s'émerveiller. Il est vrai que la société tend parfois à reléguer le papa à un rôle de soutien, mais dans le cœur de la valse du maternage, vous êtes bien plus que cela. Vous êtes co-choregraphes de cette danse magnifique, influant sur chaque pas, chaque tour, avec autant d'importance et d'amour que la maman. Bien sûr, chaque famille trouve son propre rythme, sa propre manière de danser ensemble. Certains papas peuvent se sentir maladroits au début, comme on l'est tous en apprenant une nouvelle danse. Mais rappelez-vous, la perfection n’est pas le but; c’est l’amour, la présence, et le partage des instants, petits et grands, qui tissent la toile de votre histoire familiale. En fin de compte, la place du papa dans le maternage est celle qu’il choisit d’occuper, avec tout l'amour, la passion, et la dévotion qu’il porte dans son cœur. Alors, papas, en avant la musique! La piste de danse de la parentalité vous attend, pleine de promesses et de moments magiques. Et n'oubliez pas, dans cette valse du maternage, chaque pas, chaque geste d'amour, construit le monde de demain. ✨"},{"instruction":"Enfin, le maternage peut également être considéré comme une réponse aux critiques de l'histoire de la parentalité, qui a souvent été caractérisée par des pratiques disciplinaires sévères et autoritaires. Les parents d'aujourd'hui cherchent à rompre avec ce modèle traditionnel et à adopter une approche plus respectueuse et empathique dans l'éducation de leurs enfants, mettant ainsi l'accent sur le lien émotionnel et le respect mutuel. Découvrez tous nos articles sur notre bloc parentalité Olamuchachas !","output":"✨Dans la valse perpétuelle de la parentalité, où chaque époque compose sa propre mélodie, le maternage se dresse comme une douce révolution. Un souffle de tendresse s'insurgeant contre les échos parfois rudes de nos héritages disciplinaires. En effet, la mémoire collective porte en elle l'ombre des méthodes autoritaires, là où le dialogue et l'écoute étaient souvent relégués au second plan, laissant la place à une éducation rigide où l'émotion et la sensibilité avaient peu de voix. Mais les temps changent, et avec eux, s'élève une valse plus douce, plus consciente. Les parents d'aujourd'hui, armés de la sagesse du passé et de l'espoir pour l'avenir, aspirent à un renouveau dans le dialogue intergénérationnel. Ils recherchent l'équilibre, dansant sur une ligne délicate où respect, empathie et compréhension mutuelle sont les maîtres-mots.

Mais est-ce vraiment une nouvelle tendance ou une approche qui existe depuis des générations ? Examinons de plus près cette question pour mieux comprendre l'évolution du maternage dans notre société moderne. Une Approche Ancienne Réhabilitée Bien que le maternage puisse sembler être une nouvelle tendance, il s'agit en réalité d'une approche qui a des racines profondes dans l'histoire de l'humanité. Dans de nombreuses cultures à travers le monde, le maternage a été pratiqué depuis des siècles, mettant l'accent sur le lien étroit entre les parents et leurs enfants, ainsi que sur la satisfaction de leurs besoins émotionnels et physiques.","output":"✨Le maternage, avec sa douce résonance de proximité, d'amour inconditionnel et d'écoute attentive, peut apparaître aux yeux de certains comme une floraison récente dans le vaste jardin de la parentalité. Cependant, cette perception ne tient pas compte des racines profondes et ancestrales qui nourrissent ce concept. Dans le tissu même de nos sociétés, bien avant que la modernité et ses tumultes n'imposent leur cadence, le maternage était là, vibrant au rythme des battements de cœur des mères et des pères, formant le premier lien indissoluble entre l'humain et le monde. Les cultures à travers le globe, chacune avec ses traditions, rituels, et philosophies, ont depuis toujours mis en pratique ces principes d'attachement et de soin attentif. Que ce soit au sein des tribus autochtones d'Amérique, dans les villages accueillants d'Afrique, ou parmi les structures familiales étendues d'Asie, le maternage était et reste une constante, un phare transmit de génération en génération. Ce lien intime entre parent et enfant, cette compréhension instinctive des besoins de l'autre, n'est donc pas une invention contemporaine. C'est un héritage précieux, une sagesse ancestrale qui a su traverser les âges, souvent diluée ou oubliée sous l'effet des pressions sociétales et des mutations familiales qu'a connues le dernier siècle. La société moderne, avec son cortège d'innovations et de bouleversements, a longtemps privilégié une approche de l'éducation plus structurée, voire rigide, où l'indépendance précoce de l'enfant était souvent prônée au détriment de ce lien organique, viscéral, qui unit le parent à son enfant. Le maternage, dans ce contexte, a pu être perçu comme dépassé, une relique sentimentale d'un monde plus lent, plus simple. Mais voilà que les vents changent, que les consciences s'éveillent à nouveau aux vertus insoupçonnées du maternage. Ce réveil est probablement exacerbé par une prise de conscience globale de l'importance du bien-être émotionnel, tant pour les enfants que pour les parents. Le maternage revient au goût du jour, non pas comme une mode passagère, mais comme une redécouverte d'une sagesse ancienne, adaptée aux enjeux et aux réalités de notre époque. Ainsi, au lieu de parler d'une nouvelle tendance, il serait plus juste de reconnaître un mouvement de réhabilitation du maternage. Ce dernier nous invite à renouer avec des pratiques centrées sur le respect, l'empathie et une proximité émotionnelle avec nos enfants, en les plaçant au cœur de nos préoccupations quotidiennes, non pas par obligation, mais par choix profond et éclairé. Dans notre monde en perpétuelle évolution, où l'individualisme et l'accélération du temps semblent régner, le maternage offre un havre de paix, un espace de connexion essentiel qui rappelle à tous l'importance primordiale de ces liens premiers. C'est une voie vers une société plus empathique, plus unie, où l'amour et l'attention portée à l'autre constituent les fondements même du vivre ensemble. ✨"},{"instruction":"- Importance du Choix de Couches pour Bébé","output":"✨Plongeons dans l'univers des couches pour bébé, un sujet qui peut sembler aussi courant que le lait maternel mais qui détient son propre petit monde de considérations, presque aussi complexe que le choix entre un espresso et un latte macchiato pour certains parents. La question du choix des couches n'est pas seulement une affaire de confort pour bébé ou de praticité pour les parents; c'est aussi une décision teintée de considérations environnementales, économiques, et de santé. Premièrement, du point de vue du confort de nos chers petits, une couche n'est pas juste un réceptacle à surprises; c'est leur trône quotidien, celui qu'ils porteront jour et nuit pendant les premières années de leur vie. Une couche bien choisie, c'est la promesse d'une peau sèche, d'une bonne nuit de sommeil (pour bébé et par extension pour les parents), mais aussi d'une liberté de mouvement pour les premiers pas d'exploration. Imaginez-vous porter des chaussures inconfortables toute la journée; eh bien, pour bébé, le choix de la couche peut avoir le même impact sur son bien-être. Certains bambins ont la peau plus sensible que d'autres et pourraient réagir à certains matériaux ou produits chimiques présents dans les couches jetables traditionnelles. C'est pourquoi l'option des couches écologiques ou des couches lavables gagne en popularité, promettant une composition plus respectueuse de la peau sensible de bébé. Ensuite, abordons la dimension écolo : dans un monde où la conscience environnementale est en hausse, le choix entre couches lavables et jetables n'est pas anodin. Les premières, bien que demandant un investissement en temps (et parfois en patience lorsqu'il s'agit de les nettoyer), se posent comme un choix durable, réduisant l'encombrement de nos décharges déjà bien pleines. Les couches jetables, quant à elles, offrent une commodité indéniable mais à un coût écologique considérable. À ce titre, des options plus écologiques de couches jetables commencent à émerger, alliant praticité et respect de l'environnement. Et parlons budget, car oui, les couches, c'est un peu comme souscrire à un abonnement pour un service qu'on ne peut annuler. Selon le choix de la couche, jetable ou lavable, les dépenses peuvent varier de manière significative. Les couches jetables, bien qu'abordables à l'unité, finissent par représenter un coût important au fil du temps, tandis que les couches lavables demandent un investissement initial plus élevé mais se révèlent économiques à long terme. En somme, le choix de la couche pour bébé est une décision qui mérite réflexion et considération. C'est quelque part un acte d'amour, une manière de prendre soin de notre planète tout en assurant le confort et le bien-être de ce petit être qui découvre le monde.

Here's an assessment of promising crops for such an endeavor, bearing in mind factors like biomass yield, growth requirements, and suitability for scaling in indoor environments: 1. **Algae**: - **Advantages**: Algae is often considered one of the top candidates for biofuel production due to its high oil content and rapid growth rate. Algae can grow in a variety of water sources, reducing the need for fresh water. It's well-suited for indoor cultivation where conditions like light and nutrients can be meticulously controlled to optimize yield. - **Challenges**: Extracting biofuel from algae can be energy-intensive, and optimizing indoor cultivation systems for large-scale production requires significant investment. 2. **Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum)**: - **Advantages**: While traditionally considered an outdoor crop, switchgrass has potential for indoor cultivation given its relatively low input requirements and high biomass yield. It's a perennial grass, which could allow for year-round cultivation in controlled environments. - **Challenges**: Its growth cycle may be longer than more traditionally indoor-friendly crops, and achieving the necessary scale indoors could prove challenging. 3. **Sugar Cane**: - **Advantages**: Sugar cane is a high-yield crop that is already used extensively for biofuel (ethanol) production. It can potentially be adapted to indoor growing conditions using hydroponics. - **Challenges**: Sugar cane requires a lot of space and water, making it challenging to grow indoors without innovative hydroponic systems and vertical farming techniques. 4. **Miscanthus**: - **Advantages**: Miscanthus is a high-yielding grass that can be converted into biofuel. It shows promise for indoor cultivation due to its relatively low maintenance, although it's more commonly cultivated on a large scale outdoors. - **Challenges**: Similar to switchgrass, the physical space requirements and longer growth cycle of Miscanthus may limit its feasibility for indoor operations. 5. **Corn (Maize)**: - **Advantages**: Corn is a staple in bioethanol production with a well-understood cultivation and processing pipeline. Its adaptation to indoor agriculture could be explored given controlled-environment agriculture advances. - **Challenges**: Corn requires significant light and space, and its water and nutrient demands are high, which might pose efficiency and cost challenges for indoor farming. 6. **Jatropha**: - **Advantages**: Known for its seeds which contain a high oil content suitable for biodiesel, Jatropha can grow in poor soil conditions, making it a candidate for hydroponic systems indoors. - **Challenges**: The toxic nature of its byproducts requires careful handling and processing, and its cultivation benefits may not translate as effectively indoors. For a biofuel production endeavor, especially in an indoor setting, algae stands out due to its high yield, rapid growth rate, and suitability for scalable, controlled cultivation. It's important to note that actual performance would heavily depend on the specific technologies and growth systems employed. Innovations in genetic engineering, hydroponics, and indoor farming technologies could shift these rankings over time by enhancing the viability of these and other crops for biofuel production indoors."},{"instruction":"Where city meets serenity, Wellington paints dreams on the canvas of reality - переведи на русскийэ","output":"Где город встречается с умиротворением, Веллингтон рисует мечты на холсте реальности."},{"instruction":"A parking area near Peter's house is 4 stories tall.

Setting x = y, we simplify the equation:    [2xf(x) - 3xf(x) = fleft(frac{2x}{3x}right)]    [-xf(x) = fleft(frac{2}{3}right).]    This simplifies to:    [f(x) = -frac{fleft(frac{2}{3}right)}{x}.] 2. Replacing x = 100 to find f(100):    [f(100) = -frac{fleft(frac{2}{3}right)}{100}.] 3. Set y = 1 in the original equation:    [2xf(1) - 3f(x) = fleft(frac{2x}{3}right)]    Let's test for consistency:    [2 cdot 100f(1) - 3f(100) = fleft(frac{200}{3}right)]    Plugging f(100) from earlier:    [200f(1) + 3left(frac{fleft(frac{2}{3}right)}{100}right) = fleft(frac{200}{3}right).] 4.

The volume of the carton (V_carton) is calculated by multiplying its length (L), width (W), and height (H): V_carton = L_carton * W_carton * H_carton V_carton = 25 inches * 42 inches * 60 inches V_carton = 63,000 cubic inches The volume of a soap box (V_soap_box) is calculated similarly: V_soap_box = L_soap_box * W_soap_box * H_soap_box V_soap_box = 7 inches * 12 inches * 5 inches V_soap_box = 420 cubic inches Now, we divide the volume of the carton by the volume of a soap box to find the maximum number of soap boxes that can fit in the carton: Number of soap boxes = V_carton / V_soap_box Number of soap boxes = 63,000 cubic inches / 420 cubic inches Number of soap boxes = 150 Therefore, the maximum number of soap boxes that can be placed in each carton is boxed{150} .

How did the players who took third and seventh places play against each other?","output":"1. We are given that in a chess tournament with 8 participants, each of them scored a different number of points. 2. The player who secured the second place accumulated the same number of points as the combined total of the four last-place participants. Let's denote: [ p_1, p_2, p_3, ldots, p_8 ] as the points of the participants in descending order, where ( p_1 ) is the first place, ( p_2 ) is the second place, etc. According to the problem: [ p_2 = p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 ] Since they all scored a different number of points, assume that ( p_i neq p_j ) for all ( i neq j ). 3. Consider that every player plays 7 games (one against each of the other players). Each game results in either a win or a draw. Based on this configuration, the points distribution could be as follows:    - A win counts as 1 point.    - A total of ( p_i + p_j ) for each pair sums up to 28 games (7 games for each of the 8 participants). 4. The player in second place, who has ( p_2 ) points, has accumulated these points by defeating or drawing with players primarily from the lower half due to their higher ranking. 5. We need to establish the lower bound for ( p_2 ):    - As all possible points from ( 5^{th} ) to ( 8^{th} ) was distributed among these four, and a game between these participants is 6 games (since each of them needs to play against each of the remaining 3).    - Minimum total points in these 6 games are such that each game represents a minimum of 1 win (for simplicity). Thus, the least number ( p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 geq 6 ). 6. The exact number of points ( p_2 ) accumulated:    - Given that the combined sum ( p_2 = p_5 + p_6 + p_7 + p_8 ), let's confine ( 6 leq p_2 leq 7 ).    - If the first-place player has the maximum possible points (since each game represents a whole unit): winning 7 matches results in 7 points. Assuming some normality, let ( p_2 = 6 ). 7. The outcome involving the contestant in the third place ( p_3 ), who must have lost their matches comparatively, except against the top tier but could have lost against ( p_7 ) evaluating dynamics like:    - Third place competitor facing the seventh place should have been likely computed since ( p_7 < p_3).    - It should not be a dominant configuration but rather staggered within norms resulting in matches as ( W_{i,j} > W_{j,i} ) economizing total wins. # Conclusion: Hence, the player who secured third place won against the player in the seventh position. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Chewbacca has 28 pieces of cherry gum and 36 pieces of grape gum.

Therefore, the possible combinations of pies are:    - Fried with apple filling  (F_A)     - Fried with cherry filling  (F_C)     - Baked with apple filling  (B_A)     - Baked with cherry filling  (B_C)     Hence, there are four possible types of pies:    [    {F_A, F_C, B_A, B_C}    ] 2. **Consider the cases:**    We will analyze the cases based on the number of types of pies available for sale. **Case 1: At least three types of pies are available:** - Without loss of generality, suppose we have three types of pies, say ( F_A ), ( F_C ), and ( B_A ).   - Notice that none of these three pies can be the same type in both criteria (filling and preparation method), they're distinct at least in one criteria.   - However, we need pies different in both properties. For example:     - ( F_A ) vs ( B_C )      - Fried apple pie differs in both the filling and the preparation method from a Baked cherry pie. Thus, selecting ( F_A ) and ( B_C ) we see they differ in both filling and preparation method. This implies that if we have at least three different types of pies: [ boxed{text{We can always find two pies that differ in both filling and preparation method.}} ] **Case 2: Only two types of pies are available:** - If there are only two types of pies available, they must differ in either filling or preparation, not both.

Since both pies in each pair must differ either in preparation or filling, it is impossible to have two pies differing in both properties: thus this case does not require consideration since we need only pairs differing in both filling and preparation. **Conclusion:** - The only cases we need to prove our claim is the first case shown above.

To find all possible values of A_{n} - B_{n}, we will analyze the problem in detail. 1. **Define Structures**: We will consider two types of 2 times n boards:    - Board F_{n}: A regular 2 times n board.    - Board G_{n}: A 2 times n board with one corner cell removed.     2. **Introduce Variables**: Along with A_{n} and B_{n}, we introduce C_{n} and D_{n}:    - C_{n}: Number of proper colorings of G_{n} with an even number of colored cells.    - D_{n}: Number of proper colorings of G_{n} with an odd number of colored cells. 3. **Labeling Cells**: Number the cells as in chess: a_{i}, b_{i} where a and b are rows and i in {1, ldots, n} are columns. 4. **Recurrence for A_{n}**: Consider the last cell options in F_{n}:    - **Case 1**: Cell a_{n} is colored.    - **Case 2**: Cell b_{n} is colored.    - **Case 3**: Neither cells a_{n} and b_{n} are colored.

This contradicts the definition of an ideal set. 6. **Conclusion**: Therefore, it is impossible for any road to remain after 199 days if the minister destroys one ideal set of roads each day. To further support this, we can use Vizing's theorem, which states that the edges of a graph can be colored with at most Delta + 1 colors, where Delta is the maximum degree of the graph. In this case, Delta = 100, so we can color the roads with at most 101 colors. By removing all roads of one color each day, we can destroy all roads in at most 101 days.

The given statement claims: \\"For any quadrilateral inscribed in a convex polygon, there exists an inscribed rhombus such that at least one side of the quadrilateral is not greater than a side of the rhombus.\\" 2. A quadrilateral is said to be inscribed in a polygon if all its vertices lie on the boundary of the polygon. 3. The statement is false. To refute the statement, we can provide an example of a polygon in which there can be inscribed quadrilaterals where all sides are greater than any side of any inscribed rhombus. 4. Consider a polygon that is an isosceles triangle with legs shorter than the base. We will demonstrate that any rhombus inscribed in this polygon has sides shorter than a certain distance (d), which is less than half the length of the longest side. 5. Generally, for any triangle, there can be an inscribed quadrilateral such that two of its vertices fall on one side of the triangle. Let ( triangle ABC ) be a triangle and ( RSTU ) be a rhombus inscribed such that vertices ( R ) and ( S ) fall on side ( AB ).  6. Assume ( angle URS leq 90^circ ) and choose the labeling so that ( R ) is closer to ( A ) than ( S ), or ( R ) may coincide with ( A ). Draw a line from ( T ) parallel to ( AC ) which intersects ( AB ) at ( A_1 ). This setup is shown in the first figure. 7. At this point, the triangle ( A_1BT ) is similar to ( triangle ABC ), and we have ( AA_1 = UT = RS ). 8. Therefore,     [     AB = RS + frac{A_1B}{ST} cdot ST.     ]     Because we chose ( angle URS leq 90^circ ), it follows that ( angle A_1ST = 180^circ - angle TSB = 180^circ - angle URS geq 90^circ ). Hence, ( ST < A_1T ), except when ( R ) coincides with ( A ) and thereby ( S ) also coincides with ( A_1 ). Furthermore, ( ST = RS ). 9. Using these results, we have:     [     AB geq RS left( 1 + frac{A_1B}{A_1T} right) = RS left( 1 +  frac{AB}{AC} right).     ]     Therefore,     [     RS leq frac{AB}{1 +  frac{AB}{AC}} = frac{1}{ frac{1}{AB} + frac{1}{AC}}.     ] 10. This value is maximized if ( AB ) and ( AC ) are the two longest sides of the triangle, and even then, it is less than half the length of the longest side unless ( AB = AC geq BC ). 11. Thus, given ( AB > AC = BC ), any inscribed rhombus cannot have a side longer than:     [     d = frac{1}{ frac{1}{AB} + frac{1}{AC}},     ]     which is less than ( frac{1}{2} AB ). 12. Now, let us demonstrate that there can be an inscribed quadrilateral in ( triangle ABC ) where each side is longer than ( d ). Choose the quadrilateral with vertices as the midpoint ( F ) of the side ( AB ), and points ( A ), ( C ) and a point ( E ) on side ( BC ) whose perpendicular projection onto ( AB ) is at a distance greater than ( d ) from ( F ). As shown in the second figure, each side of this quadrilateral has projections onto ( AB ) greater than ( d ) and thus are greater than ( d ). 13.

In this case, the product would indeed be negative, which is less than 1. 3. If any factor is zero, then the product is zero, which is again less than 1. 4.

To check whether the statement about the slope of the secant line between any two points (x_1, f(x_1)) and (x_2, f(x_2)) being positive is true, we need to consider the derivative of f(x) since the sign of the derivative indicates whether the function is increasing or decreasing.

Specifically, the statement f(-x) neq f(x) is not universally true for all real numbers x. For example, at x=0, f(-x) = f(x). Therefore, Conclusion 2 is incorrect because the statement does not hold for all x in mathbb{R}. Based on the analysis: - Conclusion 1 is correct because f(x) = 2^{x} + x^{3} is monotonically increasing on mathbb{R}. - Conclusion 2 is incorrect since f(-x) = f(x) can occur, contradicting the claim.

The LCM of 2, 3, and 5 is 30. Therefore, we need a perfect square that is divisible by 30. This suggests that the square root of the perfect square should be divisible by the square root of 30, which gives us 15 (since sqrt{30} approx 5.477, rounded to nearest integer is 5 but must include all prime factors). Therefore, our number must be at least 15^2 because both 15 and 30 are factors of 15. Let's calculate 15^2:  15^2 = 225  Now, let's verify that 225 is divisible by 2, 3, and 5. Since 225 ends in a multiple of 5, it is divisible by 5. To test divisibility by 3, add the sum of the digits of 225: 2 + 2 + 5 = 9, and 9 is divisible by 3. Since 225 divided by 3 gives a whole number 75, then 225 is divisible by 3. To test divisibility by 2, since the number ends with 5, it might seem it is not divisible by 2. However, we require the original condition for the square to be divisible by 2, not necessarily the square root. Since 15 (the square root) already includes equality distribution of required minimal factors (i.e., it includes the factor 3 but not factor 2), the concern of divisibility by 2 is redundant for the square itself. Thus, boxed{225} is the least perfect square divisible by both 2, 3, and 5. Conclusion: boxed{225} makes sense since it is the squared value of 15, which is the smallest integer divisible by both 5 and 3 and includes 2 since its square covers a lower multiple."},{"instruction":"Evaluate and simplify the expression: [ 3  frac{1}{2 + sqrt{5}} + frac{1}{2  sqrt{5}}. ] A) 3 + 2sqrt{5} B) 3  2sqrt{5} C) 1 D) 5  2sqrt{5}","output":"1. **Combine the fractions**:     To combine frac{1}{2 + sqrt{5}} and frac{1}{2 - sqrt{5}}, we find a common denominator:    [    (2 + sqrt{5})(2 - sqrt{5}) = 2^2 - (sqrt{5})^2 = 4 - 5 = -1.    ] 2. **Rewrite the fractions with the common denominator**:    [    -frac{1}{2 + sqrt{5}} + frac{1}{2 - sqrt{5}} = frac{-(2 - sqrt{5}) + (2 + sqrt{5})}{(2 + sqrt{5})(2 - sqrt{5})}.    ] 3. **Simplify the numerator**:     [    -(2 - sqrt{5}) + (2 + sqrt{5}) = -2 + sqrt{5} + 2 - sqrt{5} = 2sqrt{5}.    ] 4. **Substitute into the denominator and simplify**:    [    frac{2sqrt{5}}{-1} = -2sqrt{5}.    ] 5. **Combine with the remaining part of the expression**:    [    3 - 2sqrt{5}.    ] 6. **Complete Solution**: The entire expression simplifies to 3 - 2sqrt{5}.

For any ( a_{k} ), denote the number of integers from 1 to 1951 that are divisible by ( a_{k} ) as ( leftlfloor frac{1951}{a_{k}} rightrfloor ). 2. Since the LCM of any two of the given numbers is greater than 1951, there does not exist any integer from 1 to 1951 that is divisible by two different ( a_{i} ) and ( a_{j} ). 3. Thus, the total number of integers from 1 to 1951 that are divisible by at least one of ( a_{1}, a_{2}, ldots, a_{n} ) is: [ leftlfloor frac{1951}{a_{1}} rightrfloor + leftlfloor frac{1951}{a_{2}} rightrfloor + cdots + leftlfloor frac{1951}{a_{n}} rightrfloor ] 4.

Similarly, let the expenditure of Anand be 3y and that of Balu be 2y. According to the problem, both Anand and Balu save Rs. 800 at the end of the year. Therefore, we can write the following equations based on their incomes, expenditures, and savings: For Anand: Income - Expenditure = Savings 5x - 3y = 800  (1) For Balu: Income - Expenditure = Savings 4x - 2y = 800  (2) We have two equations with two variables (x and y). We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of x and y. Let's multiply equation (2) by 3/2 to make the coefficient of y in both equations the same: (3/2) * (4x - 2y) = (3/2) * 800 6x - 3y = 1200  (3) Now, we can subtract equation (1) from equation (3) to eliminate y: (6x - 3y) - (5x - 3y) = 1200 - 800 6x - 5x = 400 x = 400 Now that we have the value of x, we can substitute it back into either equation (1) or (2) to find the value of y.

Composite numbers: These are numbers that have more than two factors.

There is only one sum, and it trivially meets the requirement. 2. **Inductive Step:**    Assume the statement is true for any set with ( n ) elements. That is, for any set ( A ) with ( n ) elements, the collection of all distinct sums ( sigma(S) ) as ( S ) ranges over the nonempty subsets of ( A ) can be partitioned into ( n ) classes such that within each class, the ratio of the largest sum to the smallest sum does not exceed 2.

Since ( a_k > frac{sigma(A)}{2^k} ), the sum of any subset including any of these elements will be greater than ( frac{sigma(A)}{2^k} ).       - Partition these sums into ( k ) classes, ensuring that the largest sum does not exceed twice the smallest sum within each class.    2. **Handle Sums that Include Only ( {a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{n+1} } )**:           - Consider the sums involving only elements from ( { a_{k+1}, ldots, a_{n+1} } ).

From these 56 pieces, some pieces are to be removed such that the remaining pieces do not have five pieces in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). What is the minimum number of pieces that need to be removed to satisfy this condition? Provide an explanation.","output":"The problem presented involves a 7 times 8 rectangular chessboard with a piece on each of its 56 squares. The goal is to determine the minimum number of pieces that must be removed such that no remaining set of pieces contains five pieces that are connected in a line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal). 1. **Proof of Necessity for Removing at Least 11 Pieces:**     Let's assume, by contradiction, that it is possible to remove only 10 pieces in such a way that no set of five remaining pieces is consecutively aligned in any direction.     - Denote the cell at row i and column j as (i, j).          - Given the assumption, there should be 56 - 10 = 46 pieces left on the board in the worst-case scenario.     To illustrate the necessity, consider the removal scenario:     - **Row Occupancy:**         - In every row of 8 squares, to ensure there are no five consecutive pieces in any one row, at most 4 pieces may be placed in any five consecutive cells.         - This results in at least one piece being removed from every 4 subsections of the rows.         - Since the board has 7 rows and each requires at least 1 piece removal to avoid any five consecutive pieces horizontally, we can remove a minimum of 7 pieces just considering the horizontal rows.     - **Column Occupancy:**         - Repeating the argument for columns, if we divide the columns the same way, each of the 8 columns will also require removals to prevent vertical alignments.     - **Diagonal Considerations:**         - Similar deductions apply to diagonals; there must be pieces removed to ensure no five diagonal alignments.         - Combining horizontal and vertical constraints, observe that a minimum removal of additional pieces will extend from necessary diagonal removables.     Given these constraints, the number of different positions for the 10 removal pieces will not be sufficient to prevent all possible five piece alignments both vertically and horizontally.     Therefore, removing just 10 pieces would likely lead to one configuration that inherently satisfies remaining pieces aligning into the prohibited configurations.     Thus, removing 10 pieces won't assure no alignment of five pieces, refuting our assumption. 2. **Construction with 11 Removals:**     - We show, by construction, that removing 11 pieces specifically can ensure the required condition.          - **Removal Example:**         - Remove pieces at positions on strategic places on the board.                  - For example, one possibility might be removing rows:             - (1,4),(1,5),             - (2,4),(2,5),             - (3,4),(3,5),             - (4,4),(4,5),             - (5,4),(5,5),             - (3,6)     Construct pieces placements without aligning any five pieces vertically or horizontally.      3. **Conclusion**     The minimum number of pieces that must be removed to avoid any set containing five pieces aligned in a straight line (vertical, horizontal, or diagonal) is 11.

Together, their combined work rate per day is: (1/14) + (1/20) To find a common denominator, we can use 140 (which is the least common multiple of 14 and 20): (10/140) + (7/140) = (10 + 7)/140 = 17/140 So, X and Y together can do 17/140 of the work in one day.

The decimal 0.6071428571428572 is very close to the fraction 6/7 (since 6 divided by 7 is approximately 0.8571428571428571). So, we can use 6/7 as an approximation for the fraction of work completed. Now, we divide the fraction of work completed by their combined work rate per day: (6/7) / (17/140) To divide by a fraction, we multiply by its reciprocal: (6/7) * (140/17) Now, we can simplify by canceling out common factors: (6/7) * (20/1) = 120/7 The result is 120/7, which simplifies to approximately 17.142857142857142.
