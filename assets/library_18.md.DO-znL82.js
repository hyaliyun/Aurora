Here is a news article: Marijuana in America: Shifting Attitudes, Events and Laws      Public support for legalizing marijuana use is at an all-time high of 54%, according to Pew Research polling. This interactive explores events that have taken place over the last 45 years and the states’ legal actions on marijuana use.      Timeline: Marijuana in America      Americans' views on the legalization of marijuana have ebbed and flowed over the past four decades. Click through the points in the interactive timeline below to see significant marijuana legal and cultural events over time.      Marijuana Laws in 50 States      Marijuana use is now legal in some form or decriminalized in 24 states and the District of Columbia. Pew Research Center has found growing public support for legalization over the past decade.      Federal law prohibits the possession, selling or harvesting of marijuana. Decriminalization laws reduce the penalties associated with the use or possession of small amounts of marijuana.      SOURCE: National Conference of State Legislatures and National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws ||||| John Wagner      Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley (D) said Monday that he will sign a bill decriminalizing possession of small amounts of marijuana.      On a 34-to-8 vote, the Senate gave final approval to the legislation Monday afternoon. The bill would impose only civil fines, rather than criminal sanctions, on those caught with less than 10 grams of the drug.      At least 24 other states now have either decriminalized the use of marijuana, approved it for medicinal purposes or legalized it outright, according to a study by the Pew Research Center for the People & the Press.      “As a young prosecutor, I once thought that decriminalizing the possession of marijuana might undermine the public will necessary to combat drug violence and improve public safety,” O’Malley said in a statement. “I now think that [it] is an acknowledgment of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health.”      Maryland would join several states and jurisdictions, including the District of Columbia, that have moved in recent years to legalize or decriminalize the drug.      The House voted Saturday 78 to 55 to approve the measure.      The decriminalization bill followed a tortuous route to passage, having narrowly survived efforts by House Judiciary Committee Joseph F. Vallario Jr. (D-Prince George’s) and others to kill it in committee, by appointing a task force to study the issue.      But a group of lawmakers, including the Black Legislative Caucus, argued that the time had come to end this chapter in the war on drugs. Supporters cast the issue as a matter of civil rights, noting data showing that African Americans go to jail at a higher rate for marijuana possession, despite usage levels that are no different from those of whites.      “It’s rare you see that kind of turnaround that fast,” said Sen. Robert A. Zirkin (D-Baltimore County), the bill’s sponsor.      Zirkin said Vallario deserved some credit for ultimately signing off on the measure and doing so in a politically savvy way. Vallario opposed decriminalization on principle, Zirkin said, but the chairman also felt growing public support for such a measure, particularly in his district.      With decriminalization, violators would receive citations similar to traffic tickets for possession of less than 10 grams of marijuana: the person could either pay the fine in full or request a trial date in District Court. Failure to appear would be a misdemeanor under the criminal code. Records of convictions would not be subject to public inspection, the bill says.      As initially passed by the Senate last month, the legislation would have imposed a straight 100 fine on violators — regardless of the number of convictions — and authorized a court to require third-time offenders to enter a drug treatment program.      The final bill that emerged from the House and Senate would have escalating fines for multiple offenses: a second violation would carry a 250 fine, and a third offense would have a 500 fine. A court would be required to order a drug assessment for a third-time offender. In addition, a violator who is younger than 21 years old would have to appear before a court; the initial version in the Senate applied that sanction to people under 18 years old.      Last year, the legislature took a step toward decriminalization by easing penalties for possession of less than 10 grams to 500 fine and up to 90 days in jail.      O’Malley, who rose to political prominence as a tough-on-crime mayor of Baltimore, began this session by pronouncing that he was “not much in favor” of legalizing marijuana for recreational use, as Colorado and Washington state have recently done. He called the drug “a gateway to even more harmful behavior.”      But O’Malley, who is considering a 2016 White House bid, has been more open to more moderate marijuana reforms.      “The General Assembly has decided after much consideration — and with clear majorities in both Chambers -- to send to my desk a bill that would decriminalize the possession of small amounts of marijuana, and I plan to sign it,” he said in Monday’s statement. ||||| Assembly moves to decriminalize marijuana      House votes to make pot possession a civil offense      The House voted 78-55 to approve a measure substantially similar to the decriminalization bill overwhelmingly passed by the Senate last month. Senate President Thomas V. Mike Miller said his chamber would agree to the House's relatively minor changes and send the bill to Gov. Martin O'Malley.      The General Assembly moved Saturday to dramatically change Maryland's drug laws as the House of Delegates joined the Senate in voting to make possession of small amounts of marijuana a civil offense punishable only by a fine.      Meanwhile, key lawmakers also have reached a tentative compromise on how to revamp the state's medical marijuana law to make sure patients can get the drug. That measure is also expected to receive final approval before the Assembly adjourns at midnight Monday.      House Speaker Michael E. Busch, who came into the session a skeptic about treating marijuana possession as a civil offense, cast his vote for decriminalization.      \\"The fact of the matter is a lot of people utilize this, and it has not been effective putting them in jail and throwing away the key,\\" he said.      The House vote came on a busy Saturday as both chambers scrambled to resolve the remaining sticky issues facing the legislature before Monday night. The tally split largely along party lines, with three Republicans joining 75 Democrats in supporting the measure. Twenty Democrats and 35 Republicans voted no.      O'Malley, like Busch, has long had reservations about more lenient marijuana laws, but the governor has said he will keep an open mind in reviewing the bill.      If O'Malley signs the measure, Maryland would become the 18th state to stop treating simple possession as a criminal offense, according to the Marijuana Policy Project. Two of them, Colorado and Washington, have legalized the regulated sale of the drug for recreational use.      The Maryland decriminalization legislation defines a small amount as 10 grams, a smaller amount than in most states.      The House acted on marijuana after the Judiciary Committee voted 13-8 earlier in the day to reverse its previous decision to approve only setting up a task force to study changes to marijuana laws.      The committee's reconsideration was the result of negotiations between Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph F. Vallario Jr., a proponent of the task force approach, and a group of his fellow Democrats who want to stop treating marijuana possession as a crime. They include members of the Legislative Black Caucus who point to racial disparities in the way marijuana laws have been enforced.      The resulting bargain gave decriminalization proponents most of what they wanted. Where marijuana possession is currently treated as a misdemeanor that carries a maximum 90-day jail term, the legislation would change it to a civil offense for adults, punishable by escalating fines. Minors caught with the drug would continue to be handled by the juvenile justice system.      The House kept the Senate's 100 fine for a first offense but increased the penalties for subsequent violations to 250 for a second and 500 for a third. For a first or second offense, a violator older than 21 would be able to prepay the fine by mail, but a three-time loser would have to go to court. If convicted, the judge would have to order the defendant into an education or treatment program. ||||| Maryland is set to become the 17th state to decriminalize marijuana. Democratic Governor Martin O'Malley released a statement on Monday, saying he intended to sign legislation that would mean those found in possession of small amounts of the drug would not face jail time. Governor O'Malley said that the decriminalization bill had majority support in the state, and that under current state laws, few defendants in marijuana cases go to prison as a matter of \\"judicial economy and prosecutorial discretion.\\"      Violent crime is at its lowest in Maryland in 30 years, and the governor said the new law would allow law enforcement officials to keep their focus on more serious crimes. \\"I now think that decriminalizing possession of marijuana is an acknowledgement of the low priority that our courts, our prosecutors, our police, and the vast majority of citizens already attach to this transgression of public order and public health,\\" he said in the statement. \\"Such an acknowledgment in law might even lead to a greater focus on far more serious threats to public safety and the lives of our citizens.\\"      Governor O'Malley said he would sign the bill when it reached him      Marijuana is decriminalized in many US states, but the drug can only be bought and sold legally in Washington and Colorado. Under Maryland's proposed laws, people found in possession of small amounts of marijuana can still be fined, and those discovered to have large amounts, designed for sale or trafficking, can be arrested. Further legislation is likely: recent studies suggest that 75 percent of Americans believe marijuana will eventually be legalized across the country, and that 58 percent of the population support that change. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"A news article states that public support for legalizing marijuana use in the United States is at an all-time high of 54%. According to the article, marijuana use has been legalized or decriminalized in some form in 24 states and the District of Columbia.

Here is the sentence based on these characters: \\"An external manager can be controlled locally from a miniature RF (Radio Frequency) remote control with a variable code. The remotes have 6 combinations of buttons, each individually configured for each combination and each button.\\" Now, let's break it down a bit to give you a more detailed understanding: 1. External Manager: This could refer to a specific device, system or person who can be controlled remotely. Given the context, it's likely pointing towards a device or system that can be manipulated from a distance. 2. Locally controlled: This term suggests that the external manager can be manipulated from a close range, probably within the same locality, building, or network. 3. Miniature RF remote control: RF stands for Radio Frequency. An RF remote control is a type of remote control which uses radio waves to transmit commands. The term 'miniature' suggests that the physical size of the remote control is small, making it convenient to handle. 4. Variable code: This suggests that the commands or signals sent by the RF remote control can vary. This might be a security feature to prevent unauthorized access, or it could simply mean that the remote is capable of transmitting a wide range of commands for different functions. 5. Remotes have 6 combinations of buttons: This points out that the remote control has buttons that can be pressed in 6 different combinations to perform different operations or to control different systems. 6. Individually configured for each combination and each button: This implies that each button on the remote, and each combination of buttons, can be individually set up and programmed. This provides a high degree of customization, allowing the user to have different controls or functions according to their needs. It could also imply that each button/combination corresponds to a different command via the variable code system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore.

News article: Court rules warrantless collection of cellphone location data constitutional A federal appellate panel on Wednesday rejected a constitutional challenge to warrantless collection of cellphone location records, increasing the potential for the US supreme court to consider the legality of the practice. Related: Federal police admit seeking access to reporter's metadata without warrant In a 22-page opinion issued by the sixth circuit court of appeals, the judges said the FBI’s collection of records from wireless carriers for phone numbers connected to two Detroit men was constitutional. Timothy Carpenter and Timothy Sanders, who were convicted for their role in a string of cellphone store robberies, argued the practice was a constitutional violation under the fourth amendment. A brief filed by the American Civil Liberties Union noted that the location tracking in this case reveals the “extraordinary private details” police can obtain via location tracking, including where the defendants may worship and who they may be sleeping with. The appellate panel disagreed in the ruling, saying the pair had “no expectation of privacy” for location information. The judges added the records are unprotected, as they “say nothing about the content of any calls”. In early 2011, law enforcement officials arrested four men suspected in a string of armed robberies around metro Detroit. One of the men confessed to multiple robberies and proceeded to cooperate with the FBI, handing over his phone number, as well as 16 others linked to other possible suspects. Investigators then sought orders to obtain records for “cell site information” for the phone numbers on incoming and outgoing calls over several months, the opinion said. The judges granted the orders. The ACLU found investigators obtained records that included nearly 13,000 separate location points for Carpenter, and more than 23,000 for Sanders, which they calculated was an average of one every six minutes. As a result, Carpenter and Sanders were charged with aiding and abetting multiple robberies. The pair’s motion to suppress the cell location data, contending that a warrant with probable cause was required to obtain the records, was denied by the lower court. The opinion said that Carpenter was described in court as the organizer of several robberies, where Sanders “had served as lookout”. The court reasoned that the defendants do not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in “third-party” data such as that from a cellphone carrier. The judges also distinguished between the content of communications such as emails and location information. ”[T]he cell-site data – like mailing addresses, phone numbers, and IP addresses – are information that facilitate personal communications, rather than part of the content of those communications themselves,” the ruling stated. ACLU attorney Nate Wessler disagreed. “When we did our own analysis of this location records … we were able to tell things like when the defendant spent the night at home and spent the night at a different neighborhood,” Wessler said. “These records when they’re aggregated can be very sensitive and it’s very important that our understanding of the fourth amendment keeps pace with the advancing technology.” Judge Jane Stranch joined the majority opinion but took issue with the “sheer quantity of sensitive information procured without a warrant,” which “raises fourth amendment concerns”. Stranch also said there was a need to develop a new test to determine when a warrant is needed to obtain similar records. “The runaway pace of technological development makes this task more difficult,” she said. “But the job is ours nonetheless and the circumstances before us lead me to believe that we have more work to do to determine the best method.” The ruling is consistent with separate regional appeals courts, but conflicts with an August ruling by the fourth circuit court of appeals, which found that: “Even as technology evolves, protections against government intrusion should remain consistent with those privacy expectations society deems reasonable.” Wessler said he believes the conflicting opinions suggest “more courts certainly will be taking up this question at the appellate panel”. “And perhaps the supreme court will have to weigh in eventually to set a consistent standard across the country,” he said. The US attorney’s office in Detroit, which prosecuted the case, declined to comment. Carpenter’s attorney, Harold Gurewitz, said his client may ask the sixth circuit to rehear the case or petition the supreme court for consideration. “It concerns an issue that I think is important,” he said, “one that’s been raised in other courts across the country, both state and federal, so it is important and we’re going to look at it real quickly.” Gurewitz said the supreme court needs to step in to resolve the issue at some point. “Technology has moved forward at a speed that has continued to increase,” he said. “And I think it’s time to give the [supreme] court an opportunity to talk about how the law ought to address these … issues.” Sanders was already serving a 30-year sentence for murder, and received an additional 14 years for his role in two robberies. Carpenter was sentenced to over 116 years in prison, which the court also found to be legal. “Carpenter has a long criminal history,” the opinion said. “In this case, as the district court observed, Carpenter organized and led several ‘very violent’ robberies that put his victims ‘in extreme danger’.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1.

So we're not getting anything new (and E!'s \\"Mysteries & Scandals\\" gives you a better foothold on the particular incident...and that's not much of an endorsement). What do we get? We learn that Hollywood is a nest of viper's and decadents. No big news there. More interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and/or political establishment. It raises the question of whether Peter Bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters. But what's told is so cynical and ugly and muddled, we're left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history. The tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that I found more irritating than fun. We're not empathetic with anyone. And the great \\"Citizen Kane\\" polishes off the relationship between Davies and Hearts in a much more convincing way. In \\"The Cat's Meow\\" we're not ever sure of Davies motives for being with Hearst. As soon as we're told one thing, she's off doing the other. And are we to believe that Davies was the love of Chaplain's life? Or is he just trying to cockold one of America's most powerful--and apparently moronic--citizens. The film never makes it clear. What is convincing are the production values. There's a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes. I got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men's jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well-known personalities in Hollywood history. No one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction. The disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying. The performers can't be faulted, although Meg Tilly goes way past parody here. Kirsten Dunst never disappoints. She gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing. Only Joanna Lumley rises above the material, but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it.

Lucas, a little boy, had a strange illness, a condition that stops the body's ability to process enzymes .As his life continues, he will lose the ability to speak and his physical and mental abilities will degrade till he is left in a vegetative state. The average life expectancy for the patients is 15 years.  Chester, the boy's father, wanted his child to enjoy his life on earth as much as possible and looked into getting a service dog for the child. However, Lucas wasn't a good candidate due to his deteriorating abilities, not to mention the 15,000 cost of the animal.  Not terrified by all of this, Chester looked into adopting a dog for his son. He found Juno on a website and drove two hours to meet her. Chester had worked with the breed in the police force and was familiar with how to train them. He put in patience and hard work, and trained Juno while allowing her to become accustomed to Lucas. Now, not only will Juno not leave Lucas' side, she is also helping with his illness.

Write a title for this article: An Oklahoma sheriff says investigators are confident that one of two cars pulled from the bottom of an Oklahoma lake contained the remains of three teenagers who went missing in 1970. One of the cars pulled from the lake, a blue Chevrolet Camaro, matched the description of a car in connection with the teens' disappearance, The Daily Elk Citian reported. The missing teens were Thomas Michael Rios, 18, Leah Gail Johnson, 18, and Jimmy Allen Williams, 16. - Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record newspaper The paper reported that the three were supposed to be heading to a football game in a nearby town, but were never seen again. Some thought the three had stumbled across a drug deal at a rural airstrip and been killed. Others said they might have run away to California. “The second vehicle is tentatively identified as the car with the missing juveniles from the Sayre area,” Custer County Sheriff Bruce Peoples told the paper. He told The Associated Press on Wednesday that investigators are still trying to determine whose remains were in the other car pulled from Foss Lake. In both cases, those missing were believed to have been in an early-model Chevrolet like the one recovered Tuesday. The state medical examiner's office said Wednesday it believes the remains of a total of six people were recovered. The Highway Patrol says three skulls have been recovered. It may, however, take years to identify the remains. “There have been theories from everybody,” said Dayva Spitzer, publisher of The Sayre Record newspaper and a longtime resident. “Everyone suspected foul play. ... But every lead just went nowhere.” Authorities discovered the cars by accident. Betsy Randolph, spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Highway Patrol, told the Associated Press dive teams were at Foss Lake conducting training with sonar when they came upon the vehicles last week. \\"So they went back and did a scheduled dive today and were going to recover the cars. When they pulled the cars out of the water, the first one that came out they found bones in the car,\\" she said. The cars were submerged in about 12 feet of water and were only about 50 feet from the end of a boat ramp near a marina. But Peoples said it was no surprise that the murky waters held a secret. “This lake isn’t crystal clear. It’s a typical western Oklahoma lake with a lot of silt in it. The visibility is only 6 to 12 inches on a good day,” Peoples said. “We’ll consider it a mystery until we prove otherwise.\\" The sheriff said it was entirely possible that people simply drove into the lake and drowned. “We know that to happen, even if you know your way around. It can happen that quick,” he added. Peoples said he was confident the Camaro held the remains of the three teens, who were identified as Leah Johnson, Michael Rios and Jimmy Williams. The origins of the bones in the second vehicle were less clear. Tim Porter of Enid said he believed the remains could be those of his grandfather, John Albert Porter, who disappeared along with two other people in 1969. “Forty-something years of wondering who or why,” Porter said. “If it is my grandfather in there, it’s a gift.” The sheriff said Wednesday he was not sure whether the cars held the remains of five or six bodies. The state medical examiner’s office believed the remains of six people were recovered. The bones were being sent to the medical examiner’s office for identification and to determine the cause of death. Divers had found three skulls as of Tuesday evening. They planned to continue looking for more remains, said Oklahoma Highway Patrol spokeswoman Betsy Randolph. Authorities hoped the discoveries would offer some relief to relatives who may have gone decades wondering about the fate of a missing loved one. “We’re hoping these individuals, that this is going to bring some sort of closure to some families out there who have been waiting to hear about missing people,” Randolph said. “If that’s the case, then we’re thrilled.” The Associated Press contributed to this report Title:","output":"\\"Decades-Old Mystery Unraveling: Cars Pulled from Oklahoma Lake May Hold Remains of Missing Teens and Cold Case Victims\\""},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given an abstract of article.

IMPORTANCE Identification of the bacterium responsible for an outbreak can aid in disease management. However, traditional culture-based diagnosis can be difficult, particularly if no specific diagnostic test is available for an outbreak strain.     OBJECTIVE To explore the potential of metagenomics, which is the direct sequencing of DNA extracted from microbiologically complex samples, as an open-ended clinical discovery platform capable of identifying and characterizing bacterial strains from an outbreak without laboratory culture.     DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS In a retrospective investigation, 45 samples were selected from fecal specimens obtained from patients with diarrhea during the 2011 outbreak of Shiga-toxigenic Escherichia coli (STEC) O104:H4 in Germany. Samples were subjected to high-throughput sequencing (August-September 2012), followed by a 3-phase analysis (November 2012-February 2013). In phase 1, a de novo assembly approach was developed to obtain a draft genome of the outbreak strain. In phase 2, the depth of coverage of the outbreak strain genome was determined in each sample. In phase 3, sequences from each sample were compared with sequences from known bacteria to identify pathogens other than the outbreak strain.     MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The recovery of genome sequence data for the purposes of identification and characterization of the outbreak strain and other pathogens from fecal samples.     RESULTS During phase 1, a draft genome of the STEC outbreak strain was obtained. During phase 2, the outbreak strain genome was recovered from 10 samples at greater than 10-fold coverage and from 26 samples at greater than 1-fold coverage. Sequences from the Shiga-toxin genes were detected in 27 of 40 STEC-positive samples (67%). In phase 3, sequences from Clostridium difficile, Campylobacter jejuni, Campylobacter concisus, and Salmonella enterica were recovered.     CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE These results suggest the potential of metagenomics as a culture-independent approach for the identification of bacterial pathogens during an outbreak of diarrheal disease. Challenges include improving diagnostic sensitivity, speeding up and simplifying workflows, and reducing costs.

The pair discovered that they shared similar tastes in music, particularly in punk rock and protopunk artists like Patti Smith, Television, and the Velvet Underground. Stipe said, \\"It turns out that I was buying all the records that [Buck] was saving for himself.\\" Through mutual friend Kathleen O'Brien, Stipe and Buck then met fellow University of Georgia students Mike Mills and Bill Berry, who had played music together since high school and lived together in Georgia. The quartet agreed to collaborate on several songs; Stipe later commented that \\"there was never any grand plan behind any of it\\". Their still-unnamed band spent a few months rehearsing in a deconsecrated Episcopal church in Athens, and played its first show on April 5, 1980, supporting The Side Effects at O'Brien's birthday party held in the same church, performing a mix of originals and 1960s and 1970s covers. After considering Twisted Kites, Cans of Piss, and Negro Eyes, the band settled on \\"R.E.M.\\" (which is an acronym for rapid eye movement, the dream stage of sleep), which Stipe selected at random from a dictionary.The band members eventually dropped out of school to focus on their developing group. They found a manager in Jefferson Holt, a record store clerk who was so impressed by an R.E.M. performance in his hometown of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, that he moved to Athens. R.E.M.'s success was almost immediate in Athens and surrounding areas; the band drew progressively larger crowds for shows, which caused some resentment in the Athens music scene. Over the next year and a half, R.E.M. toured throughout the Southern United States. Touring was arduous because a touring circuit for alternative rock bands did not then exist.

The Risk and Insurance Services segment include Marsh, which provides insurance broking, risk management, and other risk-related services, and Guy Carpenter, which offers risk and reinsurance intermediary services. The Consulting segment includes Mercer, which provides health, wealth, and career consulting services, and Oliver Wyman Group, which delivers management and economic consulting services. The anonymous letter sent to Eliot Spitzer seemingly pointed to potential wrongdoings or unethical practices within Marsh & McLennan, prompting the attorney general to consider an investigation. Since the company plays a significant role in the US insurance market, any legal action or investigations against Marsh & McLennan could have consequences not only for the company itself but also for the broader insurance industry, its clients, and stakeholders. This is why the topic of the potential investigation falls under the category of Business. Investigations surrounding large companies such as Marsh & McLennan are essential to maintain transparency, fairness, and ethical practices in the world of business. Authorities, like the attorney general, have the responsibility of ensuring that corporations abide by the law and operate in the best interests of their clients, shareholders, and employees. By investigating any potential wrongdoings, these authorities help maintain a healthy business ecosystem that ultimately benefits everyone involved. In summary, the topic revolving around the anonymous letter sent to Eliot Spitzer, suggesting he investigates Marsh & McLennan, a prominent insurance broker in the US, falls under the category of Business due to the nature of the potential investigation into the company's practices within the insurance industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A man buys heroin from his dealer, Mike. The man meets two mobsters who are also looking for Mike, because he owes them 100,000. The mobsters shoot the man and leave him for dead. In Paraguay, siblings Rudy and Gloria and their friend Pat prepare for a journey into the rain forest. They plan to prove Gloria's theory that cannibalism is a myth. The trio encounter Mike and his partner Joe. Joe is badly wounded; Mike explains that they were attacked by cannibals. During the night, Gloria goes missing and Rudy finds a native village while looking for her. Due to Joe's injuries, the travelers decide to stay in the nearly deserted village. Mike seduces the naive Pat. In a cocaine-fueled rage, he encourages Pat to kill a native girl. She is unable to do it, so Mike kills the girl himself. In his dying moments, Joe reveals that he and Mike were responsible for the cannibals' aggression. They came to the region to exploit the natives for emeralds and cocaine, taking advantage of their trust in white men. One day, while high on cocaine, Mike brutally tortured and killed their native guide in full view of the tribe. A badly charred body, previously believed to be that of a different guide, is actually this native. Mike kidnapped a native girl to lead them out of the jungle, but the outsiders were followed and attacked. Following the latest murder, the natives hunt the outsiders. Joe dies of his wounds, and his body is found and cannibalized by the natives in full view of Rudy and Gloria, who are hiding from the natives. Mike and Pat abandon the others, but all are captured by the natives and forced into a cage. The prisoners are forced to watch Mike as he is tortured and beaten. The natives transport their prisoners to another village, but Rudy manages to escape. He is caught in a booby trap in the jungle, and his bleeding wounds attract piranhas. The natives shoot him with a poisoned dart, and he dies instantly. Pat and Gloria are put in a hole in the ground. Mike is placed in a...

If you're a college student yourself, you'll spend a good part of your day in classes too, so it only makes sense to look around and see if there are any interesting girls among your classmates. You're probably have the best luck in a class in your favorite subject because there's a chance that you'll share some common interests.  If you're uncomfortable approaching girls, meeting in class can help take some of the nerves out of the experience because you'll have a conversation starter ready to go -- ask for help with an assignment or commiserate about the professor. Take advantage of group projects that might come up in classes. It's a good way to get to know a girl without the pressure of having to approach her. Working while you're a student isn't just a great way to ensure that you have some extra cash; it can be a great opportunity to meet new people. You may find a girl who you like among your co-workers or your customers if you're working somewhere like the bookstore or snack bar. Just as with meeting someone in class, getting to know someone on the job can take some of the pressure off because you'll already have something in common.  If you're not a student yourself, it may be difficult to get a job on campus. Instead, try to find a position at a business near campus that's frequented by students, such as a coffee house or sandwich shop. You don't necessarily have to look for a paying job. Volunteer positions and internships can also offer opportunities to meet girls. Relationships usually work best when you share interests with your partner, so it's a good idea to look for a girl who you have something in common with. Whether you get involved with the school newspaper, environmental club, or an intramural sport, you'll meet plenty of new people who are interested in the same thing you are -- and you can really get to know someone well when you're working toward a common goal. If you can't find a club on campus that suits your interests, consider starting your own organization. It only makes sense that you'll meet plenty of college girls at spots where students congregate, so spend time at the dining hall, student union, and even the library. If there aren't popular hangouts on campus or you're not a student, try off-campus locales that students frequent, such as coffee shops, bars, clubs, and restaurants. Meeting a girl when she's in a social mood may improve your chances of getting a date, so a party is usually a great opportunity to get to know someone. Frat parties, house parties, and even school dances can provide a fun setting to meet a girl. If you're not the partying type, it's best not to force yourself to go a party. You'll likely feel uncomfortable, and only wind up meeting someone who has different interests from yours.

Addressing creative industry members at City Hall, he said he recognised the importance of the sector to \\"London's well-being.\\" He said the new role would involve ensuring \\"grassroots\\" and independent venues were not forced to close. Noise complaints and licensing rules have hit nightlife in certain boroughs. \\"We can't rest on our laurels. We are facing stiff global competition,\\" Mr Khan said.

One part of the ring is open to the water. There is a little round lake inside the island. If you look into this lake, you will see beautiful coral. You may think they are flowers. If you look at a piece of coral, you will see many little holes in it. In each of these holes a very small sea animal has lived. These sea animals make the coral. They began to build under the water. Year after year, the coral grew higher and higher. At last it grew out of the water. Then the sea brought to it small trees and something else. After some years, these things changed into earth. Sometimes the wind brought seeds to this earth. Sometimes birds flew over it and brought seeds to the island. The little seeds grew. In a few years there were plants all over the island.

However, I can certainly provide a few plausible scenarios that could occur after the given situation.  1. Introduction of a new topic: Since there are multiple people in the conversation, it is likely that at some point, someone may introduce a new topic of discussion. This could lead to an engaging exchange of ideas, opinions, and experiences among the individuals. As the conversation goes on, it may foster bonding among the participants and help build connections. 2. Parting ways: After conversating for a while, it is possible that one or more individuals will eventually need to leave, either due to other commitments or simply feeling that the conversation has run its course. When this happens, they may exchange contact information, express appreciation for the conversation, and say their goodbyes. 3. Conflict or disagreement: As people continue talking, differences in opinions and perspectives may arise, potentially leading to a debate or heated argument. In this case, it would be logical for a more neutral party to attempt to mediate the situation and help the conflicted parties find common ground or simply agree to disagree. 4. Activity or event: Depending on the environment where this conversation is taking place, an opportunity for a shared activity or event may present itself. For example, if they are at a party or social gathering, the group may decide to join a game, watch a performance, or partake in some other form of entertainment together. 5. Inclusion of other people: A new person or people may approach and join the conversation, introducing themselves and adding to the dynamic of the group's interaction. This could make the conversation even more interesting and engaging as new perspectives and experiences are shared. 6. Moments of silence: It is quite typical for conversations to have occasional pauses or moments of silence. This can be a natural part of conversation flow, allowing individuals to reflect on what has been said or gather their thoughts before responding. Sometimes, the silence may prompt someone to restart the conversation or to bring up a new topic. 7. Mutual decision to continue the conversation elsewhere: The group may find the current location to be too loud, crowded, or uncomfortable, leading them to decide to move to a different area or venue where the conversation can continue more comfortably. In conclusion, predicting the most logical next event in any social situation can be challenging as it mainly depends on the context, the participants' personalities, and circumstances.

What was \`\` America 's recessed-filter cigarette '' ? What kind of thing would answer this question?","output":"\\"America's recessed-filter cigarette\\" refers to a type of cigarette developed and marketed in the United States, specifically designed with a recessed filter. The objective of this innovative design was to provide a more enjoyable and supposedly cleaner smoking experience for consumers by reducing the amount of tar and other harmful substances inhaled during smoking. To answer this question in a comprehensive manner, let's explore the history, the design, and the marketing strategies associated with this particular type of cigarette. History: The concept of recessed-filter cigarette was first introduced by Philip Morris International in 1952. Philip Morris is one of the world's leading tobacco companies, responsible for several popular cigarette brands such as Marlboro, Parliament, and L&M. They developed a new brand called \\"Parliament\\" that featured a unique recessed filter technology for the first time. Design: The recessed filter, also known as \\"Filter Tip Recessed,\\" is designed to surpass the conventional cigarette filters, which are typically made from cellulose acetate and are attached to the end of the cigarette. In the case of recessed-filter cigarettes, the filter is set back from the end of the cigarette, creating a small empty space or recess between the filter and the mouthpiece. This design has several supposed benefits: 1. Reduced tar and nicotine intake: The recessed filter is meant to minimize the amount of tar, nicotine, and other harmful substances that reach the smoker's lungs by forcing the smoke to travel a longer path through the filter before being inhaled. 2. Cooler and smoother smoke: By the time the smoke reaches the smoker's mouth, it has had more time to cool down, providing what was perceived as a smoother and more enjoyable smoking experience. 3. No filter fibers: With conventional filters, there was always a risk of inhaling filter fibers. The recessed filter design prevents direct contact between the smoker's mouth and the filter fibers, thereby eliminating this risk. Marketing Strategy: Philip Morris marketed the Parliament brand with a heavy emphasis on the innovative recessed filter feature. They promoted the cigarette as a more sophisticated, premium option for discerning smokers who were concerned about their health and wanted a cleaner smoking experience. The advertising campaigns often featured the slogan, \\"Only the flavor touches your lips,\\" highlighting the separation of the filter from the mouthpiece. The brand positioned itself as a luxury offering, priced higher than regular cigarettes, further supporting its premium image. In conclusion, \\"America's recessed-filter cigarette\\" refers to a distinctive type of cigarette that was designed and marketed by Philip Morris International under the Parliament brand. These cigarettes were promoted as a more refined, luxurious, and health-conscious option due to their innovative recessed filter design, which aimed to reduce tar and nicotine intake, provide cooler and smoother smoke, and prevent the inhalation of filter fibers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: Who might use a double edged razor to cut things precisely? Possible A: first aid kit, chemist, butcher, shower, drug store  Why is \\"chemist\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"A double-edged razor is a sharp tool that can be used for cutting or slicing things with precision. The reason \\"chemist\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense is because chemists often work with various materials and substances in laboratories. They may need to cut or shape objects like small samples, tissue sections, thin films, or other delicate materials for analysis or experiments. Using a double-edged razor allows them to make precise, clean cuts that can avoid damaging the samples. While the other options (first aid kit, butcher, shower, and drug store) might involve cutting or use cutting tools in certain contexts, they are not as closely related to the specific application of a double-edged razor for precision cutting. For instance, a first aid kit may contain a safety razor for cutting cloth or tape but not necessarily for precision cutting. A butcher may use sharp knives or saws for cutting meat and bone, but typically not double-edged razors. Showers and drug stores are not specifically associated with cutting things precisely, although a drug store may sell double-edged razors for shaving purposes.

Oxytocin is continually released throughout childbirth through a positive feedback mechanism. As noted earlier, oxytocin prompts uterine contractions that push the fetal head toward the cervix. In response, cervical stretching stimulates additional oxytocin to be synthesized by the hypothalamus and released from the pituitary. This increases the intensity and effectiveness of uterine contractions and prompts additional dilation of the cervix. The feedback loop continues until birth. Although the mother’s high blood levels of oxytocin begin to decrease immediately following birth, oxytocin continues to play a role in maternal and newborn health. First, oxytocin is necessary for the milk ejection reflex (commonly referred to as “let-down”) in breastfeeding women. As the newborn begins suckling, sensory receptors in the nipples transmit signals to the hypothalamus. In response, oxytocin is secreted and released into the bloodstream. Within seconds, cells in the mother’s milk ducts contract, ejecting milk into the infant’s mouth. Secondly, in both males and females, oxytocin is thought to contribute to parent–newborn bonding, known as attachment. Oxytocin is also thought to be involved in feelings of love and closeness, as well as in the sexual response.

A:","output":"The Development of Substitute Materials was otherwise known as the Manhattan Project. The Manhattan Project was a top-secret research and development program initiated during World War II, led by the United States with the support of the United Kingdom and Canada. The primary objective of the project was to develop and produce the first atomic bombs, with the ultimate goal of ending the war by forcing the surrender of the Axis powers, particularly Japan and Germany. The name \\"Development of Substitute Materials\\" was used to maintain secrecy and to avoid drawing attention to the true nature of the project. The term referred to the process of discovering and producing alternative materials required for the construction of an atomic bomb. This included the development of nuclear fission technology, which utilized the release of energy resulting from the splitting of heavy atomic nuclei, primarily Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239. The Manhattan Project involved numerous research sites and employed some of the brightest scientists and engineers from around the world. Key players in the project included J. Robert Oppenheimer, who served as the lead scientist, General Leslie R. Groves, who oversaw the entire project, and several prominent physicists and chemists such as Enrico Fermi, Niels Bohr, and Ernest O. Lawrence, among others. After several years of extensive research, experimentation, and development, the Manhattan Project produced the first atomic bomb, which was successfully tested on July 16, 1945, at the Trinity test site near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The bombs' devastating power was soon utilized in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan, in August 1945, effectively ending World War II. The success of the Manhattan Project and the Development of Substitute Materials had far-reaching consequences, paving the way for nuclear power generation, advanced scientific research in atomic energy, and the arms race during the Cold War era. The project remains a testament to the remarkable advancements in science and technology during the 20th century and highlights the ethical and moral implications associated with using nuclear weapons."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What is advised to do if you feel your mind is leaving your body ? Movie title: Anguish Movie plot: The film begins with a written disclaimer: During the film you are about to see, you will be subject to subliminal messages and mild hypnosis. This will cause you no physical harm or lasting effect, but if for any reason you lose control or feel that your mind is leaving your body -- leave the auditorium immediately. The disclaimer is accompanied by a narrator, who advises viewers to take caution regarding their surroundings once the film has begun, and not to engage in conversation with any unknown individuals for the duration of the running time. In the Los Angeles theater The Rex, moviegoers watch the film within a film, The Mommy. The Mommy tells the story of John Pressman (Michael Lerner), an extremely myopic, uncontrolled diabetic who works as an ophthalmologist's assistant and is progressively growing blind. For unstated reasons, his overbearing mother Alice (Zelda Rubinstein) hypnotizes him and induces him to murder people so that he can remove their eyes and bring them back to her. One evening, Johnâagainst his mother's wishesâbarricades himself inside of a movie theater playing The Lost World, where he sets about killing the patrons one by one with a scalpel. Once John's rampage becomes apparent, the surviving moviegoers attempt to flee the now sealed-off theater. The police bring Alice to the theater in an attempt to end the siege; in the course of trying to talk John down, Alice is accidentally shot to death by the police. As The Mommy wears on, patrons of The Rex begin to experience anxiety attacks and disorientation in response to the events onscreen.

Creating a timeline of your life is a good way to make sure you include all the most important dates and events, and it gives you a structure to build upon. You can consider this the \\"brainstorming\\" phase, so don't hesitate to write down everything you can remember, even if you don't think the memory will make it into the final version of the book.  Your autobiography doesn't have to begin with your birth. You may want to include some family history as well. Write down information about your ancestry, your grandparents' lives, your parents' lives, and so on. Having information about your family history will help readers get a sense of how you became the person you are. What happened when you were a teenager? What led you to make the decisions you made? Did you go to college? Write about those transitory years, too. Write about your career, your relationships, your children, and any big life-altering events that occurred. Every good story has interesting characters, friends and foes who help move the plot along. Who are the characters in your life? It's a given that your parents will play a role, along with your spouse and other close family members. Think beyond your immediate family to others who have affected your life and should play a role in your autobiography.  Teachers, coaches, mentors, and bosses are extremely influential in people's lives. Decide whether someone who has been a role model (or the opposite) for you will figure into your story. Ex-boyfriends and girlfriends might co-star in some interesting stories. What enemies have you had in life? Your story will be boring if you don't include some conflicts. Offbeat characters such as animals, celebrities you've never met, and even cities are often points of interest in an autobiography. The story of your entire life would start to get pretty long-winded, so you'll have to make some decisions about what anecdotes you're going to include. Begin drafting your manuscript by writing out the main stories that will be woven together to create a picture of your life. There are a few main topics that most autobiographies cover since readers find them fascinating.  The childhood story. Whether your childhood was happy or traumatic, you should include a few anecdotes that give a picture of who you were and what you experienced at the time. You can tell the story of your childhood by breaking it down into smaller anecdotes that illustrate your personality - your parents' reaction when you brought home a stray dog, the time you climbed out of the window at school and ran away for 3 days, your friendly relationship with a homeless person living in the woods . . . get creative. The coming of age story. This heady and often sensual period in a human's life is always of interest to readers. Remember that it's not about writing something unique; everyone comes of age. It's about writing something that resonates with readers. The falling in love story. You could also write the opposite of this, the never-finding-love story. The identity crisis story. This usually occurs in the 30s or 40s and is sometimes referred to as a mid-life crisis. The story of facing down some force of evil. Whether it's your battle with addiction, a controlling lover, or a madman who tried to kill your family, you've got to write about conflict you've experienced. People read autobiographies to gain insight on what it's like to be someone else. Being authentically you is a sure way to keep people engaged. If your writing is formal and stiff, or if it reads like a college essay instead of an expose on your life, people will have trouble getting through the book.   Write as though you're opening your heart to a trusted friend, in prose that's clear, strong and not too cluttered with vocabulary words you rarely use. Write so that your personality is revealed. Are you funny? Intense? Spiritual? Dramatic? Don't hold back; your personality should come through in the way you tell your story. You don't have to be explicit, but it's important to reveal truths about yourself and your life in an autobiography. Don't let the book become a list of your accomplishments, with all the negative material carefully kept under the rug. Present yourself as a whole person, sharing talents and flaws alike, and your readers will be able to identify with you and hopefully root for you as they make their way through your story.  Don't always cast yourself in a positive light. You can have foibles and still be the protagonist. Reveal mistakes you've made and times when you've failed yourself and other people. Reveal your inner thoughts. Share your opinions and ideas, including those that may spark controversy. Be true to yourself through your autobiography. How was your story shaped by the moment in history in which it took place? What wars influenced your politics? What cultural events inspired you? Be sure to include a few important dates so readers can understand the sequencing of the events you are describing. Discussing what happened in the world at large during your lifetime is a good way to make your story more relevant and interesting to those reading it.","output":"This article suggests that when writing an autobiography, it's important to research your life, create a timeline, include family history, share interesting stories, and be authentic and truthful about your experiences and personality, while also considering the historical context of your life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, (UAVs), or “drones” as the press is wont to call them, can be used for surveillance, relaying communications and some can be weaponized and called in for strikes.

While it is possible Iran may have its hands on the UAV, it is worth noting that twice in the very recent past Iran has declared it has captured a U.S. owned UAV only to fail to provide any evidence to support its claims. In January of this year, Iran's Revolutionary Guards claimed to have shot down two UAV. During this hoo hah, Iran also claimed that these UAVs violated its sovereign space. But then Amir Ali Hajizadeh, the head of the Revolutionary Guards’ Air Force, did not succeed in presenting any evidence that this had actually occurred. And just this past July, Iran said it had shot down a UAV near the Fordu nuclear site -- again, another claim that went unsubstantiated. There is an awful lot of speculation and many assumptions flying regarding the most recent alleged “drone” incident of December 2011, but very little concrete information has emerged as yet. If Iran has a Sentinel, the key to any seriousness hinges upon the manner in which they would have obtained it. ISAF, led by NATO, released the statement that a UAV was lost in western Afghanistan because “the operators of the UAV lost control of the aircraft and had been working to determine its status.” This is quite a different version of events than claims by the Iranian media that a Sentinel had been captured with minimal damage. If high tech military equipment is damaged in the field, it tends to be taken with the U.S. force on the ground or blown up in situ to prevent reverse engineering -- as advanced American technology is without question highly coveted. If a Sentinel was shot down or crashed, given its capability in terms altitude and speed and taken together with its weight, the drama-rama that has taken hold regarding reverse engineering is most likely an unjustified tempest in a teacup. In the event of being shot or crashing, there would most likely be significant damage to the asset. On the other hand, if the Sentinel does exist and is indeed intact, then there may be cause for concern as it could suggest that Iran seized control of the UAV’s operating system to land it ripe to harvest for their own unmanned aspirations. In October of this year, it was reported that a virus had made its way into U.S. Predator and Reaper systems. This virus allegedly “keylogged” the commands of pilots as the platforms flew missions over Afghanistan and instigated some rumblings of concern to this end. There's no doubt that Iran certainly has a desire to build its own “drones.” In August 2010, there was a whole lot of Iranian-style pomp and circumstance surrounding ‘the Reveal’ of ‘Karrar’ – purportedly the country’s first domestically built UAV, with a range of 620 miles and a payload consisting of a 500 pound precision bomb. Convincing evidence never emerged of these claims either, but at the time it aroused some concern as the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet was based nearby in Bahrain. This week’s drone drama is tellingly set against a backdrop of escalating tension between Iran and U.S. allies. On November 12, Iran’s ballistic missile program was walloped with an explosion at Bidganeh, the primary missile testing facility located just outside of Tehran. Iran’s head of missile research, General Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, died alongside at least seventeen others in this explosion, prompting allegations that the West was responsible for the incident. Iran’s Isfahan uranium conversion facility then suffered a serious blow from another unexplained explosion, leading to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly proclaiming all necessary measures would be undertaken to protect Iran, and Gen Jaafari directing the Revolutionary Guard to hide the Shahab missles throughout the country. Just this past week, on November 19, the British Embassy was attacked in Tehran. Officials suggested the attackers had the support of the regime. Twenty-five British diplomats have been expelled and France announced it would withdraw diplomatic staff from Iran as well. This attack came on the heels of new sanctions introduced by the U.S., Canada and EU that ban financial transactions with Iran. These more aggressive measures are in response to the IAEA report (the U.N.’s nuclear watchdog) indicating that there was evidence tests had been conducted relevant to developing a nuclear device. Iran claims its nuclear ambitions are purely those of a nation with peaceful aspirations -- just as it claims it has a U.S. UAV without brandishing any evidence. Iran's credibility is low, but when wasn’t it? Drone or no drone, what this drone-drama signifies is the latest in Iran’s brandishing that it is ready to rumble.

He is always in a hurry and in the end loses both time and his good name. A lost thing may be found again, but lost time can never be got back. Time is more useful than material things. In fact, time is life itself. An unpunctual man is always wasting his most important things as well as others'. An unpunctual person is always saying unhappily that he finds no time to answer letters or return calls. But the man who really has much to do is very careful of his time. He knows that he can not finish all his work unless he carefully does every piece of work. Being unpunctual is the sign of disrespect ( _ ) towards others. If a person is invited to dinner and arrives later than the time when he should be there, he keeps all the other guests   waiting for him. Usually this will be thought as a great disrespect to the host and all the other guests. Not like a punctual person, an unpunctual one can't do his duty wonderfully, whether it is public or personal. Imagine how it would be if those who should do important tasks failed to be on time. A man who is known to be often unpunctual is never believed by his friends or fellow men. Question: Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage? Answer: Select from: 1). An unpunctual person often has more time.; 2). An unpunctual person has more work to do.; 3). A punctual person often has a busy life.; 4). A punctual person often does his work wonderfully.;","output":"4). A punctual person often does his work wonderfully.

Help as much as you can. Background: Higher pressures increase the solubility of gases. You are probably familiar with this concept as it relates to carbonated beverages. Before opening the container, the inside is pressurized, so a large amount of CO 2 is dissolved in the liquid. After opening, the pressure decreases (to the ambient pressure), so the solubility of CO 2 drops, causing it to bubble out of solution. Because they are not compressible like gases, solid and liquid solutes do not have noticeable changes in solubility at different external pressures.  Paragraph: Robin is an exterminator who is making new mixtures of chemicals to use for when he gets called to kill rats in his neighborhood. To make the mixtures, he has to dissolve nitrogen gas in containers of water. In one container, container A, he dissolves the nitrogen gas under high pressure.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If the plates on the Earth's crust were to move more quickly past each other, it would likely result in LESS frequent WEAKER earthquakes. This is because the increased speed of plate movement would lead to a higher build-up of stress, potentially causing the crust to break more often. When these breaks occur, the energy released might generate larger and more intense earthquakes rather than weaker ones. As a result, weaker earthquakes could become less common due to the higher energy releases associated with the faster plate movement.

Trebuie să evaluăm în ce măsură ar putea criteriile de la Basel să antreneze o criză gravă a creditelor pentru întreprinderile mici și mijlocii. Which language is this?","output":"The language you're asking about is Romanian. The sentence translates to \\"We need to assess the extent to which the Basel criteria could trigger a severe credit crisis for small and medium-sized enterprises.\\" As for the question regarding Basel criteria possibly triggering a severe credit crisis for small and medium businesses (SMEs), it's important to delineate that the Basel Accords were designed as an attempt to standardize banking regulations across the globe, particularly with regards to capital risk, market risk and operational risk. Their goal is to ensure the financial health of individual banks, as well as the overall banking system. The impact of these requirements on SMEs could theoretically be significant. However, the actual impact of the Basel Accords on SMEs is debated among experts and tends to look at several dimensions: 1. The Availability of Credit: One of the key concerns regarding the Basel criteria is that it may reduce the availability of credit to SMEs. Stringent capital requirements might make banks more risk-averse and, hence, more reluctant to lend to SMEs, which are traditionally seen as riskier than larger corporations. 2. The Cost of Credit: The Basel regulations may drive up the cost of credit for SMEs. Banks might choose to pass on the higher costs of maintaining larger capital buffers to their customers in the form of increased interest rates and fees. This could make credit more expensive for SMEs. 3. Financial Stability: On the other hand, the Basel criteria aim to increase the stability of the financial system, which could indirectly benefit SMEs. In a more stable financial system, credit is more likely to be available, and the cost of credit would be less likely to spike during periods of economic stress. In general, while the Basel criteria may pose some challenges to SMEs, they are an important component of a stable, transparent, and resilient financial system. Policymakers must strive to strike a balance between the stability of the banking system, the availability, and cost of credit for SMEs, and the broader goal of economic growth. There are some mechanisms planned to soften the impact on SMEs such as the support from public investment banks, guarantees from mutual guarantee societies and also the promotion of alternative sources of funding."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Note: italicized text denotes extended scenes not from the original cut.March 1938. The film opens to a child reading a comic book about the Daily Planet, the largest newspaper in the city of Metropolis. As the child reads the shot fades to the Daily Planet and up into the sky. The following title sequence moves through space and eventually reveals the planet Krypton, the home world of a highly-evolved race resembling humans and bearing a unique molecular density and structure, a result of the planet's gravitational strength and the radiation of its adjacent red sun. The planet is ruled by a Council of Elders, each representing a particular \\"clan\\" and bearing a crest of that particular House. The planet's greatest scientist, Jor, bears an S-shaped crest, the House of El. Jor-El is supervising the trial of three criminals caught attempting to overthrow the planet's government - General Zod, the planet's former defense chief; his henchman Non, a hulking killer unable to speak; and Ursa, a woman determined to exterminate men other than the man she loves, Zod. As the elders render a guilty verdict, Zod notes that the verdict must be unanimous, so Jor-El ultimately holds the key to their fate. Despite his disillusionment with the Council of Elders, Jor-El renders a conviction. The vast dome of the planet's capital city opens to the night, and a small extra-dimensional prison - the Phantom Zone - tumbles out of the sky and pulls the three criminals out of the trial room and into an eternity in dimensional limbo through space.

In the ant world a war has been waged. Two rival groups of Acromyrmex heyeri ants, group A and group B, are battling each other to gain territory. The goal is to attack the rival group when they have more openings in their nest thatch. In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which would be a better day for group B to attack group A, battle day one or battle day two?  Hint: Acromyrmex heyeri is a species of leaf-cutter ant, a New World ant of the subfamily Myrmicinae of the genus Acromyrmex. Acromyrmex heyeri workers construct the colonies nest by thatching together cut grass. At temperatures ranging from 20–30 °C, workers created more openings in the nest thatch as the internal nest temperature goes up as a method of temperature regulation for the colony. The workers will close openings in the nest thatch as the air humidity surrounding the nest decreases to reduce water loss for the colony.

Before the start of the Second World War, and the establishment of war-based industries, Jarvis's initiatives brought modest relief to Jarrow. By 1939, about 100 men were employed in a small furniture factory and up to a further 500 in various metal-based industries set up on the Palmer's site. Jarvis had acquired the obsolete liners Olympic and Berengaria, to be broken up at the yard. However, after their triumphant homecoming many of the marchers felt that their endeavour had failed. Con Whalen, who at his death in 2003 was the last survivor of those who marched the full distance, said that the march was \\"a waste of time\\", but added that he had enjoyed every step. His fellow marcher Guy Waller, on the 40th anniversary of the march in 1976, said that \\"[t]he march produced no immediate startling upsurge in employment in the town. It took the war to do that\\". These views are shared by most commentators and historians. The Daily Mirror columnist Kevin Maguire calls the march \\"a heroic failure\\", while Matt Dobson, in The Socialist, writes that \\"out of all the hunger marches its aims were the most diluted and it made the most modest gains\\". The historians Malcolm Pearce and Geoffrey Stewart provide a positive perspective, arguing that the Jarrow March \\"helped to shape [post-Second World War] perceptions of the 1930s\\", and thus paved the way to social reform.Perry observes that \\"the passage of time has transformed the Jarrow Crusade ... into a potent talisman with which many apparently seek association\\". Thus the Labour Party, which in 1936 shunned the march, later adopted it as \\"a badge of credibility\\". In 1950 the party featured the Jarrow banners on its election posters; the march then disappeared from view in an era of high employment, only to be invoked again when unemployment again became a political issue in the 1980s. In the late 20th century and beyond, Labour leaders—Michael Foot, Neil Kinnock, Tony Blair—have all associated themselves with the march. In October 1986, on the 50th anniversary, a group...

It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Constrained Energy Lapped Transform (CELT) is an open, royalty-free lossy audio compression format and a free software codec with especially low algorithmic delay for use in low-latency audio communication.

The capital and largest city is Dublin, which is located on the eastern part of the island, and whose metropolitan area is home to around a third of the country's 4.75 million inhabitants. The state shares its only land border with Northern Ireland, a part of the United Kingdom. It is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the Celtic Sea to the south, Saint George's Channel to the south-east, and the Irish Sea to the east. It is a unitary, parliamentary republic. The legislature, the ', consists of a lower house, ', an upper house, ', and an elected President (') who serves as the largely ceremonial head of state, but with some important powers and duties. The head of government is the ' (Prime Minister, literally 'Chief', a title not used in English), who is elected by the Dáil and appointed by the President, and appoints other government ministers.  - Northern Ireland (; Ulster Scots: \\"\\") is a top-level constituent unit of the United Kingdom in the northeast of Ireland. It is variously described as a country, province, region, or \\"part\\" of the United Kingdom, amongst other terms. Northern Ireland shares a border to the south and west with the Republic of Ireland. In 2011, its population was 1,810,863, constituting about 30% of the island's total population and about 3% of the UK's population. Established by the Northern Ireland Act 1998 as part of the Good Friday Agreement, the Northern Ireland Assembly holds responsibility for a range of devolved policy matters, while other areas are reserved for the British government. Northern Ireland co-operates with the Republic of Ireland in some areas, and the Agreement granted the Republic the ability to \\"put forward views and proposals\\" with \\"determined efforts to resolve disagreements between the two governments\\".  - Dublin is the capital and largest city of Ireland. Dublin is in the province of Leinster on Ireland's east coast, at the mouth of the River Liffey. The city has an urban area population of 1,345,402. The population of the Greater Dublin Area, , was 1,904,806 people.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \\"Old World\\" from the \\"New World\\".  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - Snooker is a cue sport played on a table covered with a green cloth or baize, with pockets at each of the four corners and in the middle of each of the long side cushions. A full-size table measures 11 ft 8 in × 5 ft 10 in (3569 mm x 1778 mm), commonly referred to as 12 × 6 ft.  - The Celtic Sea (; ) is the area of the Atlantic Ocean off the south coast of Ireland bounded to the east by Saint George's Channel; other limits include the Bristol Channel, the English Channel, and the Bay of Biscay, as well as adjacent portions of Wales, Cornwall, Devon, and Brittany.

He has not won a ranking event , coming closest in the 2004 Grand Prix , where he reached the semi-finals after victories over Mark Williams among others . His first ranking quarter - final was at the 1997 British Open  - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.

Cain Offers Ethics Reminder To Reporters In Pushback Over Sex Harassment Allegations Attempting to turn reports of sexual harassment allegations back on the media, the campaign for Republican presidential contender Herman Cain is targeting journalists by passing out a code of ethics offering guidelines on how to report stories. On Sunday, Cain campaign spokesman J.D. Gordon emailed passages from the Society of Professional Journalist Code of Ethics that highlighted limiting the use of anonymous sources and evaluating their truthfulness and motives before allowing their use. The code also offered a few reminders like removing arrogance from reporting, showing good taste, being accountable, not pandering to lurid curiosity, treating subjects of stories as reporters would like to be treated and exposing unethical behavior by fellow reporters. With the media just slightly above Congress in public opinion polls of trustworthy institutions, the Cain team is hoping to capitalize on distrust as it fights back against coverage of sexual harassment claims by two women at the National Restaurant Association where Cain was CEO from 1996-1999. The low-level staffers are bound by confidentiality agreements, and despite efforts by one woman's lawyer to get her released from that non-disclosure rule, she issued an anonymous statement Friday calling the allegations very serious. Issuing an email solicitation on Saturday, Cain asked donors to contribute toward his goal of raising 999,000 -- keying off his 9-9-9 economic plan -- by next Thursday so Cain can compete in the Iowa caucuses scheduled for Jan. 3. In the appeal, Cain noted the \\"attacks\\" and said his campaign still has momentum. \\"Every time someone makes a donation to my campaign it shows the media and my opponents that the American people are fed up with the politics of personal destruction and they are demanding real change in Washington,\\" the email reads. But the story is having an impact. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, in the last week, Cain has lost 9 points in his favorability rating with Republicans. A week ago his favorability ranked at 66 percent in the poll, he's now down to 57 percent. Among all registered voters in the poll released Friday, he dropped 5 percentage points to 32 percent from 37 percent. However, as far as favorability rankings go, Cain still holds his own against President Obama, ranking 46-41 in polls of 937 registered voters one year out from the election. The margin of error is 3.2 percent in the poll. Separately, a Washington Post-ABC News survey taken after the allegations emerged last Sunday showed Cain and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney running almost even with seven in 10 Republicans saying the reports don't matter when it comes to picking a candidate. Cain's opponents said the sex harassment allegations are irrelevant to the race for the White House, though they are a distraction. \\"I think the media blew this way out of proportion. I think there are a thousand stories out on there and I think that dilutes the real debates,\\" Texas Rep. Ron Paul told \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" \\"It's up to Herman Cain to get the information out and get it out in total. But that's important because we've got some real issues to discuss in this campaign, and this is taking all the bandwidth out of the discussion so we're not able to talk about jobs. We're not able to talk about our position in the world. And that hurts. That hurts the American people,\\" former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman said on NBC's \\"Meet the Press.\\" Cain vowed Saturday to answer no more questions about the allegations, cutting off a reporter who tried to inquire about the alleged incidents. \\"Don't even go there. Where's my chief of staff?\\" Cain said as his top aide Mark Block signaled from the audience. \\"Please send him the journalistic code of ethics.\\" Speaking during a one-on-one debate with fellow candidate Newt Gingrich, Cain also took the opportunity from an open-ended question to complain about the media. \\"There are too many people in the media who are downright dishonest. ... They do a disservice to the American people,\\" Cain said, bringing the room to its feet. \\"If I were running this campaign the way the pundits thought I ought to be running this campaign, I would have dropped out in August,\\" Cain later told reporters. \\"When people get on the Cain train, they don't get off.\\" But whether the Cain approach will put to rest the accusations or inspire reporters to dig deeper, the SPJ code of ethics does little to offer guidance. The SPJ notes that its code is voluntary and is not intended as a set of \\"rules.\\" \\"It is not -- nor can it be under the First Amendment -- legally enforceable,\\" the code notes. The Associated Press contributed to this report. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text involve the Herman Cain campaign's response to reports of sexual harassment allegations against the Republican presidential contender.

The report also highlights that Cain's favorability ratings have dropped as a result of the allegations. Notably, Cain's team aims to capitalize on the existing distrust of media institutions and has vowed not to answer any further questions regarding the allegations.

We have: -21 * z - 31332 = 601 * z + 124 * z Let's add the two z's (or \\"apples\\" on the right side) first. So, 601 \\"apples\\" + 124 \\"apples\\" = 725 \\"apples\\"  Now, we have: -21 * z - 31332 = 725 * z Now let's put all the z's together! We do this by adding 21 * z to both sides. (-21 * z +21 * z) - 31332 = 725 * z + 21 * z 0 - 31332 = 746 * z Now we have: -31332 = 746 * z Now, we want to know how many z's go into -31332. So, let's divide -31332 by 746: -31332 ÷ 746 = z z = -42 So, the answer is z = -42! Yay, we solved the puzzle!"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After the Jaguars deferred the opening coin toss, the Patriots received the opening kickoff to begin a 10-play, 82-yard drive. On a 1st-and-goal run from the Jaguars' 1-yard line, Maroney fumbled before breaking the plane of the goal line; it was recovered by Jaguars linebacker Daryl Smith at the 1-yard line. The Jaguars reached their own 35-yard line on their ensuing possession before failing to convert on a fourth down attempt, turning the ball back over the Patriots. Two plays after a 21-yard Morris run, Brady and Moss connected on a 2-yard touchdown reception to give the Patriots a 7-0 lead. After the kickoff, the Jaguars drove to the Patriots' 42-yard line before a David Garrard pass intended for Marcedes Lewis was intercepted by Meriweather at the Patriots' 17-yard line and returned 56 yards. Two plays later, on the first play of the second quarter, Brady threw a 26-yard touchdown pass to Baker to extend the Patriots' lead to 14-0. The Jaguars continued to move the ball on their next possession, reaching midfield on completions of 15 and 14 yards; however a false start penalty negated another 15-yard reception and the Jaguars were forced to punt. Following a Patriots' three-and-out, Garrard was strip-sacked by Banta-Cain on the first play of the Jaguars' next-drive; tackle Eben Britton recovered the fumble for the Jaguars, who punted three plays later. On the third play of their ensuing drive, the Patriots moved into the red zone on a 55-yard Morris run, and later took a 21-0 lead on a 1-yard Morris touchdown run. After another Jaguars three-and-out, the Patriots moved into Jaguars territory on a 29-yard Welker catch and later extended their lead to 28-0 on a 6-yard touchdown reception by Moss. This would remain the score after the Jaguars ended the half on another punt. The Jaguars began the second half with a 16-play, 69-yard drive that took over eight minutes off the clock; however, it ended without any points after Garrard was intercepted by Springs at the Patriots' 2-yard line on a 3rd-and-goal from the 5-yard line. The Patriots responded with a 10-play, 90-yard drive of their own, despite a false start penalty to begin it. On the first play of the fourth quarter, Brady hit Moss on his third touchdown catch of the game, putting the Patriots ahead 35-0. However, the Jaguars responded quickly, moving past midfield on a 22-yard Rashad Jennings run and into the red zone on a 20-yard Nate Hughes reception. Two plays later, Garrard scrambled two yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 35-7. With 12:41 remaining in the game, the Patriots received the ball after the kickoff. What ensued was a 20-play drive, with the Patriots reaching midfield with about ten minutes remaining in the game, and reaching the Jaguars' 10-yard line by the two-minute warning. The drive included five first downs, including two off fourth down conversions. One play after the two-minute warning, Hoyer replaced Brady at quarterback, and one play later, the Patriots turned the ball over on downs after a failed 4th-and-2 run by Morris. The Jaguars, with 29 seconds left in the game, ran one play to end the game.

Police are unable to ‘completely eliminate’ the possibility that Boris Berezovsky was murdered, it emerged yesterday. Officers said they found the exiled Russian oligarch lying on a bathroom floor with a ‘ligature’ around his neck and similar material tied to a shower rail above him. But although there was no evidence of a struggle they said the possibility someone else was involved in his death remained. The discovery of the body of the 67-year-old billionaire at a £20million Berkshire mansion has sparked an explosion of speculation around his death. Scroll down for video. Inquest: A coroner heard that Boris Berezovsky, pictured with ex-girlfriend Elena Gorbunova, was found on his bathroom floor with a ligature around his neck. Hearing: Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford, left, heard evidence yesterday from policeman Mark Bissell, right. Inquest: The hearing is being held at the Windsor Guildhall where Prince Charles was married. At the opening of an inquest, Detective Inspector Mark Bissell said specialist officers were still checking the large Ascot property for clues. He said the involvement of a third party ‘cannot be completely eliminated as tests remain outstanding’. Mr Berezovsky was referred to as Platon Elemin at the hearing in Windsor. He changed his name by deed poll after fleeing to Britain in 2000 and becoming a vocal critic of Russian president Vladimir Putin. Mr Bissell added that Mr Berezovsky was last seen alive at approximately 9.05pm the night before by the same employee, believed to be a bodyguard. The scene of the death is currently under police control and the results of any tests carried out will take several weeks, Mr Bissell said. Allies: Mr Berezovsky's friends Alex Goldfarb, left, and Andrey Sidelnikov, right, outside the inquest. Scene: A police car and a police tent are positioned insode the grounds of of late Russian tycoon Boris Berezovsky this week. Guard: A police van blocks a country lane leading to the oligarch's home as officers comb his home for clues. The inquest at the Guildhall in. Windsor, where the Prince of Wales married the Duchess of Cornwall, was. adjourned to a future date by the coroner. Coroner's officer Janine Prunty. confirmed that Berezovsky's daughter Elizaveta Berezovskaya had formally. identified the body of her father. Officers said they are speaking to. the Russian's close friends and family to build up a picture of his. state of mind in the last days of his life. It is thought that he was having. serious financial difficulties after paying out astronomical sums in. legal fees over the last few years, and wanted to return to Russia. Broken: Boris Berezovsky sued former business partner Roman Abramovich for billions of pounds but lost, which those close to him claimed 'destroyed' him. Boris Berezovsky with his ex girlfriend Elena and two children Arina (eight) and Gleb (six). The exiled 67-year-old tycoon was found by his bodyguard at his estate in Ascot on Saturday. The oligarch, who last year lost a. multibillion-pound High Court battle with Chelsea owner Roman. Abramovich, could have run up £100million in legal bills since 2011. In July 2011, he paid out Britain's. biggest-ever divorce settlement to his ex-wife, Galina Besharova. Reports suggested the deal was worth more than £100million. He later built up fees totalling more. than £250,000 after becoming embroiled in a case at the High Court with. his former partner, Elena Gorbunova, who sat at his side throughout. much of his battle with Mr Abramovich. Berezovsky emigrated to the UK in. 2000 after falling out with Russian president Vladimir Putin, and has. survived a number of assassination attempts. Police investigating the death of Mr Berezovsky (pictured here in 2003), one of Vladimir Putin's fiercest opponents, said there is so far no evidence to suggest any third party involvement in his death. Mansion: Police descend on oligarch's multi-million pound home after his body was found. His body was discovered on the. bathroom floor of a £20million mansion in Acot on Saturday after a. bodyguard became concerned and smashed the door open. Experts in chemical, biological and. nuclear emergencies spent hours combing the house amid fears that. Mr Berezovsky could have been poisoned by the Kremlin, but no radiation. was found. Another report claimed that detectives investigating the death did not find a suicide note. Some friends continue to insist Mr. Berezovsky was the victim of a professional hit for speaking out against Putin’s regime. Others believe he killed himself after. becoming depressed over the loss of his wealth and status. The exiled 67-year-old tycoon nicknamed the 'godfather of the Kremlin', is reported to have been found by his bodyguard at his mansion. The mansion in Ascot where he was found is understood to be owned by his former wife Ms Besharova, 54. Her close friend told the. Mail: ‘Galina is very upset about Boris’s death, as are their children. She remained close to Boris after they split up and it was at her house. that he died. ‘She really does not want to talk. about how he died. But there are many ways to induce what may appear to. be a natural death like a heart attack.’ Berkshire coroner Peter Bedford adjourned the hearing.

Summarize this article: the wood until it is very smooth. Sand the entire surface with a hand sander or an electric sander to get rid of rough areas and imperfections. If your wood is pretty rough to start with, begin sanding with a rough sandpaper with a grit of 100 or 120. Progress from rougher grit to finer grit sandpapers, which allows you to reduce major irregularities before achieving a fine finish. To get a very smooth surface you should end with 400 grit sandpaper.  Even if your wood already feels pretty smooth, take the time to run 400-grit sandpaper over it before sealing it. This will ensure that the surface is completely smooth once the sealant is applied. Sand with the grain, which means that you need to follow the lines of the wood grain straight back and forth. This will help you avoid leaving behind swirly marks on the surface. Wipe the entire surface several times. This will help you avoid getting wood particles stuck in your sealant, which will create an imperfect surface.

For example, many people use this type of combo product with sealing a deck, due to the large surface area that needs to be treated. They are available at all hardware and home improvement stores. These products can typically be applied with a brush or a roller.","output":"This article discusses the process of preparing, staining, and sealing wood to achieve a smooth and protected surface. The main steps covered in the article include sanding, using a tack cloth, staining, and sealing. 1. Sanding: To achieve a smooth finish on the wood, sanding is crucial. Start with a rough sandpaper with grit 100 or 120 to remove major imperfections. Gradually progress to finer grit sandpapers, finishing with a 400-grit sandpaper for an ultra-smooth surface. Even if the wood appears smooth, using 400-grit sandpaper ensures a perfect finish before sealing. Always sand with the grain to prevent swirly marks on the wood. 2. Wipe the surface and use a tack cloth: After sanding, thoroughly wipe the surface to remove any wood particles that could mar the sealant application. A tack cloth, specifically designed for this purpose, can help remove even the finest dust particles that may resist regular cloth. Avoid using water on unsealed wood, as it can cause the grain to swell and create roughness. 3. Staining (optional): If you wish to change the color or highlight the wood grain, choose a stain that suits your desired result. Apply the stain before sealing, allowing it to soak into the wood surface. Stains come in various colors and types and are usually applied with rags. Follow the instructions on the stain packaging for proper application and wait times before sealing. Wood stains can be found at hardware and home improvement stores. 4. Sealing: Some products on the market combine colorant and sealant, providing a one-step, quick-finish option for large surfaces, such as decks. These combo products can save time while still offering protection and are available at hardware and home improvement stores. Sealants are typically applied with a brush or roller.

Loring Brace's observation that such variations, insofar as it is affected by natural selection, slow migration, or genetic drift, are distributed along geographic gradations or clines. In part this is due to isolation by distance. This point called attention to a problem common to phenotype-based descriptions of races (for example, those based on hair texture and skin color): they ignore a host of other similarities and differences (for example, blood type) that do not correlate highly with the markers for race. Thus, anthropologist Frank Livingstone's conclusion, that since clines cross racial boundaries, \\"there are no races, only clines\\". Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Why are variations distributed along clines?","output":"Alright, I'll explain it in a simple way. Variations are distributed along clines because of how living things change, move, or mix over time and distances. Imagine walking from one side of a rainbow to the other. The colors change gradually, just like how some differences in living things change slowly across different places. This can happen because some living things might have a hard time moving far away, or they just mix with others nearby. This gradual change of certain differences is called a cline.

Someone mentions that \\"He don't know one note from another!\\". (This opening song has interesting musical accompaniment: the sound of the train's steam locomotive.) At the end of the song, just when the train is about to start up from a station stop in River City, Iowa, one of the people reveals that he is Harold Hill, and quickly escapes from the train before the others can catch him.Hill finds himself in a small turn-of-the-century Iowa town, full of taciturn people with small-town values. They sing him a song of welcome, explaining that Iowans are stubborn but good natured and generous. He is delighted to find an old friend and colleague from his earlier days as a crooked salesman, Marcellus Washburn (Buddy Hackett). Marcellus says that he is now making an honest living, has settled in River City, and that he likes the town and the people. The two friends reminisce about their shady dealings in the past, and that \\"Professor Hill\\"'s current racket is boys' bands.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution. He retired from political life after Louis Napoleon Bonaparte's 2 December 1851 coup, and thereafter began work on The Old Regime and the Revolution. He argued that the importance of the French Revolution was to continue the process of modernizing and centralizing the French state which had begun under King Louis XIV. The failure of the Revolution came from the inexperience of the deputies who were too wedded to abstract Enlightenment ideals. Tocqueville was a classical liberal who advocated parliamentary government, but was skeptical of the extremes of democracy.

A desperate Leah Fuller hires the three men and local Vicente Madariaga, to rescue her husband, John, who is pinned under debris from a gold mine cave-in in hostile Apache territory. During the harrowing journey, Luke tries to force himself on Leah late one night, forcing Hooker to intervene. Leah tells Hooker that where her husband is trapped, once was a boom town, but a volcano eruption wiped it out, leaving only a church steeple and the mine uncovered by lava.

Movie title: Monster from Green Hell Context: In preparation for sending a manned rocket into space, American scientists Dr. Quent Brady and Dan Morgan are put in charge of a program that sends various animals and insects into space to test their survival rates. After one of their rockets carrying wasps malfunctions and goes off course, a computer calculates that the rocket is likely to land somewhere off the coast of Africa. Some time later, in a remote part of Africa, Dr. Lorentz and his daughter Lorna perform an autopsy on a native and determine that he died of paralysis of the nerve centers caused by an injection of a massive amount of venom. Arobi, Lorentz' African assistant, then informs him that a monster is believed to be terrorizing people and animals in an area known as Green Hell. Several months later, Brady reads a newspaper account of turmoil in Central Africa caused by gigantic monsters and surmises that the wasps in the missing rocket were exposed to huge amounts of cosmic radiation because an earlier, minimal overexposure had resulted in the birth of a spider crab twice the size of its mother. Brady and Morgan request a leave of absence from Washington and head for Africa to investigate. In Libreville, equatorial Africa, the territorial agent makes plans for them to travel to meet Dr. Lorentz. Once the safari is ready, Mahri, an Arab, leads Brady and Morgan on the four-hundred mile trek to Lorentz' hospital. The safari battles brush fires, fever, drought and storms, eventually reaching the Lorentz compound where Lorna informs them that her father has not returned from a journey to Green Hell.

This helps the wax to have a good grip on the hair. Now, think about when we wash our pet dog or maybe when we give a good scrub to our toys to get rid of their dirt. This is just like exfoliating your underarms before waxing. It helps to remove all the little bits of dirt and skin, making waxing easier and more effective. We can imagine this like giving your underarms a nice bubble bath! But you know how after a bath, you have to dry off so you don't catch a cold? It's the same with your underarms. You need to make sure they are super dry before you start with the waxing process. Imagine it like wanting to stick a nice shiny sticker on a wet paper, it wouldn't stick, right?

Question: -  The water will turn into water vapor - Collect the water vapor - Allow the water vapor to cool - The water vapor will turn into liquid water - The salt will be separated from the water.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process is the water will turn into water vapor. This step involves the transformation of liquid water into gaseous form, known as water vapor, by applying heat to increase the energy and temperature of the water. This process of converting water into vapor is known as evaporation.  It typically occurs by heating a container with a mixture of saltwater. The heat makes the water molecules move faster, and as the temperature reaches the boiling point of water, approximately 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level, the water molecules have sufficient energy to break free of their liquid state and transform into vapor. Since salt molecules have a higher boiling point than water molecules, they will remain behind in the container as solid particles. To optimize the evaporation process and ensure that water vapor is captured efficiently, you may use a distillation or evaporation apparatus designed to collect and separate water vapor from the remaining salt. Typically, such apparatus consists of a heating source, a container to hold the saltwater, and a condensation system where the water vapor will cool and turn back into its liquid state. The main objective is to exclude the salt particles from evaporating and obtain pure water, free from impurities and salt. In summary, the first step of the process is heating the saltwater to turn the water into water vapor, which is achieved through the process of evaporation. The subsequent steps involve collecting the water vapor, allowing it to cool, and the transformation of the water vapor back into liquid water, ultimately leading to the separation of salt and purified water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is evident from the scenario that Cameron is a sensitive and considerate person who understands the depth of Jesse's emotions towards his dog. Recognizing the pain that Jesse would feel upon witnessing the accident and the injury of his beloved pet, Cameron instinctively steers Jesse's gaze away from the horrifying sight in order to spare him from further anguish. This act demonstrates empathy and concern for Jesse's emotional state, as Cameron is well aware of the attachment between Jesse and his dog. In turning Jesse's eyes away from the scene, Cameron is lessening the immediate emotional impact and potentially traumatic effects that the sight might bring upon Jesse. Moreover, Cameron is adopting a protective stance towards Jesse. Realizing that the distress Jesse would feel could be extremely overwhelming, Cameron intervenes and shows care for his friend's psychological well-being. By doing all this, Cameron creates a supportive atmosphere for Jesse to cope with the unfortunate incident.

Ensemble developed many real-time strategy games, including the \\"Age of Empires\\" game series, \\"Age of Mythology\\", and \\"Halo Wars\\". In addition to game development, Ensemble Studios also made the Genie Game Engine used in \\"Age of Empires\\", \\"\\", and \\"\\". The studio sold 20 million games and was worth an estimated 500 million.  - JoWooD Entertainment AG (formerly JoWooD Productions Software AG, commonly referred to as JoWooD) was an Austrian video game publisher that was founded in 1995. JoWooD went into administration and all assets were purchased by Nordic Games.  - An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game or video game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\".  - Gothic II : Night of the Raven ( German : Die Nacht Des Raben ) , often abbreviated as NotR , is the official expansion pack of the German role - playing video game Gothic II. The expansion focuses on further enlarging the story already presented in the original Gothic II game , by adding a new world called Jharkendar , new attributes , items , and weapons . Upon its first release in 2003 the game was available in the German language only , the English version only being released in 2005 , as part of the Gothic II Gold package .  - Big Huge Games is a video game developer located in Timonium, Maryland. The company was founded in February 2000 by four veteran game industry developers: Tim Train, David Inscore, Jason Coleman and Brian Reynolds (lead designer of \\"Alpha Centauri\\", et al.). Their first game, \\"Rise of Nations\\", was a critical and commercial hit. The original studio became defunct in May 2012, but the name \\"Big Huge Games\\" was later reacquired by Reynolds and Train for their new venture (previously known as SecretNewCo). The revived studio released the mobile game \\"DomiNations\\" on Android and iOS in April 2015.  - In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Forever\\" for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Original\\", a remake of Sorcerian for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In addition, console versions of Sorcerian with somewhat differing content from their PC counterparts were developed: A version for the Mega Drive was developed by Sega, a version for the PC Engine CD was developed by Victor Musical Industries, and a version for the Dreamcast was developed by Victor Interactive Software.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s.  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - Gothic II is a role-playing video game and the sequel to \\"Gothic\\", by the German developer Piranha Bytes.

Markham had hoped for a fully-fledged Royal Naval expedition, but was warned by the Admiralty that \\"the present exigencies of the Naval Service [would] prevent them from lending officers...\\" However, the Admiralty agreed to release Scott and Charles Royds, and later allowed Michael Barne and Reginald Skelton to join the expedition. The remaining officers were from the Merchant Marine, including Albert Armitage, the second-in-command, who had experience with the Jackson–Harmsworth Arctic expedition, 1894–97, and Ernest Shackleton, designated Third Officer in charge of holds, stores and provisions, and responsible for arranging the entertainments. The Admiralty also released around twenty petty officers and seamen, the rest of the crew being from the merchant service, or from civilian employment. Among the lower deck complement were some who became Antarctic veterans, including Frank Wild, William Lashly, Thomas Crean (who joined the expedition following the desertion of a seaman in New Zealand), Edgar Evans and Ernest Joyce. Although the expedition was not a formal Navy project, Scott proposed to run the expedition on naval lines, and secured the crew's voluntary agreement to work under the Naval Discipline Act.The scientific team was inexperienced. Dr George Murray, Gregory's successor as chief scientist, was due to travel only as far as Australia (in fact he left the ship at Cape Town), using the voyage to train the scientists, but with no part to play in the detailed work of the expedition.

Based on the given facts, earthworms, which are a type of annelid, play a significant role in maintaining the quality and fertility of soil. This makes annelids the correct option from the list provided. Annelids, particularly earthworms, contribute positively to soil health through various ways, including: 1. Aeration: As earthworms move through the soil, they create tunnels and burrows, allowing air and water to circulate better. This aeration process facilitates the penetration of oxygen required by plant roots and other organisms in the soil. 2. Nutrient cycling: Earthworms ingest organic materials, breaking them down into smaller particles that can be easily utilized by plants. As they digest and excrete organic matter, they release essential nutrients back into the soil for plant growth. 3. Soil aggregation: Earthworms are known for improving the structure and stability of soil. Their excretions (casts) are made up of organic matter and minerals, which help bind soil particles together into stable aggregates. This process improves water infiltration, reduces erosion, and facilitates plant root growth. 4. Decomposition: Earthworms act as natural decomposers by consuming dead plant material and microorganisms. This helps maintain a balance between the decomposition of organic matter and nutrient recycling in the soil ecosystem. Although bacteria also play a significant role in maintaining soil health by breaking down organic matter and converting nutrients into forms available to plants, the question specifically refers to the given facts. As such, annelids are the most relevant answer in this context."},{"instruction":"Q:Article: Fish and apple soup? Yes, and you won't believe how delicious it is.

Jackson), a top Chicago Police Department hostage negotiator, is approached by his partner Nate Roenick (Paul Guilfoyle) who warns him that according to an informant (whom he refuses to name), members of their own unit are embezzling large sums of money from the department's disability fund, for which Roman is a board member. When Roman goes to meet with him again he finds Roenick murdered seconds before other police arrive, pinning him as the prime suspect. Things only get worse for Roman when Internal Affairs investigator Terence Niebaum (J. T. Walsh), whom Roenick's informant suspected of involvement in the embezzlement, is assigned to investigate the murder. After the gun that killed Roenick is linked to a case Roman had worked on, Niebaum and other investigators search Roman's house and discover papers for an offshore bank account with a deposit equal to one of the amounts of money embezzled. Roman is made to surrender his gun and badge and his colleagues are doubtful of his protests of innocence. With murder and embezzlement charges pending, Roman storms into Niebaum's office and demands answers about who set him up. When Niebaum stonewalls, Roman takes Niebaum, his administrative assistant Maggie (Siobhan Fallon), police commander Grant Frost (Ron Rifkin), and two-bit con man Rudy Timmons (Paul Giamatti) as hostages. With the building evacuated and placed under siege by his own CPD unit and the FBI, Roman issues his conditions: finding Roenick's informant and summoning police Lt. Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), another top negotiator. Roman believes he can trust Sabian because he negotiates for as long as possible and see using force as a last resort, and being from another precinct eliminates him as a suspect in the disability fund scheme.

Once known best as affable barman Sam Malone on \\"Cheers,\\" in recent years he has taken some edgier turns: as a corrupt business titan turned murderer in the cable series \\"Damages\\" and a womanizing editor in HBO's half-hour comedy \\"Bored to Death.\\" Darker roles have put Ted Danson back on the map. After playing an editor and a murderer, he's now a crime-scene investigator. This week Mr. Danson, 63, returned to network television, poring over evidence as the head investigator on CBS's \\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\\" Just a few years ago, Mr. Danson seemed to be happily retired. His sitcom \\"Becker,\\" about a cranky doctor in the Bronx, was canceled in 2004. Afterward, he made a few cameos in cable shows and films—he and his wife Mary Steenburgen occasionally play fictionalized versions of themselves on HBO's \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\"—but mostly lived comfortably in Los Angeles and Martha's Vineyard. Then, in 2007, Mr. Danson got the role of Arthur Frobisher, a sociopath CEO engulfed in an Enron-like scandal in \\"Damages,\\" then on FX and now on DirecTV. \\"After years of doing half-hour comedies, I'd become this nice, accommodating actor who wanted to make sure everything was right,\\" Mr. Danson says. He hired an acting coach. \\"This coach got me to be a little more arrogant,\\" he says. \\"I didn't do anything I didn't want to do, which fit this billionaire narcissist I was playing.\\" The role put Mr. Danson back on the map—and helped him land the starring role in one of the biggest hits on TV world-wide. Now entering its 12th season, \\"CSI,\\" the original series in Jerry Bruckheimer's sleek billion-dollar crime franchise, airs in 200 countries or territories. Last season in the U.S. it attracted 13.7 million viewers nightly. That's down from its peak of 26 million in 2003, but it still beats popular drams like ABC's \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" and CBS's \\"The Good Wife.\\" See a clip of Ted Danson, the former star of \\"Cheers,\\" in the newest season of CSI. The fictional Clark County forensics unit has had its share of staff changes. William Petersen originally played night-shift entomologist Gil Grissom. In 2009, Laurence Fishburne joined as investigator Ray Langston. Mr. Danson will step in as D.B. Russell, night supervisor of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. The scientific jargon in \\"CSI\\" appealed to Mr. Danson, who has spent two decades as an activist focused on marine conservation. His father, in his hometown of Flagstaff, Ariz., was a museum director and archeologist. \\"There were always scientists crawling in and out of our house,\\" Mr. Danson says. The Wall Street Journal: Why did you decide to do \\"CSI\\"? Twenty-two episodes a season is a big commitment. Mr. Danson: I tend to back into things in life. They seem to miraculously land in my lap and as time goes on I find out how lucky I am. That happened with \\"Damages\\" and \\"Bored to Death.\\" They were teeny little parts in the pilot but turned out to be these great things for me. The same thing has happened here with \\"CSI.\\" I knew I wanted to be home in L.A. One of our daughters is pregnant, so the idea of making a show nine months out of the year and knowing where I'd be appealed to me. I started off by going to Las Vegas and I rode along with real CSI people. I went to the coroner's office and watched four autopsies. It was like being shot out of a cannon. I kept thinking, \\"Wow, maybe I'm not the right person for this.\\" Most of my life I look for the joy, the happiness, the joke, the humor. How can you immerse yourself in this dark side of life, with death and with that tiny percentage of our population that goes around killing each other? How can I fit into that world as an actor? Did you want to do a drama rather than another network sitcom? I love comedy, but it's hard. It's really, really hard. I joke that you can show up in a drama drunk, depressed, divorced, and as long as you're in the moment, the camera loves you. Drama is created by the writer, director and editor, whereas comedy is the writer and actor that are doing the work. Hence my wife saying I'm off to the spa every day. Most viewers don't like it when their favorite TV characters change. Is it a lot of pressure to replace a beloved character on the world's most watched TV drama? You pretend it's just another job but even though you try to ignore it, your body feels this is what it is, which is a billion-dollar franchise. Talk to me a year from now. Did Larry David write your character on \\"Curb Your Enthusiasm\\" or was that improvised? If you're writing a comedy show, a normal \\"Cheers\\" or \\"Seinfeld,\\" the process is you spend months pitching the stories, break it down on a chalkboard beat by beat by beat, and one of the last things you do is you hand that outline to a writer to write the dialogue. So Larry spends months working on the outlines but then doesn't write the dialogue. It's very well thought out but the dialogue is improvised. But like all improvisation, half of it is crap, so by the end [of improvising in rehearsals] you've almost improvised the script. The other half of what you see is coming out of people's mouths for the first time. Was it frustrating that for decades after \\"Cheers\\" you were typecast as a sitcom actor? The good news is some part came along that was so well known that you're typecast, so it's one of those good news-bad news things. You may never be famous again like you are for that original type. But if you let go of that and let go of the big money that comes from people hiring you to just stay in your type, and get around creative people doing really different work, you can spring loose from that type. That's what happened to me with \\"Damages.\\" There's a scene in the first season when I'm in the back seat of an Escalade snorting coke with a hooker and order someone to kill someone else. At that moment Sam Malone went flying out the window. Write to Amy Chozick at amy.chozick@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"Ted Danson, best known for his role as Sam Malone in \\"Cheers,\\" has taken on edgier roles in recent years, such as in \\"Damages\\" and \\"Bored to Death.\\" In 2011, he returned to network television as the head investigator on CBS's \\"CSI: Crime Scene Investigation.\\" The scientific jargon in \\"CSI\\" appealed to Danson, who has been an activist focused on marine conservation for two decades.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Henry and Tiffany are performing chemical reactions in their high school chemistry class. Henry performs his reactions with the use of a catalyst. Tiffany performs the same reaction with no catalyst present.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Could Tiffany change other aspects of her reaction besides adding a catalyst to influence its rate, yes or no? A:","output":"Yes, Tiffany could change other aspects of her reaction besides adding a catalyst to influence its rate. There are various factors that can affect the rate of a chemical reaction, and some of these factors include: 1. Concentration of reactants: Increasing the concentration of the reactants will generally increase the rate of reaction. This is because there will be more particles available to react, thus increasing the chances of successful collisions between reacting particles. 2. Temperature: The rate of reaction is typically influenced by temperature changes. Increasing the temperature will cause the reacting particles to move faster, and due to the increased kinetic energy, there will be more frequent collisions between them. Additionally, a higher temperature ensures that a larger percentage of reacting particles possess enough energy to exceed the activation energy barrier, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction. 3. Surface area of solid reactants: If a solid reactant is involved in the reaction, increasing its surface area by reducing the particle size will increase the rate of reaction. This is because a larger surface area means a greater number of reacting particles will be exposed to other reactants, resulting in more effective collisions. 4. Pressure (for reactions involving gases): In a gas-phase reaction, increasing the pressure is akin to increasing the concentration of the reacting particles. Higher pressure will cause gas particles to be compressed into a smaller space, thereby increasing the frequency of collisions between them and leading to a faster reaction rate. 5. Stirring (for reactions in solution): Proper stirring helps ensure that the reactants are uniformly distributed throughout the solution, increasing the chance for collisions between reacting particles, which in turn increases the reaction rate. 6. Presence of light (for photosensitive reactions): In reactions that are sensitive to light, the rate could be impacted by the presence or intensity of light that reaches the reactants. For such reactions, more light exposure could either increase or decrease the reaction rate depending on the individual reaction. While using a catalyst is an effective way to influence the rate of a chemical reaction, it is by no means the only method. By altering any or a combination of the factors mentioned above, Tiffany can effectively influence the rate of her reaction without introducing a catalyst."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Read the given context and utterance carefully. Step 2: Understand the small-talk strategy. Small-talk is a cooperative negotiation strategy used to discuss topics that are not directly related to the negotiation. It is intended to build a rapport with the opponent. Step 3: Examine the utterance and context to check for the presence of topics that are not directly related to the negotiation (Food, Water, and Firewood packages). Example: Context: 'Hello.

Step 2: Analyze the provided options We need to find the word that best describes this other side of the person in the context of the question. The options are: - non-sensitive - resistant - stoic - hardened - uncaring Step 3: Eliminate options based on their meanings - Non-sensitive: This simply means not being sensitive, which does not necessarily imply strength or determination, so it might not be the best fit. - Resistant: This means being able to withstand or oppose something, but it doesn't convey the emotion or mindset of the person under testing conditions. - Stoic: This word pertains to someone who remains calm and unemotional in difficult situations, showing great endurance and self-control. This seems to be a good match for the given context. - Hardened: This implies being tough or unfeeling, but it doesn't capture the underlying emotional self-control like stoicism does. - Uncaring: This means not being concerned or sympathetic, which again doesn't convey strength or endurance under testing conditions. Step 4: Choose the best fitting option Considering the context of the question and the meanings of each word, \\"stoic\\" appears to be the most suitable option. It describes a person who remains calm and unemotional under difficult circumstances, thus showing strength and endurance in the face of testing situations.

Can you tell me the answer to what comes first in games alpha or beta??","output":"In game development, there is a progression of stages that a game goes through before it is considered complete and ready for the market. The two stages you are asking about, Alpha and Beta, are both essential stages during the development of a game. Each of these stages comes with its distinctive characteristics and objectives. To answer your question, the Alpha stage comes first, followed by the Beta stage. Here are detailed explanations of each stage: 1. Alpha Stage: The Alpha stage is an early stage in the game development process where the developers have mostly completed the core gameplay mechanics, tasks, and all essential functions. In other words, the game should be somewhat playable at this point. However, many features are still under development, and the game's build may not be optimized or polished. The primary goal during the Alpha stage is to work out any kinks and bugs in the game design. This period is crucial for the developers, as it allows them to fix any underlying issues that could significantly impact gameplay. Alpha builds often include a lot of experimentation, such as testing various game mechanics and finding the best ways to implement them. Developers release the Alpha version internally to their team members, external testers, and, at times, to a limited number of players. This helps identify any major issues and bugs, with the goal of addressing them before proceeding to the Beta stage. 2. Beta Stage: Once the game is deemed stable and functional in its Alpha stage, it progresses to the Beta stage. At this point, the game is mostly feature-complete, meaning that it includes all the intended content, such as levels, characters, and other gameplay elements. The game should now be largely optimized for performance, and the visual and audio assets are refined. During the Beta stage, the main focus is on fixing any remaining bugs, fine-tuning the game's balance, and polishing the experience. To achieve this, developers often release a Beta version of the game to a broader audience, either through closed or open Beta tests. Closed Beta tests usually have a restricted number of participants, such as selected users or those who pre-ordered the game. In contrast, open Beta tests are made available to the general public, allowing anyone interested to download and play the game for a limited period. The feedback gathered from Beta testers is invaluable for the development team, as it provides an excellent opportunity for them to understand what players like and dislike about the game, what works and what doesn't, and any critical issues that they might not have identified during the Alpha stage. The developers then use that feedback to make any final adjustments before officially launching the game. In conclusion, the Alpha stage is the first stage in the game development process, where the primary focus is on developing the core gameplay mechanics and ironing out the major issues. The Beta stage comes after, where the game is mostly feature-complete, and developers focus on bug fixing, game balance, and polishing. Both stages are crucial in ensuring a successful game that provides an enjoyable experience for the players."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Write an article that answers the following question: Did Bahrain receive more tanks or aircraft from the United States?","output":"Title: The Dynamics of Bahrain's Military Acquisition from the United States: Comparing Tanks and Aircraft Introduction Nestled in the Persian Gulf, the Kingdom of Bahrain has long been known for its strategic geographical location, serving as a crucial node in regional and international politics. Over the past few decades, Bahrain has cemented close ties with the United States as a means to bolster its security and military landscape. A significant aspect of this relationship revolves around United States' assistance in the modernization of Bahrain's armed forces through defense sales, procurement of weapons, and equipment. This article examines a key question: \\"Did Bahrain receive more tanks or aircraft from the United States?\\" In order to delve into the intricacies of Bahrain's military acquisition from the United States, we will analyze the procurement data and compare the quantity of tanks and aircraft supplied to Bahrain's armed forces over the years. The Acquisition of Tanks The Bahrain Defense Force (BDF) has procured a notable number of tanks from the United States in order to strengthen its ground forces. One of the major acquisitions was of M60A3 Patton main battle tanks. The United States transferred around 180 M60A3 tanks to Bahrain during the 1990s. These tanks serve as the backbone of the BDF's armored capabilities and play a significant role in Bahrain's ground combat readiness. M60A3 Patton tanks are known for their superb armor protection and powerful M68 105mm gun. These tanks not only provide the BDF with effective combat capabilities, but also represent a long-standing military cooperation between Bahrain and the United States. The Supply of Aircraft Bahrain's air force, known as the Royal Bahraini Air Force (RBAF), received aircraft from the United States to bolster its aerial capabilities. One of the RBAF's leading acquisitions from the United States has been the procurement of F-16 Fighting Falcon multirole fighter jets. The United States provided Bahrain with an initial batch of 12 F-16C/D aircraft in the late 1980s, followed by an additional 10 F-16C/D jets in the early 2000s as part of the Peace Crown II Foreign Military Sales program. In 2018, Bahrain signed yet another agreement with the United States to purchase 16 upgraded F-16V aircraft through a 3.8 billion deal. These aircraft are expected to be delivered to Bahrain within the next few years. Apart from the F-16 jets, Bahrain also operates several UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, supplied by the United States, to bolster their transport and utility capabilities. Additionally, the RBAF utilizes C-130 Hercules transport aircraft for logistical and heavy transport purposes. Comparison and Conclusion Upon close examination of Bahrain's military acquisitions from the United States, it becomes evident that Bahrain has received significantly more aircraft than tanks over the years. With a total of approximately 180 main battle tanks supplied to the BDF, Bahrain's ground forces have certainly benefitted from American assistance. However, looking at the number of aircraft procured from the United States, we observe a higher figure. Bahrain acquired 22 F-16C/D fighter jets between the late 1980s and early 2000s, with another 16 F-16V jets expected in the near future. If we also take into account the additional aircraft like UH-60M Black Hawk and C-130 Hercules, Bahrain has clearly received more aircraft than tanks from the United States. In conclusion, Bahrain has received more aircraft than tanks from the United States, highlighting the emphasis on both parties' strategic partnership in enhancing the RBAF's aerial capabilities. Effective air power plays an important role in projecting force and ensuring regional stability while also enabling Bahrain to better contribute to peacekeeping and counter-terrorism efforts within the Middle East in collaboration with the United States."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I am writing this from the perspective of being a photographer.   This is the first time that I have been to the Preserve after reading, and hearing so much about it. I found it to be quite disappointing.   The issues with the Preserve, again, only from a bird spotting, and photography standpoint are many.  1. The area is completely overgrown. It has limited the view of all of the ponds and removed the vast majority of quality shooting locations. Beyond that, walking along the paths is ridiculous. I was walking along ponds, I should have been able to see, completely obstructed by shrubs and trees.  To define a quality shooting location; an area one can sit in, with a 180 degree view of the pond or the subject in front of the person.  There were trees that had 1/3 of its trunk covered in debris. I sat and watched birds, rats, and rabbits emerge from the debris.   This overgrowth is both unsightly, and a fire hazard.   2. The majority of the benches and blinds have been rendered unusable. Again, it comes down to the area being overgrown.  I walked past several benches that were placed on the edge of the pond, yet a view of dense shrubbery was presented. The blinds in the special use areas are shrouded and covered. What's the point of having a permit to use an area that has no unobstructed view?   3. Varmints. There are rabbits EVERYWHERE. Yes, they're cute, but rabbits bring rats, and there were a ton of those too. This is a disease outbreak waiting for a place to happen.  I went today looking for Burrowing Owls. All gone. Why? Cats. Feral cats have preyed on all of the Burrowing Owls, and they have been removed.   4. The ponds are inconsistently watered. This has made the birds leave for other locations.   I am incredibly displeased that I went today. I can go to a golf course and see the same birds with far less hassle, and can get great shots. It's unfortunate that the staff of this preserve isn't committed to making this a pristine bird area. Choose: was this review given positively or negatively?

She scored four Top 40 hits in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including \\"Paper Roses\\", which reached #5 on the charts.  - A beauty pageant or beauty contest is a competition that has traditionally focused on judging and ranking the physical attributes of the contestants, although some contests have evolved to also incorporate personality traits, intelligence, talent, and answers to judges' questions as judged criteria. The term almost invariably refers only to contests for unmarried women such as the Big Four international beauty pageants;<ref name=\\"chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2004-10/25/content_385531.htm\\"></ref> with similar events for men or boys being called by other names and more likely to be bodybuilding contests.  - Louis Prima (December 7, 1910  August 24, 1978) was an Italian-American singer, actor, songwriter, bandleader, and trumpeter. While rooted in New Orleans jazz, swing music, and jump blues, Prima touched on various genres throughout his career: he formed a seven-piece New Orleans-style jazz band in the late 1920s, fronted a swing combo in the 1930s and a big band group in the 1940s, helped to popularize jump blues in the late 1940s and early to mid 1950s, and performed as a Vegas lounge act in the late 1950s and 1960s.   - A big band is a type of musical ensemble associated with playing jazz music and which became popular during the Swing Era from the early 1930s until the late 1940s. Big Bands evolved with the times and continue to today. A big band typically consists of approximately 12 to 25 musicians and contains saxophones, trumpets, trombones, and a rhythm section. The terms jazz band, jazz ensemble, stage band, jazz orchestra, and dance band are also used to refer to this type of ensemble. This does not, however, mean that each one of these names is technically correct for naming a \\"big band\\" specifically.  - An orchestra is a large instrumental ensemble typical of classical music, which features string instruments such as violin, viola, cello and double bass, as well as brass, woodwinds, and percussion instruments, grouped in sections. Other instruments such as the piano and celesta may sometimes appear in a fifth keyboard section or may stand alone, as may the concert harp and, for performances of some modern compositions, electronic instruments.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - Top 40 is a music industry shorthand for the currently most-popular songs in a particular genre. When used without qualification it refers to the best-selling or most frequently broadcast popular music. The term is derived from record music charts, a few of which traditionally consist of a total of 40 songs. Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio.  - \`\` Wonderland by Night '' is a popular song by Bert Kaempfert that was a Billboard number one hit for three weeks , starting January 9 , 1961 . The song was written by Klaus - Günter Neumann with English lyrics by Lincoln Chase . It was Kaempfert 's first hit with his orchestra . The song featured Charly Tabor on trumpet . The original version of \`\` Wonderland by Night '' also crossed over to the R&B chart where it peaked at number five . Another cover , recorded and released by Louis Prima , also charted in the same year , reaching # 15 on the Billboard charts . Anita Bryant 's version reached # 18 on the US Pop Chart . Engelbert Humperdinck also recorded a vocal version of the song in his 1968 album A Man Without Love .  - Swing music, or simply swing, is a form of American music that dominated in the 1930s and 1940s. Swing uses a strong rhythm section of double bass and drums as the anchor for a lead section of brass instruments such as trumpets and trombones, woodwinds including saxophone and clarinets, and sometimes stringed instruments such as violin and guitar, medium to fast tempos, and a \\"lilting\\" swing time rhythm. The name swing came from the 'swing feel' where the emphasis is on the offbeat or weaker pulse in the music. Swing bands usually featured soloists who would improvise on the melody over the arrangement. The danceable swing style of big bands and bandleaders such as Benny Goodman was the dominant form of American popular music from 1935 to 1946, a period known as the swing era. The verb \\"to swing\\" is also used as a term of praise for playing that has a strong groove or drive. Notable musicians of the swing era include Louis Armstrong, Cab Calloway, Benny Goodman, Duke Ellington, Glenn Miller, Count Basie, Woody Herman, and Artie Shaw.  - \\"Moon Over Naples\\" is a 1965 instrumental composed and originally performed by German bandleader Bert Kaempfert and was the first track on his album, \\"The Magic Music of Far Away Places\\" for Decca Records.  - Berthold Heinrich Kämpfert, (16 October 1923  21 June 1980), better known as Bert Kaempfert, was a German orchestra leader, music producer, and songwriter. He made easy listening and jazz-oriented records and wrote the music for a number of well-known songs, including \\"Strangers in the Night\\" and \\"Moon Over Naples\\".  - Oklahoma (Cherokee: \\"Asgaya gigageyi\\" /  ; or transliterated from English as  (\\"òàlàhoma\\"), Pawnee: \\"Uukuhuúwa\\", Cayuga: \\"Gahnawiyogeh\\") is a state located in the South Central United States. Oklahoma is the 20th-most extensive and the 28th-most populous of the 50 United States. The state's name is derived from the Choctaw words \\"okla\\" and \\"humma\\", meaning \\"red people\\". It is also known informally by its nickname, \\"The Sooner State\\", in reference to the non-Native settlers who staked their claims on the choicest pieces of land before the official opening date, and the Indian Appropriations Act of 1889, which opened the door for white settlement in America's Indian Territory. The name was settled upon statehood, Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory were merged and Indian was dropped from the name. On November 16, 1907, Oklahoma became the 46th state to enter the union. Its residents are known as \\"Oklahomans\\", or informally \\"Okies\\", and its capital and largest city is Oklahoma City.  - Easy listening is a popular music genre and radio format that was most popular during the 1950s to 1970s. It is related to middle-of-the-road (MOR) music and encompasses instrumental recordings of standards, hit songs and popular non-rock vocals. It was differentiated from the mostly instrumental beautiful music format by its variety of styles, including a percentage of vocals, arrangements and tempos to fit various day parts during the broadcast day.  - \\"Strangers in the Night\\" is a popular song credited to Bert Kaempfert with English lyrics by Charles Singleton and Eddie Snyder. Kaempfert originally used it under the title \\"Beddy Bye\\" as part of the instrumental score for the movie \\"A Man Could Get Killed.\\" The song was made famous in 1966 by Frank Sinatra, although it was initially given to Melina Mercouri, who thought that a man's vocals would suit more to the melody and therefore declined to sing it.  - A Brand Ambassador (sometimes also called a Corporate Ambassador) is a person who is hired by an organization or company to represent a brand in a positive light and by doing so help to increase brand awareness and sales. The brand ambassador is meant to embody the corporate identity in appearance, demeanor, values and ethics. The key element of brand ambassadors is their ability to use promotional strategies that will strengthen the customer-product-service relationship and influence a large audience to buy and consume more. Predominantly, a brand ambassador is known as a positive spokesperson, an opinion leader or a community influencer, appointed as an internal or external agent to boost product or service sales and create brand awareness. Today, \\"brand ambassador\\" as a term has expanded beyond celebrity branding to self-branding or personal brand management. Professional figures such as good-will and non-profit ambassadors, promotional models, testimonials and brand advocates have formed as an extension of the same concept, taking into account the requirements of every company.

Now, I am going to examine each type of answer and see which makes most sense given the content of the question:    - Entity: While it's possible that the question asks about an entity related to the phrase, it's unlikely that the answer directly refers to an object or concept that exists.    - Abbreviation: The phrase itself doesn't seem to hint at any specific abbreviation, so it's improbable that the answer is an abbreviation.    - Description: The question seems to ask for a description of whose phrase this was but the answer itself likely isn't the description, it's the subject of the description.    - Human: Since the question is asking about whose come-on this was, it is likely that the answer will refer to a human (or a group of humans) who used this phrase.    - Location: While the question mentions London, it doesn't seem to be asking for a specific location.    - Numeric value: The content of the question doesn't suggest any numerical answers. Based on the analysis, the most likely answer to the question \\"Whose old London come-on was: \`\`Buy my sweet lavender''?\\" would be a human or a group of humans who used this phrase.

Problem:CLOSE Former Iowa meatpacking executive Sholom Rubashkin had hoped new evidence could shorten his prison sentence for bank fraud and money laundering. Wochit      Buy Photo Sholom Rubashkin, right, heads to a court appearance in Cear Rapids on Oct. 30, 2008. (Photo: Register file photo)Buy Photo      President Donald Trump on Wednesday commuted the prison sentence of former Iowa slaughterhouse executive Sholom Rubashkin, who was sentenced to 27 years for bank fraud and money laundering, the White House said.      In a statement, the White House said the decision, which is not a presidential pardon, had bipartisan support from leaders across the political spectrum, such as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-California) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah). Trump's action does not vacate Rubashkin’s conviction and leaves his term of supervised release and a restitution obligation, the White House said.      Rubashkin, a 57-year-old father of 10 children, oversaw operations at Agriprocessors, a large kosher meatpacking plant owned by his father in the northern Iowa town of Postville. The plant was raided by agents with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in May 2008, leading to the arrests of nearly 400 Mexican and Guatemalan immigrants who were living and working in the country without authorization.      SUPPORTING A LIGHTER SENTENCE: 10 big names who advocated it      WHAT PROSECUTORS SAID:Rubashkin was not railroaded      REGISTER EDITORIAL:We need answers on prosecutors' conduct      The raid sparked a chain of events, including Agriprocessors declaring bankruptcy, that led investigators to suspicious invoices and other sales records that Rubashkin faked to make the company appear on better financial footing. Prosecutors accused Rubashkin of using the fake paperwork to continue borrowing on a 35 million line of credit, ultimately resulting in a 27 million loss for a St. Louis-based bank when Agriprocessors went defunct.      Rubashkin was convicted in 2009 and sentenced to 27 years in prison. He has served more than eight years of that sentence.      One of Rubashkin's attorneys, Montgomery Brown, said Rubashkin was released Wednesday from the Federal Correctional Institution in Otisville in New York. His wife picked him up, Brown said Rubashkin's son told him. Rubashkin's family could not be reached for comment Wednesday night.      Another one of Rubashkin's attorney, Guy Cook, praised Trump's commutation, the president's first in office. Cook said Rubashkin “finally received justice\\" and called the commutation tremendous news for the Rubashkin family, who live Borough Park, a neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York.      The sentence was essentially a life sentence, Cook told the Register. He called it unfair and unjust, and described it as not supported by the facts of the trial.      “President Trump has done what is right and just,” Cook said. “The unrelenting efforts on behalf of Rubashkin have finally paid off.”      A review of Rubashkin's case was supported by more than 30 members of Congress, including Rep. Steve King, R-Kiron, the White House said. He was the only Iowa representative to support a review. Five former high-ranking Department of Justice officials, including former FBI Director Louis Freeh, also supported a review of the case, the White House said.      Robert Teig, a former assistant U.S. attorney for the northern district of Iowa who was involved in the prosecution early on, called the commutation political, describing it as the result of a campaign of false information. Rubashkin was likely the largest employer of illegal immigrants at the time in Iowa, Teig said. He asserted the commutation was \\"180-degrees\\" from a get-tough approach on illegal immigration.      \\"[Rubashkin] couldn’t win legally, factually or morally, so he had to win politically,\\" Teig, 66, of Cedar Rapids, told the Register. \\"It’s sad when politics interferes with the justice system.\\"      The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Rubashkin's case in 2012.      In January, Chief U.S. District Court Judge Linda Reade denied a petition from defense attorneys seeking a new sentencing hearing and other relief that could have freed Rubashkin earlier than his expected 2033 release date. Reade accused the former executive's attorneys of \\"embellishing\\" their claims to win a new hearing.      Attorneys representing Rubashkin claimed in a court petition that the bank's loss was caused by prosecutors who wrongfully meddled in the bankruptcy sale, scaring off potential buyers willing to pay more than the eventual 8.5 million sale price. The filings pointed to new evidence, including recently discovered handwritten notes, that defense lawyers claim prove prosecutors misled Reade about their interference in the sale at the time of the sentencing.      THE POSTVILLE RAID:Impact lingers for Guatemalan town      Prosecutors denied any wrongdoing, and Reade wrote in her ruling that the sentence was based on more than just the amount Rubashkin cost the bank.      \\"The government did not conceal any information that materially affected the outcome of the sentencing hearing and it did not offer misleading testimony,\\" she wrote.      \\"(Rubashkin) orchestrated a massive criminal scheme that impacted a very large community, that is, defrauded financial institutions for approximately 10 years, harbored an illegal workforce and laundered millions of dollars in an effort to provide kosher products across the nation,\\" she wrote. The court recognized that \\"(Rubashkin) repeatedly tried to obstruct justice when his criminal scheme came to light, never acknowledged what the law requires and never wholeheartedly accepted responsibility.\\"      The defense attorneys' claims sparked calls for former President Barack Obama to use his clemency power to free Rubashkin or shorten his sentence, most prominently in the opinion pages of the Washington Post and the Wall Street Journal. But Obama left office without granting Rubashkin a pardon or commuting his sentence.      A bipartisan group of more than 100 former high-ranking Department of Justice officials have expressed concerns about the evidentiary proceedings in Rubashkin’s case and the severity of his sentence, the White House said in its statement Wednesday.      Supporters of Rubashkin have long claimed that the 27-year sentence handed down by Reade was excessive. Rubashkin's prison sentence was nearly three years longer than the original prison sentence given to Jeffrey Skilling, the former Enron president convicted in a fraud case that cost shareholders 11 billion.      But detractors lamented that Rubashkin was never tried in federal court on a host of immigration charges, which would have given former workers an opportunity to testify about alleged abuses and exploitation at the plant. Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorneys Office dismissed those charges shortly after Rubashkin's convictions for bank fraud and money laundering.      A jury acquitted Rubashkin in state court of 67 misdemeanor child labor law violations in 2010 after his defense attorney argued the executive should not be held liable for employing teens who \\"tricked\\" the company using fake documents. But among the allegations made public in that case were claims that certain Agriprocessors supervisors harassed and had sexual intercourse with female workers in a storage room at the plant.      Rubashkin has enjoyed support from his community of Chabad-Lubavitch Jews. After the White House announced the commute, some Orthodox Jews, including outgoing New York City Council member David Greenfield, called the news a Chanukah miracle.      \\"After years of getting railroaded by the legal system, Sholom Rubashkin is finally going home thanks to (President Trump),\\" Greenfield, a Democrat who represented the neighborhood where members of Rubashkin's family live, said in a statement on Twitter.

Trump's commutation of the sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, 57, marks his first commutation and the second use of his clemency powers since taking office, including his controversial pardon earlier this year of former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio.      The White House, in its statement announcing the move, claimed bipartisan support for the action.      The case against Rubashkin started after an immigration raid on a kosher meatpacking company that he owned, and his arrest in 2008 by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents resulted in his conviction for financial crimes.      The case drew national attention, and last December a former federal prosecutor and deputy attorney general under President Bill Clinton, Philip Heymann, took to the pages of the The Washington Post to blast Rubashkin's conviction, which he said was \\"based on perjured testimony and prosecutorial misconduct.\\" adding that more than 100 former Justice Department officials, including former attorneys general, also felt the case against Rubashkin was unjust.

(Associated Press)      WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump on Wednesday commuted the sentence of an Iowa kosher meatpacking executive who had been sentenced to 27 years in prison for money laundering, marking the first time he's used the presidential power.      The decision to intervene on behalf of Sholom Rubashkin, who ran the Iowa headquarters of a family business that was the country's largest kosher meat-processing company, came at the urging of numerous members of Congress and a long list of high-ranking law enforcement officials, who argued the sentence was far too harsh for a first-time, nonviolent offender.      The action was \\"encouraged by bipartisan leaders from across the political spectrum, from Nancy Pelosi to Orrin Hatch,\\" the White House said.      Rubashki was convicted in 2009 for submitting fake invoices to a bank that made Agriprocessors' finances appear healthier than they were so that it could borrow more. His prosecution came after federal authorities raided the plant and arrested 389 illegal immigrants in 2008.      The 57-year-old father of 10 has served more than eight years of his sentence, according to the White House, which stressed the action is not a presidential pardon and does not vacate Rubashkin's conviction.      Trump has used his pardon power just once so far: to spare former Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio the prospect of serving jail time by wiping away a federal conviction stemming from immigration patrols that focused on Latinos.      Rubashkin's long-time attorney Guy Cook praised Trump's decision, saying Rubashkin \\"has finally received justice.\\"      \\"The sentence previously imposed was unfair, unjust and essential a life sentence,\\" he said via email. \\"President Trump has done what is right and just. The unrelenting efforts on Rubashkin's behalf have finally paid off.\\"      Rubashkin's attorneys last year accused prosecutors of improperly interfering with the sale of Agriprocessors and depressing its sale price by millions. The drop in value left Agriprocessors' bank with a 27 million loss — a figure used to calculate Rubashkin's sentence under federal guidelines. The U.S. attorney's office denied the allegations.      The White House said the president's decision to review Rubashkin's sentence was driven by concerns raised by a bipartisan group of more than 100 former high-ranking law enforcement and Justice Department officials, including multiple former attorneys general, as well as prosecutors, judges, and legal scholars.      \\"Mr. Rubashkin is a devoted husband and father, a deeply religious man who simply doesn't deserve a sentence of this length, or anything remotely close to it,\\" they wrote in a letter that urged Trump to use his \\"executive clemency power to commute the patently unjust and draconian 27-year sentence imposed upon Sholom Rubashkin_a first time, non-violent offender and father of 10, including an acutely autistic child.\\"      More than 30 current members of Congress also submitted letters to the White House supporting a review of Rubashkin's case.      But former prosecutor Bob Teig, who retired in 2011 after serving as a prosecutor and spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Iowa, said Trump's decision to commute Rubashkin's sentence \\"makes no sense\\" given Trump's repeated promises to get tougher on illegal immigration.      Teig said that every court that looked at Rubashkin's sentence had concluded it was fair, and suggested that former Justice Department officials and lawmakers who supported leniency were unaware of the facts of the case.      \\"The outrage is backwards,\\" he said.      ___      Associated Press writers Ryan J. Foley in Iowa City, Iowa, and Zeke Miller in Washington contributed to this report. ||||| Today, President Donald J. Trump commuted the prison sentence of Sholom Rubashkin, an action encouraged by bipartisan leaders from across the political spectrum, from Nancy Pelosi to Orrin Hatch.      Mr. Rubashkin is a 57-year-old father of 10 children. He previously ran the Iowa headquarters of a family business that was the country’s largest kosher meat-processing company. In 2009, he was convicted of bank fraud and sentenced thereafter to 27 years in prison. Mr. Rubashkin has now served more than 8 years of that sentence, which many have called excessive in light of its disparity with sentences imposed for similar crimes.      This action is not a Presidential pardon. It does not vacate Mr. Rubashkin’s conviction, and it leaves in place a term of supervised release and a substantial restitution obligation, which were also part of Mr. Rubashkin’s sentence.      The President’s review of Mr. Rubashkin’s case and commutation decision were based on expressions of support from Members of Congress and a broad cross-section of the legal community. A bipartisan group of more than 100 former high-ranking and distinguished Department of Justice (DOJ) officials, prosecutors, judges, and legal scholars have expressed concerns about the evidentiary proceedings in Mr. Rubashkin’s case and the severity of his sentence.

It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Weardale is a dale, or valley, of the east side of the Pennines in County Durham, England. Large parts of Weardale fall within the North Pennines Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)  the second largest AONB in England and Wales. The upper valley is surrounded by high fells (up to O.D. at Burnhope Seat) and heather grouse moors. The River Wear flows through Weardale before reaching Bishop Auckland and then Durham, meeting the sea at Sunderland.  - County Durham (locally ), occasionally Durhamshire, is a county in North East England. The county town is Durham, a cathedral city, whilst the largest settlement is Darlington. It borders Tyne and Wear to the north east, Northumberland to the north, Cumbria to the west and North Yorkshire to the south. Historically, the county included southern Tyne and Wear, including Gateshead and Sunderland.  - Wearside is an area of North East England centred on the continuous urban area of Sunderland by the River Wear, and in the wider sense, including separate neighbouring settlements such as Seaham.  - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague.  - North East England is one of the nine regions of England that are classified at the first level of NUTS for statistical purposes. It covers Northumberland, County Durham, Tyne and Wear, and the Tees Valley. The region is home to three large conurbations: Teesside, Wearside, and Tyneside, the latter of which is the largest of the three and the eighth most populous conurbation in the United Kingdom. There are only three cities in the region; Newcastle upon Tyne is the largest city in the region with a population of just under 280,000, followed by Sunderland, both of which are located in the metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear. The city of Durham is the county town of County Durham. Other large settlements in the region include Darlington; Gateshead; Hartlepool; Middlesbrough; South Shields; Stockton-on-Tees; Alnwick and Washington.  - The River Wear in North East England rises in the Pennines and flows eastwards, mostly through County Durham to the North Sea in the City of Sunderland. At long, it is one of the region's longest rivers, wends in a steep valley through the cathedral city of Durham and gives its name to Weardale in its upper reach and Wearside by its mouth.  - Framwellgate Bridge is a mediaeval masonry arch bridge across the River Wear , in Durham , England .

Article: Todd McHugh doesn't think he is a hero, but police say the California teenager probably saved a mother and her two young children from serious injury or death last month. He pulled them out of their car, stuck on light-rail tracks in Folsom, California, about 90 seconds before a train smashed into it. McHugh, 17, was northbound on his way to meet friends when the silver car in front of him turned off the road, went into a ditch and jolted  to a stop on the tracks. McHugh jumped out of his vehicle and went to help. The driver, a woman who police say had fallen asleep, was behind the wheel and dazed. Her two daughters aged 7 and 10, were in the back seat, buckled  in. McHugh took the woman's hand and helped her from the car. She unbuckled the kids. Another driver who had pulled over to help shouted that a train was coming, McHugh recalled. Police said the other man ran along the tracks and tried to wave down the train. It was dark and there was a bend in the tracks. The train operator probably never saw him. McHugh said the driver applied the brakes, but the train was still going fast when it came up on them. The woman, her daughters and McHugh took shelter behind his truck as the train smashed into their car, dragging it down the tracks, the teenager said. The woman's car was destroyed. Officials said the train was damaged. But none of the crew and four passengers were injured. Police said the outcome could have been far worse: \\"Had she sat there for another minute or two, she and her daughters could have been in that vehicle when the train struck it, and they could have been severely injured or killed.\\" McHugh said he \\"didn't do anything anyone else wouldn't have done.\\" Question: What can we infer from the passage? - It was risky for the woman to drive with two babies. - Had it not been for McHugh's timely help, the woman driver and her two daughters would have been seriously injured or even killed. - It was careless of the train driver not to have noticed the warning. - The mother was at a loss at the sight of the approaching train.

While taking a sight-seeing tour on a small boat, he gazes into the ocean and sees something below the surface that fascinates him, while his older brother Freddie Bauer is walking around the boat fascinated by the women. Allen jumps into the water, even though he cannot swim. He grasps the hands of a girl who is inexplicably under the water with him and an instant connection forms between the two. Allen can now breathe under water as he is in the hands of a mermaid. However, Allen is pulled to the surface by the deck hands and the two are separated, though apparently no one else sees the girl. After the ferry moves off, Allen looks back at the girl, who dives underwater showing her mermaid's tail. Allen comes to believe the encounter was a near-death hallucination, but his bond with the mermaid proves so strong that his subsequent relationships with women fail as he seeks the connection he felt with the mermaid. Years later, Allen (Tom Hanks) is a co-owner of a wholesale fruit and vegetable business in New York City with his womanizing older brother Freddie (John Candy). Depressed after his latest breakup, Allen returns to Cape Cod, where he encounters eccentric scientist Dr. Walter Kornbluth (Eugene Levy). After Allen is left alone when his motorboat conks out, he again falls into the sea, and is knocked out when the boat hits his head. He wakes up with a headache on a beach, where he encounters a beautiful naked woman with long blonde hair, a necklace with a lion medal, and the inability to talk (Daryl Hannah) who, unknown to him, is the mermaid he met as a boy (her tail transforms into legs when it becomes dry). After kissing him, she dives into the sea and leaves Allen to return home. Kornbluth, while diving in order to seek proof of strange sea creatures, also encounters the mermaid in her sea form, causing him to become obsessed with finding her again.

The approach was soon extended to morphology by John McCarthy and Alan Prince, and has become a dominant trend in phonology.

Here are two sentences: Mohcine Douali , who lives in the centre of Algiers , said : \\" It was a great shock . \\" It was a great shock , \\" said Mohcine Douali , who lives in central Algiers . Do they have the same meaning?","output":"Yes, both sentences convey the same meaning with slightly different sentence structures. They both communicate that Mohcine Douali, a resident of the central part of Algiers, experienced a significant shock or surprise. The primary difference between the two sentences lies in the way they are constructed, but they still provide the same information.  In the first sentence, Mohcine Douali is introduced as living in the center of Algiers, which provides the reader with context before sharing his quote. The quote from Mohcine Douali - \\"It was a great shock\\" - is then presented at the end of the sentence. This structure can be useful when aiming to emphasize the context or background information before presenting the quote. On the other hand, the second sentence puts Mohcine Douali's quote first - \\"It was a great shock\\" - and then provides the context and background information. This sentence structure places the focus on Mohcine Douali's reaction and personal experience, which can be helpful when highlighting the emotional impact for the reader. Despite the differences in structure, both sentences effectively communicate the same content. They describe Mohcine Douali's experience living in central Algiers and his reaction to an event, which was a great shock for him.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Underwater  for the following movie plot:  In 1942, both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union are gathering forces and supplies in one particular sector of the Eastern Front for a major attack. The Soviets are secretly constructing a bridge at night over a river. To avoid detection, it is being built underwater, just below the surface. In an attempt to find out where the Germans plan to strike, Colonel Semenov (George Macready) has a small paratrooper unit dropped behind enemy lines to attack a divisional headquarters and hopefully take an officer prisoner for interrogation. The local partisans, led by the wily Kostyuk (Roman Bohnen), provide a guide, Lisa Elenko (Marguerite Chapman). The attack succeeds at first. Alexei Kulkov (Paul Muni), one of the paratroopers, takes seven Germans prisoner in the basement. Then, just as Elenko brings him a message, German artillery hits the building, causing it to collapse and trap them in the spacious cellar. Afterward, Kulkov's dog sniffs out where his master is buried and starts digging. This alerts one of Kulkov's comrades, who communicates with him by tapping on a metal pipe in code. Learning that Kulkov has caught an officer, he leaves to get help. Kulkov is in no hurry to dig out. Though the prisoners rank no higher than a sergeant, he is convinced one of them is an officer in disguise, based on a pistol and a monocle he has found. He begins questioning the men one by one, but while he rules out ex-miner Stillman (Rudolph Anders) and a former magician (Philip Van Zandt), he cannot pinpoint his man. An eighth German soldier, thought to be dead, wakes up and attacks. In the struggle, the lone lantern is extinguished and Elenko is stabbed in the shoulder. However, Kulkov kills him and regains control of the situation. Oddly, Elenko is certain that one of the Germans tried to help her in the darkness. Kulkov decides to try a ploy. He orders the magician to go around the corner of the main room out of sight of the others. He knocks the German out and then fires one round, making the rest think he has exacted...

For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER.

Question: Background: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Paragraph: John enrolled in a prestigious culinary school. In the very first day his instructor was showing different processes used on fruits. One of them was glace fruit. He showed the class how to prepare glace fruit and kept some of the glace fruits on bowl A. To compare glace fruits with non glace fruits he kept some non glace fruits on bowl B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would bowl A fruits be preserved longer or shorter than bowl B fruits? Answer:","output":"Bowl A fruits would be preserved longer than bowl B fruits.  Step 1: Identify the types of fruits in the bowls: - Bowl A: Glace fruits (candied or crystallized fruits) - Bowl B: Non-glace fruits (regular fruits) Step 2: Understand the preservation process of glace fruits: - Glace fruits are preserved by soaking them in sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit, eventually preserving it. This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year and prevents the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavorable osmotic pressure created by the high sugar content. Step 3: Compare the preservation durations of the fruits in the bowls: - Bowl A: Glace fruits can last for a year. - Bowl B: Non-glace fruits do not have the same preservation and tend to spoil faster due to the absence of sugar preservation. Conclusion: Based on the information provided, bowl A fruits (glace fruits) would be preserved longer than bowl B fruits (non-glace fruits)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two enterprising Italians — Alessandro Guagni and Lorenzo Bianchi — hear you, and they're doing something about it.      The pair is trying to bring back a make-out friendly garlic strain, aglione, which hasn't been widely cultivated in Italy for 40 years, according to the Guardian. Guagni and Bianchi are vying to get their less-pungent, more-digestible \\"kissing garlic\\" on the menu at some of Italy's best restaurants.      A construction engineer and a lawyer by trade, Guagni and Bianchi turned to cultivating giant garlic (about 10 times the size of your average bulb, they said) three years ago, when Guagni spotted it while on vacation in Tuscany. \\"We wanted to do something to escape from our offices,\\" Guagni told the Guardian, and growing \\"big garlic\\" — the literal translation of aglione — provided just such a diversion. Thus, they started asking after the crop at Tuscan restaurants.      \\"We asked: 'Where can we find it?' And they [restauranteurs] said: 'No, there isn't any. You will never find it because it is over. It's extinct.'\\" But aglione is not extinct. Eventually they were able to locate some seeds, and they planted two hectares of land with the \\"kissing garlic,\\" which will be ready for harvest in a few months. Thereafter, the world will be able to make out with abandon immediately after garlic-laden feasts — what a time to be alive. ||||| Giant variety known as aglione is milder, odourless and easy to digest, say pair who have spent three years cultivating crop      Help is on the way for cooks and diners who love the taste of garlic but hold back from eating it for fear it will cause bad breath and indigestion.      An unlikely Roman duo, a construction engineer and a commercial lawyer, have spent the past three years cultivating a special giant variety of garlic that used to be prevalent in Tuscany but has not been produced in large quantities for 40 years. The garlic, known in Italian as aglione, has a milder flavour, is odourless and easy to digest, say the two entrepreneurs, Alessandro Guagni and Lorenzo Bianchi.      With just a few months to go before their harvest, the pair are trying to get their “kissing garlic” in some of Italy’s Michelin-star restaurants after chefs who sampled last year’s crop gave it an enthusiastic response . They hope to sell the aglione in high quality food markets, where they hope it will come to be seen as a newfound Italian gem.      “We thought this was a typical example of Italian excellence that has been forgotten. Why? Because no one knows it and no one asks for it,” said Bianchi.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Alessandro Guagni at work on the farm where the aglione is grown. Photograph: Stephanie Kirchgaessner for the Guardian      Garlic is often associated with Italian cuisine, and is considered an important ingredient when cooking roasted potatoes, lamb, roast pork and bruschetta, but it is not a flavour that dominates typical dishes. Guagni and Bianchi say this reflects concern, especially among young people, that it is indigestible and causes bad breath.      They also say that most garlic consumed in Italy is produced abroad, particularly China and Spain.      Their story started about three years ago. Guagni was on holiday in the Chiana valley in Tuscany, in the heart of winemaking country, when he came across a farmer’s stand that was selling a product he had never seen before.      “It was very big. One bulb weighed from 300 to 800 grams, about 10 times as big as normal garlic. The taste was very good and very light so we thought about the possibility of reintroducing it in the market,” Guagni said.            Their first task was to find aglione seeds.      The product is not totally unknown. Some Tuscan restaurants serve a dish known as pici all’algione on their menu, a fresh, eggless pasta with a tomato and garlic sauce. When Guagni and Bianchi started asking restauranteurs about where they found their supplies, however, they hit a wall.      “We asked: ‘Where can we find it’? And they said: ‘No, there isn’t any. You will never find it because it is over. It’s extinct’,” Guagni said.      They learned that though the dish technically calls for aglione, which translates as “big garlic”, most chefs use a conventional variety.            Eventually they tracked down a few local producers , got their hands on some seeds and went to work on land Bianchi owns in the Marche region, near the city of Ancona. They say they have a tractor they “play” on over the weekend, and a friend with experience who is also helping out.      Asked whether their garlic could be considered organic, the two chuckle.            Facebook Twitter Pinterest Ducks eat the weeds on the land but don’t eat the garlic bulbs. Photograph: Courtesy: Kissingarlic      “It couldn’t get more organic,” Bianchi said. Garlic is not too labour intensive, they add, and in this case much of the labour is done by ducks, which eat the weeds on the land but don’t touch the bulbs themselves. They also produce fertiliser.      The pair have grown their garlic on two hectares of land, which they say is enough to cultivate about 30,000 plants.      According to the Fondazione Slow Food, an organisation that promotes food biodiversity, fewer than 10 producers cultivate what it calls aglione della Chiana, and most do so for personal use. The foundation said the variety does not contain allicin, a chemical compound found in traditional garlic, and that there are usually six large cloves in a bulb.      The garlic is said to date back to ancient times, when Etruscans inhabited the Chiana valley, and it was also present on the island of Giglio. It allegedly arrived on the island in 1544 after the pirate Khayr al-Din killed nearly everyone on it, forcing the ruling Medici family of Florence to repopulate it with aglione-loving inhabitants of the Chiana valley, who brought it with them.      Guagni and Bianchi, who have been friends since they were teenagers growing up in Rome, are thinking big, possibly about creating a supplement or soap, given that garlic is known for its anti-bacterial qualities. They also have a few more ancient products they would like to revive, but don’t want to divulge their trade secrets.      They are also having fun. “We wanted to do something to escape from our offices,” Guagni said. ||||| You might never have to worry about eating garlic on a first date again—if two Italian farmers are successful. Former engineer Alessandro Guagni and lawyer Loreno Bianchi are marketing KissinGarlic, a milder strain of garlic that the duo claims does not cause bad breath.      Garlic’s signature odor comes from a compound called allicin, which is released whenever a clove is crushed or chopped. Take away the allicin and you remove the pungent smell and the risk of bad breath. As luck would have it, an allicin-free garlic already exists—no engineering or cross-breeding necessary. Guagni and Bianchi’s KissinGarlic is actually an ancient strain of garlic called aglione, which doesn’t contain any allicin.      The sweet smelling garlic is not only easier on the nostrils; it’s also massive. It typically grows five times the size of common garlic, but it can grow up to ten times the size. It is also less zesty and spicy than common garlic and therefore, the duo says, easier to digest.      The ultra-mild garlic was almost lost completely. Today, there are less than ten producers who grow aglione, all of which are located in Italy’s Chiana Valley. Guagni and Bianchi have joined this small enclave of aglione producers and grow their KissinGarlic in the valley using ducks as weed deterrents and fertilizer dispensers. (The ducks eat the weeds, then digest them and fertilize the soil with their droppings.)      Curious about the breath-friendly garlic? You can order it by emailing info@kissingarlic.com. But be prepared to make a lot of mildly garlicky dishes; the minimum order is fifteen heads.      [h/t Food Navigator] ||||| Chiana Giant garlic is rarely cultivated these days. In fact, there are less than ten producers, all of whom work in the reclaimed flat lands of the Chiana Valley and in a few fraction of the town of Montepulciano. This giant garlic has a particular aroma and contains no allicin (a particular chemical compound) or its derivatives. This garlic is an almost ivory shade of white, nearly spherical in shape and is slightly flat at the extremities. There are usually six large, individual bulbs in each clove, which can weigh up to 800 grams. It has a very delicate flavor and is used in the Chiana Valley most typically in a pasta dish called pici all’aglione. Chiana Giant garlic’s history dates back to when the Etruscans lived in the Chiana Valley, while the garlic is also present on Giglio Island. In 1544 the pirate Khayr al-Din, also known as Barbarossa, sacked the island, killed everyone who opposed him and kidnapped and enslaved more than 700 locals. Following this tragedy the Medici family repopulated the island with people from the Chiana Valley, who certainly brought bulbs of Chiana Giant garlic with them. The historic production zone is the Chiana Valley, around Montepulciano and in particular in the towns of Abbadia, Acquaviva, Gracciano, Montepulciano Station and Valiano. There are 2,000 bulbs of the garlic produced annually, mainly for personal use. With the industrialization of the 1960s, the tradition of cultivating the garlic in a family setting was lost, and thus also the tendency to use it in the kitchen.

Answer a question about this article: When a historic document survives only in translation, the original having been lost, researchers sometimes undertake back-translation in an effort to reconstruct the original text. An example involves the novel The Saragossa Manuscript by the Polish aristocrat Jan Potocki (1761–1815), who wrote the novel in French and anonymously published fragments in 1804 and 1813–14. Portions of the original French-language manuscript were subsequently lost; however, the missing fragments survived in a Polish translation that was made by Edmund Chojecki in 1847 from a complete French copy, now lost.

Ryan was born in Refugio, south of Victoria in south Texas, the youngest of six children, to Lynn Nolan Ryan Sr. (1907-1970), and the former Martha Lee Hancock (1913-1990). The senior Ryan operated a newspaper delivery service for the Houston Post that required him to rise in the early morning hours to prepare 1,500 newspapers for delivery over a 55-mile route. The children were expected to help with the daily tasks. In 1965, after graduating from Alvin High School, Ryan was drafted by the New York Mets in the 12th round of the 1965 Major League Baseball draft. He was assigned the minor league Marion Mets in the Appalachian League. When Ryan was called up to the New York club the following year, he was the second-youngest player in the league. His first strikeout was Pat Jarvis, and he gave up his first major league home run to Joe Torre, a future NL MVP and Hall of Fame big-league manager.  Ryan missed much of the 1967 season due to illness, an arm injury, and service with the Army Reserve; he pitched only 7 innings for the Mets' minor league affiliate in Jacksonville. Ryan returned to the major leagues to stay starting with the 1968 season. Ryan was unable to crack the Mets' pitching rotation, led by Tom Seaver and Jerry Koosman. Ryan was used more as a reliever and spot starter by the 1969 Mets. To deal with frequent blisters on his throwing hand he often soaked his fingers in pickle brine, although the technique's effectiveness was questioned by Ryan's teammates and coaches.  Ryan pitched well for the Miracle Mets in the 1969 postseason. Against the Braves in the NLCS, Ryan completed a Mets sweep by throwing seven innings of relief in Game 3, getting his first playoff win (it would take him 12 years to get another). Then in the 1969 World Series, Ryan saved Game 3, pitching 2 1/3  shutout innings against the Baltimore Orioles. The Game 3 victory gave the Mets a 2-1 lead in the Series, which they went on to win in five games. It would be Ryan's only World Series appearance in his career.  On April 18, 1970, Ryan tied a Mets record by striking out 15 batters in one game. Four days later, Ryan's teammate, Tom Seaver, topped it with a then MLB record 19 against the San Diego Padres (though Ryan would tie this record four years later). Ryan has credited his time with Seaver and the Mets with turning him from just a flamethrower to a pitcher. Contrary to popular belief, Ryan never wanted to be traded from the Mets and felt betrayed by the team that drafted him. His views on this only calmed once he started running the Rangers and gained a better understanding of the business side of baseball.

Write an article based on this \\"The UK's financial watchdog is calling for a clampdown on commissions paid for selling insurance, loans and bank accounts.\\"","output":"Title: The UK's Financial Watchdog Urges Clampdown on Commissions for Selling Financial Products Introduction In recent years, the UK's financial watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has been closely monitoring and regulating the country's financial services sector. In a bid to increase transparency and ethical behaviour amongst financial institutions, the FCA is now calling for a clampdown on commissions paid for selling insurance, loans, and bank accounts. This latest move is aimed at safeguarding customers from potential predatory practices, while ensuring that financial companies operate on a level playing field. The Problem with Commissions Commissions on financial products, such as insurance policies, loans, and bank accounts, have long been a contentious issue within the sector. Critics argue that the practice of paying large commissions creates conflicts of interest between financial institutions, their employees, and their customers. The pursuit of commissions can often result in sales staff recommending products that may not necessarily be in the best interest of the customer. This unscrupulous approach to sales not only exacerbates the trust gap between customers and financial institutions but can also lead to customers facing financially detrimental outcomes. It is an issue that the FCA has identified as a priority in its ongoing effort to reform the industry. The FCA's Proposal The FCA's call for a clampdown on commissions highlights the need for consistent regulation and strict monitoring of payment structures within financial institutions to support a fair and transparent marketplace. The agency is encouraging firms to reconsider their current commission models and find alternative ways to reward sales staff without creating conflicts of interest. The proposed clampdown on commissions would necessitate policymaking on several levels, such as: 1. Restricting or capping commission rates on financial products to minimize financial incentives that may lead to biased recommendations. 2. Implementing strict disclosure requirements, whereby financial institutions would need to clearly inform customers of the commissions received for selling particular products. 3. Mandating the presence of a diverse range of financial products, thereby ensuring that customers have access to unbiased and well-suited financial solutions. 4. Advocating for performance-based employee compensation in the sector, which rewards staff for meeting customer needs and promoting a culture of transparency and ethical selling practices. Potential Benefits of Clampdown The proposed clampdown on commissions, if successfully enforced, could bring about numerous benefits for consumers, financial institutions, and the overall economy. These potential benefits include: 1. Greater transparency: With firms disclosing commission rates to consumers and adhering to payment structure guidelines, customers will have access to clearer and more transparent information. This transparency empowers consumers to make better-informed decisions when purchasing financial products. 2. Improved customer trust: As financial institutions prioritize customer needs and demonstrate a commitment to ethical sales practices, consumer trust in these institutions is likely to increase. 3. Reduction in mis-selling: With fewer financial incentives clouding decision-making, the likelihood of mis-selling financial products, such as inappropriate insurance policies or unnecessarily expensive loans, is significantly reduced. 4. Higher industry standards: By encouraging financial institutions to adopt performance-based compensation structures, the FCA sets a higher standard across the industry, promoting a culture focused on customer satisfaction and ethical practices. Conclusion The FCA's call for a clampdown on commissions paid for selling financial products echoes the regulatory agency's constant efforts to increase transparency, reduce unethical practices and protect consumers in the UK financial services sector. By supporting policies that prioritize customer needs and well-being, the FCA is propelling the industry towards a more responsible and sustainable future. Although implementing these changes may come with challenges, investing in better practices and prioritizing consumer trust can undoubtedly benefit the financial landscape in the long run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For four years, she was Hollywood's biggest box-office star representing the kind of sweet, innocent girl that everyone wanted as their daughter. However, years later, she reappeared as a successful politician. Shirley Temple was born in Santa Monica, California on 23 April 1928. Encouraged by her mother, she learned to dance while she was just three. In 1934, Stand Up and Cheer became her first film and the film was a great success. At the age of six she was earning 1,250 a week -- more than 21,000 at today's values. Across the world, audiences flocked to see her in films such as Little Miss Marker, The Little Colonel and The Littlest Rebel. In 1935 she was awarded a special Oscar (Academy Award) and her foot and hand prints were added to those of stars such as Jean Harlow and Mary Pickford outside Grauman's Chinese theatre in Hollywood. The peak of her film career came in 1939 when The Little Princess became a box-office success. Temple starred in a total of 43 feature films. But she found it difficult to maintain her film career in adulthood and retired from Hollywood in 1950. She disappeared from the spotlight for nearly 20 years. She returned to the public eye in 1967, as a Republican candidate for Congress. When Nixon became president, he rewarded her with an appointment to the American delegation to the United Nations. Then, in 1974, President Ford appointed her the United States Ambassador  to Ghana. George Bush Snr, appointed her Ambassador to Czechoslovakia. Shirley Temple drew a line between her childhood stardom and her later political career. \\"Some people are stuck on this image of the little girl,\\" she once said. \\"She is not me.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Philosophy (from Greek , \\"philosophia\\", literally \\"love of wisdom\\") is the study of general and fundamental problems concerning matters such as existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. The term was probably coined by Pythagoras (c. 570  c. 495 BC). Philosophical methods include questioning, critical discussion, rational argument and systematic presentation. Classic philosophical questions include: Is it possible to know anything and to prove it? What is most real? However, philosophers might also pose more practical and concrete questions such as: Is there a best way to live? Is it better to be just or unjust (if one can get away with it)? Do humans have free will?  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - Pole vaulting is a track and field event in which a person uses a long, flexible pole (which today is usually made either of fiberglass or carbon fiber) as an aid to jump over a bar. Pole jumping competitions were known to the ancient Greeks, Cretans and Celts. It has been a full medal event at the Olympic Games since 1896 for men and 2000 for women.  - Plato (Greek: \\"Plátn\\", in Classical Attic; 428/427 or 424/423  348/347 BCE) was a philosopher in Classical Greece and the founder of the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in the Western world. He is widely considered the most pivotal figure in the development of philosophy, especially the Western tradition. Unlike nearly all of his philosophical contemporaries, Plato's entire \\"œuvre\\" is believed to have survived intact for over 2,400 years.  - Aristotle (\\"Aristotéls\\"; 384322 BC) was a Greek philosopher and scientist born in the city of Stagira, Chalkidice, on the northern periphery of Classical Greece. His father, Nicomachus, died when Aristotle was a child, whereafter Proxenus of Atarneus became his guardian. At seventeen or eighteen years of age, he joined Plato's Academy in Athens and remained there until the age of thirty-seven (c. 347 BC). His writings cover many subjects  including physics, biology, zoology, metaphysics, logic, ethics, aesthetics, poetry, theater, music, rhetoric, linguistics, politics and government  and constitute the first comprehensive system of Western philosophy. Shortly after Plato died, Aristotle left Athens and, at the request of Philip of Macedon, tutored Alexander the Great beginning in 343 BC.  - Konstadinos Filippidis ( Greek :   ; born 26 November 1986 in Athens ) is a Greek pole vaulter .  - The city of Athens during the classical period of Ancient Greece (508322 BC) was the major urban center of the notable polis (city-state) of the same name, located in Attica, Greece, leading the Delian League in the Peloponnesian War against Sparta and the Peloponnesian League. Athenian democracy was established in 508 BC under Cleisthenes following the tyranny of Isagoras. This system remained remarkably stable, and with a few brief interruptions remained in place for 180 years, until 322 BC (aftermath of Lamian War). The peak of Athenian hegemony was achieved in the 440s to 430s BC, known as the Age of Pericles.  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.  Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.  - Attica (or ; or ) is a historical region that encompasses the city of Athens, the capital of Greece. The historical region is centered on the Attic peninsula, which projects into the Aegean Sea. The modern administrative region of Attica is more extensive than the historical region and includes the Saronic Islands, Cythera, and the municipality of Troizinia on the Peloponnesian mainland. The history of Attica is tightly linked with that of Athens, which, from the classical period, was one of the most important cities in the ancient world.  - Piraeus (\\"Pireás\\" , , \\"Peiraieús\\") is a port city in the region of Attica, Greece. Piraeus is located within the Athens urban area, southwest from its city center (municipality of Athens), and lies along the east coast of the Saronic Gulf.  - A metropolis is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Greek and means the \\"mother city\\" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers.

Q: Passage: On 31 December 1543, Henry and Charles had signed a treaty pledging to invade France in person by 20 June 1544; each was to provide an army of no less than 35,000 infantry and 7,000 cavalry for the venture. Against this Francis could muster about 70,000 men in his various armies. The campaign could not begin, however, until Henry and Charles had resolved their personal conflicts with Scotland and the German princes, respectively. On 15 May, Henry was informed by Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, that, after his raids, Scotland was no longer in a position to threaten him; he then began to make preparations for a personal campaign in France—against the advice of his council and the Emperor, who believed that his presence would be a hindrance. Charles had meanwhile reached an understanding with the princes at the Diet of Speyer, and the Electors of Saxony and Brandenburg had agreed to join his invasion of France. By May 1544, two Imperial armies were poised to invade France: one, under Ferrante Gonzaga, Viceroy of Sicily, north of Luxemburg; the other, under Charles himself, in the Palatinate. Charles had gathered a combined force of more than 42,000 for the invasion, and had arranged for another 4,000 men to join the English army. On 25 May, Gonzaga captured Luxembourg and moved towards Commercy and Ligny, issuing a proclamation that the Emperor had come to overthrow \\"a tyrant allied to the Turks\\". On 8 July, Gonzaga besieged Saint-Dizier; Charles and the second Imperial army soon joined him.  Question: How many troops did Henry and Charles agree to provide, combined, at minimum?

In June 2009, Ray Davies told The Independent that while a full-fledged reunion was unlikely, \\"I will continue to play with ex-band members like Mick Avory from time to time. With Dave, a lot of it is psychological. I'll guide him in, and coerce and nurture him, and when the time is right I suppose I'll even shout at him again.\\" When asked about a possible reunion in an interview that year, Avory stated, \\"A reunion would not be possible with the originals, for a start due to ill health. But it would be possible with the Kast Off Kinks plus Ray. In any event Ray would record new material. We have some old tracks from the 80s as well.\\" In March 2010, Avory reported that the band were planning on releasing an album of unreleased and new material. He stated that they had \\"eight tracks\\" ready for the album, but that the Davies brothers had to settle their differences before the project could progress.Quaife, who had been receiving kidney dialysis for more than ten years, died on 23 June 2010, aged 66. Two days after the bassist's death, Dave Davies posted a statement on his message board expressing deep sorrow over the passing of his former band mate and stating that Quaife \\"was never really given the credit he deserved for his contribution and involvement [sic] [with The Kinks]\\". Ray Davies dedicated his performance of 27 June at the Glastonbury Festival to Quaife and performed several Quaife-era Kinks songs in tribute to him. Davies told the crowd, \\"I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for him.\\"In separate interviews early in 2011 both Davies brothers spoke positively about a potential reunion. Dave Davies explained, \\"There's nothing in the pipeline yet, but ... we'll see. It's possible.\\" Each has said that any reunion would be dependent on the other. According to Ray Davies, the brothers were to meet in April to discuss future plans.

Yes Based on the provided paragraph, we can indeed conclude that \\"Budapest consists of two parts, Buda and Pest, which are on opposite sides of the river and connected by a series of bridges.\\" The paragraph explicitly states this information and leaves no room for ambiguity or uncertainty. It clearly defines the geographical relationship between Buda and Pest as they make up the city of Budapest.  Budapest, the capital city of Hungary, is uniquely and historically divided into two distinct parts by the Danube River. Buda, the older, hilly side, lies on the western bank of the river and is known for its historic architecture, charming cobbled streets, and the iconic Buda Castle. On the other hand, Pest, the flat and more modern part, is situated on the eastern bank of the river and boasts a lively city center with bustling businesses, shops, and Parliament building. The two parts of Budapest are connected by a number of remarkable bridges, the most famous being the Chain Bridge, a suspension bridge that was the first permanent structure to span the Danube. Other bridges connecting both halves of the city include the Elisabeth Bridge, Liberty Bridge, and Margaret Bridge, each with their own history and architectural significance. Having Buda and Pest as separate yet connected halves lends a unique character to Budapest, and the series of bridges that join these areas create a harmonious union between the city's ancient past and contemporary present. Moreover, the bridges are not only functional in nature, but also serve as architectural and historical symbols of the city's growth and development throughout the years. In summary, based on the given paragraph, it is safe and accurate to conclude that Budapest indeed comprises two parts - Buda and Pest - which are located on opposite sides of the river and connected by a series of bridges. This geographical and architectural composition is an essential aspect of the city's identity and allure to both residents and tourists alike."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"To answer these questions, I will first research and analyze how MeetMe and Twitter define their target markets and then determine if the answer to both questions is the same. Step 1: Research and analyze MeetMe's target market. MeetMe is a social networking platform primarily focused on connecting users based on similar interests, facilitating new friendships, and allowing them to maintain connections. Their target market consists of people interested in expanding their social network, meeting new friends, and engaging in online chatting and socializing. They particularly target younger demographic users, aged 18-34, who are actively seeking new connections with people nearby and around the world. Step 2: Research and analyze Twitter's target market. Twitter is a microblogging and social networking platform where users express their thoughts, ideas, news, and opinions through short messages called 'tweets.' Its target market is broader, as it is more diverse in terms of age and user interests. Twitter aims to reach anyone who wants to stay updated on the latest news and trends, join various conversations, or follow their favorite personalities, brands, and influencers. They accommodate anyone from casual users, businesses, journalists, celebrities, and politicians. Step 3: Compare the target markets of MeetMe and Twitter. MeetMe's target market is more focused on facilitating new friendships and connections, while Twitter's target market is much broader, aiming to engage users in multiple ways, including following the latest news, joining conversations, and following their interests. Step 4: Determine if the answer to both questions is the same. Given the differences in their target markets, the answer to both questions would not be the same. MeetMe is more narrowly focused on a younger demographic and building new connections, whereas Twitter targets a wider range of users with varied objectives and interests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She had presented a talk on black holes in the evening, but was found dead in the morning by the manager of the observatory. She had been shot in the face, but there was no weapon. There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck.

Given the following context:  Oklahoma is between the Great Plains and the Ozark Plateau in the Gulf of Mexico watershed, generally sloping from the high plains of its western boundary to the low wetlands of its southeastern boundary. Its highest and lowest points follow this trend, with its highest peak, Black Mesa, at 4,973 feet (1,516 m) above sea level, situated near its far northwest corner in the Oklahoma Panhandle. The state's lowest point is on the Little River near its far southeastern boundary near the town of Idabel, which dips to 289 feet (88 m) above sea level. Among the most geographically diverse states, Oklahoma is one of four to harbor more than 10 distinct ecological regions, with 11 in its borders—more per square mile than in any other state. Its western and eastern halves, however, are marked by extreme differences in geographical diversity: Eastern Oklahoma touches eight ecological regions and its western half contains three. Although having fewer ecological regions Western Oklahoma contains many rare, relic species. Oklahoma has four primary mountain ranges: the Ouachita Mountains, the Arbuckle Mountains, the Wichita Mountains, and the Ozark Mountains. Contained within the U.S. Interior Highlands region, the Ozark and Ouachita Mountains are the only major mountainous region between the Rocky Mountains and the Appalachians.

A:","output":"The time change in London takes place twice a year to mark the beginning and end of Daylight Saving Time (DST), also known as British Summer Time (BST) in the United Kingdom. This system was introduced to make the best use of daylight during the longer days of the summer months and to conserve energy. In the UK, clocks are changed forward by one hour at the beginning of British Summer Time and moved back one hour when returning to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). This time adjustment happens in accordance with a predetermined schedule. The exact schedule for changing the time in London is as follows: 1. Moving forward to British Summer Time (BST): Clocks are set one hour ahead on the last Sunday of March at 1:00 am Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). As a result, it becomes 2:00 am BST, which marks the commencement of British Summer Time. This transition is commonly known as \\"springing forward.\\" 2. Moving back to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT): Clocks are set one hour back on the last Sunday of October at 2:00 am British Summer Time (BST). Following the adjustment, it becomes 1:00 am GMT, signifying the return to standard time. This change is referred to as \\"falling back.\\" These time changes are automatic for most modern devices, such as smartphones, tablets, and computers with built-in calendar and time functions. However, for some other devices, such as wall clocks, wristwatches, and older electronics, manual adjustments might be necessary. To sum up, changing the time in London occurs twice a year: transitioning from GMT to BST on the last Sunday of March, and moving back from BST to GMT on the last Sunday of October. Adhering to this schedule allows for the utilization of daylight during summer months, and helps London and the rest of the United Kingdom conserve energy and better align waking hours with periods of sunlight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One problem is that in space there's no physical sensation to let you know when you're upside down and astronauts have to rely on possible clues from their surroundings. A few hours after reaching orbit , one in three of all astronauts will experience space sickness--a feeling rather like carsickness. There is also the problem of protection from the extreme hazards  of space such as constant meteorite bombardment  and radiation. It is going to take some clever technology to keep rockets and astronauts from these dangers. Even with a well-protected spaceship, space travel isn't going to be easy. No matter what you travel in, it is going to be a long flight in space! Science fiction writers often imagine using suspended animation , a kind of forced long-term sleep, as a way for astronauts to escape the boredom of long missions. An even stronger measure might be to freeze the astronauts. We already use cryogenic  techniques to preserve dead bodies and store human embryos . Freezing living adults may not be so far away, but perhaps we don't have to do that. Perhaps we should use our existing technology and send frozen embryos to the far corners of universe. Hundreds of years from now, billions and billions of miles away, the embryos will be thawed  and their hearts will start beating.

And even saw tour buses full of French schoolchildren dumped on his doorstep in a quiet cul-de-sac - a mile away from the Big Pit coalmine tourist attraction in Blaenavon, South Wales. So Nigel Winfield, 62, decided to take matters into his own hands and put up eight realistic road signs in official colours and logos to point them in the right direction. Nigel Winfield, 62, put up eight road signs to stop confused tourists from driving into his quiet cul-de-sac in Forgeside, South Wales. He believes his homemade 'tourist information' signs have led to a 90 per cent reduction in traffic in the village of Forgeside, 16 miles from Newport. He said: 'It has reached crisis point. There were around 50 cars a day coming through disrupting the peace and quiet. 'These drivers are just blindly following their sat-navs - it was a lot of traffic for a nice quiet cul-de-sac. 'It was making everyone in the street cheesed off. So, being a practical person, I decided to make some signs.' The tourists were trying to find the Big Pit coalmine tourist attraction in Blaenavon, South Wales. The signs took Mr Winfield five days to make and cost around £50 - he even made a stencil to copy the logos for sat-nav and the Big Pit. Torfaen council is currently making a new  set of signs - but  Mr Winfield's were inspected and it was decided that his could stay for now. Villagers say they have been overrun by disorientated motorists trying to make their way to the nearby museum within the industrial village Unesco World Heritage site. There are main roads which lead to the tourist attraction - but sat-navs are sending motorists 'around the houses' through the village. The in-car GPS is sending directing motorists towards an old mining road with a uneven surface and half of them turn around instead of risking it. The signs took Mr Winfield five days to make and cost around £50 - he even made a stencil to copy the logos. Sat navs  are directing tourists to Old Pit Road (pictured), next to his house, one mile away from the coal mine. 'There was instantly a ninety percent reduction - it's amazing to think a 62-year-old year old man with a paint brush and a bicycle can effect a 90 percent reduction in traffic. 'Everyone in the street was really pleased with them but I had the forger's dilema because they thought the council were responsible.' He still sees four or five drivers trying to go around the back of the houses to reach the museum - but it has been much quieter since he made his signs. A council spokesman said: 'Having carried out further investigations it seems that some sat navs do direct people incorrectly via Forgeside. 'However, this mainly appears to be an issue with older models and we are currently designing signage to try and prevent this. 'These unauthorised signs have been inspected to ensure they don't create any hazards for road users and will be removed when our own signs are erected.' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article involve: 1. Nigel Winfield, a 62-year-old resident of Forgeside, South Wales, faced an issue with confused tourists and their sat-nav directions, which led them to his cul-de-sac home instead of the Big Pit coalmine tourist attraction in Blaenavon, South Wales. 2. Due to the inconvenience caused by the heavy influx of lost tourists, Winfield decided to create his own realistic road signs in official colors and logos to direct them to the right destination. 3. Winfield believes that his homemade 'tourist information' signs have led to a 90% reduction in traffic in the village of Forgeside. 4.

Options: - act quickly - learn to walk - stretches - buy shoes - go quickly  Explain why a human would choose \\"learn to walk\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"learn to walk\\" as the answer to this question because it is the most logical and developmentally appropriate progression in the acquisition of locomotive skills. Learning to walk is a fundamental milestone in human development that serves as the foundation for more advanced forms of movement, such as running. The other options presented, while related to the concept of running in some way, do not address the primary prerequisite to running, which is the ability to walk. First, let's look at the importance of learning to walk. Walking is a critical stage in human motor development that typically emerges between 9 and 17 months of age, although the precise timing can vary. This process involves learning to maintain balance, coordinate movements, and adapt to changing environments or task demands. Acquiring the ability to walk allows an individual to explore their surroundings, interact with others, and participate in various daily activities. It also provides a foundation for the development of other gross motor skills, including running, jumping, and playing sports. Now, let's briefly examine why the other options are not suitable answers. Act quickly, buy shoes, and go quickly all convey the concept of speed, which is an important element of running. However, before one can focus on developing speed, they must first have a solid foundation in walking. Acting or going quickly alone does not explain how one learns to perform the physical action of running. In the context of this question, these options are therefore secondary concerns. Stretches, on the other hand, are relevant to running, but they are not a prerequisite to learning how to run. Stretches can help to prepare the body for running, prevent injuries, and enhance performance. However, they do not teach the fundamental mechanics and motor patterns required for successful walking and, eventually, running. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"learn to walk\\" as the most appropriate answer to the question because walking is the essential first step in the progression of locomotive skills, and without mastering the ability to walk, one cannot truly learn to run. It is through the development of balance, coordination, and strength that walking provides that an individual is able to improve their motor proficiency and ultimately achieve the necessary skills to run effectively. The other options, while related to running, do not address the core requirement of knowing how to walk before you can run."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: Jerusalem was conquered after a bloody battle. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"If the premise is true that Jerusalem was still reeling from the effects of the Persian devastation and was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam, it is not directly conclusive that the hypothesis stating Jerusalem was conquered after a bloody battle is also true. To make this conclusion, we need to evaluate additional historical information and context about the conquest of Jerusalem. The premise contains two main facts: 1. Jerusalem was still recovering from the effects of the Persian devastation. 2. Jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of Islam. While these two facts provide some background information regarding the vulnerability and state of the city at the time, they do not give us enough information on the nature of the battle which took place when Jerusalem was conquered by Islamic forces. We need more information on events that occurred during the conquest, such as troop movements, engagements, casualties, or the overall strategy deployed by the Islamic forces. Historically, it is known that there were indeed conflicts and battles that occurred during the Islamic conquest of the Levant, which includes Jerusalem. The forces of Islam, under the command of Caliph Umar, sought to spread their rule in this region during the 7th century. It is documented that Caliph Umar's forces did face resistance from the Byzantine Empire, which controlled Jerusalem at the time. Although there were military engagements and sieges during this period, historical records reveal that the actual capture of Jerusalem occurred through a peaceful surrender under specific terms, as opposed to a violent and bloody battle. Therefore, the hypothesis that Jerusalem was conquered after a bloody battle does not directly follow from the premise provided.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Who are the four people whose wedding receptions are being held in the same hotel?  Maura is a down on her luck single mother who's facing eviction from her house, which lead her to the rash decision to marry an illegal immigrant, Wilson, in exchange of €9,000. Maura's daughter Molly believes that her mother truly loves Wilson and that she's getting a new father. Meanwhile, Freddie, a nice guy with OCD-esque habits, is remarrying the selfish and very image-conscious Sophie after a recent divorce. The receptions for both weddings are being held in the same hotel. Freddie and Maura's paths keep crossing, leading to Sophie wrongly assuming that the two are involved in an illicit affair. To complicate matters, two immigration officers arrive at the wedding reception to investigate Wilson and Maura. Eventually Molly learns that her mother is involved in a scam and has no feelings for Wilson. Believing her suspicions of an affair to be true, Sophie flees the wedding. Presuming Freddie responsible, Sophie's aggressive father loses his cool and attempts to assault Freddie. Meanwhile, Sophie has gone to a pub in Dublin with some working class girls who support her decision to run away as they believe Freddie to be a lecherous cheater. Sophie gets drunk with her new friends while Freddie is frantically trying to find her to keep his marriage afloat. It is revealed that one of the reasons for their original breakup wasn't Sophie's mental state, as insinuated, but Freddie's nervous breakdown for his inability to deal with Sophie. Facing ruin and a new divorce, Freddie tries to take his own life by throwing himself off the top floor of the hotel. However, just as he is about to jump, Maura steps in and talks him down from the ledge. When he returns to the wedding, they find both parties have joined together and a drunken Sophie has come back.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who encounters an attack helicopter on their way home from work? ?  The film opens at Burger-Matic, where Henry Lever orders a milkshake at the drive-thru. At the window, he tells the attendant, Sally Jackson, that his wife knows about their affair. She asks him if he has also told his wife about her pregnancy. On his way home, he encounters a ferocious wind. It turns out to be an attack helicopter, which runs him off the road. In a panic, he flees through the woods and drops his heart medication. At an outdoor chapel, he sits on a bench as the helicopter hovers in front of him. The pilot, Angus Montier, shoots at the ground near him despite the protests of his copilot and brother, Dorian. The shots scare him enough to cause a fatal heart attack. Throughout their attack, Dorian and Angus can hear the chatter of Sally and her coworkers. Likewise, they can hear the helicopter pilots on their headsets. The next day, the police inform Beatrice Lever that Henry has died. She appears shocked and crestfallen, when Dorian and Angus arrive. It quickly becomes clear that she encouraged her sons to scare him to death. She is also furious about his affair, and wants revenge on his mistress. Angus and Dorian are worried that the people they heard on the radio might have overheard enough to connect them to his death. They quickly deduce that Burger-Matic is the only location close enough to have been on the same frequency. Angus goads Dorian into getting a job there to ensure that no one is wise to their crime. Sally is heartbroken at the news about Henry. At work, Dorian bonds with her quickly. He gives her a model helicopter for her baby, and he explains that he and Angus fly them as reservists for the National Guard. She asks him to accompany her to lamaze class, since she doesn't have a partner. Eventually, he takes her to the base to see the helicopter that he flies. As she sits in the cockpit, she tells him about Henry.

The sentence mentions that Nasser was especially influenced by Tawfiq al-Hakim's novel \\"Return of the Spirit.\\" Tawfiq al-Hakim was an Egyptian writer, and while not a politician himself, his work played a significant role in shaping Nasser's views on leadership and his aspirations for Egypt. Al-Hakim wrote about the need for a unifying figure who could encapsulate the feelings and desires of the Egyptian people, symbolizing their collective objectives. From this information, we can infer that Nasser admired leaders who embodied such qualities, striving to bring the Egyptian people together to achieve their shared goals. As a prominent political figure in Egypt, Nasser was known for his role in toppling the monarchy in the 1952 Egyptian Revolution and leading the country as its second president from 1956 to 1970. Nasser championed pan-Arabism, anti-imperialism, and socialism, working towards the development and unification of Arab nations. While the given sentence doesn't name a specific politician that Nasser admired, some of his contemporaries include figures like Jawaharlal Nehru (the first Prime Minister of India), Josip Broz Tito (the President of Yugoslavia), and Sukarno (the first President of Indonesia). Nasser, along with these leaders, was part of the Non-Aligned Movement, allowing us to assume that he might have had admiration for them. In conclusion, although the sentence does not directly answer the question about which politician Nasser admired, it provides insight into the type of leader he respected and the literature that influenced his political ideology. To answer the question more explicitly, further research or information would be required to pinpoint specific politicians that Nasser held in high regard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Albanian was proved to be an Indo-European language in 1854 by the German philologist Franz Bopp. The Albanian language comprises its own branch of the Indo-European language family. Some scholars believe that Albanian derives from Illyrian while others claim that it derives from Daco-Thracian. (Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see Thraco-Illyrian.) Establishing longer relations, Albanian is often compared to Balto-Slavic on the one hand and Germanic on the other, both of which share a number of isoglosses with Albanian. Moreover, Albanian has undergone a vowel shift in which stressed, long o has fallen to a, much like in the former and opposite the latter. Likewise, Albanian has taken the old relative jos and innovatively used it exclusively to qualify adjectives, much in the way Balto-Slavic has used this word to provide the definite ending of adjectives. The cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the Albanian language in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the North, but also of the Orthodox in the South. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition when cleric Gjon Buzuku brought into the Albanian language the Catholic liturgy, trying to do for the Albanian language what Luther did for German.  Question: \\"What three areas of religious texts helped develop the Albanian language?\\" Response: \\"Protestant\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"The response to the question is not factually correct.

Q:Information:  - The London Plan is the statutory spatial development strategy for the Greater London area in the United Kingdom that is written by the Mayor of London and published by the Greater London Authority. The regional planning document was first published in final form on 10 February 2004. In addition to minor alterations, it was substantially revised and republished in February 2008 and again in July 2011. The London Plan published in July 2011 is currently in effect and has 2031 as a formal end date. minor alterations are being made to the plan to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework and other changes in national policy.  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Dialogue (sometimes spelled dialog in U.S. English) is a written or spoken conversational exchange between two or more people, and a literary and theatrical form that depicts such an exchange. As a narrative, philosophical or didactic device, it is chiefly associated in the West with the Socratic dialogue as developed by Plato, but antecedents are also found in other traditions including Indian literature. In the 20th century, philosophical treatments of dialogue emerged from thinkers including Mikhail Bakhtin, Paulo Freire, Martin Buber, and David Bohm. Although diverging in many details, these thinkers have articulated a holistic concept of dialogue as a multi-dimensional, dynamic and context-dependent process of creating meaning. Educators such as Freire and Ramón Flecha have also developed a body of theory and technique for using egalitarian dialogue as a pedagogical tool.  - A silent film is a film with no synchronized recorded sound, especially with no spoken dialogue. The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music.  - Sheet music is a handwritten or printed form of music notation that uses modern musical symbols to indicate the pitches (melodies), rhythms and/or chords of a song or instrumental musical piece. Like its analogs  printed books or pamphlets in English, Arabic or other languages  the medium of sheet music typically is paper (or, in earlier centuries, papyrus or parchment), although the access to musical notation since the 1980s has included the presentation of musical notation on computer screens and the development of scorewriter computer programs that can notate a song or piece electronically, and, in some cases, \\"play back\\" the notated music using a synthesizer or virtual instruments.  - A pianist is an individual musician who plays the piano. Most forms of Western music can make use of the piano. Consequently, pianists have a wide variety of repertoire and styles to choose from, including traditionally classical music, Jazz, blues and all sorts of popular music, including rock music. Most pianists can, to a certain extent, play other keyboard-related instruments such as the synthesizer, harpsichord, celesta and the organ and keyboard. Perhaps the greatest pianist of all time was Franz Liszt, whose piano mastery was described by Anton Rubinstein: \\"In comparison with Liszt, all other pianists are children\\".   - The London Borough of Croydon is a London borough in south London, England and is part of Outer London. It covers an area of and is the largest London borough by population. It is the southernmost borough of London. At its centre is the historic town of Croydon from which the borough takes its name. Croydon is mentioned in the Domesday Book, and from a small market town has expanded into one of the most populous areas on the fringe of London. Croydon is the civic centre of the borough. The borough is now one of London's leading business, financial and cultural centres, and its influence in entertainment and the arts contribute to its status as a major metropolitan centre. Formed in 1965 from the Coulsdon and Purley Urban District and the County Borough of Croydon, the local authority Croydon London Borough Council, is now part of the local government association for Greater London, London Councils. The economic strength of Croydon dates back mainly to Croydon Airport which was a major factor in the development of Croydon as a business centre. Once London's main airport for all international flights to and from the capital, it was closed on 30 September 1959 due to the lack of expansion space needed for an airport to serve the growing city. It is now a Grade II listed building and tourist attraction. Croydon Council and its predecessor Croydon Corporation unsuccessfully applied for city status in 1954, 2000, 2002 and 2012. The area is currently going through a large regeneration project called Croydon Vision 2020 which is predicted to attract more businesses and tourists to the area as well as backing Croydon's bid to become \\"London's Third City\\" (after 'The City' and Westminster). Croydon is mostly urban, though there are large suburban and rural uplands in the south. Since 2003 Croydon has been certified as a Fairtrade borough by the Fairtrade Foundation. It was the first London Borough to have Fairtrade status which is awarded on certain criteria. The area is one of the hearts of culture in London and the...  - Vitaphone was a sound film system used for feature films and nearly 1,000 short subjects made by Warner Bros. and its sister studio First National from 1926 to 1931. Vitaphone was the last major analog sound-on-disc system and the only one which was widely used and commercially successful. The soundtrack was not printed on the film itself, but issued separately on phonograph records. The discs, recorded at  rpm (a speed first used for this system) and typically in diameter, would be played on a turntable physically coupled to the projector motor while the film was being projected. Many early talkies, such as \\"The Jazz Singer\\" (1927), used the Vitaphone system. The name \\"Vitaphone\\" derived from the Latin and Greek words, respectively, for \\"living\\" and \\"sound\\".  - Gladys Louise Smith (April 8, 1892  May 29, 1979), known professionally as Mary Pickford, was a Canadian-American film actress, writer, director, and producer. She was a co-founder of the film studio United Artists and one of the original 36 founders of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.  - The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) is a professional honorary organization with the stated goal of advancing the arts and sciences of motion pictures. The Academy's corporate management and general policies are overseen by a Board of Governors, which includes representatives from each of the craft branches.  - Croydon is a large town in south London, England, the principal settlement of the London Borough of Croydon. It is located south of Charing Cross. It is one of the largest commercial districts outside of Central London, bearing one of the largest shopping districts and a developed night-time economy. It is identified in the London Plan as one of 11 metropolitan centres in Greater London. It has a population of 52,104 in the 2011 census, comprising the Addiscombe, Broad Green and Fairfield wards.  - United Artists (UA) is an American film and television entertainment studio. The studio was founded in 1919 by D. W. Griffith, Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks with the intention of controlling their own interests rather than depending upon commercial studios. The studio was repeatedly bought, sold and restructured over the ensuing century.  - Flora le Breton ( 1899 -- 11 July 1951 , in Brooklyn , New York City ) was an English silent film actress from Croydon , Surrey , England .

Jerry Brown goes along—a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags in supermarkets and other stores, reports the Los Angeles Times. Lawmakers narrowly approved the measure yesterday in the name of reducing litter on streets and beaches. It would apply to supermarkets next July and to convenience and liquor stories the following year. Customers would be able to pay a dime or so for a reusable plastic bag or a paper bag. Brown hasn't taken a position on the ban, which is generally opposed by Republicans as a big-government move that would amount to a tax on shoppers, reports the Wall Street Journal. And while Brown has a long history of supporting green initiatives, this one is no slam dunk given that it's an election year, reports the Sacramento Bee. Some of California's biggest localities, including Los Angeles County and San Francisco, already have such bans in place.","output":"Title: California Set to Create a National First with Statewide Ban on Single-Use Plastic Bags In a landmark decision, California's legislature has approved a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags in supermarkets and other stores, taking a bold step toward reducing litter on streets and beaches. This move is expected to create a significant positive impact on the environment, and if Governor Jerry Brown endorses the initiative, it would become the first of its kind in the United States. However, the ban has attracted opposition from Republicans, arguing that it represents a big-government move and would amount to a tax on shoppers. The bill, which lawmakers narrowly passed, will apply to supermarkets starting from July and will extend to convenience and liquor stores the following year. As part of the scheme, customers will have the option to purchase a reusable plastic bag or a paper bag for a dime (approximately 10 cents). Governor Brown has not yet revealed his stance on the ban. While California is known for its strong environmental conservation initiatives, the approval of the statewide plastic bag ban represents a significant development in the country's battle against plastic pollution. Several counties and cities in California, including Los Angeles County and San Francisco, have already implemented similar bans, resulting in cleaner streets and beaches, reduced waste output and increased demand for eco-friendly alternatives. Opposition to the plastic bag ban is primarily linked to the belief that it imposes unnecessary costs – financial or otherwise – on shoppers, as explained by Republican critics. Additionally, concerns have been raised about the potential role of such a ban in exacerbating income inequality, given that low-income households may bear the brunt of purchasing reusable bags or paper bags. However, proponents of the ban argue that the advantages of reducing plastic waste far outweigh the perceived costs, particularly considering the long-term environmental impact of single-use plastic bags. Despite Governor Brown's history of supporting green initiatives, his position on this particular ban remains uncertain, especially given the ongoing election year. If Brown endorses the ban, its proponents will have overcome a significant hurdle, putting in motion a pioneering initiative that may encourage similar moves elsewhere in the United States. In conclusion, the California Legislature's approval of a statewide ban on single-use plastic bags heralds a groundbreaking step toward achieving a cleaner, greener America. If Governor Brown throws his support behind the initiative, the ban will likely go into effect next year, empowering Californians to adopt more sustainable and environmentally-friendly shopping practices. Furthermore, the ban has the potential to set a precedent for other states and nations, encouraging them to take action against the widespread pollution caused by single-use plastic bags."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Thereafter, during the last 18 years of his life, he gave only some 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the salon. He supported himself by selling his compositions and teaching piano, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with Franz Liszt and was admired by many of his musical contemporaries, including Robert Schumann. In 1835 he obtained French citizenship. After a failed engagement to Maria Wodzińska, from 1837 to 1847 he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer George Sand. A brief and unhappy visit to Majorca with Sand in 1838–39 was one of his most productive periods of composition. In his last years, he was financially supported by his admirer Jane Stirling, who also arranged for him to visit Scotland in 1848. Through most of his life, Chopin suffered from poor health. He died in Paris in 1849, probably of tuberculosis. What was Frédéric's most likely cause of death?","output":"Frédéric Chopin's most likely cause of death was tuberculosis. This conclusion is drawn from the information provided in the article, which states that he died in Paris in 1849, and throughout most of his life, he suffered from poor health.

Check the “About Us” or “Mission Statement” page of their website so you can see what they value and be sure to mention them in your interview so you come across as knowledgeable. If the company doesn't have a website you can check, look on sites like LinkedIn or Glassdoor to see past reviews and employees talk about the company.  Check the company's social media accounts if they have any to see how they interact with others and what types of posts they make. Research competitors for the company you're interviewing with to get a better understanding of the overall industry. As you research the company, check the website to see if they have photos of their employees so you can determine the dress code. If you can't find anything online, call the company's HR department and ask them about their dress code so you can prepare. In most business casual interviews, a buttoned shirt with a tie or a blouse with a jacket will work fine. In a business formal setting, wear a suit or a professional-looking dress. Avoid wearing open-toed shoes, shorts, or revealing clothes to an interview. Be punctual to show the employer that you take the position seriously. Check your route the night before your interview and leave early enough so you can get to the location 10-15 minutes before your interview starts. Once you arrive, let the employer know you've arrived since you may be able to interview at an earlier time. If you have a phone or Skype interview, make sure you're ready and everything is set up 10 minutes in advance so you aren't in a rush. When the employer is ready for the interview, make eye contact with them and smile. Introduce yourself by name, being sure not to interrupt or talk over them. Offer a firm handshake and try not to squeeze too hard or else it will come off as too aggressive. As you shake their hand, you may say, “Hi, I'm Jane Smith. It's a pleasure to meet you.” When you first start, let the employer know you appreciate the time they're giving you for the interview. As you're settling into the interview, you can ask questions about their day so far or how long they've been with the company to show that you're genuinely interested in them. Follow the interviewer's lead in the conversation, so shift from small talk to job-related questions when they do.  For example, you may start off by saying, “How has the week treated you so far?” to interact with them. Small talk works great if you need to walk to a different room for the interview.

Algae that grows on the surface of wood can provide food for certain kinds of fish. Driftwood is a popular choice because of its twisting shape. You can sew carpet moss onto a piece of driftwood to combine wood and plant life, making the tank more resemble a natural underwater habitat. Boil any structure you plan to put in the tank in water before introducing it to your tank. Boiling will sterilize your wood or rock to make it safe for your aquarium. Boiling wood will kill any bacteria on it and remove tannins that can stain the water. Fish will also often hide behind rocks. Rocks have a variety of shapes and colors, so you can look for rocks that you think add to your overall theme. Choose rocks that speak to your sense of style.  Avoid having large rocks directly touch the glass. Over time, the rocks may damage the glass, causing stress fractures or cracks.  After boiling rocks, soak them overnight and then brush them to remove loose particles. These can include the typical castles and pirate treasure, or you can go for something more imaginative. Consider getting a few decorations in different sizes to provide different territories. Like plants, structures give fish hiding places that they enjoy. Some structures can add oxygen to the water. Be very careful when buying decorations with holes or small spaces. While these can be ideal hiding places for smaller fish, larger fish can become stuck and get injured or even die trying to get out. Be sure any hole or archway is significantly larger than your largest fish. If you have young fish, keep in mind their full grown size when picking out such decorations. Experiment with the placement of your decorations to find something that is aesthetically pleasing to you. Having one main decoration that is larger than everything else can provide a good focal point, but also make sure it won't crowd your tank. Balance items with empty space. If one side of your aquarium is going to face a wall, consider attaching a background to it. These simple sheets of plastic can be bought at any pet store, and come printed with beautiful pictures, from undersea plants to deserts. A simple black background will lend a very professional look, hiding cords and tubing and making the colors in your aquarium stand out, especially if you have a lot of plants. If your aquarium is looking a little sparse, a background printed with plants or coral reefs can give the impression of a much lusher environment.  Choose a background that fits your theme. An image of a coral reef suggests a natural space. You could go in the other direction with something like a space-themed background if you want a more unique theme. Measure your tank before going to the store, and buy a piece at least 1\\" longer than your tank to account for uneven edges. When you get home, cut it down to the proper size and tape it to the outside of the back of your aquarium. Summary:","output":"The article talks about how wood and rocks can decorate your fish tank. Wood, like driftwood, can be used to make your tank look like nature, and even add food for some fish. Before putting wood in the tank, it needs to be boiled to get rid of things that can harm the fish or make the water dirty. Rocks can be used too, but they shouldn't touch the glass and need to be cleaned first. There's also other kinds of decorations you can use, but be careful if they have holes that fish might get stuck in. Also, if you have a side of your tank that's going to be next to a wall, you might want to put a background picture on it. This can be a picture of something like plants, a coral reef, or even space - you pick what you like! When you buy a background, make sure it's a little bit bigger than your tank so you can cut it to the right size at home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

A Pennsylvania jury this week ballparked its value at nearly 900,000.      That's how much the Huntingdon County panel decided Steven Hanes, a 54-year-old Mount Union man, should receive in damages because a doctor removed the wrong testicle during an operation in June 2013.      The jury of 11 women and one man reached that verdict against Dr. Valley Spencer Long and the J.C. Blair Memorial Hospital in Huntingdon on Wednesday at the end of a 2 1/2-day civil trial.      Braden R. Lepisto, Hanes' lawyer, said Thursday that the verdict appears to be the first monetary award to be granted by a jury in a medical malpractice case in Huntingdon County in more than 25 years.      The big question here is: How could something like this happen?      \\"That was my thought when we first got this case,\\" said Lepisto, of the Philadelphia law firm Kline & Specter. \\"We just felt the evidence was so obvious.\\"      Hanes claimed in his suit that he went to Long, a urologist, because he was experiencing chronic pain in his right testicle. Although other, less invasive procedures were options, Long recommended surgery, Lepisto said.      In the operating room, Long removed Hanes' healthy left testicle while leaving the damaged right one in place, Hanes' suit states. Hanes claimed the doctor was \\"reckless\\" in failing to properly identify the testicle that was supposed to be removed.      Court filings show Long wrote in a post-operative report that \\"it appeared that the left testicle and cord may actually have been removed instead of the right one.\\" Hanes claimed Long told him as much during a follow-up visit.      \\"The conduct of the doctor during the surgery indicated he had no idea which testicle he was removing,\\" Lepisto said.      \\"Steve had the right testicle pain for 15 years before he went to see Dr. Long. He wanted to relieve the pain,\\" Lepisto added. \\"Four years later Steve continues to have the pain. He's had more frequent pain.\\"      He added that Hanes now has a \\"debilitating fear\\" of having the ailment treated because of what happened. Lepisto said that if the problem right testicle does eventually have to be removed, Hanes would have to undergo testosterone replacement therapy for the rest of his life.      He noted that his firm is pursuing another pending malpractice case over a patient who died under Long's care. The doctor, now 77, is no longer performing surgeries, Lepisto said.      In rendering its verdict against Long and the hospital, the jury awarded Hanes 620,000 in damages for pain and suffering and 250,000 in punitive damages against Long for \\"reckless indifference.\\"      The verdict can be appealed. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy) arrives in Nuremberg in 1948 to preside over the trial of four Nazi judges, each charged with having abused the court system to help cleanse Germany of the politically and socially undesirable, allegedly guilty of war crimes. The opening statement of the prosecuting attorney (Richard Widmark) is a vicious one, depicting the defendants as having been willing, evil, accomplices in Nazi atrocities, but Judge Haywood wonders if it is really that simple.Confounded at how one defendant, a renowned German champion of justice named Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), appears to have played the greatest role in molding Germany's Ministry of Justice into a destructive instrument of Nazism, Judge Haywood resolves to gain some perspective on the period in which the German legal system strayed from a course of entirely objective justice.Probing for the truth proves difficult, though, as nobody who lived in Germany during Nazism seems to admit to having much inside knowledge. He befriends Mrs. Bertholt (Marlene Dietrich), the widow of an executed Nazi army officer, but she offers few insights, more consumed by her personal experiences than the broader matters of Nazism. Mrs. Bertholt is focusing on being a catalyst for the cultural rebirth of Nuremberg, keen on remolding the image of a city that had become notorious as the site of the Nazi raliies. An attempt to discuss the period with his housekeepers, Mr. and Mrs. Halbestadt, who had lived near the Dachau concentration camp, proves equally fruitless for Judge Haywood, as they cannot help but focus on the loss of their child in the bombing and the fact that they nearly starved from poverty. Whether anyone knew anything mattered little, for Germans were looking forward, not backward, still grappling with, and recovering from, the hardships and losses that the war brought to them and their families.Only in the courtroom will Judge Haywood have the opportunity to gain insights into the realities of the period. First hand evidence of a) all... Answer:","output":"\\"Justice in the Shadows: The Nuremberg Trials\\" The film \\"Justice in the Shadows: The Nuremberg Trials\\" follows the story of Judge Dan Haywood (Spencer Tracy), who is tasked with presiding over the trial of four Nazi judges accused of war crimes in the aftermath of World War II. Set in 1948 Nuremberg, the film delves into the complexities of the German justice system and society during the Nazi era. The defendants, led by enigmatic Ernst Janning (Burt Lancaster), a once highly-regarded German champion of justice, stand accused of transforming the Ministry of Justice into a weapon of the Nazi regime. Prosecuting attorney (Richard Widmark) delivers a scathing opening statement, painting the accused as willing and eager participants in the atrocities committed during the Holocaust. However, Judge Haywood is not convinced that assigning blame is quite so simple. The movie portrays the judge's quest to uncover the truth behind the actions of these Nazi judges and the nation that supported them. As he delves deeper into the matter, he discovers that the people he encounters, including the widow of a Nazi officer and his own housekeepers, are consumed by their personal experiences and loss. Germany, it seems, is busy trying to rebuild and move forward in the aftermath of World War II and is reluctant to dwell on the past. The courtroom becomes the central stage where Judge Haywood attempts to gain a greater understanding of the Nazi era. Through witness statements and firsthand accounts, he faces the harsh reality of the complex period in history that led to the events in question. As the trial progresses, the judge grapples with the moral dilemma of determining guilt and administering justice in the face of overwhelming horror and tragedy that had befallen Germany. \\"Justice in the Shadows: The Nuremberg Trials\\" is a thought-provoking and poignant examination of post-war Germany and the unenviable task of seeking justice for the unspeakable crimes committed during the Holocaust. As the line between right and wrong becomes blurred, the film questions the nature of justice itself and how it can be achieved in an era where humanity failed so remarkably. The movie's title emphasizes the uneasy and complex nature of seeking justice in the aftermath of such darkness, with the shadows of the past looming large over those tasked with prosecuting and judging the accused."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Next question: who is the actor in the allstate insurance commercials?","output":"The actor in the Allstate Insurance commercials is Dennis Haysbert. Dennis Dexter Haysbert was born on June 2, 1954 in San Mateo, California. He has built a notable career as an American actor and voice actor, but is distinctive for his deep, authoritative voice which easily stands out. This has also played a crucial part in securing his position as the representative figure of Allstate Insurance in commercials since 2003. His career began in the 1970s, but hit its peak in the 2000s. Over his career, he has appeared in a variety of roles spanning film, television, and video games. However, his most famous roles are probably on the small screen, especially in the popular Fox series “24” where he played the groundbreaking role of David Palmer, the first African American president of the United States. He also featured in CBS’s military drama, “The Unit,” where he played Sergeant Major Jonas Blane. In film, he has made significant marks in several projects such as his role as Pedro Cerrano in the Major League series, and his supporting role in the critically acclaimed film Far From Heaven. As a voice actor, Haysbert worked on multiple projects, most notably in animated films like “Wreck-It Ralph”, “Kung Fu Panda 2”, and “Sinbad: Legend of The Seven Seas”. Moreover, his distinctive, resonant voice has also lent itself to video games, particularly in “Call of Duty: Finest Hour” and “Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow”. Dennis Haysbert, with his prominent presence and distinct voice, has become synonymous with Allstate Insurance commercials for nearly two decades now. You might remember the commercials - they often feature Haysbert in different situations explaining various aspects of the insurance offerings, with his deep, calming voice echoing the company's well-known slogan, “You’re in good hands with Allstate”. Hence, it could be said that Dennis Haysbert's charismatic and comforting persona has played a significant role in the brand identity and the overall success of the Allstate Insurance company's marketing campaigns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Qualcomm Stadium is San Diego's largest football stadium","output":"Yes, we may infer that Qualcomm Stadium, which is now renamed to SDCCU Stadium (San Diego County Credit Union Stadium), is San Diego's largest football stadium, having been the primary venue for numerous events and sports over the years. The Holiday Bowl, being a prominent annual NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision college football bowl game since 1978, has been held at this stadium, further suggesting its capacity and importance within San Diego for hosting major sporting events. Just as the Holiday Bowl features a matchup of Pac-12 and Big Ten teams since the 2014 edition, SDCCU Stadium has played host to a wide variety of other sporting, entertainment, and cultural events over the years. Originally opened in 1967 as San Diego Stadium, it was later renamed Jack Murphy Stadium in 1981, before adopting its current name SDCCU Stadium in 2017. Its seating capacity of around 70,000 spectators makes it the largest football stadium in San Diego. Throughout its history, SDCCU Stadium has been home to numerous sports franchises, including the former NFL team San Diego Chargers (now the Los Angeles Chargers), the MLB team San Diego Padres, and the Major League Soccer expansion team San Diego Loyal SC. Furthermore, it has hosted numerous college football events, such as the San Diego State University Aztecs' home games, the San Diego County Credit Union Poinsettia Bowl, and of course, the Holiday Bowl. Apart from sports, SDCCU Stadium has served as a venue for major concerts, international soccer matches, Supercross, Monster Jam, exhibitions, and religious events, further asserting its status as San Diego's largest and arguably most versatile football stadium. So in conclusion, given the history and relevance of SDCCU Stadium as a host for the Holiday Bowl and many other notable events over the years, it is safe to infer that it is indeed San Diego's largest football stadium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The clerk, a friendly man with a winning smile, looked at the couple and explained that there were three conventions in town.\\"All of our rooms are taken,\\" the clerk said.\\"But I can't send a nice couple like you out into the rain at one o'clock in the morning.

Tchaikovsky remained abroad for a year after the disintegration of his marriage. During this time, he completed Eugene Onegin, orchestrated his Fourth Symphony, and composed the Violin Concerto. He returned briefly to the Moscow Conservatory in the autumn of 1879. For the next few years, assured of a regular income from von Meck, he traveled incessantly throughout Europe and rural Russia, mainly alone, and avoided social contact whenever possible. During this time, Tchaikovsky's foreign reputation grew and a positive reassessment of his music also took place in Russia, thanks in part to Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky's call for \\"universal unity\\" with the West at the unveiling of the Pushkin Monument in Moscow in 1880. Before Dostoyevsky's speech, Tchaikovsky's music had been considered \\"overly dependent on the West\\". As Dostoyevsky's message spread throughout Russia, this stigma toward Tchaikovsky's music evaporated. An unprecedented acclaim for him even drew a cult following among the young intelligentsia of Saint Petersburg, including Alexandre Benois, Léon Bakst and Sergei Diaghilev.Two musical works from this period stand out. With the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour nearing completion in Moscow in 1880, the 25th anniversary of the coronation of Alexander II in 1881, and the 1882 Moscow Arts and Industry Exhibition in the planning stage, Nikolai Rubinstein suggested that Tchaikovsky compose a grand commemorative piece. Tchaikovsky agreed and finished it within six weeks. He wrote to Nadezhda von Meck that this piece, the 1812 Overture, would be \\"very loud and noisy, but I wrote it with no warm feeling of love, and therefore there will probably be no artistic merits in it\\". He also warned conductor Eduard Nápravník that \\"I shan't be at all surprised and offended if you find that it is in a style unsuitable for symphony concerts\\".

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Twenty first century is seeing an explosion of artificial island building. Many countries are building islands in the middle of seas and oceans, which they often use for tourism or for defensive purposes. For example, UAE had build several islands in the Persian Gulf. To build those islands they had to ask Oman and Qatar to export sand to them. Qatar declined to export sand, but Oman agreed. Oman in turn had to mine huge quantity of sand in their own country.  As a result of sand mining, Would Qatar's fisheries earn more money or less money than Oman's fisheries?  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"As a result of sand mining, it is likely that Qatar's fisheries would earn more money than Oman's fisheries. This is because sand mining has several negative impacts on the environment and local wildlife, which can lead to the decline of fish populations and other marine life. When Oman agreed to export sand to UAE, they had to mine a significant amount of sand from their own country. This sand mining can cause erosion, destruction of natural habitats, and disturbance of underwater ecosystems. The increased turbidity in the water due to sand mining can be harmful to organisms like coral that need sunlight to survive. As a result, the overall health and productivity of the marine environment may be compromised, leading to a decline in fish populations. On the other hand, Qatar declined to export sand, meaning that their coastal and underwater ecosystems would likely be less disturbed and more stable. This allows for a healthier marine environment, which in turn supports thriving fish populations. Consequently, Qatar's fisheries could potentially earn more money than Oman's fisheries, which may be negatively affected by the environmental consequences of sand mining. Of course, there are many complex factors that contribute to the success of a country's fisheries—including economic policies, fishery management strategies, and global market trends. However, based purely on the environmental impacts of sand mining on marine ecosystems, Qatar's decision not to export sand may provide an advantage for their fisheries over Oman's fisheries."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The Battle of Rio de Janeiro was a battle in 1558 on the French town at Rio de Janeiro, called Henriville. The Portuguese, though in far smaller numbers, defeated the French and made them flee to the jungle. The French town was then burnt by Mem de Sá, the Portuguese governor. Can we draw the following conclusion? The armies arrived by boat.","output":"Step 1: Analyze the information provided. We are given information about the Battle of Rio de Janeiro and its outcome. Mem de Sá, the Portuguese governor, burnt down the French town. However, there is no direct mention of how the armies arrived at the battle location. Step 2: Evaluate the context. During the 16th century, cities and settlements were often constructed near water for transportation purposes. Rio de Janeiro is located on the coast of Brazil and has various water bodies around it, such as the Atlantic Ocean and Guanabara Bay. Step 3: Consider historical context. In the mid-1500s, maritime navigation was the primary means of long-distance travel and transportation. Both France and Portugal were seafaring nations with a strong presence in the Atlantic Ocean, and it was common for them to transport troops and supplies via sea routes. Step 4: Evaluate based on the context and historical background. Given the location of Rio de Janeiro and the prevalent mode of transportation during the 16th century, it is plausible that the armies arrived by boat. Conclusion: While there is not explicit information from the provided text about armies arriving by boat, considering the geographic context and the historical period, we can infer that it is likely that the armies arrived at the battle location via boats.

The couples accused Houston-based Cabot of negligently drilling two natural gas wells near their Susquehanna County homes, contaminating their wells with high levels of methane. Cabot maintains the methane is naturally occurring.      “Oh my God! They heard! They heard!” said a tearful Leslie Lewis, attorney for the Elys and Huberts, as she hugged a supporter after exiting the courtroom at the federal courthouse in Scranton.      The jury of four men and four women deliberated for 8½ hours over two days before awarding Mr. and Mrs. Ely 2.6 million and their three minor children 50,000 each. The jury awarded Mr. and Mrs. Hubert 1.4 million, while another family member was awarded 50,000.      An attorney for Cabot immediately vowed to appeal, advising U.S. Magistrate Judge Martin Carlson the company will file a motion asking him to set aside the verdict and/or grant a new trial based on Ms. Lewis’ conduct during the trial.      Attorney Jeremy Mercer said Ms. Lewis repeatedly referenced evidence that had been excluded and made comments that implied Cabot was “hiding something.”      Judge Carlson interrupted her three times during her closing argument, admonishing her for making improper statements, he said, and that unfairly influenced the jury against the energy company.      “Without plaintiffs’ counsel’s conduct, the evidence in this case did not allow for a jury to reach the verdict it did,” Mr. Mercer said.      Ms. Lewis defended her actions. She said she was just being a zealous advocate for her clients.      “I know my conduct was appropriate,” she said following the trial. “My job as an attorney and advocate for these folks is to push the envelope.”      The Elys hugged and spoke with the jurors as they left the courthouse. None of the jurors spoke with media.      Cabot ‘surprised’      At trial, Ms. Lewis argued Cabot rushed to drill to capitalize on the natural gas boom. That resulted in defective wells that allowed methane to leak and migrate to the Elys’ and Huberts’ wells.      Cabot’s attorneys argued the evidence was woefully lacking. They noted the Elys and Huberts first noticed problems with their well water in the summer of 2008. Cabot did not start to drill the wells until Sept. 25, 2008. Cabot also argued the couples failed to provide any evidence to show a pathway existed underground for the gas to reach their wells.      “Cabot is surprised at the jury’s verdict given the lack of evidence provided by plaintiffs,” George Stark,spokesman for Cabot, said in a prepared statement. “The verdict disregards overwhelming scientific and factual evidence that Cabot acted as a prudent operator in conducting its operations.”      Speaking after the trial, Ms. Lewis said she was concerned the Elys and Huberts would lose as several pre-trial rulings severely limited the evidence she could present.      The first blow came in January, when U.S. District Judge John Jones dismissed their claims for breach of contract, fraud and personal injury, finding insufficient evidence.      Ms. Lewis suffered several other setbacks. Judge Carlson, who presided over the trial, precluded her from presenting more than 300 exhibits because she did not provide them to the defense until a few weeks before trial. On Monday, Judge Carlson ruled the Elys could not recoup damages for a loss in property value because they did not present any reports that showed the value of their home prior to and after the contamination occurred.      The only claim that remained at trial was for “private nuisance.” To prevail on a nuisance claim, the couples had to prove Cabot’s negligence in drilling caused their water problems and that the conduct caused them significant discomfort and inconvenience.      “I had a very poor forecast for these plaintiffs,” Ms. Lewis said as she stood with her clients outside the courthouse. “I had to convince all eight jurors on the limited evidence I was going to be able to put forth.”      Ely: Not about money      As his eyes welled with tears, Mr. Ely said he was determined to see the case through, no matter what.      “It wasn’t about the money,” Mr. Ely said. “They did something wrong. We were voicing ourselves and standing up for our rights. We walked into that courtroom with our heads high. No matter what happened, I was going to walk out of the courtroom with my head high.”      The Elys and Huberts were among 44 Dimock Twp. residents who sued Cabot in 2009. The company settled that suit with 40 of the plaintiffs in 2012, but the Elys and Huberts rejected the deal. Their attorney withdrew from the case after the settlement. The two couples represented themselves for years before Ms. Lewis took the case.      “This was not an easy trip,” Mr. Ely said. “There were a lot of ups and downs and a lot of things we had to tackle. It was quite the battle but, as you heard today, we are at the end.”      Ms. Lewis said she worked on the case for more than a year and has “not received a dime” so far. She took the case on a contingency basis, knowing that meant she would not get paid if Cabot prevailed. She said she promised the Elys and Huberts she’d stick with them.      “We started this. I’m going to finish it with you, whatever comes out with respect to money,” she said.      Whether or not the verdict will stand remains to be seen. Ms. Lewis said she anticipates an appeal.      “Do I feel confident? Based on what’s gone down over the past 6½ years, I don’t know,” she said.      “At this point in time there could not have been a better outcome. The entire community should applaud themselves, the Elys and Huberts for standing up and saying ... enough is enough.”      Contact the writer: tbesecker@timesshamrock.com, @tbeseckerTT on Twitter ||||| SCRANTON, Pa. — A federal jury on Thursday found Cabot Oil and Gas Corp. responsible for contaminating two Susquehanna County water wells through its natural gas drilling operations and awarded the families a total of 4.24 million.      The Ely and Hubert families of Dimock Township were the last plaintiffs in a high-profile case that began in 2009 and originally included 44 of the rural town’s residents who claimed shoddy Cabot wells drilled early in the Marcellus Shale gas boom allowed methane and other constituents to migrate into their drinking water.      Cabot maintains that anything tainting the water supplies is there naturally or comes from sources other than its operations.      The jury awarded Nolen Scott Ely and Monica Marta-Ely each 1.3 million, plus 50,000 for each of their three children. The jury awarded Ray and Victoria Hubert each 720,000, plus 50,000 for their daughter.      The trial in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania had started on Feb. 22 and stretched into a third week. The jury of four men and four women deliberated for about eight hours on Wednesday afternoon and Thursday morning before reaching its verdict that Cabot was negligent in drilling two of its early wells and created a nuisance by contaminating the families’ water wells.      In a statement, Texas-based Cabot said it is surprised by the verdict because the plaintiffs lacked evidence to support their nuisance claims.      “The verdict disregards overwhelming scientific and factual evidence that Cabot acted as a prudent operator in conducting its operations,” the company said.      Cabot’s attorneys indicated in court on Thursday that they will move to set aside the verdict because they said the plaintiffs’ attorney repeatedly mentioned excluded evidence and acted in other ways that prejudiced the jury against the company.      Cabot’s attorney Jeremy Mercer described it as a calculated effort “to throw skunks into the jury box.”      The families’ attorney Leslie Lewis rebutted that charge as she stood outside the courthouse, embracing the tearful plaintiffs and their supporters.      The jury “really listened,” she said. “Nothing untoward occurred with the presentation of the case. They followed the truth, they followed the facts.”      Mr. Ely referred to the size and sophistication of Cabot’s legal team as he reflected on his years-long pursuit that included periods when he represented himself after most of the original plaintiffs settled in 2012.      “There were six Goliaths in there,” he said, “and all I had was just a little pea stone.”      A state investigation that began in 2009 concluded that Cabot was responsible for contaminating 18 Dimock water supplies with high levels of methane and metals. Residents had complained of brown, fetid water that was so full of gas it would cause a lit match to burst into flame.      That drew the attention of federal regulators, the international press, celebrities, filmmakers and anti-fracking activists to the tiny community, which was described as a cautionary tale for other regions hoping to capitalize on advanced but invasive extraction technologies to release oil and gas from stubborn shale formations.      The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection barred Cabot from drilling new wells in a 9-square-mile section of the township in April 2010.      The prohibition still stands because regulators say the company has not yet met the terms of an agreement that requires Cabot to eliminate gas leaks from its wells and reduce methane concentrations in the affected water supplies to consistently low levels. The company also paid 4.6 million as part of the state settlement.      Much of the evidence the state used to justify those penalties was excluded from the Ely and Hubert case through pretrial rulings.      Laura Legere: llegere@post-gazette.com.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Though the two sentences have similarities and discuss the same entity, the \\"Panthera tigris sudanensis,\\" they are not perfect paraphrases of each other as they convey different levels of recognition and certainty regarding the subspecies. The first sentence asserts that the Panthera tigris sudanensis is a supposed subspecies of tiger, implying that there is debate or speculation and it is not universally accepted as a distinct subspecies. By saying \\"not scientifically recognised,\\" it suggests either there is insufficient evidence or research supporting this subdivision or the scientific community does not acknowledge it as such. The second sentence, in contrast, claims that Panthera tigris sudanensis is a recognised subspecies of tiger, which directly contradicts the first sentence's assertion that it isn't. However, it then says that it's \\"not scientifically claimed,\\" which is unclear but could mean that while it's recognised as a subspecies, that recognition isn't based on scientific evidence or consensus. This seems contradictory and makes the exact meaning of the sentence hard to decipher. Both sentences agree that this supposedly African tiger is \\"alleged,\\" implying there's uncertainty or lack of concrete facts to support that it lives in Africa. In summary, while the sentences share a main subject and theme, the differences in the recognition status of Panthera tigris sudanensis and the degree of certainty expressed mean they do not paraphrase each other closely.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - West Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is an inland and in relative terms upland county having eastward-draining valleys while taking in moors of the Pennines and has a population of 2.2 million. West Yorkshire came into existence as a metropolitan county in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972.  - North Yorkshire is a non-metropolitan county (or shire county) and larger ceremonial county in England. It is located primarily in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber but partly in the region of North East England.  - In geography, a confluence is the meeting of two or more bodies of water. Also known as a \\"conflux\\", it refers either to the point where a tributary joins a larger river, (main stem), or where two streams meet to become the source of a river of a new name, such as the confluence of the Monongahela and Allegheny rivers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania creating the Ohio River.  - York is a historic walled city at the confluence of the rivers Ouse and Foss in North Yorkshire, England. The municipality is the traditional county town of Yorkshire to which it gives its name. The city has a rich heritage and has provided the backdrop to major political events in England throughout much of its two millennia of existence. The city offers a wealth of historic attractions, of which York Minster is the most prominent, and a variety of cultural and sporting activities making it a popular tourist destination for millions.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - Yorkshire (or ; abbreviated Yorks), formally known as the County of York, is a historic county of Northern England and the largest in the United Kingdom. Due to its great size in comparison to other English counties, functions have been undertaken over time by its subdivisions, which have also been subject to periodic reform. Throughout these changes, Yorkshire has continued to be recognised as a geographical territory and cultural region. The name is familiar and well understood across the United Kingdom and is in common use in the media and the military, and also features in the titles of current areas of civil administration such as North Yorkshire, South Yorkshire, West Yorkshire and East Riding of Yorkshire.  - A shire is a traditional term for a division of land, found in the United Kingdom and Australia. It was first used in Wessex from the beginning of Anglo-Saxon settlement, and spread to most of the rest of England in the tenth century.  - South Yorkshire is a metropolitan county in England. It is the southernmost county in the Yorkshire and the Humber region and had a population of 1.34 million in 2011. It has an area of and consists of four metropolitan boroughs, Barnsley, Doncaster, Rotherham and Sheffield. South Yorkshire was created on 1 April 1974 as a result of the Local Government Act 1972 with Barnsley as its county town.  - Scandinavian York ( also referred to as Jórvík ) or Danish / Norwegian York is a term used by historians for the south of Northumbria ( modern day Yorkshire ) during the period of the late 9th century and first half of the 10th century , when it was dominated by Norse warrior - kings ; in particular , used to refer to the city ( York ) controlled by these kings . Norse monarchy controlled varying amounts of Northumbria from 875 to 954 , however the area was invaded and conquered for short periods by England between 927 and 954 before eventually being annexed into England in 954 . It was closely associated with the much longer - lived Kingdom of Dublin throughout this period .  - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - The Cathedral and Metropolitical Church of Saint Peter in York, commonly known as York Minster, is the cathedral of York, England, and is one of the largest of its kind in Northern Europe. The minster is the seat of the Archbishop of York, the second-highest office of the Church of England, and is the mother church for the Diocese of York and the Province of York. It is run by a dean and chapter, under the Dean of York. The title \\"minster\\" is attributed to churches established in the Anglo-Saxon period as missionary teaching churches, and serves now as an honorific title. Services in the minster are sometimes regarded as on the High Church or Anglo-Catholic end of the Anglican continuum.  - The East Riding of Yorkshire, or simply East Yorkshire, is a ceremonial county of England. It is located in the region of Yorkshire and the Humber. The East Riding of Yorkshire may also refer to a local government district with unitary authority status, which does not include the city of Kingston upon Hull, the largest settlement in the ceremonial county, which is a separate unitary authority. The modern East Riding of Yorkshire (both ceremonial county and unitary authority), was formed in 1996 from the northern part of the non-metropolitan county of Humberside.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.

Two teams of researches studied Antarctica's climate. The team studied two different regions. The US team studied East Antarctica, while the Swiss team studied West Antarctica.  Which team didn't learn about a region that doesn't show signs of appreciable melting despite the large amount of surface warming?  Hint: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Answer:","output":"The Swiss team didn't learn about a region that doesn't show signs of appreciable melting despite the large amount of surface warming. The Swiss team studied West Antarctica, which has been experiencing stronger warming, especially in winter and spring. However, the surface warming in West Antarctica hasn't led to significant melting at the surface or directly affected the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. In contrast, East Antarctica studied by the US team has experienced some autumn cooling, and thus, shows less signs of surface melting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which friend experienced more weather fronts?  Joe lived in East Antarctica while his buddy Jim lived in West Antarctica. They were both into collecting rare specimens of plants and wildlife.  They would often complain about the weather.  Hint: East Antarctica is colder than its western counterpart because of its higher elevation. Weather fronts rarely penetrate far into the continent, leaving the centre cold and dry. Despite the lack of precipitation over the central portion of the continent, ice there lasts for extended periods. Heavy snowfalls are common on the coastal portion of the continent, where snowfalls of up to 1.22 metres (48 in) in 48 hours have been recorded.

The ambiance was lovely: it's on the first floor of the old Firehouse Lounge, where Embury used to be, and although it's dimly lit and has kept some of that cozy Prohibition-era atmosphere, it also feels more open and  airy than I remember Embury being. A number fun little abstract paintings add some color to the place.  They have a great cocktail menu (and a NICE whiskey selection). The chef's selection meat & cheese plate was a perfect appetizer for a group of our size to share, and I also highly recommend the the bacon-wrapped dates with manchego cheese. All except for one of us ended up ordering the winter salad (w/ kale, dried cherries, and some type of wheat berry-like grain), and it did not disappoint.  The only reason this place does not get five stars from me is the price, which I feel is a bit prohibitive for someone of my current graduate school income level, at 10-12 a drink.

Article: A comprehensive business plan keeps you organized as you set up your ISP. In a good business plan, you describe your goals as an ISP, how you will provide service to customers, and how much you will charge for it. Also, describe how much money you need to start, how many employees you will hire, and how you will deal with problems like maintenance issues.  You need a good plan if you intend on selling your service as an ISP. While you don’t need it for a private service, having a plan is still useful. Banks look for good business plans when giving out loans. Since becoming an ISP is expensive, have a good plan to secure funding. Every country in the world has its own unique rules determining how ISPs operate. States and cities may also create their own guidelines, so be sure to visit the closest government office for advice. In many places, you can set up your own ISP without much legal trouble. Keep in mind that national ISPs operate in most areas. In some countries,  you may not even be allowed to set up a new ISP business. Submit your licensing application to your government’s business office. Get the application on your government’s website or by visiting them in person. You will need to list your business’ name, what it does, and how it operates. Then, wait 1 to 2 months to receive your license in the mail. You do not need to get a business license if you aren’t selling your service to customers. Chances are no one will bother you if you set up a service only for you and people you know. your Internet service to potential customers. Most people already have an ISP. To compete with existing businesses, begin advertising. Purchase ads on local TV, buy ad space in newspapers and magazines, and send flyers to customers near your relay towers. Also, go door to door to explain what your service has to offer. Expect people to stick with their old ISP. Even if they aren’t happy with their ISP, they may not feel motivated enough to make a change. Focus on the customers you have to grow your business. Refer to your customer management program to keep tabs on your service. Cables and other equipment wear out over time. Sometimes components get damaged from bad weather, animals, or other accidents. Make repairs and buy new equipment as needed to keep your business profitable. If you have a good network tracking system, it will show you when something goes wrong with your network.

Which brother studied more about rising temperatures influencing mantle melting?  Two brothers Syd and Dan went to college. Syd studied plate tectonics and mantle melting. His brother Dan got to study types of soil and pedology.  Hint: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

I measured the area in my kitchen, but the stove didn't fit because the","output":"measurements were off. The detailed explanation of the sentence would be as follows: The statement is part of a situation where the speaker is trying to fit a stove in their kitchen. The person already measured the area available in their kitchen. The measuring of the kitchen area could involve determining the length, width, and possibly the height of the space to ensure that the stove would fit. This is an important step when installing a new appliance in an existing kitchen design to minimize potential fitting problems. However, in this case, the person encountered a problem. Despite their previous measurement, the stove did not fit in their kitchen. The last part of the statement, 'because the measurements were off,' provides the reason for this problem. The term 'measurements were off' means that there were some inaccuracies or errors in the original measurements taken. Perhaps they were not precise in their calculations, or possibly a miscalculation occurred during the process. It could be that they forgot to take into account certain fixed features that might obstruct the placement of the stove. For example, cabinets, counters, or backsplash areas could impede the full space needed to accommodate the stove. They might have also misread the manufacturer's specifications of the stove's dimensions, resulting in the oversight. This situation exemplifies why it is crucial to double-check all measurements when installing new appliances or furniture. Error in dimensions, even a small one, can lead to unexpected complications. It could result in spatial incongruencies, causing the appliance or furniture not to fit or look out of place within the room layout. Therefore, ensure measurements are carefully done, considering all possible obstructions, and correctly interpreted to prevent such mishaps.  Now, in this case, the person might need to consider various solutions to rectify the problem. They might need to use a smaller stove, adjust the existing kitchen arrangement, or modify the furniture or design elements that are obstructing the stove's proper installation. Careful consideration would be necessary to choose a solution that strikes a balance between maintaining the kitchen's functionality and aesthetic qualities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - In computing, a line number is a method used to specify a particular sequence of characters in a text file. The most common method of assigning numbers to lines is to assign every line a unique number, starting at 1 for the first line, and incrementing by 1 for each successive line.   - Machine code or machine language is a set of instructions executed directly by a computer's central processing unit (CPU). Each instruction performs a very specific task, such as a load, a jump, or an ALU operation on a unit of data in a CPU register or memory. Every program directly executed by a CPU is made up of a series of such instructions.  - In computer science, a preprocessor is a program that processes its input data to produce output that is used as input to another program. The output is said to be a preprocessed form of the input data, which is often used by some subsequent programs like compilers. The amount and kind of processing done depends on the nature of the preprocessor; some preprocessors are only capable of performing relatively simple textual substitutions and macro expansions, while others have the power of full-fledged programming languages.  - Ratfor (short for \\"Rational Fortran\\") is a programming language implemented as a preprocessor for Fortran 66. It provided modern control structures, unavailable in Fortran 66, to replace GOTOs and statement numbers.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.  - Goto (goto, GOTO, GO TO or other case combinations, depending on the programming language) is a statement found in many computer programming languages. It performs a one-way transfer of control to another line of code; in contrast a function call normally returns control. The jumped-to locations are usually identified using labels, though some languages use line numbers. At the machine code level, a goto is a form of branch or jump statement. Many languages support the goto statement, and many do not (see language support).  - A compiler is a computer program (or a set of programs) that transforms source code written in a programming language (the source language) into another computer language (the target language), with the latter often having a binary form known as object code. The most common reason for converting source code is to create an executable program.  - Crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in the crystalline solids (see crystal structure). The word \\"crystallography\\" derives from the Greek words \\"crystallon\\" \\"cold drop, frozen drop\\", with its meaning extending to all solids with some degree of transparency, and \\"grapho\\" \\"I write\\". In July 2012, the United Nations recognised the importance of the science of crystallography by proclaiming that 2014 would be the International Year of Crystallography. X-ray crystallography is used to determine the structure of large biomolecules such as proteins.  Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of crystals was based on physical measurements of their geometry. This involved measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to each other and to theoretical reference axes (crystallographic axes), and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question. This physical measurement is carried out using a goniometer. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net such as a Wulff net or Lambert net. The pole to each face is plotted on the net. Each point is labelled with its Miller index. The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established.  - Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics that uses numerical analysis and data structures to solve and analyze problems that involve fluid flows. Computers are used to perform the calculations required to simulate the interaction of liquids and gases with surfaces defined by boundary conditions. With high-speed supercomputers, better solutions can be achieved. Ongoing research yields software that improves the accuracy and speed of complex simulation scenarios such as transonic or turbulent flows. Initial experimental validation of such software is performed using a wind tunnel with the final validation coming in full-scale testing, e.g. flight tests.  - A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.  - Computational physics is the study and implementation of numerical analysis to solve problems in physics for which a quantitative theory already exists. Historically, computational physics was the first application of modern computers in science, and is now a subset of computational science.  - Fortran (formerly FORTRAN, derived from \\"Formula Translation\\") is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications, Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continuous use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers.  - Computational chemistry is a branch of chemistry that uses computer simulation to assist in solving chemical problems. It uses methods of theoretical chemistry, incorporated into efficient computer programs, to calculate the structures and properties of molecules and solids. It is necessary because, apart from relatively recent results concerning the hydrogen molecular ion (dihydrogen cation, see references therein for more details), the quantum many-body problem cannot be solved analytically, much less in closed form. While computational results normally complement the information obtained by chemical experiments, it can in some cases predict hitherto unobserved chemical phenomena. It is widely used in the design of new drugs and materials.  - Numerical weather prediction (NWP) uses mathematical models of the atmosphere and oceans to predict the weather based on current weather conditions. Though first attempted in the 1920s, it was not until the advent of computer simulation in the 1950s that numerical weather predictions produced realistic results. A number of global and regional forecast models are run in different countries worldwide, using current weather observations relayed from radiosondes, weather satellites and other observing systems as inputs.  - Ratfiv is an enhanced version of the Ratfor programming language , a preprocessor for Fortran designed to give it C - like capabilities . Fortran was widely used for scientific programming but had very basic control - flow primitives ( \`\` do '' and \`\` goto '' ) and no \`\` macro '' facility which limited its expressiveness . The name of the language is a pun ( Ratfor ( RATional FORtran ) - > \`\` Rat Four '' - > \`\` Rat Five '' - > RatFiv ) . Ratfiv was developed by Bill Wood at the Institute for Cancer Research , Philadelphia , PA in the early 1980s and released on several DECUS ( Digital Equipment Users Group ) SIG ( Special Interest Group ) tapes . It is based on the original Ratfor by B. Kernighan and P. J. Plauger , with rewrites and enhancements by David Hanson and friends ( U. of Arizona ) , Joe Sventek and Debbie Scherrer ( Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory ) .

She lived in New York and enjoyed doing gymnastics and playing soccer. One day, Hannah came home from school and her parents greeted her. She knew that something was different by the expressions on their faces. Even Jackson, Hannah's dog, was acting different. Hannah asked why everyone was being so strange. Hannah's father, who was known as Pop, explained to Hannah that his job was forcing him to move. Hannah did not seem to think this was too big of a deal. Then, Hannah's mother explained that they were moving to Kenya. Kenya, she explained, was a place in Africa and life would be very different there. As Hannah began to cry thinking about all of her friends at home, Hannah's mother calmed her with a gentle touch. Jackson began howling as Hannah cried, but was also calmed by Hannah's mother. Hannah spent the next two weeks visiting her friends and saying her goodbyes. She did not know the next time she would be home. She cried very hard when she said goodbye to her best friend, Susan.

Cynthia handed a nine iron to Jessica as","output":"Jessica stood nervously by the golf cart. Jessica had never even held a club before, let alone played a full round of golf. But today, the sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the greens beckoned to her with their verdant charm. What's more, she was eager to share the experience with her long-time friend, Cynthia, who was seasoned with years of golf prowess under her belt. Cynthia grinned at Jessica's obvious uncertainty. \\"Don't worry, Jess, just relax. I'll show you the ropes, and we'll have a great time.\\" Jessica attempted a smile and gripped the nine iron tightly. It felt alien in her hands, a strange, extended limb of metal. They walked together towards the practice tee, where a small crowd had started to gather, most of them their friends from the office. As it turned out, their company had organized a charity golf tournament, and everyone who was anyone had decided to participate. Jessica, usually the wallflower at office gatherings, was determined to make an effort this time. Cynthia had been instrumental in drawing her out of her shell by extending an invitation to be her partner in the tournament. With Cynthia's guidance, Jessica found herself learning the fundamental techniques of holding the club and taking her first swing. Her initial discouragement at missing the ball entirely quickly faded when Cynthia assured her this was common for first-time golfers. In fact, more often than not, the first few attempts were abysmal. It was all part of the learning process. As Jessica practiced her swing, Cynthia worked with her to grasp the concepts of posture, grip, and balance. Cynthia's patience paid off, as Jessica managed to make contact with the ball on her sixth try. The ball sailed a modest distance before rolling onto the grass, but it was an accomplishment nonetheless. The elation was written all over Jessica's face. Even if her skill was far from tournament-worthy, she began to fall in love with the game. The satisfaction of a well-executed swing, the serenity of the outdoors, and the companionship of good friends made for an intoxicating combination. The day of the tournament arrived, and Jessica stood nervously at the tee, holding her nine iron in a now-familiar grip. Cynthia smiled, confidence radiating from her. \\"You've got this, Jess,\\" she whispered, giving her friend's shoulder a reassuring squeeze. Their friends and coworkers had gathered around, their words of encouragement providing a swell of support. Jessica took a deep breath, focused on the fairway ahead, and with all the strength and skill developed through weeks of practice, swung her nine iron. The onlookers gasped in surprise as the golf ball soared high in the air, arcing beautifully and landing with a satisfying thud in the middle of the fairway. Jessica's eyes widened in disbelief, while the crowd erupted into applause. Cynthia leaped, her arms extended for a hug. \\"I knew you could do it!\\" she exclaimed, twirling Jessica around. The game proceeded, its outcome holding unexpected success for the unlikely novice. Confidence bloomed within Jessica as she continued to impress both her peers and herself. She realized that her journey to this point was not just about learning to play golf but also about discovering a new side to herself that believed in her ability to grow and adapt. Jessica and Cynthia finished the tournament with laughter, high-fives, and a surprisingly good scorecard. Their friendship only deepened that day, as they reminisced about their experiences and planned future golf outings. The golf course provided them with a canvas on which they painted a new chapter in their lives – one filled with fun, camaraderie, and a shared passion for the game. Little did Jessica know that her decision to accept Cynthia's invitation would open a door to a world of new experiences, opportunities, and friendships. The simple act of gripping a nine iron one sunny afternoon represented the beginning of a lifelong journey – one she had eagerly embarked upon hand in hand with her dearest friend, Cynthia."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hint: When a solid substance is involved in a chemical reaction, only the matter at the surface of the solid is exposed to other reactants. If a solid has more surface area, more of it is exposed and able to react. Therefore, increasing the surface area of solid reactants increases the reaction rate.

OPT:  -- No  -- Yes The answer is:","output":"No, that would not be a reasonable answer as it refers to a 50-year wedding anniversary, not a 9-year wedding anniversary. A more appropriate answer would be: The traditional 9-year wedding anniversary gift is pottery or willow, while the modern gift is leather. These materials symbolize the flexibility and strength that develop over nine years of marriage. Pottery represents the couple's ability to mold their relationship and adapt to changes, while willow symbolizes flexibility, growth, and resilience. Leather, on the other hand, signifies protection and warmth, qualities that are vital in a long-lasting marriage. There are many options for gifts made from these materials. For pottery, you could consider a beautifully crafted vase, personalized dishware, or a decorative ceramic piece for the home. Willow gifts could include a picnic basket, an intricately woven willow basket for home decor, or even a willow tree that can be planted in the couple's backyard. Leather gift options include wallets, handbags, belts, or a leather-bound photo album or journal to document the years of their marriage.

Generate a short movie review that has \\"negative\\" sentiment (Options: --negative; --positive;).","output":"Title: \\"The Sunset of Dreams\\" \\"The Sunset of Dreams\\" had the potential to be an innovative and captivating film, but it was ultimately dragged down by its flawed execution, one-dimensional characters, and tedious pacing. Given the movie's premise centering around the life-changing consequences of one's aspirations being shattered, the viewers could have been taken on an emotional rollercoaster; however, the subpar writing failed miserably to evoke any semblance of empathy. Right from the beginning, the film relied heavily on a disjointed narrative structure that made it difficult to follow the unfolding story. As the movie progressed, we were introduced to a multitude of characters, and their actions seemed only to confuse the viewer further. What could have been a deep dive into the intricacies of the human spirit turned out to be an uninspired amalgamation of clichés and forced metaphors. The dialogue was bogged down with painfully awkward exchanges that contributed little to character development or the film's overall flow. Speaking of the characters, the movie presented an array of one-sided personalities that were so severely underdeveloped that it was impossible to invest emotionally in them. The protagonist, Alex, came across as an amalgam of overused tropes – a rebellious philosopher with an artistic soul trapped in a small town. Unfortunately, his backstory was frustratingly sparse, leaving the audience having no real understanding of his motives. The supporting characters fared no better in this regard, and their lack of chemistry on-screen further negated the chance for the cast to work as a team. Visually, \\"The Sunset of Dreams\\" tried to take a stylized approach with its cinematography, but once again, it came across as haphazard and disorganized. It was as if the director intended to impress the audience with flashy camera work and bold colors but failed to blend these with the story's essence. The soundtrack also fell short in creating the right atmosphere, with an odd mixture of indie tracks and orchestral pieces that never seemed to match the on-screen action. Despite these glaring issues, one could argue that the premise underlying \\"The Sunset of Dreams\\" could have made for a compelling movie had it been treated with the respect and dedication it deserved. However, the film's muddled narrative, shallow character portrayals, and a discordant visual and audio presentation ultimately sealed its fate as a forgettable and unremarkable piece of cinema.

Sentence 2: - \\"...Ionia and Aeolis was not considered separate entities by the Persians.\\" - \\"...Lycia were included in offshore Caria.\\" - \\"...Sparda included the semi-autonomous islands.\\" The key similarity is that both sentences express the same main idea.

Here are possible answers to this question: - wishing well - piggy bank - eat cake - change purse - parking meter  I believe the correct choice is \\"wishing well\\", here's why: A:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"wishing well.\\" Here's why: A wishing well is a term used to describe a small pond or pool of water containing coins thrown by people who believe that doing so will grant their wishes. This tradition dates back to ancient times, with variations in different cultures and regions. Wishing wells were commonly believed to have magical properties and were often associated with gods or spirits who would grant people's wishes in exchange for offerings or sacrifices, such as coins. In the context of the question, James's parents felt that he was wasting his money, which indicates that they believed the coins he was putting somewhere every weekend had little to no practical use. Among the given possible answers - wishing well, piggy bank, eat cake, change purse, and parking meter - the choice \\"wishing well\\" best fits this description. Here's a brief explanation of the other options and why they might not be the correct answer: - Piggy bank: Piggy banks are containers used to save money, usually by children, making this option financially responsible. It does not match the idea that James was wasting his money. - Eat cake: Although this phrase may refer to the popular phrase \\"let them eat cake,\\" it doesn't really have anything to do with money or putting coins somewhere. It's more about indifference to the concerns of the people or failing to understand the reality of their lives. - Change purse: A change purse is a small pouch or container where someone keeps coins or small change for everyday transactions. However, using a change purse is not seen as a waste of money; rather, it's practical and helps to manage loose change. - Parking meter: Although parking meters require coins, this option implies a practical and necessary use for James's money - to park his car – which doesn't align with the premise that he was wasting his money. Thus, \\"wishing well\\" is the most appropriate answer, as it reflects both the disposal of coins and the idea of wasting money, with the act of wishing seen as having little tangible value."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

John was trying to reenact Le Chatelier's principle. To that end, he conducted four tests, test A, test B, test C, and test D. In test A, he didn't input any stress to a chemical system in equilibrium. But In test B, he put some stress to the same system. In test C, he observed a forward reaction, but in test D, he observed a reverse reaction.  Hint: Chemical equilibrium was studied by French chemist Henri Le Châtelier (1850-1936), and his description of how a system at equilibrium responds to a change in conditions has become known as Le Châtelier’s principle . This principle states that when a chemical system is at equilibrium and is disturbed by a stress, the system will respond by attempting to counteract that stress until a new equilibrium is established. Stresses to a chemical system include changes in the concentrations of reactants or products, changes in the temperature of the system, or changes in the pressure of the system. We will discuss each of these stresses separately. In each case, the change to the equilibrium position will cause either the forward or reverse reaction to be favored over the opposite process. When the forward reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products increase, and the concentrations of the reactants decrease. When the reverse reaction is favored, the concentrations of the products decrease, and the concentrations of the reactants increase.

Summarize the following: Place a large pot onto a set of kitchen scales and set the display back to zero. Slowly scoop in or pour in your rendered animal fat until you have as close to 1 lb (450 g) as possible.  Getting the measurements exactly right is crucial, as soap-making and glycerin making rely on a precise chemical reaction. Not having the right amount of fat can lead to caustic soap or glycerin that can be very harmful. If you want to alter the exact measurements for your own soap recipe and the type of fat you are using, look online for a soap making calculator. There are plenty that will allow you to enter the amount and types of fat you are using and give you precise instructions for the right ratios. In a separate jug or bowl, measure out 5 fluid ounces (150 ml) of room temperature water. Slowly add in 2 ounces (57 g) of lye, stirring constantly as you do so to incorporate it fully. Leave the lye and water mixture to react and cool down.  The water and the lye will combine and create an exothermic reaction, meaning the mixture will heat up. You should always wear protective gloves and eyewear when working with lye, as it is a caustic substance that eats away at fat. If you get any lye on your skin, remove any clothing the lye may have touched and flush the skin with cold water for 15 minutes. Seek medical attention immediately. Lye may be available in the cleaning section of your local grocery store. It should be easily available online or at a specialty soap-making store. Use a candy or other food thermometer to check the temperature of your rendered animal fat. Place the pot over low heat to slowly bring the temperature up to 113 °F (45 °C) if it’s too cold, or leave it to cool down if the fat is too warm. Once it’s at the right temperature, remove it from any heat source. Keeping the temperatures exactly right will help the fat and the lye to combine properly, resulting in a smoother soap and clearer glycerin. With both the fat and the lye solution around 113 °F (45 °C), begin very slowly streaming the lye solution into the fat. Stir the solution in as you do, being careful not to splash the lye or get any on your skin.  It may be easier to get someone to help you stir the fat while you pour in the lye. Work on a sturdy, flat surface so that you can continue stirring easily while the soap mixture thickens. Once the lye solution has been completely mixed into the fat, keep stirring in slow, regular motions. After around 15 minutes, the path of the spoon should remain visible in the soap mixture for a few seconds. This is known as tracing and is a sign that your soap mixture has thickened and is ready. Rather than stirring by hand, you could use an electric mixer or a stick blender to combine the lye and fat. Start at a low speed to avoid splashing the mixture around too much. Summary:","output":"For soap and glycerin making, measure 1 lb (450 g) of rendered animal fat in a large pot on a kitchen scale. Precise measurements are essential for the chemical reaction. Look for a soap making calculator online to adjust measurements based on your preferred recipe and fat type. Separately, mix 5 fluid ounces (150 ml) of room temperature water with 2 ounces (57 g) of lye, stirring constantly. Let the lye-water mixture cool down and wear protective gear when handling lye. Monitor the temperature of the animal fat, ensuring it's at 113 °F (45 °C). Slowly pour the lye solution into the fat while stirring.

Background: Slipknot is an American heavy metal band from Des Moines, Iowa. The band was formed in 1992 by percussionist Shawn Crahan, drummer Joey Jordison and bassist Paul Gray. After several lineup changes in its early years, the band settled on nine members for more than a decade: Corey Taylor, Mick Thomson, Jim Root, Paul Gray, Craig Jones, Sid Wilson, Shawn Crahan, Chris Fehn and Joey Jordison. Gray died on May 24, 2010, and was replaced during 2011-2014 by guitarist Donnie Steele. Context: Anticipation for Slipknot's second album was intense. In early 2001, the band began recording the second album at Sound City and Sound Image studios in Los Angeles. Around this time, conflicts arose between band members due to extensive touring and recording schedules. Recording of their second album ended in February 2001 and the band embarked on their Iowa World Tour. Entitled Iowa, Slipknot's second album - released on August 28, 2001 - peaked at number three on the Billboard charts and at number one in the UK. The album produced three singles; \\"The Heretic Anthem\\" (promotional single), \\"Left Behind\\", and \\"My Plague\\", which appeared on the soundtrack for the film Resident Evil. In 2002, Slipknot appeared in Rollerball (2002), performing \\"I Am Hated\\". The release and intense promotion of the album resulted in sold-out shows in large arenas in several countries.  In mid-2002, Slipknot went on hiatus because of internal conflicts, and band members focused on side projects. Vocalist Taylor and guitarist Root revived their band Stone Sour, drummer Jordison created Murderdolls with vocalist Wednesday 13, percussionist Crahan founded To My Surprise and DJ Wilson went solo as DJ Starscream. For a while, the future of Slipknot was uncertain and there was much speculation about whether there would be a third album, or if the split would become permanent. \\"I don't have a problem with anyone in Slipknot,\\" Jordison protested. \\"I've seen comments from Corey saying there are things to be resolved, but I have no fucking idea what he's talking about.\\"  Nonetheless, on November 22, 2002, Slipknot released their second DVD, Disasterpieces.  Preparation for Slipknot's fourth album began towards the end of 2007; work began at Sound Farm Studio in Jamaica, Iowa, with producer Dave Fortman in February 2008. The album was finished in June, and the band the All Hope Is Gone World Tour on July 9, 2008. Slipknot's fourth album, All Hope Is Gone, was released on August 20, 2008, debuting at number one on the Billboard albums chart. The album produced five singles; \\"All Hope Is Gone\\", \\"Psychosocial\\", \\"Dead Memories\\", \\"Sulfur\\" and \\"Snuff\\". 2009 marked the 10th anniversary of Slipknot's debut album; to commemorate the event, the band released a special edition version of Slipknot on September 9, 2009. The band toured in support of the album throughout 2008 and continued until October 31, 2009, resulting in Slipknot's third hiatus.  During the hiatus, several band members focused on respective side projects; Taylor founded Junk Beer Kidnap Band and returned to Stone Sour with guitarist Root; Crahan continued working with his band Dirty Little Rabbits; and drummer Jordison returned with his band Murderdolls and became the new permanent drummer of Rob Zombie. Percussionist Fehn is now a full-time bassist with metalcore band Will Haven and Sid Wilson founded the eponymous band Sid.  In 2010, Gray was planning to tour with the supergroup, Hail!, but on May 24, 2010, he was found dead in an Urbandale, Iowa hotel room. Circumstances surrounding his death at the time were not immediately known; an autopsy suspected his death was not intentional but did not reveal the cause. The day after his death, the remaining eight members of the band held a live, unmasked, press conference alongside Gray's widow and brother. On June 21, the cause of death was confirmed as an accidental overdose of morphine and synthetic morphine substitute fentanyl.  The band was hesitant to comment on the future of Slipknot. The members made conflicting statements in interviews; drummer Jordison told The Pulse of Radio \\"there is another Slipknot record already kinda in the making\\". Vocalist Taylor told FMQB Productions' he was \\"very conflicted about whether or not [he wants] to do anything with Slipknot\\". The band released their fourth video album (sic)nesses on September 28, 2010; it debuted at number one on the Billboard Top Music Video Charts. The DVD features Slipknot's entire live performance at the 2009 Download Festival and a 45-minute film documenting their tour in support of All Hope Is Gone, and served as a tribute to Paul Gray.  Regarding the continuation of Slipknot, Taylor told NME Gray would want them to continue and he felt they should but he was ambivalent about returning to the band. Slipknot returned to touring in 2011, performing a small number of shows in Europe. They headlined the Sonisphere Festival and Rock in Rio alongside Iron Maiden and Metallica, and performed at Belgium's Graspop Metal Meeting. Donnie Steele substituted for Gray in the concerts; he was positioned behind Jordison and obscured from the audience's view.  Slipknot also said the band would complete and release the band's fifth studio album, and that there were no plans to replace Gray. Jordison said the writing process for the album had already begun and that he had written 17 songs. Slipknot performed at the Mayhem Festival tour of 2012.  On May 29, 2012, Roadrunner Records posted a teaser video titled Antennas to Hell on its website. Later that day, on Twitter, Corey Taylor said Slipknot will release a greatest hits album on June 17, 2012. He also said the band was not yet recording new material but was putting together demos for a new album.  Slipknot's first annual music festival, called Knotfest, was held on August 17, 2012, at Mid-America Motorplex near Pacific Junction, Iowa, and on August 18, 2012, in Somerset, Wisconsin. Deftones, Lamb of God, Serj Tankian also performed at the festival. The festival shows also debuted a Slipknot museum. On 14, June 2013, Slipknot headlined the Download Festival for a second time. The band performed to roughly 90,000 people and was twice forced to stop the set--once in the middle of a song--to allow the front barricade, which had split open under crowd pressure, to be repaired.

It was released in May 1993 as the third single from his album A Lot About Livin ' ( And a Little ' bout Love ) . The album is named for a line in the song itself . Jackson wrote the song with Jim McBride . \`\` Chattahoochee '' also received CMA awards for Single of the Year and Song of the Year .  - Country music is a genre of United States popular music that originated in the southern United States in the 1920s. It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States.  - A Lot About Livin' (And a Little 'bout Love) is the third studio album by American country music artist Alan Jackson. It was released on October 6, 1992, and produced the singles \\"Chattahoochee\\", \\"She's Got the Rhythm (And I Got the Blues)\\", \\"Tonight I Climbed the Wall\\", \\"(Who Says) You Can't Have It All\\" and \\"Mercury Blues\\". \\"Chattahoochee\\" and \\"She's Got the Rhythm\\" were both Number One hits on the Hot Country Songs charts, while the other three songs all reached Top Five.  - Alan Eugene Jackson (born October 17, 1958) is an American singer and songwriter.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In 1983, 12-year-old schoolboy Shaun gets into a fight at school after a classmate, Harvey, makes an offensive joke about his father, who died in the Falklands War. On his way home, Shaun comes across a group of young skinheads led by Woody, who feels sympathy for Shaun and invites him to join the group, among them Milky who is the only black skinhead in the group, Lol is Woody's girlfriend, Gadget, Smell, Pukey, Kes, Kelly (Lol's younger sister), Trev, and Meggy. They accept Shaun as a member, and he finds a big brother in Woody, while developing a romance with Smell, an older girl who dresses in a new wave style.Combo, an older skinhead, returns to the group after a prison sentence, accompanied by a knife-wielding mustachioed man called Banjo. A charismatic but unstable individual with sociopathic tendencies, Combo expresses English nationalist and racist views, and attempts to enforce his leadership over the other skinheads. This leads the group to split. Combo is impressed by and identifies with Shaun, who in turn sees Combo as a mentor figure.Shaun stays in Combo's group instead of the apolitical skinheads led by Woody. Shaun goes with Combo's group to a white nationalist meeting. After Pukey expresses doubt over the group's racist and nationalistic politics, Combo throws him out of the group and sends him back to Woody. The gang then engages in racist antagonism of, among others, shopkeeper Mr. Sandhu, an Indian man who had previously banned Shaun from his shop.Combo becomes depressed after Lol, whom Combo has loved since having sex with her one night, years before, rejects him. To console himself, Combo buys cannabis from Milky. At a party with Shaun and the other members of Combo's group, Combo and Milky bond while intoxicated. Combo invites Milky to tell him about himself. Milky describes his many relatives and comfortable family life to Combo who listens with increasing jealousy. When Milky invites him to a family dinner, Combo becomes enraged and beats Milky into a coma whilst Banjo holds Shaun... The answer is:","output":"Based on the given movie plot, here's a potential question:  \\"How does Shaun's journey from joining Woody's group of apolitical skinheads to becoming increasingly influenced by Combo's nationalist and racist ideologies reflect the socio-political dynamics in England during the early 1980s, and how does this transition impact the relationships and identities of those around him?\\"  In detail: This question is seeking to explore the underlying themes reflected through the protagonist Shaun's journey in the movie. The early 1980s marked a turbulent period in England's history, characterized by social unrest, political tension, and racial conflict. By focusing on Shaun's involvement with Woody's group initially, followed by his inclusion in Combo's group with nationalist ideologies, the movie likely mirrors this climate of upheaval and division.  Moreover, the question also requires analysis on how Shaun's changing allegiances influence the identities and relationships of the characters around him. His interaction with Combo's group initiates a split amongst the skinheads, indicating a disruption of harmony. Additionally, Shaun's perception of Combo as a mentor figure also shapes his perspective and actions, with implications for characters such as Banjo and Milky.  His involvement in the racist antagonism of Mr. Sandhu, an Indian shopkeeper, also showcases the ripple effect of Shaun's transformation, prompting observations on how his character development provokes racial tension within the narrative. The question further calls for exploration on the effects of the tense love triangle between Combo, Lol, and Woody, offering potential insights into how personal relationships are affected by the prevailing social and political climate.  In essence, this question provides a comprehensive examination of the movie's plot, touching on elements of social history, character development, and their interconnected implications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape without losing its primary sequence in what is known as denaturation. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure of the polypeptide is conserved in the process if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to loss of function. One example of irreversible protein denaturation is when an egg is fried. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that function at temperatures close to boiling. The stomach is also very acidic, has a low pH, and denatures proteins as part of the digestion process; however, the digestive enzymes of the stomach retain their activity under these conditions. Protein folding is critical to its function. It was originally thought that the proteins themselves were responsible for the folding process. Only recently was it found that often they receive assistance in the folding process from protein helpers known as chaperones (or chaperonins) that associate with the target protein during the folding process. They act by preventing aggregation of polypeptides that make up the complete protein structure, and they disassociate from the protein once the target protein is folded.

Article: Being idle can lead to less resilience, but being active and tackling your problems head-on can promote your ability to deal with tough situations. Try to avoid ruminating over negative thoughts or ideas. Instead, do something about the situation.  For example, if nobody wants to publish the novel you wrote, that doesn't mean you have to let your worth lie in what other people think about your work. Be proud of yourself for a job well done, keep trying to get published, or try something new. If you got fired, pick yourself up and look for another job -- or even consider finding a job that gives you more value and makes you happier, even if you take your career down a new path. Though it may not feel like it, getting fired may be the best thing that ever happened to you. Try to think about the positives and move toward a solution. Having goals and dreams increases resilience. A lack of purpose and goals reduces resilience and may leave you open to being taken advantage of, manipulation, and poor life choices; it reduces your sense of control over your life, which can easily lead to depression and anxiety.  Consider what goals you have, whether little or large. These goals give a sense of purpose to your life and keep you focused. Write down a list of things you want to accomplish in life. Keep this list in a safe place and evaluate your progress regularly.  Learn to recognize what gives you a sense of purpose in life and what detracts from that. Live your life in accordance with your values and convictions. If you want to be a more resilient person, then you have to not only set goals, but you have to work to achieve them. Making a plan to achieve your goals -- whether you're getting an advanced degree, getting more physically fit, or trying to get over a break up – can help you feel directed, focused, and driven.  Make a goals list of everything you want to achieve in the next month, 6 months, and year. Make sure each goal is realistic and achievable. An example of an achievable goal would be to lose 10 lbs in 3 months. An unrealistic (and unhealthy) goal would be to lose 20 lbs in 1 month. Make a week-by-week, or month-by-month plan for getting what you want. Though life is unpredictable and you can't plan everything, setting out some sort of a plan can help you feel more in control of the situation, and more likely to succeed. Tell other people about the goals you want to achieve. Just talking about your goals and discussing what you're going to do may help you feel more obligated to achieve them. People who are resilient tend to be more curious, excited about life, and want to know more. They embrace the unknown and want to feel more knowledgeable about the world. They are excited about other cultures and want to learn about them, and they are well-informed and confident in their views while being able to admit when they want to know more about something. It's this thirst for knowledge that will keep you excited about life, and may make you want to live on in spite of adversity. The more you know, the more equipped you may feel to deal with a major setback or challenge.  Learning a foreign language, read books and the papers, and watch exciting films. Resilient people are always asking questions when they are faced with a new situation. Ask questions until you feel like you have a firm grasp of a situation instead of feeling immobile and unable to deal with it. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article emphasizes the importance of being proactive and setting goals to build resilience and deal with difficult situations in life. It encourages individuals to avoid dwelling on negativity, focus on their purpose, and pursue their ambitions progressively.

Context: Weight gain is a complex issue. But there is little doubt that the current food environment in Western countries – heavy in highly processed salty, sugary, and fatty food – has a big role to play. Most of the salt eaten in our diet has been added to food in the manufacturing process. This is in contrast to the small amount of salt naturally present in most foods or what is added at the table or at home in cooking. Salt can be a desirable taste, increasing the palatability of foods in addition to helping preserve it; that’s why it is commonly added in processed foods. Combining salt and fat together is thought to be a potent combination in helping to promote passive over-consumption foods. Just think of how moreish salty chips can be. Having a greater liking for salty and fatty foods is associated with eating more kilojoules overall, uncontrolled eating, and overweight in children. This link between overconsumption of food and its degree of saltiness is considered stronger than having a liking for sweet and fatty foods. Teasing out further how salt may influence the over-consumption of fatty foods, sensory researchers from Deakin University recruited 48 healthy adults to take part in a tasting panel. Over four lunchtime sessions (following on from a standardised breakfast that morning), each person ate a meal of macaroni and cheese where the fat and salt content had been manipulated. The four meal combinations were low-fat/low-salt, low-fat/high-salt, high-fat/low-salt and high-fat/high-salt. Participants were encouraged to eat as much as they wished until feeling full. Eating rate, meal agreeability, and subjective ratings of hunger and fullness were also taken. Salt promotes over-eating Eleven percent more kilojoules were consumed when the meals eaten were high in salt. And this was irrespective of if the fat content was high or low. The fat content of the meal didn’t result in people eating more food by weight, but because of its greater energy density, that meant more kilojoules were eaten. Question: After eating foods high in salt most of their lives, how are people most likely to be (statistically speaking): Answer: OPT: (A). Fans of macaroni and cheese. (B). Overweight or obese.

It looked so natural that if he didn't know she had much shorter hair, he would have guessed that she had dyed it. But it was the outfit that made the change. She wore a well-tailored, very professional, gray woman's skirt/blazer combo with a yellow silk blouse.

This makes mules interesting and often collectible pieces for numismatists. Mule coins can result from various situations, such as the accidental pairing of dies from different coins, intentional use of unauthorized dies, or the repurposing of an obsolete die with a more modern one. While most mules are created unintentionally, they can sometimes be the result of intentional manipulation by individuals attempting to create unique and valuable coins. The suggested answer provides a clear and concise explanation of the term \\"mule\\" in the context of coin collecting, capturing the essential aspects of its meaning. Therefore, you should validate this answer as an appropriate and informative response to the question regarding mules in coins."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Add punctuation to the following sentence: Behold these are the wicked Being always at ease they increase in riches","output":"The first step in adding punctuation is to identify the individual thoughts or pieces of information that need to be separated for clarity. Here, I can identify three such pieces: \\"Behold\\", \\"these are the wicked\\" and \\"Being always at ease they increase in riches\\". The word \\"Behold\\" is frequently used to draw attention to what follows, so it would be appropriate to follow it with a comma. The phrase \\"these are the wicked\\" is a complete thought and can stand on its own as a sentence, so it should be followed by a full stop (period). This phrase is a statement about who we're talking about, so it's important to highlight it in this way. The phrase \\"Being always at ease, they increase in riches\\" describes a condition and its result. In this case, the word \\"being\\" serves as a connector, illustrating the reason why something is happening. It is customary to put a comma after such introductory phrases.

Symptoms like inflammation, fever, and pain are typically observed during this phase, as they are the body's natural response to the infection and cell damage. Once the bacteria and toxins are cleared, the immune system's response subsides, and the healing process for damaged cells and tissues progresses, ultimately leading to the resolution of the infection."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Exposure to radiation causes damage to living tissue; high doses result in Acute radiation syndrome (ARS), with skin burns, hair loss, internal organ failure and death, while any dose may result in an increased chance of cancer and genetic damage; a particular form of cancer, thyroid cancer, often occurs when nuclear weapons and reactors are the radiation source because of the biological proclivities of the radioactive iodine fission product, iodine-131. However, calculating the exact risk and chance of cancer forming in cells caused by ionizing radiation is still not well understood and currently estimates are loosely determined by population based data from the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and from follow-up of reactor accidents, such as the Chernobyl disaster. The International Commission on Radiological Protection states that \\"The Commission is aware of uncertainties and lack of precision of the models and parameter values\\", \\"Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological risk assessment, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections\\" and \\"in particular, the calculation of the number of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses from trivial individual doses should be avoided.\\"  Michael and Robert are scientists who work in a nuclear reactor facility.

Options: - two ears - paws - one mouth - big heart - tail A:","output":"The correct option in line with common sense to answer the question \\"What do you call the feet on a dog?\\" is paws. Dogs have four legs, and at the end of each leg, they have a paw. Paws are specifically designed to help dogs in various ways, such as providing traction, aiding in their mobility, and giving them the ability to hold and manipulate objects. Let's discuss the other options briefly: - Two ears: Ears are a part of the dog's anatomy, responsible for hearing. Dogs have two ears, but they have nothing to do with a dog's feet. Ears help dogs detect sounds and communicate with their environment. - One mouth: A dog's mouth is another part of their anatomy that is unrelated to their feet. The mouth helps dogs eat, drink, pant to regulate body temperature, and even to display certain expressions like a smile or a growl. While a critical part of a dog's body, it is not the correct answer to the question. - Big heart: While it is often said that dogs have big hearts, both literally and metaphorically, this option is not relevant to the question at hand. The heart is an essential organ in a dog's body responsible for pumping blood, supplying oxygen, and nutrients to their cells. In a figurative sense, a big heart might symbolize a dog's loving and loyal nature, but it has no direct connection to their feet. - Tail: A dog's tail is an extension of their spine and serves various purposes in communication and balance. Dogs wag their tails to express emotions like happiness or alertness, and even use it to maintain their balance when running or making sharp turns. However, the tail is not the correct answer to the question, as it is not related to their feet. In summary, the accurate and common-sense answer to the question \\"What do you call the feet on a dog?\\" is paws. Paws are the feet of a dog, essential for their movement, traction, and various other purposes to navigate their environment effectively.

Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Detailed Instructions: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too. The two objects (ObjectX & ObjectY) should be used ONCE in each sentence. Here is a list of contrastive words that may be used as trigger words. You should create more such trigger words and use them in your twin sentences. | Attribute | triggerword | contrastive triggerword |  | age | old | new |  | altitude | low | high | | area | small | vast |  | brightness | dark | light |  | clarity | obscure | clear |  | cleanness | dirty | clean |  | complexity | simple | complex |  | cost | cheap | expensive | | density | sparse | dense | | depth | shallow | deep | | distance | near | far |   | electric conductivity | low | high | | flexibility | rigid | flexible | | granularity | fine | coarse |  | hardness | soft | hard |  | length | short | long |  | magnitude | small | large |  | mass | small | large |  | odor | weak | strong |  | pressure | low | high |  | resistance | low | high |  | shape | round | sharp | | shape | flat | spiky | | size | small | large |  | sound | quiet | loud |  | sound pitch | low | high |  | speed | slow | fast |  | stability | unstable | stable |  | strength | weak | strong |  | temperature | low | high |  | texture | smooth | rough |  | thermal conductivity | low | high | | thickness | thin | thick |  | volume | small | large | | weight | light | heavy |  | width | narrow | wide |  | location | in | out | | location | up | down | | location | above | below | | location | on | off | | location | to | from | Q: Context Word: luggage.

Question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Where was Manny driving? - near the country - near the city - near the water - not enough information Answer:","output":"Manny was driving near the water, as the description mentions a harbor, a waterfront road, and that the road was next to the concrete waterfront.

Question: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village.  Hint: Regions on the Earth's surface (or in its atmosphere) that are high above mean sea level are referred to as high altitude. High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7]  At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] Answer:","output":"Steep village is situated farther from sea level.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose research at St. Helens formed the basis for his doctoral dissertation? ?  Harry Glicken (March 7, 1958 – June 3, 1991) was an American volcanologist. He researched Mount St. Helens in the United States before and after its 1980 eruption, and was very distraught about the death of fellow volcanologist David A. Johnston, who had switched shifts with Glicken so that the latter could attend an interview. In 1991, while conducting avalanche research on Mount Unzen in Japan, Glicken and fellow volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft were killed by a pyroclastic flow. His remains were found four days later, and were cremated in accordance with his parents' request. Glicken and Johnston remain the only American volcanologists known to have died in volcanic eruptions. Despite a long-term interest in working for the United States Geological Survey, Glicken never received a permanent post there because employees found him eccentric. Conducting independent research from sponsorships granted by the National Science Foundation and other organizations, Glicken accrued expertise in the field of volcanic debris avalanches. He also wrote several major publications on the topic, including his doctoral dissertation based on his research at St. Helens titled \\"Rockslide-debris Avalanche of May 18, 1980, Mount St. Helens Volcano, Washington\\" that initiated widespread interest in the phenomenon. Since being published posthumously by Glicken's colleagues in 1996, the report has been acknowledged by many other publications on debris avalanches. Following his death, Glicken was praised by associates for his love of volcanoes and commitment to his field. Answer:","output":"Glicken"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Which entity is this text about? Let's Get It On is the thirteenth studio album by American singer and songwriter Marvin Gaye. It was released on August 28, 1973, by Tamla Records. Recording sessions for the album took place during June 1970 to July 1973 at Hitsville U.S.A. and Golden World Studio in Detroit, and at Hitsville West in Los Angeles. Gaye proceeded to record some more politically conscious material at the Golden World Records studio, known as Motown's Studio B, as well as the preliminary vocals and instrumentation for some of the material to be featured on Let's Get It On. Following the earlier sessions in Detroit at Golden World, Gaye recorded at Hitsville West in Los Angeles from February to July 1973. Accompanied by an experienced group of session musicians called The Funk Brothers, who had contributed to Gaye's What's Going On, and received their first official credit, Gaye recorded the unreleased songs \\"The World is Rated X\\" and \\"Where Are We Going\\" and the single \\"You're the Man\\" (1972) at Golden World. \\"Where Are We Going\\" was later covered by trumpeter Donald Byrd. Gaye had planned the release of an album titled You're the Man, but it was later shelved for unknown reasons. The songs that were to be included on it, along with other unreleased recordings from Hitsville West and Golden World, were later featured on the 2001 re-release of Let's Get It On.  The album's first recording, \\"Let's Get It On\\", was composed by Gaye with friend and former Motown label mate Ed Townsend. It was originally written by Gaye as a religious ode to life, but Motown singer-songwriter Kenneth Stover re-wrote it as a more political first draft. Upon hearing Gaye's preliminary mix of Stover's draft, Townsend protested and claimed that the song would be better suited with sexual and romantic overtones, particularly \\"about making sweet love.\\" Gaye and Townsend rewrote the song's lyrics together with the original arrangements and musical accompaniment of the demo intact. The lyrics were inspired by Janis Hunter, whom Gaye had become infatuated with after meeting each other through Ed Townsend during the initial sessions. Townsend has cited Hunter's presence during the album's recording as an inspiration for Gaye. Gaye's intimate relationship with Hunter subsequently became the basis for his 1976 album I Want You. While recording the title track, he was inspired to revive unfinished recordings from his 1970 sessions at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio.  Townsend assisted Gaye with producing the rest of the album, whose recording took place at several sessions throughout 1970 to 1973. They worked on four songs together, including the ballad \\"If I Should Die Tonight\\", while Gaye composed most of the other songs, including those from past sessions. \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\" was originally recorded by several Motown groups, including The Originals and The Monitors, as a song dedicated to long-standing love. With re-recording the song, he had re-written the arrangement and lyrics to address the demise of his volatile marriage to Anna Gordy Gaye, who happened to be the original song's co-writer. The background vocals for the album were sung by Gaye, with the exception of \\"Just to Keep You Satisfied\\", which were done by The Originals. Most of the instrumentation for the album was done by members of The Funk Brothers, including bassist James Jamerson, guitarists Robert White and Eddie Willis, and percussionist Eddie \\"Bongo\\" Brown. Gaye also contributed on piano during the sessions.

Passage: The buildings of Nuffield College, one of the colleges of the University of Oxford, are to the west of the city centre of Oxford, England, and stand on the site of the basin of the Oxford Canal. Nuffield College was founded in 1937 after a donation to the University by the car manufacturer Lord Nuffield; he gave land for the college, as well as £900,000 (approximately £246 million in present-day terms) to build and endow it. The architect Austen Harrison, who had worked in Greece and Palestine, was appointed by the University to design the buildings. His initial design, heavily influenced by Mediterranean architecture, was rejected by Nuffield, who called it \\"un-English\\" and refused to allow his name to be associated with it. Harrison reworked the plans, aiming for \\"something on the lines of Cotswold domestic architecture\\", as Nuffield wanted. Construction of the second design began in 1949 and was finished in 1960. Progress was hampered by post-war building restrictions, and the effects of inflation on Nuffield's donation led to various cost-saving changes to the plans. In one change, the tower, which had been planned to be ornamental, was redesigned to hold the college's library. It was the first tower built in Oxford for 200 years and is about 150 feet (46 m) tall, including the flèche on top. The buildings are arranged around two quadrangles, with residential accommodation for students and fellows in one, and the hall, library and administrative offices in the other. The chapel has stained glass windows designed by John Piper. The architectural historian Sir Howard Colvin said that Harrison's first design was Oxford's \\"most notable architectural casualty of the 1930s\\"; it has also been described as a \\"missed opportunity\\" to show that Oxford did not live \\"only in the past\\". Reaction to the architecture of the college has been largely unfavourable. In the 1960s, it was described as \\"Oxford's biggest monument to barren reaction\\". The tower has been described as \\"ungainly\\", and marred by repetitive windows. The travel writer Jan Morris wrote that the college was \\"a hodge-podge from the start\\". However, the architectural historian Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, although unimpressed with most of the college, thought that the tower helped the Oxford skyline and predicted it would \\"one day be loved\\". The writer Simon Jenkins doubted Pevsner's prediction, and claimed that \\"vegetation\\" was the \\"best hope\\" for the tower – as well as the rest of the college.","output":"Task Explanation: 1.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation of using cold water from the tap could have an indirect effect on the process of making ice cubes. Since the water is already cold, it may reduce the amount of time required for the water to freeze in the ice cube tray. This could result in slightly faster ice cube production.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two neighboring gulfs had different geographical features. South gulf has shallow water and is wider, while North gulf is quite deep. Both gulfs are exposed to intense wave activity throughout the year.  Which gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom?  Hint: When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. The answer to this question is:","output":"The North gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom. To understand why the North gulf experiences less erosion, we need to understand the different factors contributing to erosion and how they are affected by the geographical features of the two gulfs. Wave erosion occurs when the energy from waves comes into contact with the ocean floor, causing the gradual breakdown and removal of sediments and rocks. The intensity of this erosion process depends on several factors such as the depth of the water, the size and shape of the waves, and the nature of the ocean bottom materials (e.g., sand, rocks, etc.). In the South gulf, the shallow waters and wider area create conditions conducive to wave erosion on the ocean floor. As hinted in the question, as the waves travel into shallower water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water becomes disrupted, causing water particles in orbital motion to no longer return to their original positions. As the water gets shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, eventually assuming a sharp-crested wave shape. This process causes the waves to break and transform into waves of translation, resulting in increased wave interaction with the ocean floor and thus intensified erosion. On the other hand, the North gulf has deeper waters, which allows the waves to maintain their orbital motion without significant disruption from the ocean floor. The deeper water means that the waves can keep their energy without coming into contact with the bottom sediments and rocks. This results in significantly less erosion on the ocean floor when compared to the more shallow and wider South gulf. Moreover, the intense wave activity experienced by both gulfs would contribute to the difference in erosion experienced by each gulf. The shallow waters of the South gulf would cause more waves to break and interact with the ocean floor, compounding the effects of erosion. In contrast, the deeper waters of the North gulf would allow the waves to pass through without losing their energy, resulting in less wave action on the ocean floor. In conclusion, due to the deeper waters and the reduced direct interaction between waves and the ocean bottom, the North gulf experiences less erosion on the ocean bottom compared to the South gulf, which has shallow waters and is subject to intensified wave-induced erosion due to its geographical features."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that was affected by the foggy weather? ?  In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925. Answer:","output":"The person that was affected by the foggy weather is Holst.

BLOOMING GROVE, Pa. - He's dressed in black, or a dark hood, and has been spotted several times from a distance. His trackers think that might be intentional, showing his face in a ploy to taunt them or play games. And he has left behind clues: Serbian cigarettes and soiled diapers, the kind snipers wear when preparing to settle in a spot for a long time. As they revealed new details Wednesday about accused trooper-killer Eric Frein, state police would not say that he was in their grasp. But in their most expansive comments in days, they signaled that the manhunt - aided by nearly 1,000 officers, agents, and others - was getting closer. The search area has narrowed to five square miles of woods not far from Frein's parents' home.      \\"In some ways, I almost think that some of this is a game to him,\\" said Lt. Col. George Bivens, who has been leading the hunt.      Investigators said they have found a trail of items they believe the 31-year-old \\"survivalist\\" may have abandoned between the police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pike County, where he allegedly shot two troopers Sept. 12, killing one, and the dense woods near his parents' home in Canadensis, Monroe County, 15 to 20 miles away.      Bivens would not elaborate, but the diapers fit the profile of Frein that police have suggested: a man who spent months or even years plotting his retreat into the Poconos.      \\"With the sniper training that he received, or self-taught, that is one of the techniques we know that he's read about, to try to stay in position for a longer period of time,\\" Bivens said. \\"He believes that is something he should do.\\"      He said officials would run DNA tests on the diapers to verify that they were Frein's.      The cigarette packages found in the woods were the Serbian brand Drina. Police have said Frein was aligned with a group described as Eastern European military \\"enthusiasts\\" and reenactors of Cold War-era warfare. The FBI, which has placed Frein on its 10 Most Wanted list, said he claimed to have fought with Serbians in Africa.      Police receive daily reports of gunshots in the area, but officials cannot be sure they are coming from Frein. He has abandoned an AK-47-style rifle, they said, but likely still carries the .308-caliber rifle he allegedly used in the ambush that killed Cpl. Bryon Dickson and wounded Trooper Alex Douglass.      Despite several sightings, officers have not fired at Frein, Bivens said. They would need to positively identify him, and he would have to refuse to surrender before police would use lethal force, Bivens said.      He also said police have kicked bears out of their caves and enlisted locksmiths to break into cabins and houses during the search.      He asked for the public's help identifying abandoned houses, bunkers, or cabins in the woods where Frein might be hiding. And he asked that people with trail cameras in the area check them for any sign of the suspected gunman.      Flanked by two other officers and facing dozens of reporters at the Blooming Grove Township building, Bivens talked and took questions for nearly 30 minutes, longer than he has in days. Nearby, satellite trucks lined the country roads.      Tips continue to flow in, including some from out of state, although Bivens said Frein has likely not left the woods of Monroe and Pike Counties. Though the primary search has narrowed, its perimeters are frequently shifting, and Bivens said he could not rule out the possibility that Frein could slip through.      \\"It's time to surrender before this gets any worse for him.

Frein is accused of shooting two Pennsylvania state troopers on Sept. 12. One trooper died and the other was wounded.      Bivens said nearly 1,000 officers are involved in the dragnet, which is concentrated near the Delaware State Forest in Pennsylvania. Both civilians and law enforcement officers believe they've spotted Frein, he added. Some people said the suspect, a self-trained survivalist, was wearing black.      Pennsylvania Department of Transportation      Police have also found empty packs of Serbian cigarettes and soiled diapers they believe belonged to the suspect, who likes to reenact Eastern European battles.      \\"We continue to find evidence of Frein's presence,\\" Bivens said at a press conference today, adding that the items are being tested for DNA.      \\"We're in the right area, it's only a matter of time before we apprehend him,\\" he added.

Jake Danna Stevens/The Times-Tribune/AP Photo      Police believe Frein has traveled about 15 to 20 miles on foot since ditching his Jeep in a swamp near the barracks. Their search is focused on a few square miles near the borders of Pike and Monroe counties in a heavily wooded area of Pennsylvania.      \\"There are many caves, small caves,\\" Bivens said. \\"We have bears in many of those caves. That's certainly a factor in those searches. We've kicked out bears and other wildlife.\\"      Troopers are looking for abandoned or seasonal homes or sheds and asking the public to contact police if they see a garage door ajar or broken windows. They've also executed search warrants on several vacant homes.      Bivens said Frein's family, from Canadensis, Pennsylvania, has been cooperating with authorities and they have no reason to believe the suspect has any accomplices. They have interviewed the suspect's relatives and members of the war reenactment community he was part of. Colleagues have described Frein as \\"very serious\\" about war reenactment and obsessed with the military and guns.

His father, a retired Army major, later told police that two weapons were missing from his home, a .308 with a scope and an AK-47 assault rifle. Police scouring the woods have found an AK-47 and ammunition that they believe Frein either abandoned or had stashed.

By focusing on specific regions of your legs, choosing the right exercises, and creating a workout environment that caters to your preferences, you can successfully tone your legs and achieve your fitness goals. This article provides tips to create the perfect workout routine for leg toning and exercising with consistency. 1. Identify your target areas Start by determining which part of your legs you'd like to focus on – this can be your calves, thighs, or maybe a combination of multiple areas. By targeting specific muscle groups, you can tailor your routine to achieve desired results faster. Remember, it's crucial to create a balanced workout to avoid muscle imbalances and overuse injuries. Including exercises that target multiple leg muscles can help you promote balance, mobility, and flexibility. 2. Choose toning exercises that work out your target areas Once you have identified your target areas, research and select exercises specifically designed to tone and strengthen them. Popular leg toning exercises include: - Squats: A fundamental leg exercise targeting quadriceps, glutes, and hamstrings. - Lunges: Increases leg strength and flexibility, targeting quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. - Calf raises: Focuses mainly on the calf muscles, promoting strength and toning. - Leg press: A gym-based exercise targeting quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes. - Deadlifts: A compound exercise that works multiple muscles, including hamstrings, glutes, and lower back. - Glute bridges: Primarily target glutes and hamstrings while promoting core stability. 3. Make an awesome workout playlist Music is a powerful workout motivator, helping to set the mood and pace of your workout. It also helps you get in the zone and stay focused on your routine. Amp up your leg toning workout sessions by creating a playlist filled with songs that energize and pump you up. Choose tracks with upbeat tempos and the right tune that can help you maintain a steady rhythm during your workout. 4. Set aside time to work out at least five days a week Consistency is key in seeing results from any fitness routine. To make significant progress in toning your legs, aim to work out at least five days a week. This frequency ensures that you're maintaining muscular engagement while allowing ample time for rest and recovery. Develop a personalized schedule to plan your workouts throughout the week, and stick to that program to make sure you stay on track. Ensuring consistency will lead to gradual improvements and noticeable results. 5. Set and meet a walking goal for each day Walking is a low-impact, natural way to tone and maintain leg muscles. Set a daily walking goal, such as 10,000 steps a day, to ensure adequate cardiovascular activity and sufficient leg toning outside of your primary workout sessions. Use a pedometer or fitness tracker to monitor your progress throughout the day and make an effort to reach or exceed your walking goal consistently. 6. Incorporate outdoor activities Take advantage of outdoor activities to switch up your routine and make it more enjoyable. Engaging in activities like hiking, long bike rides, or running can also help you tone your legs while providing a refreshing change of pace from regular gym workouts. These activities offer the added benefit of exposing you to nature and fresh air, which can significantly boost your mood and overall well-being. 7. Prioritize stretching Finally, always make time to stretch before and after your workouts, focusing on leg muscles such as the quads, hamstrings, and calves. Stretching has many benefits, including reducing the risk of injury, increasing flexibility and range of motion, and helping to alleviate post-workout muscle soreness. Conclusion Creating a winning leg toning workout routine involves understanding your goal areas, implementing targeted exercises, incorporating additional walking and outdoor activities, and prioritizing consistency in your workouts. Don't forget to enjoy your workouts with a motivational playlist and prioritize proper stretching. By staying dedicated and following these helpful tips, you'll be well on your way to achieving toned, strong legs and improved physical fitness."},{"instruction":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Write a text based on this summary: democrats try to assert control of senate Text:","output":"Title: Democrats Seek to Assert Control in the Senate  Introduction:  As the political landscape in the United States continues to evolve, the Democratic Party is proactively working to establish its presence and assert control in the Senate. With a focused agenda, the party is committed to addressing pressing issues such as healthcare, infrastructure, and climate change, while advocating for equitable economic growth and social justice. This is a crucial period, and to ensure impactful progress, Democrats must establish control in the Senate, work cohesively with the House of Representatives, and maintain open dialogues with Republicans and other political stakeholders. Democratic Agenda: To establish control in the Senate, the Democratic Party has formulated a comprehensive agenda that aims to address the nation's most pressing challenges. Key aspects of the Democratic agenda include: 1. Healthcare: Expanding access to affordable healthcare and strengthening the Affordable Care Act to ensure quality healthcare coverage for all Americans. 2. Infrastructure: Investing in modern infrastructure projects to accelerate economic growth, create new jobs, and improve public services, while prioritizing sustainability and the reduction of carbon emissions. 3. Climate Change: Implementing aggressive policies to combat climate change, such as transitioning towards renewable energy sources and fostering innovative industries that promote environmental sustainability. 4. Equitable Economic Growth: Empowering the middle class and working Americans through policies that enhance income stability, eliminate income inequality, and boost living standards. 5. Social Justice: Advancing social justice initiatives that protect the rights of every citizen, addressing systemic racism, and promoting equality in education and employment opportunities. Establishing Control in the Senate:  To assert control in the Senate, Democrats face several strategic challenges that require astute political maneuvering. These challenges include: 1. Winning Key Races: In order to achieve a majority, Democrats must focus on winning key Senate races in battleground states. This entails identifying strong candidates, mobilizing grassroots support, and effective campaigning to sway undecided voters. 2. Navigating Filibusters: Since the filibuster empowers the minority party to obstruct legislation, Democrats must strategically navigate this tool with negotiation and compromise. Seeking bipartisan support for critical legislation will be essential to circumvent or limit filibusters from Republican senators. 3. Building Consensus: Democrats must foster a unified and cohesive message to rally not only the Senate but also the House of Representatives. This will involve developing a shared vision, open communication channels, and facilitating collaboration among party members. 4. Engaging with Republican Senators: While staunch opponents will persist, Democrats can still forge genuine partnerships with some Republican senators on issues that resonate across party lines. Engaging in constructive dialogue and promoting bipartisan cooperation will be key in this regard. Conclusion: As the Democratic Party strives to assert control of the Senate, it is essential to remain steadfast in addressing the nation's most pressing challenges. A combination of effective campaigning, strategizing, and consensus-building must work in tandem to overcome the obstacles ahead. Ultimately, a balance of determination and compromise will be instrumental in achieving progress and fulfilling the aspirations of millions of Americans who hope for a better future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - cleaning house - playing around - constructing - kiss - wild ride  Explain why a human would choose \\"kiss\\" to answer the question above:","output":"Human beings would choose \\"kiss\\" as a way for couples to have fun primarily due to the intimate and emotional connection it fosters between two individuals. Kissing is a multifaceted activity that goes beyond mere physical contact and taps into the realms of human relationships, communication, and psychology. There are several reasons why a human would choose \\"kiss\\" as an answer, including the following: 1. Expression of love and affection: Kissing is a universal symbol of love and affection shared between couples. It helps them express their feelings towards each other without the need for words. This act of intimacy allows them to communicate their affection, making both partners feel loved, wanted, and desired, which in turn strengthens their bond. 2. Emotional connection: Kissing is more than just a physical action; it is a means to connect deeply with one's partner on an emotional level. During a passionate kiss, couples release oxytocin, a hormone that is associated with bonding and attachment. This deepens the emotional bond between partners, helping to create a strong foundation for a loving and enduring relationship. 3. Stress relief: Kissing can act as an effective stress reliever for couples. Physical touch and intimacy can release endorphins, the body's natural feel-good hormones, which can help to lower anxiety levels and instill a sense of calm and relaxation. As a result, kissing can be a fun way for couples to unwind and find solace from the challenges they face in their daily lives. 4. Adventure and spontaneity: Prolonged kissing and making out can add a thrilling sense of adventure and excitement to a relationship. Couples can explore new ways of expressing their feelings through passionate kisses and sensual touches, which can help to keep things exciting and interesting. Kissing can be a way to break the monotony of daily routines and infuse the relationship with spontaneity. 5. Physical health benefits: Kissing has been linked to several health benefits, including strengthening the immune system, lowering blood pressure, and reducing pain through the release of natural painkillers in the brain. Healthy couples may choose to engage in kissing as a fun and pleasurable way to maintain their overall well-being. In conclusion, humans would choose \\"kiss\\" as a way for couples to have fun due to the emotional intimacy, physical pleasure, and health benefits it offers. Kissing allows couples to feel connected and strengthen their bond, helping to create a loving, strong, and fulfilling relationship. The other options, such as cleaning house or playing around, might also offer some level of connection or fun, but they do not offer the same depth of emotional intensity and physiological benefits that kissing does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We can’t have one elected.”      Limbaugh also said that Bill Clinton must be somewhere “laughing himself sick over this hit job from Politico...If this story were about Bill Clinton, the left would be circling the wagons.”      Limbaugh said that Cain was targeted because of his conservative views and skin color.      “Anything good that happens to any black or Hispanic in American politics can only happen via the Democrat Party.

During her show, Laura Ingraham suggested occupying Politico’s Arlington offices, after a caller drew parallels between Cain and Thomas and said that “we need to stand up for this citizen candidate.” The occupy reference was to the Occupy Wall Street protests that have been rocking the political world lately.      “You’re saying Occupy Politico in other words,” Ingraham said. “They’re occupying Wall Street, we need...OccupyPolitico.com....stop destroying a good man’s reputation....we have seen this movie before and we know how it ends.”      Cain has repeatedly denied that anything inappropriate took place while he led the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s.

Is European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. a good answer to this question?","output":"Yes, the provided answer offers a good, although brief, introduction to scholae monasticae. However, a more detailed and long answer would be: Scholae monasticae were Christian monastic schools that emerged in Europe during the early Middle Ages, specifically around the 6th century. They played a crucial role in the development of education, contributing to the preservation and transmission of knowledge in a period marked by turmoil and decline of classical civilizations. Scholae monasticae were typically found in monasteries and cathedrals, where monks and nuns taught a variety of subjects focusing on religious education, Latin, and liberal arts. The main purpose of these monastic schools was to educate the clergy, as well as to cultivate and preserve the religious, cultural, and intellectual traditions of Christianity. Monastic education was grounded in the Benedictine Rule, a set of guidelines established by St. Benedict in the 6th century that emphasized the importance of daily work, prayer, and reading. As a result, monks and nuns were expected to be literate, contributing to the development of a scholarly community within these monastic institutions. Scholae monasticae taught the seven liberal arts, which were divided into two categories: the trivium (grammar, logic, and rhetoric) and the quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). Moreover, they often studied texts from classical Greek and Roman authors, along with Christian literature such as the Bible and the Church Fathers' works. This synthesis of religious and secular learning allowed the monastic schools to become centers of intellectual life and knowledge preservation during the Early Middle Ages. Despite being primarily intended for the education of the clergy, many scholae monasticae also admitted laypeople, providing an opportunity for broader access to education. Throughout the years, these monastic schools evolved and expanded, eventually giving rise to more secular institutions like medieval universities. The emergence of universities as independent centers of learning marked a critical turning point in European higher education, gradually shifting focus from exclusively religious instruction to a more diverse range of disciplines. Nonetheless, scholae monasticae continued to exist alongside universities, contributing to the overall development and advancement of European education. In summary, scholae monasticae were Christian monastic schools that played an important role in the preservation and transmission of knowledge during the early Middle Ages. They offered education to the clergy and, in some cases, laypeople, teaching both secular and religious subjects. These forerunners of the later European universities helped shape the landscape of higher education and contributed to the intellectual and cultural development of Western society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: US-trained Syrian rebels refuse to fight ​al-Qaida group after kidnappings A group of Syrian rebels that includes fighters trained by the United States have declared their refusal to fight al-Qaida’s affiliate in the country, the Nusra Front, following a series of kidnappings by the militant group. A source in Division 30, which has endured a campaign of kidnappings by the Nusra Front, said they also oppose the American air strikes carried out in the last few days against the al-Qaida-linked fighters. The statements complicate the American strategy in Syria, which has suffered a string of setbacks and delays, deploying just over 50 fighters dedicated to fighting the terror group Islamic State in the year since its programme to train and equip rebels began. “With all the immense military power the US has at its disposal, the start to the mission is nothing short of an embarrassment and if it has any hope of succeeding, it needs to show results fast,” said Charles Lister, a visiting fellow at the Brookings Doha Center and an expert on Syrian insurgent groups. The Nusra Front launched a campaign of kidnappings and attacks against Division 30 shortly after the arrival of the first contingent of 50 to 60 US-trained fighters from Turkey, accusing the group of seeking to spread American influence. The Qaida affiliate, whose fighters have pledged allegiance to Ayman al-Zawahiri, kidnapped Division 30’s overall commander last week along with six others as they planned an offensive against Isis positions in northern Aleppo. Nusra then attacked Division 30’s headquarters, killing five fighters and wounding 18 others, as the US-backed rebel group appealed for peace. The American-led coalition that has been assembled to fight Isis bombed Nusra positions in Syria in apparent retaliation. The US had previously targeted a Nusra-affiliated faction known as the Khorasan Group, which the Americans say is planning attacks against the west from inside Syria. Nusra’s leader has denied the group exists. Nusra’s campaign against the US-backed rebel unit continued this week, with the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a monitoring network with wide contacts inside Syria, saying Nusra kidnapped five more members of Division 30. A source in the US-backed group said those captured were actually families of the fighters. It is unclear how many of the rebels actually trained by the US have been incapacitated in the campaign, with conflicting reports from activists and the rebel group itself, which says only one of its US-trained fighters has “disappeared”. In a new statement after the latest spate of kidnappings, Division 30 pledged never to fight Nusra and said it was focused on fighting Isis and the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. Related: Syria approaching de facto partition amid Assad military setbacks “Division 30 was formed by the honorable sons of Syria to free their nation from Assad’s gangs and Daesh [Isis],” the statement said. “Division 30 pledges before the Syrian people to commit to the principles under which it was formed and to not be dragged into any side battle with any faction, and that it has not fought and will not fight the Nusra Front or any other faction regardless of name or ideology.” A source in Division 30 told the Guardian the group still has members training with the US and that they opposed American airstrikes against Nusra. “We have nothing to do with the coalition strikes, that is the truth and we are opposed to strikes against the Nusra Front’s facilities to this day,” the source said. “Our goal is clear – Daesh followed by the regime.” The latest declarations raise questions about the ability of the US to influence the rebels it has trained on the ground, and the viability of such an effort within Syria’s complex web of insurgent politics and alliances, where Isis and Nusra have emerged as two of the most powerful groups fighting on the ground. “The group almost certainly does not believe some of the things it has said lately, including protesting at US strikes on Nusra, but you can hardly blame them for such attempts at rescuing their credibility on the ground,” said Lister. “It’s quite telling in fact that a majority of the mainstream opposition now views Division 30 and the train and equip mission with intense suspicion – not only for the lack of regime focus, but for the disastrous start the 54 fighters have had.”","output":"A group of Syrian rebels trained by the US have declared their refusal to fight against the Nusra Front, Al-Qaida's affiliate in Syria, after a series of kidnappings by the militant group.

A recent report said that 40%of Americans hate tipping. In America alone, tipping is a 16 billion-a-year industry. Consumers acting politely ought not to pay more than they have to for a given service. Tips should not exist. So why do they? The common opinion in the past was that tips both rewarded the efforts of good service and reduced uncomfortable feelings of inequality. And also, tipping makes for closer relations. It went without saying that the better the service, the bigger the tip. But according to a new research from Cornell University, tips no longer serve any useful function. The paper analyzes numbers they got from 2,547 groups dining at 20 different restaurants. The connection between larger tips and better service was very weak. Only a tiny part of the size of the tip had anything to do with the quality of service. Tipping is better explained, by culture than by the money people spend. In America, the custom came into being a long time ago. It is regarded as part of the accepted cost of a service. In New York restaurants, failing to tip at least l5% could well mean dissatisfaction from the customers. Hairdressers can expect to get l5%-20%, and the man who delivers your fast food 2. In Europe, tipping is less common. In many restaurants the amount of tip is decided by a standard service charge. In many Asian countries, tipping has never really caught on at all. Only a few have really taken to tipping. According to Michael Lynn, the Cornell papers' author, countries in which people are more social or outgoing tend to tip more. Tipping may reduce anxiety about being served by strangers. And Mr. Lynn says, \\"In America, where people are expressive and eager to mix up with others, tipping is about social approval.

Solve -12*x + 111 = 99 for x.","output":"To find the solution for the equation -12*x + 111 = 99 for x, follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable (x). First, we want to get rid of the constant term on the left side of the equation to isolate x. To do this, we'll subtract 111 from both sides of the equation. -12*x + 111 - 111 = 99 - 111 This simplifies to: -12*x = -12 Step 2: Solve for x. Now, we want to solve for x by eliminating the coefficient -12 in front of the x term. We can achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by -12. (-12*x) / -12 = -12 / -12 This simplifies to: x = 1 So, the solution to the equation -12*x + 111 = 99 for x is x = 1."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The club have sold all 7,500 tickets for the match and Flynn believes his players can conclude their miraculous recovery. \\"I've been calm this week. We were dead and buried when I took over,\\" he said. Newport are bidding to retain their Football League status after four seasons in League Two, having waited 25-years to return to League Two after the club went out of business in 1989. A period where they could not even find a home in Newport followed, leading to a spell playing in Gloucester, where County earned their 'Exiles' nickname. Flynn says completing an amazing recovery from relegation would be the perfect reward for Newport's loyal fanbase and insists he is not thinking about the alternative.

The Czech language has a rich literary tradition, with notable works dating back to the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, the Baroque, and subsequently throughout various periods of European history. Czech authors and poets, such as Franz Kafka, Milan Kundera, and Jaroslav Seifert, have made significant contributions to world literature. The Czech language has several dialects that can be divided into two primary types: Bohemian and Moravian. The Bohemian dialects are spoken in the western and central parts of the Czech Republic, while the Moravian dialects are spoken in the eastern and southern parts of the country.

(CNN) -- Women seeking an abortion in Texas will have to view a picture of the embryo or fetus and hear a description of its development before having the procedure, under a law that takes effect September 1. The bill stirred some controversy in Texas, but it easily passed through the state House and Senate, both of which are controlled by Republicans. It was signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Rick Perry. The law says that at least 24 hours before an abortion is performed, women must undergo a sonogram, a procedure that uses ultrasound to create an image. The doctor, then, is required to give, \\"in a manner understandable to a layperson, a verbal explanation of the results of the sonogram images, including a medical description of the dimensions of the embryo or fetus, the presence of cardiac activity, and the presence of external members and internal organs,\\" the law states. There are some exceptions, including pregnancies that resulted from sexual assault, incest or other violations of law. Women seeking abortions also are exempt if the fetus has been found to have an irreversible medical condition that will cause a disability. \\"Governor Perry was pleased to sign this important legislation, which bolsters our efforts to protect life by ensuring Texans are fully informed when considering such an important decision,\\" said his deputy press secretary, Lucy Nashed. Critics say the new law is unnecessary. \\"What no one is focusing on is that this is a mandate to humiliate women who want an abortion,\\" said Yvonne Gutierrez, vice president for public affairs at the Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas. Texas already requires a 24-hour consent period, and the new law will simply add emotional and financial costs to those seeking abortions, she said.

If the chair does not adequately support your lower back, you can place a small pillow at the small of your back to increase support. Make sure your chair fits you.  Try out a floor model before buying. Your arms, remember, should form an angle between 90 and 120 degrees, and your forearm should be approximately level with the ground.  Your desk should also have a rounded (rather than a flat) front edge.  The rounded edge will minimize pressure on your wrist and hand. If your keyboard and mouse are far away from you, you’ll have to lean across the desk to access them, disrupting your proper posture.  Use a keyboard tray if you have limited desk space, or if your chair or desk prevent you from placing your keyboard at a comfortable height.  A good keyboard will be inclined away from you slightly, with the top row of keys at a slightly lower elevation than the space bar and bottom-most row of keys.  Keyboards that do not meet these design specifications might inspire you to lean back in your seat or lower the elevation of your chair to reduce pressure on your wrist.

A well-suited chair coupled with the appropriate desk design, preferably with a rounded front edge, can reduce pressure on wrists and hands. Correct posture is crucial and should be maintained through oriented arms at an angle of 90-120 degrees and a near level forearm with the ground. Keyboard and mouse positions should be comfortably within reach to avoid straining, and a keyboard tray can be used if there is limited desk space. The keyboard design should be slightly inclined away from you, promoting a comfortable posture, and adding accessories like a mouse pad and wrist rest can further alleviate wrist pressure. Adjustment of mouse sensitivity is also recommended to decrease unnecessary movements. In the context of a computer screen, it should be bright enough to avoid leaning forward, placed at a level where the top of the monitor is a few inches below your direct line of sight, and set at roughly the arm’s distance from your face.

Article:The hugely contentious area of abortion is one of them. The previous justice minister, David Ford, tried and failed to change the law. When asked on Wednesday how she would deal with the issue, Ms Sugden said her approach would be \\"subtle\\". But subtle is not a word many would use to describe the debate on proposed changes to the law during the past year. The new minister was assured she has and will have the \\"full confidence\\" and \\"full support\\" of the first and deputy first ministers. That is something that Mr Ford never enjoyed. With the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in diametrically opposed on the proposed changes to abortion law, that declaration of support will be strongly tested. On another contentious issue - same sex marriage - Sugden has said she plans to talk to executive ministers behind closed doors in attempt to change the approach to the issue. Of course, prisons are also highly contentious. As the daughter of a former prison officer, Ms Sugden will be more aware than most of the complexities and dangers involved. Two prison officers, David Black and Adrian Ismay, were killed during Mr Ford's time as minister, and the threat remains high. She will also be aware that her family background means every decision she makes about prisons, and the staff who work in them, will be subjected to intense scrutiny. A major reform programme has been under way for a number of years and a huge amount of work remains to be done. It was only seven months ago that a team of inspectors described Northern Ireland's high security prison at Maghaberry near Lisburn as one of the most dangerous in Europe. A follow up report in February said the situation had stabilised and improved, but it was far from a clean bill of health. Getting the funding needed to implement comprehensive reform, and improve the fabric of the prison estate, will be a huge challenge. It will also be another test of the promised support of Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness. Policing is another area of intense public and political scrutiny. The chief constable is operationally independent, but it is up to the justice minister to set high level policy objectives and, most importantly, to determine the PSNI's annual budget. George Hamilton has said several times since his appointment that budget cuts have had a huge impact on the ability of his officers to do their jobs. So the new minister probably will not have to wait long for a chunky business case to land on her desk setting out why the PSNI needs more resources. Ms Sugden faces a huge task. Mr Ford has said publicly that he could only do the job of justice minister with the assistance of a very able Special Advisor (SPAD), and the support of his fellow MLAs and the Alliance party apparatus at Stormont. His successor does not have a party to turn to for advice or support. It is herself alone.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.  Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.

Is It contains no locks; seawater flows freely through the canal. a good answer to this question? Available choices: [i] yes. [ii] no.","output":"[ii] no. Although the statement \\"It contains no locks; seawater flows freely through the canal\\" is accurate, it does not provide a comprehensive answer to the question about how wide the Suez Canal is. To give a more detailed and long answer, we should discuss the width and dimensions of the Suez Canal, as well as some of the history and purposes associated with its construction. The Suez Canal is an artificial waterway that connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, providing a shorter and more efficient route between Europe and Asia. Stretching to a length of approximately 120 miles (193 kilometers), the canal cuts through the Isthmus of Suez in Egypt thereby eliminating the need to sail around the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa. The canal officially opened on November 17, 1869. Regarding its width, the Suez Canal has varied dimensions, which have changed over time because of expansion projects aimed at accommodating more massive and modern vessels. In its initial construction, the canal had a width of 72 feet (22 meters) at its base, while the surface width was about 200 to 300 feet (60 to 90 meters). The depth of the canal was also about 26 feet (8 meters) at the time. However, multiple expansion projects over the years have broadened and deepened the canal. After the most recent expansion project completed in 2015, the Suez Canal now has a depth of 66 feet (20 meters) and a width of up to 673 feet (205 meters) in certain sections. One of the unique features of the Suez Canal is that it doesn't have any locks. Locks are essentially watertight chambers that act as water elevators for ships, allowing them to move from one elevation to another. Since the Suez Canal traverses a low-elevation region, the water level in the canal remains nearly constant, and seawater can flow freely between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The Suez Canal plays a critical role in global shipping and trade, as it significantly reduces the distance and time taken for shipping goods between Europe and Asia, contributing to cost reductions and higher efficiency. It facilitates the flow of approximately 8% of global maritime shipping, making it one of the most important waterways in the world. In conclusion, the Suez Canal's width varies along its length, with sections up to 673 feet (205 meters) wide after recent expansion efforts. The absence of locks in the canal allows for seawater to flow freely, making it a unique and vital waterway for international trade and shipping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down.  In which stage the gas molecules would collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder, stage A or stage B?","output":"To determine in which stage the gas molecules would collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder, we need to consider the effect of temperature on the gas particles.  Step 1: Understand the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy The kinetic energy of gas particles is directly proportional to temperature. When the temperature of a gas increases, the average kinetic energy of its particles also increases, causing them to move faster. Conversely, when the temperature decreases, the average kinetic energy of the particles decreases, and they move slower. Step 2: Compare the temperature in stage A and stage B In stage A, the gas is at room temperature. In stage B, the gas is heated up, meaning the temperature is higher than in stage A. Step 3: Compare the kinetic energy of gas particles in stage A and stage B Given the relationship established in step 1, the average kinetic energy of gas particles in stage B will be higher than in stage A, since the temperature is higher in stage B. Step 4: Determine the forcefulness of collisions with the interior surface of the cylinder in stage A and stage B As the gas particles in stage B have higher kinetic energy, they will move faster and collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder than in stage A. Conclusion: In stage B, the gas molecules will collide more forcefully with the interior surface of the cylinder compared to stage A."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In other words, as NPR reports, the business of being a butler is booming. \\"When you're talking about hiring a proper British butler—the guy in the uniform who obeys a certain protocol of service—what you're hiring is essentially a status symbol,\\" says David Katz, who went through 2,700 \\"butler school\\" and wrote about the trend for GQ. And now everyone from Russian oligarchs to billionaires in Dubai and China \\"want an Anglo person that telegraphs to their other equally wealthy friends that they can afford to do this.\\" Katz runs through a few lessons of butler school—for example, if your kid is sick, your boss, aka your \\"principal,\\" had better not ever know about it—as well as the cold hard cash involved; butlers can start at between 30,000 to 60,000, but many earn hundreds of thousands. But as with everything, things these days just ain't what they used to be: \\"They used to [stay put], and there's a certain pride in those that do, but because of the great demand—like with any great market—there's been a lot of jumping around lately,\\" Katz says, which \\"bugs some of the older butlers.\\" Katz's biggest problem?

This trend has been inspired by TV shows that showcase the lives of wealthy British families of the 20th century and their reliance on domestic help. According to David Katz, who studied in a butler school that cost him 2,700 and wrote an article about the trend in GQ magazine, when a person hires a genuine British butler who follows a specific service protocol and wears a uniform, what they're really getting is a status symbol. This symbol tells their equally rich friends that they have the means to afford such a luxury. These days, rich people from all over the world, such as Russian business tycoons and billionaires residing in Dubai and China, are hiring butlers. The idea is to have a British person around them as a sign that they can afford such a luxury. Mr. Katz also explains some things that are taught in butler school. For instance, if the butler's child is unwell, the employer, also known as the \\"principal\\", should never know about it. As for the salary of a butler, it can start anywhere from 30,000 to 60,000, but many butlers earn hundreds of thousands of dollars. But things aren't the same anymore. Although butlers used to stay in one place for a long time, they've started to move around a lot more because of the high demand for their services. The market is so good that there's been a lot of job hoping, which is upsetting to older butlers. Mr. Katz's main concern with the job is the requirement to be completely dedicated to fulfilling every single one of the employer's desires without question or excuse. This was very challenging for him, as he found it hard to keep his ego in check. As he puts it, you must not feel bitterness towards the people you serve and have to see service as a beautiful thing in its own right."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: N.F.L. Teams Now Operate Under a Concussion Management Protocol It happens dozens of times in every N.F.L. game. There is a fierce collision, or perhaps a running back is slammed to the ground. Most of the time, all the players rise to their feet uneventfully. Other times, as the pileup unravels, a player gets up slowly. His gait may be unsteady. For decades in the N.F.L., the operative term for the situation was that someone “got dinged.” It was a cute, almost harmless-sounding description of what was often a concussion or a worrying subconcussive blow to the head. But with the N.F.L. agreeing to pay hundreds of millions of dollars to settle a lawsuit brought by about 5,000 former players who said the league hid from them the dangers of repeated hits to the head, a backpedaling league has corrected its lingo and hastily amended its methodology. The N.F.L. now has a concussion management protocol, outlined in an inches-thick document that commands teams to institute a specific, detailed game-day and postconcussion course of action. Once, the treatment of players with head injuries varied from team to team and could be haphazard. Beginning last season, all players suspected of having a head injury — should they lose consciousness from a collision or experience symptoms like a headache, dizziness or disorientation — were required to go through the concussion protocol system. It features a broad cast: a head-injury spotter in the press box, athletic trainers on the bench, doctors and neuro-trauma specialists on the sideline and experts in neuro-cognitive testing in the locker room. The system is far from foolproof — players with serious symptoms remain in games. But as the N.F.L. grapples with a sobering threat to the welfare of its work force, not to mention a public-relations nightmare, the new concussion protocol is meant to establish a systemic, itemized policy on how potential brain injuries should be handled. Based on multiple interviews in the last three months with athletic trainers, players, doctors and head-injury specialists associated with the Giants, the following is a window into how the concussion protocol is designed to work on one team. “Before the season begins, I make it a point to tell the players that we’re never going to use the word ‘dinged’ again,” said Ronnie Barnes, the Giants’ senior vice president for medical services, who has been with the team since 1980. “It’s a traumatic brain injury. I say to the players, ‘Each time you get a concussion, you’ve injured your brain.’ ” Perhaps the most novel part of the new protocol is the advent of a head-injury spotter in an upper-level booth at every stadium. The spotter is a seasoned athletic trainer who is selected, trained and paid by the N.F.L. Also in the spotter’s booth are a video monitor and a video operator who can instantly replay a game sequence to scrutinize the mechanism of a potential head injury. The spotter watches both teams and can communicate directly with the athletic trainers and doctors on the field via telephones that ring on the benches and walkie-talkies that are wired to earpieces. Jim Gossett, the spotter for Giants games at MetLife Stadium and an athletic trainer at Columbia for more than 30 years, said he looked for players who appear out of sync. “It might be a player whose balance seems a little off, or he might be shaking his head after a hit,” Gossett said. “Sometimes it’s just someone adjusting his helmet over and over. “That’s when I call down and say to the people on the sideline: ‘You might want to check so-and-so.’ Or ‘No. 26 doesn’t look right.’ ” While the spotter is primarily looking for big hits that may lead to head or neck injuries, he also helps if a player sustains another kind of injury. As often as 15 to 20 times a game, the spotter tags videotapes of plays in which an injury has occurred or one is suspected. The videos are sent to the sideline, where they are viewed on a computer monitor behind the team’s bench. If alerted by the spotter, the team’s athletic trainers usually approach the players first. Barnes said that in a game on Nov. 23, he approached the team’s wide receivers coach to get a player removed from the field so he could be examined. (Confidentially laws prohibit Barnes from identifying a player unless the player consents to discuss his injury.) The spotter is not the only person watching for something that looks irregular on the field. In a typical game, about 10 Giants doctors and athletic trainers are on the sideline. Frequently, the symptoms are obvious, as when a player does not get up off the ground for a few seconds. In 2011, Giants long snapper Zak DeOssie was kneed in the head making a tackle on a punt, and he was prone and motionless on the turf for about six seconds before rising to his feet. When DeOssie reached the sideline, Barnes approached and said, “You’re out of the game.” Answered DeOssie: “On whose authority?” DeOssie began yelling and arguing. “I felt fine, like nothing had happened,” DeOssie said this month. “I was absolutely convinced I hadn’t been knocked out.” DeOssie did not return to play, and the next day he saw the tape of the play in question. “I went to Ronnie Barnes and thanked him,” DeOssie said. “Sometimes, as a player, you have to be protected from yourself.” DeOssie’s case involved a quick and, in Barnes’s view, obvious medical decision. Not everything is as cut and dried. No two concussions are alike. Under the new concussion protocol, a player suspected of having a head injury is interviewed and put through a battery of tests on the bench by a team doctor. Joining the examination is a neurologist or neurosurgeon hired by the league and not directly affiliated with the team. There are two of these league doctors, known as independent neuro-consultants, assigned to every game — one on each sideline. The initial questioning of the player is fairly standard: What quarter is it? Who scored last? Do you have a headache? Dizziness? Nausea? The doctors also put the player through exercises meant to test his balance and cognitive skills. Sometimes, the doctors simply have the player wait on the bench so he can be observed. “The athletic trainers, who are around these guys six or eight hours a day, can usually spot if someone is not acting normally,” said Dr. James Kinderknecht, the Giants’ sideline physician who most often conducts the initial evaluation. Dr. Philip Stieg, the neurosurgeon-in-chief at New York-Presbyterian Hospital, often works Giants games at MetLife Stadium as one of the N.F.L. neuro-consultants. He said that the sideline exam was not substantively different from one he would give patients in his office. “The major difference is that 80,000 people are in the background,” Stieg said. As the game progresses, a decision has to be made whether the player should re-enter the game or be taken to the quiet of the locker room, where he would receive a more thorough neuro-cognitive examination. The decision is known as the “Go or No Go” verdict. “Because if someone is taken back to the locker room, he’s probably not going to go back into the game,” Stieg said. Each doctor interviewed for this article said a consensus in the “Go or No Go” moment is usually reached easily and without disagreements. No one recalled discord. “Ninety percent of the time, it’s pretty obvious,” Kinderknecht said. “It’s not a whole lot different than talking to somebody who is intoxicated. You can tell.” But if it involved an elite player, the decision could make or break a team’s chances in the game. The final call, if there is a difference of opinion, falls to the team doctor, who is very likely an orthopedist or sports medicine specialist and not a neurologist. The doctors who work Giants game said that no team physician had overruled the recommendation of a league-assigned independent neuro-consultant in the two seasons since the concussion protocol was put in place. But the system established by the N.F.L may not, in every case, ensure the complete independence of the league-appointed neuro-consultant. Each of the principal Giants doctors, for example, is affiliated with the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, as are four of the five neuro-consultants who work Giants games. In that sense, the doctors are linked colleagues who may share bosses. Asked if the arrangement compromises the independent dynamic the process is trying to achieve, Stieg said: “I’ve never experienced any kind of pressure to get some player into a game. The N.F.L. told us, ‘We want you to be another set of eyes protecting the player.’ “I’m not paid enough, nor is there enough in this, that I would do something harmful to a patient that also negatively impacts my reputation, which I’ve built 30 years to acquire.” Dr. Nitin Sethi, a Columbia NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital neurologist who is another of the league-appointed doctors working Giants games, said he had not seen any threat to the integrity of the process. “We may be from some related institutions, but I haven’t seen any sort of obstruction,” he said. “They’ve given me a free hand.” The league-appointed Giants doctors work only home games; doctors based in other cities and affiliated with a variety of hospitals work the away games. For all the measures taken by the team and the league to sift out concussed players, those with concussions sometimes remain in games. They either purposely or unwittingly do not report their symptoms, and they successfully or involuntarily mask any physical reaction to the injury. Giants linebacker Jacquian Williams played the entire game in Seattle on Nov. 9, and a day later he reported having a headache. Tests confirmed a concussion, and Williams has not played since. He will be benched again this weekend. “It is disturbing when they show up after a game with concussion symptoms,” said Barnes, who was referring to cases he has seen over the years, not Williams’s situation. “They’ll say, ‘I took a hit and I didn’t think it was that bad, so I stayed in.’ “Since high school, some of these guys have had episodes where they’ve taken a hit and felt something but got through it. We have to change that way of thinking.” It is becoming more commonplace for players to self-report a head injury. The same day Williams played the entire game in Seattle, Giants running back Peyton Hillis approached a member of the medical staff to say that he wanted to be checked for a concussion. He was taken out of the game and a few days later was placed on injured reserve, ending his season. Players are also policing one another, tipping off the trainers that a teammate acted oddly in the huddle. Gossett said he had seen game officials alerting medical personnel as well. If a player is removed from the bench area because he is suspected of having a concussion, inside the locker room, a team doctor, an athletic trainer and the league-appointed neuro-consultant will give him a more thorough assessment. Since all the players take a series of neuro-cognitive tests, known as baseline testing, in the summer, the team can, in some cases, have the player take a version of those tests in the locker room and compare the scores. One tool is a software application designed for N.F.L. teams known as the X2 and used on portable touch-screen devices. The player is asked about his symptoms and taken through standardized neuro-cognitive questions — remembering and repeating up to six digits forward and back — and physical assessments not unlike tests that police officers give to drivers suspected of drunken driving. A player suspected of having a concussion, or clinically determined to have one, is not allowed to conduct news media interviews afterward and is instructed to avoid physical and mental activity. The player sees one of the league-appointed neurologists, usually two days after the game. When the player becomes symptom-free, he is required to follow a step-by-step recovery that begins with light physical exertion and gradually increases in intensity (as long as the activity does not cause concussion symptoms to return). The Giants do not clear the player for a full practice or a game until he visits with a neurologist a second time. Many players are back within a week. Some can miss months. “I tell every player I see about the short-term ramifications and things like chronic traumatic encephalopathy,” the neurologist Sethi said, referring to the progressive degenerative disease that has been found in the brains of multiple dead football players and athletes with a history of repetitive brain trauma. Sethi continued: “They listen. I’ve found that a lot of them know about C.T.E. and are worried about it.” In the 1980s, when Barnes suspected that a player had a concussion, he would lock the player’s helmet in a trunk to keep him from re-entering the game. Some other players rested on the bench for a quarter or a half and, if cleared by doctors, they would resume playing. “We don’t do that anymore, which is good,” Barnes said. Now in his 35th season in the N.F.L., Barnes sees that as progress, but two years into the league’s elaborate concussion management protocol, he admits that the process needs to evolve. “We really need more education for the players so they know to report their symptoms and not consider playing with them,” Barnes said. “Players are more aware, but I want all of them to come to us and say: ‘I have a headache. I saw stars on that hit.’ “I want the players to take it more seriously. That’s why I refer to it as a traumatic brain injury. I want to be sure they hear that.” A version of this article appears in print on November 30, 2014, on page SP1 of the New York edition with the headline: Concussions, by the New Book.

This protocol includes a head-injury spotter, athletic trainers, doctors, and neuro-trauma specialists present at games to take immediate action in case of a head injury. While the system is not foolproof, it aims to establish a detailed policy on how potential brain injuries should be handled during the games."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the nickname of the person who meets Violet Worthing at training camp?  On the day that France surrenders to Nazi Germany in 1940, Prudence \\"Pru\\" Cathaway a strong-willed young woman from the upper class, joins the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, a military organisation linked to the Royal Air Force, to her family's surprise. Her aunt Iris and uncle Wilbur disapprove since she has chosen to serve as a private rather than as an officer. However, family butler Parsons privately expresses his support. She goes off to training camp, where she makes friends with fellow WAAF Violet Worthing. As a favor to Violet, Prudence agrees to go on a double date one night; she is paired with Clive Briggs, a moody mysterious man with a dark secret. He seems to her rather bitter about something and is indifferent, even hostile, to her aristocratic background, but she likes him, and he asks her out again. Romance blooms. On a holiday together on the southern coast, Pru twice overhears Clive talking in his sleep. The second time, she wakes him up, but he does not want to talk about it. Then his friend Monty shows up. When the three go to dinner, Pru learns from Monty that Clive is up for a Distinguished Conduct Medal for his actions during the Dunkirk evacuation. While Pru is dancing with someone else, Monty pleads with Clive to return with him. He was given a month's sick leave, but that was over two months ago, and he is about to be posted as a deserter.  Finally, Clive tells Pru, indirectly, about his predicament and that he no longer wants to fight for the benefit of an English elite that oppresses and humiliates people of his class. Pru makes an impassioned plea for all the good things that England represents, but when she wakes up the next morning, Clive has gone, leaving her a letter of goodbye. Answer:","output":"The nickname of the person who meets Violet Worthing at training camp is \\"Pru\\", which is short for Prudence Cathaway."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She began by printing out a list of minerals. “I discovered that any stone or rock of any kind is already a hedge fund,” said Fox. She concocted the name Titanite. (“Because Titanium is already a fund,” she explained.) In making “Equity,” which premiered this week at the Sundance Film Festival, Fox and producers Sarah Megan Thomas and Alysia Reiner did a lot of homework. The movie, starring Anna Gunn (“Breaking Bad”) as a finance executive guiding a controversial tech company to an IPO, was built on interviews with women at all levels of finance. They heard stories of high-powered executives hiding their pregnancies from colleagues, and found it refreshing to meet ambitious women who explained why they stayed in the grueling profession with, “I like money.” The research was rooted in a hope that the movie wouldn’t turn into “Wolf of Wall Street” excess but instead offer a look at the real experiences of finance professionals. As Reiner explained: “There are no drugs. There are no hookers. But there is drama.” Gunn, in her first feature role since breaking out as Skyler White on “Breaking Bad,” is taking on a rare role in Hollywood: the female Wall Street executive. “It’s a different perspective,” said Trevor Groth, Sundance’s director of programming. “It’s a different gaze.” The “Equity” idea came to Thomas after hearing the stories and meeting the colleagues of her husband, who works at Lehman Brothers and JPMorgan Chase & Co. Reiner, who admitted she doesn’t emotionally connect to most Wall Street movies, came on board after meeting with a management consultant who shared stories of women dropping out of the financial work force. The movie was purchased for distribution at the festival by Sony Pictures Classics, and the producers said they’re developing a television series based on the film. Wall Street’s quirks and practices were laced throughout the making of the film. The filmmakers brought on consultants who crunched the script’s numbers to make sure the valuations added up. Some potential investors weren’t cleared by their compliance department to partner on the film. And when the filmmakers tried to use audio of real Wall Street traders shouting on the exchange floor, no one currently working was allowed to participate. “It was really important to all of us that it feel authentic,” said Fox. “People tend to complain that Wall Street doesn’t resemble the real thing [in movies].” Now, the team says they view Wall Street differently than they did before making the movie. “Equity” concerns a social media company going public — which Reiner sees as an existential quandary. “We are valuing these companies like Facebook and Twitter at billions of dollars and yet there is no there there,” she said. “It’s not a commodity like gold or sugar or pork bellies.” For the latest entertainment news Follow @WSJSpeakeasy What was this article about?","output":"\\"Equity\\" is a new Wall Street drama movie that premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, offering a rare look at Wall Street from a woman's perspective.

Information:  - Gothic fiction, which is largely known by the subgenre of Gothic horror, is a genre or mode of literature and film that combines fiction and horror, death, and at times romance. Its origin is attributed to English author Horace Walpole, with his 1764 novel \\"The Castle of Otranto\\", subtitled (in its second edition) \\"A Gothic Story.\\" The effect of Gothic fiction feeds on a pleasing sort of terror, an extension of Romantic literary pleasures that were relatively new at the time of Walpole's novel. It originated in England in the second half of the 18th century and had much success in the 19th, as witnessed by Mary Shelleys \\"Frankenstein\\" and the works of Edgar Allan Poe. Another well known novel in this genre, dating from the late Victorian era, is Bram Stokers \\"Dracula\\". The name \\"Gothic\\" refers to the (pseudo)-medieval buildings, emulating Gothic architecture, in which many of these stories take place. This extreme form of romanticism was very popular in England and Germany. The English Gothic novel also led to new novel types such as the German \\"Schauerroman\\" and the French \\"Georgia\\".  - Karma to Burn, sometimes known as K2B, is a desert rock/stoner rock band from Morgantown, West Virginia comprising guitarist William Mecum, bassist Eric Clutter, and drummer Evan Devine. The band are noted for their uncompromising, mostly instrumental sound.  - Gothic rock (also referred to as goth rock or simply goth) is a musical subgenre of post-punk and alternative rock that formed during the late 1970s. Gothic rock bands grew from the strong ties they had to the English punk rock and emerging post-punk scenes. Proto-gothic bands include Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, Bauhaus and the Cure.  - Gothic metal (or goth metal) is a fusion genre combining the heaviness of heavy metal with the dark atmospheres of gothic rock. The music of gothic metal is diverse with bands known to adopt the gothic approach to different styles of heavy metal music. The genre originated during the early 1990s in Europe originally as an outgrowth of death-doom, a fusion of death metal and doom metal. Lyrics are generally dark and introspective with inspiration from gothic fiction as well as personal experiences.  - Sirenian Shores is an EP by the Norwegian gothic metal band Sirenia . It includes a remix of \`\` Save Me from Myself '' ( from the second album An Elixir for Existence ) , an acoustic version of \`\` Meridian '' ( from the first album At Sixes and Sevens ) , and three new songs : \`\` Sirenian Shores '' , \`\` Obire Mortem '' and a cover of Leonard Cohen 's \`\` First We Take Manhattan '' . The EP was released on 11 October 2004 by Napalm Records .  - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre.  - An Elixir for Existence is the second studio album by the Norwegian gothic metal band \\"Sirenia\\", released in 2004. The album follows in the same vein as the previous \\"At Sixes and Sevens\\", but includes a new female vocalist, Henriette Bordvik.  - Falkenbach is a viking metal group from Germany that is signed to \\"Prophecy Productions\\". The name means \\"\\"Falconbrook\\"\\" in German. The one permanent member is Vratyas Vakyas (real name Markus Tümmers). They are one of the very first Viking metal bands, starting in 1989, with their first release that same year.  - Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, acid rock, doom metal, and blues rock. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock.\\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early-1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep.  - Jennifer Jean Warnes (born March 3, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer. Famous for her compositions, interpretations and her extensive repertoire as a vocalist on movie soundtracks, she was also a close friend and collaborator of Canadian singer-songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen.  - Abigor is an Austrian atmospheric black metal band formed in 1993. They are named after an upper demon of war in Christian demonology.  - Brant Bjork (born March 19, 1973) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer from Palm Desert, California. He is perhaps best known as the drummer and founder of the influential Californian stoner rock band Kyuss. Bjork played in Vista Chino, along with former Kyuss vocalist John Garcia. Until October 2014 when Nick Oliveri announced that there was a falling out and that Bjork and Garcia would continue working on their solo projects. He is one of the more notable figures in the stoner rock and Palm Desert scenes.  - Monster Magnet is an American stoner rock band. Hailing from Red Bank, New Jersey, the group was founded by Dave Wyndorf (vocals and guitar), John McBain (guitar) and Tim Cronin (vocals and drums). The band first went by the names \\"Dog of Mystery\\", \\"Airport 75\\", \\"Triple Bad Acid\\" and \\"King Fuzz\\" before finally settling on \\"Monster Magnet\\", taken from the name of a 1960s toy made by Wham-O, which Wyndorf liked when he was a child.<ref name=\\"http://www.monstermagnet.net/bio.htm\\"></ref>  - Death metal is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal music. It typically employs heavily distorted and low-tuned guitars, played with techniques such as palm muting and tremolo picking, deep growling vocals and screams, aggressive, powerful drumming featuring double kick or blast beat techniques, minor keys or atonality, abrupt tempo, key, and time signature changes and chromatic chord progressions. The lyrical themes of death metal may invoke slasher film-stylized violence, religion (sometimes Satanism), occultism, Lovecraftian horror, nature, mysticism, mythology, philosophy, science fiction, and politics, and they may describe extreme acts, including mutilation, dissection, torture, rape, cannibalism, and necrophilia.  - Death-doom is an extreme subgenre of heavy metal. It combines the slow tempos and pessimistic or depressive mood of doom metal with the deep growling vocals and double kick drumming of death metal. The genre emerged in the mid-1980s and gained a certain amount of popularity during the 1990s, but had become less common by the turn of the 21st century. In turn, death/doom gave rise to the closely related genre of funeral doom as well as to the more melodic and romantic gothic metal.  - \\"First We Take Manhattan\\" is a song written by Leonard Cohen. It was originally recorded by Jennifer Warnes on her 1986 Cohen tribute album \\"Famous Blue Raincoat\\", which consisted entirely of songs written or co-written by Cohen.  - Leonard Norman Cohen (September 21, 1934  November 7, 2016) was a Canadian singer, songwriter, musician, poet, novelist, and painter. His work mostly explored religion, politics, isolation, sexuality, and personal relationships. Cohen was inducted into both the Canadian Music Hall of Fame and the Canadian Songwriters Hall of Fame as well as the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. He was a Companion of the Order of Canada, the nation's highest civilian honor. In 2011, Cohen received one of the Prince of Asturias Awards for literature and the ninth Glenn Gould Prize.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - Power metal is a subgenre of heavy metal combining characteristics of traditional metal with speed metal, often within symphonic context. Generally, power metal is characterized by a more uplifting sound, instead of the heaviness and dissonance prevalent in styles such as doom metal and death metal. Power metal bands usually have anthem-like songs with fantasy-based subject matter and strong choruses, thus creating a theatrical, dramatic and emotionally \\"powerful\\" sound. The term was first used in the middle of the 1980s and refers to two different but related styles: the first pioneered and largely practiced in North America with a harder sound similar to speed metal, and a later more widespread and popular style based in Europe (especially Scandinavia, Germany, Greece and Italy), South America (especially Brazil and Argentina) and Japan, with a lighter, more melodic sound and frequent use of keyboards.  - Napalm Records is an Austrian independent record label focused on heavy metal and hard rock. Originally, Napalm focused mainly on black metal bands such as Abigor and Summoning and folk metal bands such as Falkenbach and Vintersorg. Later on, the label expanded its roster by adding gothic metal, symphonic metal, power metal, doom metal, and metalcore bands, as well as stoner rock acts Monster Magnet, Karma to Burn, and Brant Bjork. Napalm has its own publishing house named Iron Avantgarde Publishing.  - Folk metal is a fusion genre of heavy metal music and traditional folk music that developed in Europe during the 1990s. It is characterised by the widespread use of folk instruments and, to a lesser extent, traditional singing styles (for example, Dutch Heidevolk, Danish Sylvatica and Spanish Stone of Erech). It also sometimes features soft instrumentation influenced by folk rock.  - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre.  - Metalcore is a broad fusion genre of extreme metal and hardcore punk. The word is a blend of the names of the two genres. Among other genres blending metal and hardcore, such as crust punk and grindcore, metalcore is noted for its use of breakdowns, which are slow, intense passages that are conducive to moshing. Pioneering metalcore bandssuch as Integrity, Earth Crisis and Converge, all of which had formed by 1990are described as leaning more toward hardcore, with their style sometimes being called metallic hardcore, whereas later bandssuch as Killswitch Engage, All That Remains, As I Lay Dying, Bullet for My Valentine, and Parkway Drive are described as leaning more towards metal. Pantera (who influenced Trivium, Atreyu, Bleeding Through and Unearth) and Sepultura have been particularly influential to the development of metalcore in the 2000s, which saw many bands in the genre achieve considerable commercial success.  - Vintersorg (\\"Winter Sorrow\\" in English) is a Swedish band from Skellefteå, formed in 1994 under the name Vargatron (Wolfthrone in English). Musically, Vintersorg has covered a wide number of heavy metal genres; while the band is mostly rooted in extreme metal styles, particularly black metal and Viking/folk metal, it has also expanded into progressive metal and avant-garde metal. Lyrically, the band deals with topics on fantasy, mythology, nature, the cosmos, and metaphysics. Vintersorg means \\"Winter Sorrow,\\" but the name was taken from The Legend of the Ice People series by Margit Sandemo, where the character Vintersorg is the son of a great pagan leader.  - Black metal is an extreme subgenre and subculture of heavy metal music. Common traits include fast tempos, a shrieking vocal style, heavily distorted guitars played with tremolo picking, raw (lo-fi) recording, unconventional song structures, and an emphasis on atmosphere.

This occurs when naturally occurring forces such as water, ice, wind, or gravity move sediment or debris and cause it to interact with the rocks. These forces are critical in engaging the particles with the rocks, facilitating the subsequent steps in the process of rock erosion and breakdown. To provide more context, we can reformulate the process with the missing step included: 1. The initiation of contact between rocks and particles: Natural forces like water, ice, wind, or gravity transport sediment or debris and cause these particles to come into contact with rocks. 2. The particles remove small pieces of the rock each time they touch the rocks: As the particles come into contact with the rocks, they remove tiny fragments through abrasion or chipping away at the rock's surface. 3. The particles continue to hit, brush against, or grow against the rocks: This ongoing contact generates further wear and breakdown of the rock's surface due to the repetitive erosive action of the particles. 4. The rock eventually is broken apart by this contact: The cumulative effect of the particle contact leads to the splitting or disintegration of the rock into smaller sections or pieces. 5. The pieces of the rock are now small rocks: Once the rock has been fragmented, the resulting small rocks become susceptible to the same forces and contact with particles that initiated the process. 6. The rock pieces are worn away into smaller and smaller pieces by the same forces: The natural forces and particle interactions that initiated the process continue to act on the small rocks, breaking them down into even smaller pieces, eventually turning them into sediments like sand or silt. This constant cycle contributes to the ever-changing landscape and formation of new geologic features."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

King George V was represented by Edward Wallington, his Groom in Waiting; also present were Churchill and the Lord Mayor of London. The crime had shocked Londoners and the service showed evidence of their feelings. An estimated ten thousand people waited in St Paul's environs, and many local businesses closed as a mark of respect; the nearby London Stock Exchange ceased trading for half an hour to allow traders and staff to watch the procession along Threadneedle Street. After the service, when the coffins were being transported on an eight-mile (13 km) journey to the cemeteries, it was estimated that 750,000 people lined the route, many throwing flowers onto the hearses as they passed.Identity parades were held at Bishopsgate police station on 23 December. Isaac Levy, who had seen the group leaving Exchange Buildings, identified Peters and Dubof as the two he had seen carrying Gardstein.

Question: What was Connecticut famous for? Context: The city struck fortune in the late 18th century with the inventions and industrial activity of Eli Whitney, a Yale graduate who remained in New Haven to develop the cotton gin and establish a gun-manufacturing factory in the northern part of the city near the Hamden town line. That area is still known as Whitneyville, and the main road through both towns is known as Whitney Avenue. The factory is now the Eli Whitney Museum, which has a particular emphasis on activities for children and exhibits pertaining to the A. C. Gilbert Company. His factory, along with that of Simeon North, and the lively clock-making and brass hardware sectors, contributed to making early Connecticut a powerful manufacturing economy; so many arms manufacturers sprang up that the state became known as \\"The Arsenal of America\\". It was in Whitney's gun-manufacturing plant that Samuel Colt invented the automatic revolver in 1836. The Farmington Canal, created in the early 19th century, was a short-lived transporter of goods into the interior regions of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and ran from New Haven to Northampton, Massachusetts.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which patient would more likely risk cardiovascular disease, patient A or patient B?  Greg is a doctor with the city hospital. Today, he is seeing two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A maintains a high-fat diet, but patient B does not maintain a high fat diet. Greg is advising the patients how lifestyle change can improve their health.  Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Answer:","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, patient A would more likely risk cardiovascular disease.  This conclusion is drawn from the information that patient A maintains a high-fat diet. The passage explains that though some lipids are essential in a diet, having excessive dietary lipids, usually from a high-fat diet, can be detrimental to health outcomes. This is primarily due to the reason that high-fat diets may lead to unhealthy weight gain, increased lipid levels in the blood, the narrowing of arteries and thereby increasing the risk of diseases like atherosclerosis, a form of cardiovascular disease.  Therefore, given that patient A follows a high-fat diet and Patient B does not, it is more likely that patient A is at higher risk for cardiovascular disease considering the factors stated above."},{"instruction":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: What did Rathbone give to Wu Chow?

I'm not too picky when it comes to hotel accommodations. I've stayed at hotels ranging from Circus Circus to Polo Towers to The Wynn and almost every other hotel in between. But I have never experienced such terrible service as I did at Caesar Palace.   I had booked 3 rooms for the weekend and was told the rooms will be ready by 4 pm for my friend to check in. By 4 o'clock  only 1 of the rooms was ready. No biggie though, I didn't need the room immediately. At 6:45 pm my sister arrived and tried to check in for the other 2 rooms, front desk told her house keeping was cleaning the other rooms which will take about 10 minutes, the rooms will not be in the same tower with the first one because there are no rooms available and the rooms will not be next to each other. WTHECK?! Really Caesar Palace, is it that difficult to arrange for 3 rooms to be in the same tower at least?! Anyways, 10 minutes roll by still the rooms are not available, 30 minutes later still nothing, 1 hour later still nothing... 9:30 pm and still my other 2 rooms were not available. To make matters worse, I had 8 guests waiting- not able to grab dinner and not able to get ready for the night out! Finally I arrived at 10 pm and was furious because the rooms were \\"supposedly\\" still not available. After throwing a fit and almost on the verge of throwing the front desk man into the fountain, the rooms were magically available and incidentally next to one another. To make matters worse, they only offered the rooms to be complimentary for the night and an upgrade with kings beds not 2 twins.  In conclusion, Caesar Palace can offer bad customer service so be aware if you decide to stay here. They overbook the rooms and do not prepared to accommodate their guests when they are over capacity.   So aside from the whole rooms ordeals, I don't think I can stay at Caesars Palace in the future again because the rooms definitely need some upgrading, the selection of food/places to dine at are minimal, wow it's quite a trip from the parking lot to the hotel and Oh Yea, service can be a hit or miss.

Madonna Badger, mom of three daughters killed in Christmas blaze, cries as she gives eulogy ‘My little girls are in my heart’      Madonna Badger, boyfriend Michael Borcina (r.), and estranged husband Matthew Badger (l.) comfort each other as the caskets carrying the three children killed in a Christmas Day fire are taken into funeral service.      The first mourners showed up an hour early, exchanging hugs on the church steps.      A steady stream of the Badger family’s loved ones followed. And then came the entire Stamford, Conn., fire department, about 70 firefighters dressed crisply in dark suits and not saying a word.      Nearly 1,000 people were packed into the St. Thomas Episcopal Church in midtown by the time Madonna Badger rose to give a eulogy no mother should ever have to give.      Badger stepped up to the lectern and glanced at the three caskets arranged in front of her.      Her lips were trembling. The overflow crowd was silent.      Then, choking back sobs, the fashion ad exec told them about her three daughters, who were killed in a Christmas Day inferno at her Connecticut mansion, along with her mom and dad.      “My little girls are not gone from us entirely because my little girls are in my heart. Right here,” Badger said, motioning toward her chest.      “And this is where they live.”      Badger, flanked by church workers, had to walk around her girls’ mahogany caskets on her way to the dais. They sat side-by-side, topped with white and pink flowers.      The mourners, including designer Calvin Klein, actor Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Badger’s estranged husband, Matthew, dissolved in tears as she reminisced about her “little girl tribe.”      Badger described each of them one by one, stopping several times to compose herself. More than once, a church worker had to come forward to give the shattered mother a fresh tissue.      Nine-year-old Lily sang before she could speak and had a thousand-watt smile.      “Lily was naturally shy, but when she let her smile glow, it glowed completely,” Badger said.      Lily loved many things, Badger said, but nothing more than her 7-year-old twin sisters, Grace and Sarah.      “They were her best friends,” she said.      Sarah once passed out cookies at a nursing home. Afterward, she told her grandma, “Someone ought to tell the tooth fairy this is where she needs to bring the teeth because they really need her.”      Sarah often stayed up late talking to her mom — a memory that caused Badger to break down for several seconds.      “Sarah liked to lie with me at night and hold my hand and tell me how much she loved me,” Badger said.      Grace loved math and crafts, always building objects out of Band-Aids, and was curious about everything.      “For Christmas, Gracie wanted a telescope and microscope,” Badger said. “She wanted to see the seen and unseen.”      ‘Why my children?’      Badger recalled a particularly painful conversation she had with Grace years ago.      “Gracie asked a thousand times if she was going to die before me,” Badger said. “I said, ‘No. That’s never going to happen.’      “But it did, and I wonder why. Why my children? Why my parents?”      The firefighters’ eyes were wet with tears.      Many had responded to the massive blaze that engulfed Badger’s three-story Stamford, Conn., mansion about 4:50 a.m., but were unable to save her three girls and parents.      The bodies of the girls and their grandparents, Lomer and Pauline Johnson, were found on the top two floors.      Two of the children were found in separate parts of the home — one just a few feet away from her grandfather, the other near her grandmother.      Badger and her boyfriend, Michael Borcina, barely escaped. Both suffered injuries while trying to find the children amid the flames and thick smoke.      The inferno was ignited by a bag of embers from a Yule log that had been removed from the fireplace because the children were concerned Santa would be burned, authorities said.      After the 90-minute service, Badger let out a piercing wail as she walked out of the church, trailing behind the coffins.      “No mother should have to endure what she has endured,” said family friend Gillian Brandt, 55. “How she is finding the strength to go on . . . I just don’t know.”      rschapiro@nydailynews.com ||||| Matthew and Madonna Badger watch as the caskets carrying the bodies of their three daughters arrive for funeral services on Jan. 5, 2012 (John Moore/Getty Images)      By Sonja Sharp and Wil Cruz      DNAinfo Staff            MIDTOWN — Inconsolable mother Madonna Badger tearfully remembered her young daughters — who were killed along with her parents in a devastating Christmas Day fire at their Stamford, Conn. home — at their somber funeral Thursday as dancers, singers and little angels.      Badger, who escaped the horrific blaze along with her friend Michael Borcina, joined the girls' father Matthew Badger, and hundreds of mourners to say goodbye to Lily, 10, and twins Grace and Sarah, who were 7, at the St. Thomas Church on 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue.      \\"They were my little girl tribe,\\" said Badger as she choked back tears. \\"And I want you to hear about them from me.      \\"My girls are in my heart, and that is where they live now, and they live in me. I want to remember my girls out loud.\\"      The girls' father was so distraught that he could not speak. Instead, the priest, Rev. Dr. William Shillady read a heart-wrenching note to the rapt mourners, many of whom broke down during the service.      \\"A day with Lily was like a day with a beautiful song,\\" the dad said in the note. \\"She was so vulnerable and beautiful. She always wanted a grown up around her at night — in the end, she was right.\\"      The fatal fire, sparked by ashes from the fireplace that were left near the house, ripped through the 100-year-old building, trapping Badger's daughters and parents, Lormer and Pauline Johnson, inside.      Lormer Johnson, a former Saks Fifth Avenue Santa Claus, was found near the body of one of the girls and was believed to have been trying to save her, according to reports.      And in a tragic twist, investigators believe the ashes were removed so that the girls wouldn't worry about Santa coming down the chimney, the Associated Press said. They are also trying to determine if the house, which was under renovation, had working smoke detectors.      As the family processed behind the girls' identical coffins draped in lillies and other flowers, mourners moved into the aisle to embrace the grieving parents.      Several rows were packed with Stamford firefighters who fought desperately to free the trapped family but were pushed back by intense smoke and flames.      Madonna Badger, who once lived in Manhattan and was an art director for Calvin Klein, remembered her first daughter Lily as a shrinking violet who loved to sing and dance.      \\"Lily was the angel of my heart and my first baby,\\" Badger recalled. \\"She made up songs constantly.\\"      She loved dolls and her stuffed animals, \\"but most of all she loved her sisters,\\" Badger said.      The eldest girl had asked her mother about dying, Badger said. On a trip to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Lily, then 5-years-old, collapsed to the floor and begged her mom to tell her when she would die.      The funeral procession for Madonna Badger's family arrives at St. Thomas Church on 53rd Street and Fifth Avenue on Jan. 5, 2012. Badger's parents and three young daughters were killed in a fire on Christmas Day. (DNAinfo/Paul Lomax)      \\"I told her life is a mystery,\\" Badger said. \\"We never know when we're going to die. And she accepted that.\\"      One of Lily's friends, Audrey, 9, grave the grieving mom a poem she wrote entitled \\"Hope,\\" which she read aloud at the service.      Grace, a second grader, was the explorer of the three girls, who loved making crafts and excelled at math.      \\"For Christmas she wanted a microscope and a telescope,\\" said her heartbroken mom. \\"Grace asked me a thousand times if she was going to die before me. I said, 'No, No, that's never going to happen,' but it happened.\\"      Her inseparable twin Sarah was remembered as the social butterfly of the pair with a big heart — relishing the opportunity to pass out Christmas cookies at an old age home with her grandfather.      Sarah was so popular, in fact, that her schoolmates competed for her attention.      \\"The principal had to call a meeting of second grade girls so they could figure out how to take turns being close to Sarah,\\" Badger said.      But mostly, she was mommy's little girl.      \\"Sarah used to like to lie in my bed and tell me how much she loved me,\\" said a weeping Badger, who was consoled at the funeral by the girls' father Matthew Badger and Borcina.      \\"Sarah was so lovable and vibrant,\\" her dad said in his note. \\"She saw the goodness in all of us.\\"      Mourners — among whom were singer Lou Reed, actor Philip Seymour Hoffman and clothing mogul Calvin Klein — were touched by the Badgers' strength throughout the ordeal.      \\"I can't imagine how they're even standing up,\\" said James Gilroy, a family friend. \\"I thought what she said was just beautiful.\\"      As a parent himself, Gilroy said he could scarcely imagine losing a child, much less three.      \\"I have a little girl 11 years-old.\\" Gilroy said. \\"It's the worst thing I've ever heard.\\"      After the service ended, Madonna Badger wept loudly as she walked out of the church.      \\"Grace was fearless,\\" she said.      \\"Nothing will bring my parents back, or my children. In all this incomprehensible loss and chaos love is everything,\\" she said. \\"I used to say I could never ever live through losing my babies — but here I am.\\"      Donations in memory of the children can be made to The Other 364 Foundation.

Article: Before the opening of the Cape Cod Canal in 1914,the only way ships could leave Boston was on a route around Race Point--the northern tip of Cape Cod.However,navigation during the 18th century was a nightmare,because the floating cross current  around Race Point caused countless accidents.So building a lighthouse to lighten the place was very necessary. As early as 1808,the people of Provincetown requested a lighthouse on Race Point,but it took Congress eight years to react when they finally paid  8,000 on April 27,1816 to build a lighthouse --Race Point Light,which was located in the town of Provincetown,Massachusetts.It was first built of stone 25 feet high with no foundation and its light was 30 feet above the sea.It was equipped with one of the nation's earliest revolving lights. Actually,there were two other lighthouses on Cape Cod,but they were hit by a storm in October 1841.In the following year,Race Point Light was examined by I.W.P.Lewis,who realized the light's importance.He said,\\"The light should be useful to all ships leaving Boston.However,its _ power is so weak that people would hardly be able to differentiate it from the lights set on the ships which stay in the bay,or close by.It hasn't played its role as a lighthouse well.\\" The result was that old lighthouse was destroyed and a new iron lighthouse with a proper foundation was put up to take its place.The new lighthouse was 45 feet high.Although the original keeper's house was in good repair,it was destroyed too and a new one was built.Today the lighthouse has been automated and Race Point Light is still an active aid to navigation. You can park at Race Point Beach and walk about 45 minutes to the lighthouse.Sunset at Race Point Light is one of the Cape Cod's most popular scenes.And at times whales can be seen in the lighthouse.For reservations to stay one night in the keeper's house at Race Point call(508)487-9930.
