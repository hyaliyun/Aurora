PUBLISHED:. 15:01 EST, 19 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 18:11 EST, 19 December 2012. A NBA star has decided to give up his celebratory six-shooter gesture in the wake of the Sandy Hook school massacre. Joakim Noah, 27, who plays for the Chicago Red Bulls, has not used his trademark move since the attack last Friday where 20 children aged six and seven died along with six teaching staff. The player, who earned 11million this year, had celebrated success on the court by miming guns with his index fingers. Scroll down for video. Respect: Chicago Bulls' Joakim Noah reacts during an NBA basketball game against the Philadelphia 76ers on December 12, prior to the Sandy Hook school shootings. During the Bulls last game against Boston Celtics, which the Chicago team won 100-89, Noah did not once make the gesture - or at two other games in the past week. The player had been performing the celebration since the 2010-11 season. He told the New York Post: 'It was kind of like a funny, comical thing. But I guess we’re in a situation right now where it’s not funny.' He said that the high level of gun violence in Chicago added to his decision. On December 14, the star player tweeted: 'This is so f***** up... There needs to be some kind of gun control.. For real.' Joakim Noah has established a charity called Noah's Arc Foundation which helps underprivileged children through sports and arts programs. Tribute: The Bulls player has used the celebration for several seasons until last week when he said it was no longer a 'funny, comical thing' New York Giants receiver Victor Cruz has visited the home of the six-year-old Connecticut shooting victim who was buried in a replica of his jersey. Jack Pinto was among 20 children shot to death Friday in Newtown. Several elementary school-age children played touch football in the front yard of his family's home on Tuesday. Tribute: Victor Cruz's boots for Jack Pinto. Six-year-old Jack was a huge Giants fan and Cruz his favorite player. Many wore Giants jerseys or Newtown football or wrestling shirts as they laughed, smiled and hugged. The children and their families left after several hours. Young fans carried autographed Giants footballs and jerseys. About 45 minutes later, Cruz left the home in an SUV and an escort of five police cruisers, sirens blaring. He later tweeted that he has 'much love to the entire Pinto family. Great people with huge hearts'. Several people leaving the home confirmed Cruz was there. When the New York Giants took on the Atlanta Falcons this past Sunday, Cruz's boots were inscribed with the words 'Jack Pinto, My Hero', 'R.I.P. Jack Pinto' and 'This one is for you'. Cruz later said: 'There's no words that can describe the type of feeling that you get when a kid idolizes you so much that unfortunately they want to put him in the casket with your jersey on. 'I can't even explain it.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: Nogales, Arizona, is a small city. Just more than 20,000 people live here, according to the 2005 census. But spend a couple of days here with law enforcement, and your head will spin. Almost half of all illegal drugs seized from Mexico last year were seized in the eastern Arizona region, and Nogales is the largest border city in this U.S. border patrol sector. In the past six months, the Border Patrol has seized about 500,000 pounds of illegal drugs here, which is 15 percent higher than the previous six months. Each day, hundreds of people are arrested, mostly for immigration violations but many for drug and weapons crimes. The temporary jail cells in the Border Patrol station in Nogales are often overflowing. The Border Patrol boss in this sector says his agents were assaulted 260 times within the past year. One night this week, we saw the danger and variety of lawbreaking activity experienced here quite vividly. At the immigration checkpoint set up a half-hour north of Nogales on Interstate 19, a semi truck is pulled over when the drug-sniffing dog detects something. The back of the truck is opened, and inside are thousands of tomatoes, but the dog is still not happy. The truck is taken back to the Border Patrol station, and agents climb over the tomatoes. And that's where they find the stash. Bales and bales of dope. Forty bales of marijuana. Nine hundred eight pounds, to be exact. At a street value of 800 a pound, the authorities estimate they kept 720,000 worth of marijuana off the streets. I interview the man arrested for driving the shipment. The operating theory: that he is doing dirty work for one of the Mexican cartels. But the Mexican man tells me he is not scared, because \\"I was just carrying tomatoes.\\" He claims that he knew nothing about the nearly half-ton of pot. The man will be telling that to the judge and could face significant time in an American prison. Illegal drugs consume the day of all law enforcement people here. We drive with the Border Patrol in the late hours of the night and hear a call over the radio that two men have been spotted jumping the border wall with backpacks. The chase is on, and another dog is brought to the area. The men disappear, but the dog picks up a scent in the heavy, hilly brush. Sarah the drug-sniffing dog is taught to sit when she finds something. She suddenly sits and then jumps on what looks like bushes. It turns out the bushes are actually attached to sacks of marijuana. Two 25-pound sacks full of pot. They were abandoned by the men when they ran away after being spotted. Street value, at least 40,000. Ray Rivera, the agent who works with Sarah, told me that over the past two years, Sarah has found nearly 7,000 pounds of pot. But Rivera also is pretty heroic. Just a couple of weeks ago, he was shot in the leg when a man he was chasing committed suicide. The bullet passed through the man's face and into Rivera's knee. Law enforcement life here is not for the squeamish. Before we leave this area, we go to a rural area west of Nogales where we hear illegal immigrants and drug couriers often try to get into the United States. When we get there, we see why. The tall border fence abruptly ends as it gets close to a small mountain, but there is plenty of space for people to squeeze into the United States. We wander about 10 feet into Mexico to look at some of the clothes, water bottles and cigarette boxes that people have left behind. As we get ready to leave, we see a Border Patrol vehicle zooming towards us. They don't know we're with CNN; they think we may be criminals. One of the four agents points his rifle at us and demands that we keep our hands in plain sight. They search our car, and we tell them who we are and what we're doing. They say they spotted us because of their long-range video cameras. They tell us to give them a heads up next time we go exploring, and all is well. The agents did their job well. But there are only so many of them and an immense amount of border. After spending time with these agents, it's easy to see how sometimes what they do feels like a thankless task. Highlights:","output":"- Nogales, Arizona is the largest border city in the eastern Arizona region, with almost half of all illegal drugs seized from Mexico last year being confiscated there. - The Border Patrol has seized about 500,000 pounds of illegal drugs in the past six months, a 15% increase from the previous period.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. This article: The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949. Travancore and Cochin were merged in the middle of 1949 to form the princely union of Travancore-Cochin. The only princely states which signed neither Covenants of Merger nor Merger Agreements were Kashmir, Mysore and Hyderabad. contains an answer for the question: What are the names of the state that was formed when its last merger was completed on May 15 1948?, what is it ?

Evaluate the hypothesis components.    The hypothesis has two components:    - The person is currently raising children.    - The person is studying at NC State. 3. Compare the hypothesis components with the information from the premise.    - The first component of the hypothesis (raising children) contradicts the premise, which clearly states that the person does not have any children and having children would be inconvenient at this time.    - The second component of the hypothesis (studying at NC State) aligns with the information provided in the premise, as it states that the person is doing their Master's at NC State. 4.

He is strip-searched, photographed and questioned. After a while, a shadowy American (who is never named, but is nicknamed \\"Tex\\" by Billy due to his thick Texan accent) arrives, takes Billy to a police station and translates for Billy for one of the detectives. On questioning Billy tells them that he bought the hashish from a taxicab driver, and offers to help the police track him down in exchange for his release. Billy goes with the police to a nearby market and points out the cab driver, but when they go to arrest the cabbie, it becomes apparent that the police have no intention of keeping their end of the deal with Billy.

(CNN) -- Japan's prime minister conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday, signaling the return to power of the Liberal Democratic Party and ending the brief rule of the disappointing upstart Democratic Party of Japan. Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda pledged to step down as party president after exit polls showed a smashing loss in lower house voting. The party, once seen as a breath of fresh air in Japanese politics, came to be regarded as increasingly ineffective. \\"We got a regrettable result,\\" Noda said. \\"The result is everything in the politics. The biggest responsibility lies on me. I will quit as the partly leader of DPJ.\\" The move clears the way for the return to power of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the current leader of the conservative-leaning Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP. \\"The Japanese people will be keenly looking whether the LDP can meet with their expectations,\\" Abe said in interviews after the polling. The LDP ruled the country almost continuously since its establishment in 1955 until it was forced from power three years ago by the DPJ. Public broadcaster NHK said the LDP and its coalition partner, the new Komei party, gained at least 302 seats in the 480-seat lower house. CNN's main affiliate, TV Asahi, reports the LDP/Komei coalition gained at least 312 seats. The official count is expected to be released Monday. The LDP is inheriting a struggling economy, regional tensions and questions over Japan's role in Asia. \\"The economy is at the bottom. It's our first mission to turn it around,\\" Abe said.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\\" correctly answer the question \\"Who said they would quit as party leader of DPJ?\\"?","output":"No, the response \\"Prime Minister Shinzo Abe\\" does not correctly answer the question \\"Who said they would quit as party leader of DPJ?\\".

Q: What determines which type of precipitation falls?    Choices:  - air pressure  - air currents  - ground temperature  - air temperature  A: The answer to this question is:","output":"air temperature. The type of precipitation that falls, such as rain, snow, sleet, or freezing rain, is primarily determined by the air temperature at different altitudes, as well as at the ground level.  Here's a brief explanation: 1. Rain: Rain occurs when the air temperature remains above freezing (0°C, 32°F) throughout the entire atmosphere, from the cloud level down to the ground. The precipitation falls as liquid droplets. 2. Snow: Snow forms when the air temperature is below freezing at the cloud level and remains below freezing down to the ground. Water vapor in the clouds freezes into ice crystals, which then collect and stick together to form snowflakes. 3. Sleet: Sleet, also known as ice pellets, occurs when snowflakes pass through a shallow layer of air with temperatures above freezing and partially melt. The snowflakes then encounter a lower layer of subfreezing air just above the ground, causing the melted portion to refreeze into small ice pellets. 4. Freezing rain: Freezing rain is caused by a similar process to sleet. However, the layer of air with temperatures above freezing is thicker, causing the snowflakes to melt entirely into raindrops. When the raindrops reach the ground or other surfaces below freezing, they freeze upon contact and create a layer of ice. While these are the primary factors that determine the type of precipitation, other elements such as air pressure, air currents, and ground temperature can play roles in the development and intensity of precipitation events. Nonetheless, air temperature remains the most critical factor in determining the type of precipitation that falls."},{"instruction":"Q: Casey came to school, but forgot the presentation.

Answer the following question: Article: As for older people, some of the applications are hard to use because they didn't grow up with them. They don't have simple models of how it should work. They don't know what to do when it doesn't work. I think there is huge potential, so I have designed some for them. The ability to connect to friends, who remember the same movies, news and music, is really important, especially as people get older. They end up in retirement homes and they aren't always close to their friends. Allowing the network to help them connect with friends  and family members is a really powerful thing. My wife likes using the Internet, although it took me years to get her to use e-mail. She was born with normal hearing, but lost it when she was three years old. She was totally deaf for many years until 53 when she got ear implants .They work really well. That is a big change for her. Before then, her friends couldn't call her on the phone, so they insisted that she use e-mails to communicate with them. The younger people don't even think of this as technology. It's just there, and they use it .There's been a very interesting change in communication styles between the old and the young .A woman named Sharryturkle wrote about this phenomenon .There are some kids who are now in their teens and are tending not to make phone calls. And they think of e-mail as old-fashioned and slow. The reason why teens don't make phone calls seems to be that they don't know what to say. When they call they often pause for a while. On the other hand, texting is considered proper, and it's OK if you don't answer. You might have been distracted .It's not considered rude, but it's considered unusual if you're in this kind of voice conversation and simply stop talling. Question: What is the best way for the teens to communicate with others? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Sending text messages.\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, according to the information in the article, it seems that the preferred method of communication for teenagers is texting. The author points out that some teenagers find phone calls to be awkward due to pauses in conversation and uncertainty about what to say, which suggests that they may feel more comfortable sending text messages instead. Another crucial point mentioned is that, unlike with voice conversations, it's considered socially acceptable not to reply immediately to a text message – it could be understood that the recipient was distracted. Therefore, based on the author's observations, it can be inferred that texting could be the best way for teens to communicate with others."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Generate a question about the topic \\"IEEE 1394\\" whose answer would be: The IEEE 1394 interface is a serial bus interface standard for high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data transfer..

If the question isn't answerable, please output \\"Can't answer\\". Question: In what year is the movie set? Title: Good Night, and Good Luck. Movie plot: Set in 1953, during the early days of television broadcast journalism. Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and his dedicated staff â headed by his co-producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and reporter Joseph Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr.) in the CBS newsroomâdefy corporate and sponsorship pressures, and discredit the tactics used by Joseph McCarthy during his crusade to root out Communist elements within the government. Murrow first defends Milo Radulovich, who is facing separation from the U.S. Air Force because of his sister's political leanings and because his father is subscribed to a Serbian newspaper. Murrow makes a show on McCarthy attacking him. A very public feud develops when McCarthy responds by accusing Murrow of being a communist. Murrow is accused of having been a member of the leftist union Industrial Workers of the World, which Murrow claimed was false. In this climate of fear and reprisal, the CBS crew carries on and their tenacity ultimately strikes a historic blow against McCarthy. Historical footage also shows the questioning of Annie Lee Moss, a Pentagon communication worker accused of being a communist based on her name appearing on a list seen by an FBI infiltrator of the American Communist Party. The film's subplots feature Joseph and Shirley Wershba, recently married staffers, having to hide their marriage to save their jobs at CBS as well as the suicide of Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) who had been accused in print of being a Communist. The film is framed by performance of the speech given by Murrow to the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1958, in which Murrow harshly admonishes his audience not to squander the potential of television to inform and educate the public, so that it does not become only \\"wires and lights in a box\\".[2] Answer:","output":"The movie \\"Good Night, and Good Luck\\" is set in 1953."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

Context: In intelligent mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum is larger relative to the rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be highly intelligent, as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that. Jody had borrowed someone's correction fluid -- in fact it was Mr Dickinson, the teacher's correction fluid -- but it was borrowed from someone who'd borrowed it from him.

Process:  - You inhale - Your diaphragm moves down - Your lungs have more room - Your lungs fill with air - You exhale - Your diaphragm moves back up - Carbon dioxide is exhaled - You start the process over again.  suppose air is cleared in the lung happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process","output":"If the air is cleared in the lung, meaning the lungs are not retaining as much inhaled air as they should, this will lead to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. The supposed perturbation in this case would be directly impacting a step of the process.  Here's a detailed explanation: The process of respiration, as described above, involves inhaling oxygen-rich air into the lungs and exhaling carbon dioxide. The oxygen inhaled is needed to supply the body's tissues and cells with the required amount of oxygen, while the carbon dioxide, a waste product, is removed from the body through exhalation.  When the air in the lungs is cleared, it indicates that the lungs may not be holding and processing the inhaled air optimally. This can be due to the collapsing of air sacs (alveoli) or other issues like lung damage or respiratory illnesses, which directly impact the critical step of gas exchange. Gas exchange is the process where oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide from the bloodstream diffuses into the lungs to be exhaled. The efficiency of gas exchange depends on factors like lung surface area, the thickness of the respiratory membrane, and the partial pressure difference of the gases. If the air is cleared, and the lungs are less effective in exchanging gas, it leads to a direct impact on the process of respiratory gas exchange. As a result, a smaller amount of oxygen is delivered to the bloodstream. This can cause the body's tissues and cells to receive an inadequate amount of oxygen, which may lead to hypoxia or reduced oxygen supply to meet the body's needs. This can further affect cellular metabolism and overall organ function. In summary, the supposed perturbation in the given scenario of the air being cleared in the lung is directly impacting a step of the process, specifically the step involving the gas exchange in the alveoli of the lung. This direct impact causes a smaller amount of oxygen to be delivered to the bloodstream, leading to reduced oxygen availability for the body's cells and tissues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work.  The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Sir John Alexander Macdonald (11 January 1815  6 June 1891) was the first Prime Minister of Canada (18671873, 18781891). The dominant figure of Canadian Confederation, he had a political career which spanned almost half a century. He drank heavily, and in 1873 was voted out during the Pacific Scandal, in which his party took bribes from businessmen seeking the contract to build the Pacific Railway. Macdonald's greatest achievements were building and guiding a successful national government for the new Dominion, using patronage to forge a strong Conservative Party, promoting the protective tariff of the National Policy, and building the transcontinental Canadian Pacific Railway. Economic growth was slow during his years in office, as Canada verged on stagnation; many residents migrated to the fast-growing United States. He fought to block provincial efforts to take power back from Ottawa. His most controversial move was to approve the execution of Métis leader Louis Riel for treason in 1885; it alienated many Francophones.  - Charles Joseph \\"Joe\\" Clark, (born June 5, 1939) is a Canadian statesman, businessman, writer, and politician who served as the 16th Prime Minister of Canada, from June 4, 1979, to March 3, 1980.  - Joseph Philippe Pierre Yves Elliott Trudeau (; October 18, 1919  September 28, 2000), better known as Pierre Trudeau or Pierre Elliott Trudeau, was a Canadian politician who served as the 15th Prime Minister of Canada from 19681979 and 19801984. He is the 3rd longest-serving Prime Minister in Canadian history (behind William Lyon Mackenzie King and John A. Macdonald), having served for 15 years, 164 days.  - The Conservative Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Tories, is a political party in Canada. It is positioned on the right of the Canadian political spectrum. The party's leader from 2004 to 2015 was Stephen Harper, who served as Prime Minister from 2006 to 2015.  - The Liberal Party of Canada, colloquially known as the Grits, is the oldest federal political party in Canada. The party espouses the principles of liberalism, and generally sits at the centre of the Canadian political spectrum. The Liberal Party is traditionally positioned to the left of the Conservative Party of Canada and to the right of the New Democratic Party (NDP).  - The Canadian federal election of 1979 was held on May 22 , 1979 to elect members of the Canadian House of Commons of the 31st Parliament of Canada . It resulted in the defeat of the Liberal Party of Canada after 11 years in power under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau . Joe Clark led the Progressive Conservative Party to power , but with only a minority of seats in the House of Commons . The Liberals , however , did beat the Progressive Conservatives in the overall popular vote by more than 400,000 votes .  - William Lyon Mackenzie King (December 17, 1874  July 22, 1950) was the dominant Canadian political leader from the 1920s through the 1940s. He served as the tenth Prime Minister of Canada from 1921 to 1926, 1926 to 1930, and 1935 to 1948. He is best known for his leadership of Canada throughout the Second World War (19391945) when he mobilized Canadian money, supplies and volunteers to support Britain while boosting the economy and maintaining home front morale. A Liberal with 21 years and 154 days in office, he was the longest-serving prime minister in Canadian history. Trained in law and social work, he was keenly interested in the human condition (as a boy, his motto was \\"Help those that cannot help themselves\\"), and played a major role in laying the foundations of the Canadian welfare state.  - The New Democratic Party (NDP NPD) is a social-democratic political party in Canada. The leader of the federal wing of the NDP is Thomas Mulcair, who was elected in the 2012 leadership election, led the party through the 2015 federal election and then lost a party leadership review on April 10, 2016.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Avenged Sevenfold (sometimes abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. The band's influences include Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Pantera, Bad Religion, Dream Theater, Motorhead, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, In Flames, At the Gates, Helloween, Queensryche, System of a Down, AC/DC, NOFX, Alice in Chains, Black Flag, Corrosion of Conformity, Suicidal Tendencies, Misfits, Slayer, The Vandals, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Slipknot, Deftones, Beastie Boys, Biohazard, Type O Negative, Anthrax and AFI.  The band has been categorized under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music has evolved over most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in \\"Streets\\", which shows a punk rock style, and \\"Warmness on the Soul\\", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: \\"When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'.\\"  On City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold's third album, the band chose to abandon the metalcore genre, using a more hard rock and heavy metal style. Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled album, however, has some experiments with other music genres than that from City of Evil, most notably in \\"Dear God\\", which shows a country style and \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\", which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. Nightmare contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called \\"Fiction\\", progressive metal-oriented track \\"Save Me\\" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on \\"God Hates Us\\". The band's sixth studio album Hail to the King shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their newest album The Stage, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. In the past, Avenged Sevenfold has also been described as alternative metal, screamo, and pop punk metal.  The band has been criticized for \\"not being metal enough\\". Vocalist M. Shadows responded to this with, \\"we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough. Who cares?\\" Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.

Q:This article: On the battlefield, the king's commanders led the troops. The empire's war strategy rarely involved massive invasions; more often it employed small scale methods such as attacking and destroying individual forts. The empire was among the first in India to use long range artillery commonly manned by foreign gunners (those from present day Turkmenistan were considered the best). Army troops were of two types: The king's personal army directly recruited by the empire and the feudal army under each feudatory. King Krishnadevaraya's personal army consisted of 100,000 infantry, 20,000 cavalrymen and over 900 elephants. This number was only a part of the army numbering over 1.1 million soldiers, a figure that varied as an army of two million has also been recorded along with the existence of a navy as evidenced by the use of the term Navigadaprabhu (commander of the navy). The army recruited from all classes of society (supported by the collection of additional feudal tributes from feudatory rulers), and consisted of archers and musketeers wearing quilted tunics, shieldmen with swords and poignards in their girdles, and soldiers carrying shields so large that no armour was necessary. The horses and elephants were fully armoured and the elephants had knives fastened to their tusks to do maximum damage in battle.The capital city was completely dependent on the water supply systems constructed to channel and store water, ensuring a consistent supply throughout the year. The remains of these hydraulic systems have given historians a picture of the prevailing surface water distribution methods in use at that time in the semiarid regions of South India.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the most damaging loss to the British and the standing of their empire? ?  Britain's declaration of war against Nazi Germany in September 1939 included the Crown colonies and India but did not automatically commit the Dominions of Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland and South Africa. All soon declared war on Germany, but Ireland chose to remain legally neutral throughout the war.After the Fall of France in June 1940, Britain and the empire stood alone against Germany, until the German invasion of Greece on 7 April 1941. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill successfully lobbied President Franklin D. Roosevelt for military aid from the United States, but Roosevelt was not yet ready to ask Congress to commit the country to war. In August 1941, Churchill and Roosevelt met and signed the Atlantic Charter, which included the statement that \\"the rights of all peoples to choose the form of government under which they live\\" should be respected. This wording was ambiguous as to whether it referred to European countries invaded by Germany and Italy, or the peoples colonised by European nations, and would later be interpreted differently by the British, Americans, and nationalist movements.In December 1941, Japan launched, in quick succession, attacks on British Malaya, the United States naval base at Pearl Harbor, and Hong Kong. Churchill's reaction to the entry of the United States into the war was that Britain was now assured of victory and the future of the empire was safe, but the manner in which British forces were rapidly defeated in the Far East irreversibly harmed Britain's standing and prestige as an imperial power. Most damaging of all was the Fall of Singapore, which had previously been hailed as an impregnable fortress and the eastern equivalent of Gibraltar. The realisation that Britain could not defend its entire empire pushed Australia and New Zealand, which now appeared threatened by Japanese forces, into closer ties with the United States. This resulted in the 1951 ANZUS Pact between Australia, New Zealand and the United States of America.

Which continent experienced wind phenomena?  Two continents were separated by a large ocean. Oceania had milder weather and experienced common weather phenomena, while Lemuria experienced natural disasters.  Hint: On Earth, the common weather phenomena include wind, cloud, rain, snow, fog and dust storms. Less common events include natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, typhoons and ice storms. Almost all familiar weather phenomena occur in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere).  Weather does occur in the stratosphere and can affect weather lower down in the troposphere, but the exact mechanisms are poorly understood.Weather occurs primarily due to  air pressure, temperature and moisture differences between one place to another.  These differences can occur due to the sun angle at any particular spot, which varies by latitude from the tropics. In other words, the farther from the tropics one lies, the lower the sun angle is, which causes those locations to be cooler due the spread of the sunlight over a greater surface.   The strong temperature contrast between polar and tropical air gives rise to the large scale atmospheric circulation cells and the jet stream.  Weather systems in the mid-latitudes, such as extratropical cyclones, are caused by instabilities of the jet stream flow (see baroclinity).  Weather systems in the tropics, such as monsoons or organized thunderstorm systems, are caused by different processes. The answer to this question is:","output":"Oceania experienced wind phenomena."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Hoping to rebound from their last-second home loss to the Panthers, the Chargers flew to Invesco Field at Mile High for a Week 2 AFC West duel with the Denver Broncos.  In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as FB Michael Pittman getting a 1-yard TD run, after a Philip Rivers pass to Chris Chambers was ruled an interception on the field. The Chargers challenged the ruling, but the replay system was inoperative to the officials, so the ruling on the field stood.  The 'Bolts would respond with kicker Nate Kaeding getting a 34-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Denver increased its lead with QB Jay Cutler completing a 3-yard and a 14-yard TD pass to TE Tony Scheffler.  San Diego would immediately respond with RB Darren Sproles returning a kickoff 103 yard for a touchdown, yet the Broncos replied with kicker Matt Prater getting a 52-yard field goal.  The Chargers would strike at Denver's lead as QB Philip Rivers completing a 48-yard TD pass to WR Chris Chambers, yet the Broncos would end the half with Cutler completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR Brandon Marshall. In the third quarter, the 'Bolts began to rally as Rivers completed a 15-yard TD pass to Chambers, along with Kaeding nailing a 21-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, San Diego took the lead with Kaeding's 28-yard field goal and Rivers' 66-yard TD pass to Sproles.  However, Denver responded with a 12-play, 80-yard drive (which included a second controversial officiating call that turned a game-winning fumble into an incomplete pass) that concluded with Cutler completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR Eddie Royal, including Cutler's 2-point conversion pass to Royal.

English football star Steven Gerrard has admitted punching a man in a bar, but the Liverpool captain insisted in his court testimony that it was in self-defense. England international Steven Gerrard is in court defending his actions after a bar brawl late last year. The 29-year-old is facing a charge of affray after an incident in the early hours of December 29, when he attacked businessman Marcus McGee following a dispute about the music that was being played. If found guilty, Gerrard faces a maximum penalty of six months in jail and a fine of 7,200. Gerrard, who denies the charge, told a judge on Thursday that he was sorry about his actions in Southport's Lounge Inn, but at the time he thought McGee was going to attack him. They had been involved in an argument after Gerrard tried to change the music on the bar's sound system, but McGee would not let him, the UK Press Association reported. \\"I thought he was going to hit me,\\" Gerrard said. \\"He was on his way forward to me and his behavior had changed from when I was having a discussion with him. I didn't know why.\\" Gerrard said he was unaware that his friend John Doran had already punched McGee when he himself started to hit the 34-year-old. \\"I am certainly mistaken in thinking he was coming towards me to throw punches at me,\\" the midfielder said. \\"Now I know, obviously, he had been struck, reacted and thought the strike was by me and he came into me and that's when I reacted. I am sorry about the whole incident. \\"I grabbed the back of his jumper as he moved forward to me. When I had hold of Marcus, I remember swinging my right hand two or three times. \\"I was trying to stop still and I felt I had arms all over me. I could see a melee around Marcus McGee. When I was getting pulled away I realized people were patting me, some of whom were my friends. \\"I wanted to help control the situation. I was worried the fight I had with Marcus was going to get worse because people were going past me in that direction.\\" Gerrard said that his friends had earlier told him to \\"forget\\" the argument, but he felt he needed to confront McGee. \\"I couldn't understand why the guy had such a problem with me, why he was so aggressive,\\" he said. \\"I was also concerned that if I did leave it I would not have been able to enjoy my night, he may have come over to me. \\"I wanted to see why he had such a problem with it, why a total stranger had such a problem with me putting my favorite songs on. I asked why I couldn't have an input in the music and tried to explain that I had permission from the manageress.\\" \\"I asked Marcus what was the problem with the music machine and why he treated me like that. Very quickly he came off the bar stool and was in my face right by me.\\" Gerrard had been celebrating after scoring two goals as Liverpool thrashed Newcastle 5-1 to remain top of the Premier League, and admitted that he had been drinking alcohol. \\"I certainly knew I had had a drink.

Let shareholders decide One proposal that makes more sense came Monday from Starboard Value, another activist fund that has bought 5.5 percent of Darden and sided with Barington. Starboard has asked shareholders to call a special meeting to have Darden shareholders vote on the merits of a Red Lobster spin. It would take 50 percent support simply to call a special meeting, and even if shareholders vote against the Red Lobster deal, management can technically forge ahead with it. But shareholders should call for a meeting—whether they like the Red Lobster proposal or not. The reason is that if the Red Lobster deal scares off activist investors entirely, management will avoid a serious discussion with shareholders about how to best create value. Left to its own devices, management has a poor track record. Since the start of 2011, Darden shares are up just 9 percent while the S&P 500 has risen nearly 47 percent and Chili's owner Brinker International has gained 152 percent. A big problem has been a slowdown in sales, which put Darden's profit margins under pressure thanks to its inflated cost base. Things don't appear to be getting much better, with analysts expecting same-restaurant sales to decline 1.7 percent at Darden in the year through May. (Read more: Did investors miss the message on BlackBerry?) Shareholders may not love every aspect of the activists' proposals. But the activists are important because they are likely to suggest ideas that management hasn't. And if the activists propose their own board directors at the annual meeting, management will feel pressure to entertain any ideas that appeal to shareholders. First, Darden could probably remove significant costs. In the year through May 2013, Darden spent 205,145 per store in general and administrative expenses. That compares with just 153,407 per store for Brinker in its most recent fiscal year. There's reason to believe Darden's costs could be at least as low as Brinker's given it has a much larger store base, which creates economies of scale. If Darden could reach Brinker's level of so-called G&A per store, it would save 111 million per year, substantial for a company expected to earn 338 million in net income in the year through May. Darden's Red Lobster plan, by comparison, includes just 60 million of annual cost savings by 2015. Also, Darden has made no mention of plans to franchise its store base, which is entirely company-owned. Such deals have been successful for fast-food chains like Jack in the Box that have made such a switch. Analysts expect Jack in the Box to have an operating profit of 180 million in the year through September, up 50 percent from two years earlier. There also are ways for Darden to extract value from its real estate without placing all of it into a REIT. One alternative is to sell select properties and then lease them back. Darden probably has a range of options for creating more shareholder value. But if investors allow the company to keep too much control, they may never get to see the real menu.

Article: Recently a specialist  in teenager studies does some research on teenage problems. He thinks parents shouldn't be blamed of themselves because there is nothing they can do to deal with the teenage problem. Whatever they do, sometimes a wonderful, kind and helpful child will turn into a terrible animal. I've seen friends deal with _ in all kinds of different ways. One strict mother insisted that her son, should stand up, open doors and shake hands like a gentleman whenever anyone entered the room. I saw him last week when I visited them. Lying on the sofa, he made no attempt to turn off the loud TV he was watching as I walked in. His mother was angry. \\"I don't know what to do with him these days,\\" she said. \\"He's forgotten all the manners we taught him.\\" He hasn't forgotten them. He's just decided that he's not going to use them. She said that she would like to throw him down from the sofa onto the floor. Another good friend of mine let her two daughters climb all over the furniture, reach across the table, stare at me and say, \\"I don't like your dress, it's ugly.\\" One of the daughters has recently been driven out of school. The other has left home. \\"Where did we go wrong?\\" Her parents are now very sad. Probably nothing is wrong with the parents. Question: What is the author's opinion about the sudden change in teenage children? - Parents have no choice but to try to accept it. - Parents should pay more attention to the change. - Parents should work more closely with school teachers. - Parents are a fault for the change in their children.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person that performed on the Sound+Vision Tour? is inside the article: Bowie shelved his solo career in 1989, retreating to the relative anonymity of band membership for the first time since the early 1970s. A hard-rocking quartet, Tin Machine came into being after Bowie began to work experimentally with guitarist Reeves Gabrels. The line-up was completed by Tony and Hunt Sales, whom Bowie had known since the late 1970s for their contribution, on bass and drums respectively, to Iggy Pop's 1977 album Lust for Life. Although he intended Tin Machine to operate as a democracy, Bowie dominated, both in songwriting and in decision-making. The band's album debut, Tin Machine (1989), was initially popular, though its politicised lyrics did not find universal approval: Bowie described one song as \\"a simplistic, naive, radical, laying-it-down about the emergence of Neo-Nazis\\"; in the view of biographer Christopher Sandford, \\"It took nerve to denounce drugs, fascism and TV ... in terms that reached the literary level of a comic book.\\" EMI complained of \\"lyrics that preach\\" as well as \\"repetitive tunes\\" and \\"minimalist or no production\\". The album nevertheless reached No. 3 and went gold in the UK.Tin Machine's first world tour was a commercial success, but there was growing reluctance—among fans and critics alike—to accept Bowie's presentation as merely a band member. A series of Tin Machine singles failed to chart, and Bowie, after a disagreement with EMI, left the label. Like his audience and his critics, Bowie himself became increasingly disaffected with his role as just one member of a band. Tin Machine began work on a second album, but Bowie put the venture on hold and made a return to solo work. Performing his early hits during the seven-month Sound+Vision Tour, he found commercial success and acclaim once again.In October 1990, a decade after his divorce from Angie, Bowie and Somali-born supermodel Iman were introduced by a mutual friend. Bowie recalled, \\"I was naming the children the night we met ... it was absolutely immediate.\\" They married in 1992. Tin Machine resumed work the..., can you guess it ?

But, really, they were just unable to do what regarding reality and lies? Options: - differentiate - hate - discriminate - contrast - distinguish  Explain why a human would choose \\"distinguish\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"distinguish\\" to answer the question above because it appropriately captures the underlying meaning and context of the situation being described. In this case, the man and the woman are comparing their experience to police brutality, which suggests that they have a certain perception or understanding of their situation. However, the question implies that their comparison may not be accurate and that there is a discrepancy between their perception and the actual reality. The word \\"distinguish\\" refers to the ability to recognize or identify differences between two things, in this instance, reality and lies. It implies that the man and the woman are unable to accurately differentiate between what is true and what is false in their situation or that they are having difficulty discerning the reality of their experience. Using the other options provided as answers to the question would not yield the same level of clarity or understanding: 1. \\"Differentiate\\" could potentially work as an answer as well, but \\"distinguish\\" is more fitting when describing someone's ability to perceive differences in qualities or characteristics, in this case, between reality and lies. 2. \\"Hate\\" does not fit the context of the question as it refers to strong negative emotions or feelings of aversion and enmity towards something or someone, rather than recognizing differences or separating reality from lies. 3. \\"Discriminate\\" is more commonly associated with unfairly treating people or things based on unjust criteria, such as race, gender, or social status. It is not directly related to the issue of distinguishing between reality and lies in this context. 4. \\"Contrast\\" is a term that often involves comparing two distinct elements to emphasize their differences, but it does not inherently involve the process of recognizing or discerning those differences from one another in the way that \\"distinguish\\" does. In conclusion, the human would choose \\"distinguish\\" to answer the question because it conveys the most accurate meaning with regard to the inability of the man and woman to separate reality from lies in their situation. The nuance and context provided by the term \\"distinguish\\" make it the most appropriate word among the options provided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill Clinton was in trouble for \\"not having sexual relations with that woman\\" - who was that woman?","output":"The woman referenced in the quote, \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman,\\" is Monica Lewinsky. Former President Bill Clinton made this statement during a press conference on January 26, 1998, responding to allegations about his extramarital affair during his presidency. Monica Lewinsky was a 22-year-old unpaid intern in the White House when she and President Clinton began having a series of intimate encounters in 1995, some of which occurred in the Oval Office. The affair lasted until 1997 and was revealed to the public in 1998.  Lewinsky, a graduate of Lewis & Clark College, moved to Washington D.C. to take an internship at the White House in July 1995. She was later given a paid position in the White House Office of Legislative Affairs. Following rumors of her relationship with Clinton, she was transferred to the Pentagon. This affair came to light when Linda Tripp, a former White House employee, provided taped phone conversations between herself and Lewinsky to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. President Clinton initially denied the affair publicly. He stated, \\"I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky,\\" in a nationally televised White House news conference. However, evidence of the relationship emerged, including a blue dress of Monica's that was stained with Clinton's DNA.  Following this revelation, President Clinton testified before a grand jury (via closed-circuit television) in August 1998, becoming the first sitting president to testify before a grand jury investigating his own conduct. During his testimony, he admitted an \\"improper physical relationship\\" with Lewinsky. This led to an impeachment process in December 1998 by the US House of Representatives on the grounds of perjury to a grand jury and obstruction of justice. However, he was acquitted of all impeachment charges by the Senate in February 1999. Monica Lewinsky's life was heavily impacted by the scandal and the public ridicule that followed. She eventually moved to London, where she earned a master's degree in social psychology from the London School of Economics, and has since worked as a social activist championing for a safer and more compassionate social media environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the best way to: How can I keep a bandana in place in my hair?","output":"Keeping a bandana in place in your hair can be a stylish and practical choice, whether you are trying to manage your hair during a workout, protect it from the sun, or simply create a fun and fashionable look. Here are some steps and tips for ensuring your bandana stays securely in place throughout the day: 1. Choose the right bandana: Select a bandana that is made from a comfortable, durable, and non-slip material, such as cotton. A bandana with some texture or grip can help prevent it from sliding off your hair more easily. The size should be large enough to fold and tie securely around your head. 2. Prepare your hair: The way your hair is styled can impact how securely the bandana stays in place. To provide a more stable base, consider putting your hair up in a ponytail, bun, or braid, depending on your hair length and type. For shorter hairstyles, you can use bobby pins to help secure shorter strands in place. 3. Fold the bandana: Lay the bandana flat on a surface with its pattern or design facing down. Fold it in half diagonally to create a triangle. Depending on the size of the bandana and the look you desire, you can fold it into a thinner or wider strip by either folding the long edge of the triangle over towards the point or by rolling the bandana. 4. Securely tie the bandana: Position the bandana on your head with the folded edge facing outwards to create a smoother look. Make sure the bandana covers your hairline, as this will help keep it in place. Hold the folded edge against your forehead with one hand and use the other hand to wrap the two ends of the bandana around to the back of your head. Cross the two ends, then bring them back to your forehead and tie them in a secure knot. For added stability, consider double-knotting the ends. It's important not to tie the bandana too tightly, as this can result in discomfort or even headaches. 5. Tuck in loose ends: Once you’ve tied the bandana, tuck any loose ends underneath the knot to give a neater appearance. If any part of the bandana feels loose or begins to slip, you can use bobby pins to anchor it to your hair. 6. Apply hairspray (optional): If you find that the bandana still tends to slip, lightly misting your hair with hairspray before placing the bandana on your head can provide additional grip. 7. Adjust throughout the day: Make sure to periodically check your bandana and adjust it as needed throughout the day to prevent slipping and maintain your desired hairstyle. By following these steps and tips, you can successfully keep a bandana in place in your hair, allowing you to enjoy its stylish and practical benefits all day long."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which people send someone to steal a device from the Avenger's headquarters? ?  In 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out. Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the Avengers' headquarters, where he briefly fights Sam Wilson.

The Greeks and Romans identified the region in the 3rd century BC as Gangaridai , a mighty kingdom of the historical subcontinent .","output":"While the two sentences appear to be very similar at first glance, there are subtle differences in their meaning due to the placement of the adjectives \\"mighty\\" and \\"historical.\\" Let's analyze each sentence closely to understand these differences. 1. The Greeks and Romans identified the region in the 3rd century BC as Gangaridai, a historical kingdom of the mighty subcontinent. In this sentence, the phrase \\"historical kingdom\\" emphasizes the age and antiquity of the kingdom of Gangaridai. The adjective \\"mighty\\" modifies the word \\"subcontinent,\\" suggesting that the subcontinent itself is strong and powerful. Thus, this sentence implies that Gangaridai is an ancient kingdom located within a large, powerful, and expansive subcontinent. 2. The Greeks and Romans identified the region in the 3rd century BC as Gangaridai, a mighty kingdom of the historical subcontinent. In this sentence, the adjective \\"mighty\\" modifies the kingdom of Gangaridai rather than the subcontinent. This suggests that Gangaridai itself was a powerful and influential kingdom in its time. The use of \\"historical subcontinent\\" emphasizes the age and historical significance of the subcontinent as a whole, rather than focusing on the kingdom of Gangaridai specifically. In summary, while both sentences convey that the Greeks and Romans identified a region called Gangaridai in the 3rd century BC, the emphasis on which aspects were considered powerful or historical varies in each sentence. The first sentence focuses on the historical nature of Gangaridai within a powerful subcontinent, whereas the second sentence highlights Gangaridai as a mighty kingdom within a historically significant subcontinent."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Determine the starting and ending years of the actor's career. 3. Calculate the number of decades their career spanned. Step 1: Identify the American actor who starred in \\"The Happy Ending.\\" \\"The Happy Ending\\" (1969) is a movie directed by Richard Brooks, and the American actor who starred in it is Jean Simmons. Step 2: Determine the starting and ending years of the actor's career. Jean Simmons was born in 1929 and started her acting career when she was 14 in the film \\"Give us the Moon\\" (1944). She continued to act until 2009 when she appeared in her final film, \\"Shadows in the Sun.\\"  Step 3: Calculate the number of decades her career spanned. Jean Simmons' career started in 1944 and ended in 2009. To calculate the number of decades, we should find the number of years her career spanned and then divide it by 10. 2009 - 1944 = 65 years Now, we will divide the number of years by 10 to get the number of decades. 65 years ÷ 10 = 6.5 decades Jean Simmons' acting career spanned 6.5 decades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If you’re like us, you have an extra pumpkin around the house right now. I’d like to challenge you to Thirty Days of Thankfulness for the month of November. By the end of the month, you’ll have one thankful pumpkin on display to kick off the holidays! You’ll also have a family that realizes they have much to be thankful for! I thought of this idea one year when I was visiting family. I was trying to think of a way to use a little pumpkin that my niece and nephew had for decoration. So we sat around the table and tried to list everything we were thankful for. As they contributed, I wrote keywords with a marker all over the pumpkin. Even when we were done with our brainstorming activity, they would think of things to add to our thankful pumpkin. It’s a simple yet meaningful activity that encourages children (and adults) to find things they are grateful for in their lives. When you’re not writing on it, place the pumpkin in a spot where everyone can see it every day. It serves as a reminder, not only for all the good things in life, but also to continue the challenge with quality family discussions. If you made these decorative pumpkins, and don’t want to save them, you could paint them a neutral color and write or paint all over them too. We’re going to use a regular picked-from-the-patch pumpkin in our house. The following document gives brief instructions for this activity. You can clip it to the fridge for this year and/or file it away for next year if you’d like. Or, you can make the conversation more interesting by cutting out the prompt strips from the document and placing them in a jar or container. Each day when you sit down to write on your thankful pumpkin, you can have your child choose a strip to start the discussion. Question: What did they write?

The Ponte di Rialto is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Venice and one of the most iconic landmarks of the Italian city. Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. After the end of this story, Rialto Bridge's is probably: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. still new  B. In need of renovations  C.

(September 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) A group of college friends consisted of Harvey, Nikki, Rob, Skip, Nan, Chaz, Kit, and Archâgather, celebrate spring break by spending the weekend at the island mansion of their friend and Skip's sister Muffy St. John, on the weekend leading up to April Fools' Day. The tone is set almost immediately with Muffy preparing details around the house, and finds an old jack-in-the-box she remembers in a flashback sequence. Meanwhile, her friends are joking around on the pier, then on the ferry to the island. When en route to the island, local deckhand buck Buck is seriously injured in a gruesome accident. Once on the island and in the mansion, it turns out Muffy has set up a variety of little jokes from the simple such as whoopee cushions and dribble glasses, to the more complex and disturbing such as an audiotape of a baby crying in someone's room and heroin paraphernalia in a guest's wardrobe. Through it all, despite the friends in general try to relax, Skip goes missing. Kit catches a glimpse of what looks like his dead body. Soon, Arch and Nan also go missing next. During a search, Nikki falls into the island's well and finds the severed heads of Skip and Arch and the dead body of Nan. Afterward, the remaining group discover that the phones are dead and there is no way to get off the island until Monday. One after another, the group either vanishes or being killed and their bodies being found. Kit and Rob put together some clues and realizing that everyone's earlier assumption is wrong; the kinsman of the deckhand injured when they arrived is a red herring. It also turns out that Muffy has a violently insane twin sister named Buffy, who has escaped. In fact, the \\"Muffy\\" they have been around since the first night was Buffy, pretending to be Muffy.

Heading home early, i feel like poo.  How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","output":"The sentiment of this tweet can be described as negative, reflecting the author's current state of dissatisfaction, low mood, and possibly physical discomfort. There are a few clear indicators in the text that suggest a negative sentiment: 1. \\"Heading home early\\" - This phrase implies that the author has decided to leave their current location sooner than planned, suggesting that they are not enjoying themselves or may have some urgent issue that requires their attention at home. It can reveal a sense of urgency and unhappiness with their current situation, which contributes to the overall negative sentiment. 2. \\"I feel like poo\\" - This statement explicitly conveys the author's current emotion and physical state. \\"Feeling like poo\\" is a colloquial and informal way of saying that someone is feeling unwell, physically ill, or simply in a poor emotional state. It is a negative expression that demonstrates the author's desire to convey their discomfort, enhancing the negative sentiment present. 3. Use of casual, informal language - The use of casual language, including colloquialisms and informal phrases like \\"feel like poo,\\" can suggest that the author's emotional or physical state is significant enough to warrant a departure from more formal language. This casual tone can further contribute to the perception of a negative sentiment. In summary, the sentiment of this tweet is predominantly negative. The author is experiencing a degree of physical or emotional discomfort that has led them to leave their current situation early and express their feelings in a candid manner using informal language."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Dr William McCrea, 58, even hands out glasses of wine on his ward rounds. He says he has prescribed wine to 10,000 patients over the last 10 years. He came up with the idea after discovering the French have fewer heart attacks than the British despite eating a fattier diet and smoking more. He claims drinking red wine can also reduce the risk of a stroke by 20%. Dr McCrea says screw top bottles of younger wines are most effective. It works because red wine dilates the arteries and raises good cholesterol. Article:","output":"Title: Doctor Prescribes Red Wine to 10,000 Patients in a Decade for Heart Health Benefits Dr. William McCrea, a 58-year-old medical professional, has been prescribing red wine to his patients for heart health benefits for the past 10 years. Over that time, he claims to have prescribed it to around 10,000 patients, even going as far as handing out glasses of wine during his ward rounds. This unconventional prescription method began after Dr. McCrea discovered that the French population experiences fewer heart attacks than their British counterparts. This is despite the French consuming a fattier diet and smoking more than the average British citizen. Intrigued by this observation, Dr. McCrea looked for possible explanations and found that red wine could be a contributing factor. According to Dr. McCrea, drinking red wine can reduce the risk of a stroke by 20%. This is because the antioxidants present in red wine have the ability to dilate arteries and increase the levels of good cholesterol in the body. These combined effects are believed to contribute to improved heart health and a reduced risk of heart attack. Dr. McCrea recommends screw-top bottles of younger wines, as they are thought to be the most effective for this purpose. He emphasizes the importance of selecting red wines, as they contain a higher concentration of antioxidants than white wines. This component is responsible for the wine's artery-dilating and cholesterol-boosting properties. Although some controversy may arise from Dr. McCrea's unorthodox approach, it is important to consider the potential health benefits of red wine when consumed in moderation. As always, individuals should consult with their healthcare provider before implementing any supplements or dietary changes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Options: - oxygen intake - new lungs - think more clearly - feeling refreshed - silence  Explain why a human would choose \\"think more clearly\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"think more clearly\\" as the answer to the question above because breathing fresh air can positively impact our mental state and cognitive abilities, ultimately helping us make better decisions.  When we breathe fresh air, we take in more oxygen, which is needed for our brains to function optimally. Oxygen is essential for the production of energy in the brain, and inadequate oxygen levels can lead to reduced mental sharpness, fatigue, and even depression. As a result, increased oxygen intake due to fresh air directly contributes to clearer thinking and improved decision-making. Moreover, when we step outside and take a break from our current surroundings, we often feel more refreshed and alert. This can help to reset our minds, enabling us to think more clearly and make better decisions. Feeling refreshed can also reduce stress levels, which may further contribute to improved cognitive function. While options like \\"oxygen intake\\" and \\"feeling refreshed\\" are also correct elements for the importance of breathing fresh air, the option \\"think more clearly\\" integrates both of these aspects and emphasizes the core benefit of clearer thinking for decision-making. The options \\"new lungs\\" and \\"silence\\" are not directly related to the question as they do not link to the cognitive benefits that fresh air can provide to make better decisions. In summary, a human would choose \\"think more clearly\\" to answer the question above because breathing fresh air enhances oxygen intake and provides a refreshing break, both of which contribute to clearer thinking and improved decision-making."},{"instruction":"Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The body does not exist in isolation.

Charles Parker Jr. (August 29, 1920 - March 12, 1955), also known as Yardbird and Bird, was an American jazz saxophonist and composer. Parker was a highly influential jazz soloist and a leading figure in the development of bebop, a form of jazz characterized by fast tempos, virtuosic technique and advanced harmonies. Parker was a blazingly fast virtuoso, and he introduced revolutionary harmonic ideas including rapid passing chords, new variants of altered chords, and chord substitutions. His tone ranged from clean and penetrating to sweet and somber. Parker died on March 12, 1955, in the suite of his friend and patroness Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter at the Stanhope Hotel in New York City, while watching The Dorsey Brothers' Stage Show on television. The official causes of death were lobar pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer, but Parker also had an advanced case of cirrhosis and had suffered a heart attack. The coroner who performed his autopsy mistakenly estimated Parker's 34-year-old body to be between 50 and 60 years of age.  Since 1950, Parker had been living with Chan Berg, the mother of his son Baird (who lived until 2014) and his daughter Pree (who died as an infant of cystic fibrosis). He considered Chan his wife although he never married her, nor did he divorce his previous wife, Doris, whom he had married in 1948. His marital status complicated the settling of Parker's estate and would ultimately serve to frustrate his wish to be quietly interred in New York City.  Dizzy Gillespie paid for the funeral arrangements and organized a lying-in-state, a Harlem procession officiated by Congressman and Reverend Adam Clayton Powell, Jr., as well as a memorial concert. Parker's body was flown back to Missouri, in accordance with his mother's wishes. Berg criticized Doris and Parker's family for giving him a Christian funeral, even though they knew he was a confirmed atheist. Parker was buried at Lincoln Cemetery in Missouri, in a hamlet known as Blue Summit, located close to I-435 and East Truman Road.  Parker's estate is managed by Jampol Artist Management.","output":"This text is about Charles Parker Jr., also known as Yardbird and Bird, an American jazz saxophonist and composer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Question: \\"What facet of evolution by natural selection did Darwin focus on in his work that was presented to the Linnean Society?\\"  Context: \\"Darwin was hard at work on his \\"big book\\" on Natural Selection, when on 18 June 1858 he received a parcel from Wallace, who stayed on the Maluku Islands (Ternate and Gilolo). It enclosed twenty pages describing an evolutionary mechanism, a response to Darwin's recent encouragement, with a request to send it on to Lyell if Darwin thought it worthwhile. The mechanism was similar to Darwin's own theory. Darwin wrote to Lyell that \\"your words have come true with a vengeance, ... forestalled\\" and he would \\"of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal\\" that Wallace chose, adding that \\"all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed\\". Lyell and Hooker agreed that a joint publication putting together Wallace's pages with extracts from Darwin's 1844 Essay and his 1857 letter to Gray should be presented at the Linnean Society, and on 1 July 1858, the papers entitled On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection, by Wallace and Darwin respectively, were read out but drew little reaction. While Darwin considered Wallace's idea to be identical to his concept of natural selection, historians have pointed out differences. Darwin described natural selection as being analogous to the artificial selection practised by animal breeders, and emphasised competition between individuals; Wallace drew no comparison to selective breeding, and focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Some historians have suggested that Wallace was actually discussing group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In his work presented to the Linnean Society, Charles Darwin focused on the aspect of evolution by natural selection that involved competition between individuals and the mechanism being analogous to artificial selection practiced by animal breeders.

In contrast, Alfred Russel Wallace, who independently conceived a similar evolutionary mechanism, focused on ecological pressures that kept different varieties adapted to local conditions. Unlike Darwin, Wallace did not draw a comparison to selective breeding and his ideas have been interpreted by some historians as potentially involving group selection rather than selection acting on individual variation.

So was a girl in my class named Lisa. That's where the similarities ended. I was tall and she was small. My thick black hair had been recently cut short into an untidy style. Her natural blonde hair flowed to her waist and looked great. I was 12 and one of the oldest in the class while she was 11 and the youngest. I was awkward and shy. She wasn't. I couldn't stand her, considering her my enemy. But she liked me and wanted to be friends. One day, she invited me over and I said yes--I was too shocked to answer any other way. My family had moved six times in six years, and I had never managed to develop any friendships. But this girl who wore the latest fashions wanted me to go home with her after school. She lived in a fun part of town that had two pizza places, an all-night bookstore, a movie theater and a park. As we walked from the school bus stop through her neighborhood, I tried to guess which house might be hers. Was it the white one with the perfect lawn or the three-story house with a front porch? I got very surprised when she led me into an old apartment building. She lived on the fourth floor in a two-room place with her mother,her stepfather, her two brothers and her sister. When we got into the room she shared with her sister, she took out a big case of Babies, which was my next surprise. I had never played with them. We sat on the floor,laughing as we made up crazy stories about the Babies. We found out that we both wanted to be writers when we were older and both had wild imaginations. We had a great day that afternoon. Lisa was loved by the whole neighborhood. The bookstore owners lent her fashion magazines; the movie theater gave her free tickets... Soon I was included in her magic world. We slept over at each other's houses and spent every free moment together.

Well, it's a big group of people who make important decisions about soccer all around the world. Recently, a very important person from FIFA named Jerome Valcke talked about soccer fields. He said that big soccer games, like World Cup, might soon be played on artificial turf instead of real grass. Now, you must be wondering what is artificial turf. It is a surface that looks like grass but is actually made of synthetic materials. It is sometimes used on soccer fields and playgrounds because it is easy to take care of and safer for players. Some people are not very happy with this decision because, next year, the Women's World Cup in Canada will be played on this artificial turf instead of real grass. They believe that it might affect the game or safety of the players.

By then the language had developed a literary tradition, and since then it has changed little; journals from that period have no substantial differences from modern standard Czech, and contemporary Czechs can understand them with little difficulty. Changes include the morphological shift of í to ej and é to í (although é survives for some uses) and the merging of í and the former ejí. Sometime before the eighteenth century, the Czech language abandoned a distinction between phonemic /l/ and /ʎ/ which survives in Slovak. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): How much difficulty do contemporary Czechs have in understanding material from the 18th century?","output":"Contemporary Czechs generally have little difficulty in understanding material from the 18th century. This is due to the fact that standard Czech originated during that period, and there have been minimal changes in the language since then. Some journals and literary texts from that era are quite similar to modern standard Czech, which allows Czech speakers today to comprehend the material without much trouble. Although there are a few changes that have occurred since the 18th century, such as the morphological shift of í to ej and é to í, as well as the merging of í and the former ejí, these modifications do not impede the overall understanding of the language. Moreover, the distinctions between phonemic /l/ and /ʎ/, which were lost in Czech but preserved in Slovak, do not pose any significant difficulty for modern Czech speakers. In summary, contemporary Czechs can understand 18th-century material relatively easily, as there have been minimal changes to the Czech language since its development as a standard form during that period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Interval training involves alternating between short high-intensity and long low-intensity activities to make your workouts more effective. When you develop your workout routine, look for activities that push your limits and are difficult to complete and plan to do them in 30-second bursts. Then choose less strenuous activities and complete them for 3-4 minutes at a time.  For example, you may incorporate 30 seconds of jogging or sprinting followed by 3-4 minutes of brisk walking. Continue alternating between them until you finish your workout. Aim to exercise at least 4-5 days each week with interval training. Interval training also allows you to burn more calories than a regular workout. Doing frequent cardio workouts prevents you from getting winded during a fight and boosts how long you last against your opponent. Incorporate exercises such as running, swimming, or cycling into your weekly routine so you can stay fit. Start with a 10-minute warmup so you can prepare for the rest of your workout before switching to higher-intensity exercise to keep your heart rate in your target range.  Aim to do cardio for 45-60 minutes at least 2-3 times per week. If you’re at a gym or have the equipment, you can also include using a treadmill, elliptical, rowing machine, or stepping machine for your cardio workout. Strengthening your arms allows you to throw more powerful punches and block hits better. Keep your arms straight down at your sides and hold dumbbells in each hand. Make sure the weight of the dumbbells is easy for you to lift repeatedly without getting tired. Bend your arms at the elbow to curl the weights up to your shoulders in controlled motions. Slowly lower your arms back down to your sides to complete the rep. Aim to do 3 sets of 15-20 reps for your workout. Stand up straight with your arms at your side and take a large step forward with one foot. As you step forward, bend your knees until your front leg forms a 90-degree angle. Pause for 1 count before standing upright again. Alternate which leg you use after each lunge to get a balanced workout.  Do 2-3 sets of 10-15 lunges. You can choose to do lunges with your bodyweight or you can hold dumbbells to make them more difficult. Lay in a plank position on the floor and plant your palms are slightly wider than your shoulders. Straighten your arms to raise yourself off the ground so your back stays straight. Lower yourself slowly toward the ground until your elbows form a 90-degree angle and hold the position for 1 count. Straighten your arms again to raise your body in a slow, controlled motion.  Aim to do 2-3 sets of 15-20 push-ups for your workout. If standard push-ups are too hard, put your knees on the ground to make them easier. If you want to make your push-ups more difficult, move your body in a circular motion as you lower yourself to the ground to activate your core even more. Stand so your back is straight and your feet are slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees until they form a 90-degree angle to lower your body closer to the ground while you keep your back straight. Hold the position for 1 count before straightening your legs to jump off the ground. As soon as you land, start going into your next squat.  Do 2-3 sets of 15-20 jump squats to get a good leg workout. Building up your leg strength allows you to move more quickly and throw more powerful kicks. Squat using 1 leg at a time if you want to make them more difficult. You can choose to do bodyweight squats or hold dumbbells if you want to increase the weight. Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and your arms at your side. Keep your back straight as you bend your knees until they’re at a 90-degree angle. Plant your palms on the ground in front of you and move your feet behind you to get into a plank position. Lower your body until your elbows are at a 90-degree angle before jumping back up into a squat. Jump in the air to straighten your legs and start your next squat immediately when you land. Aim to do 2-3 sets of 10-15 burpees. Hold your body up on parallel bars so your arms are fully extended and your feet are off the ground. Bend your elbows until they’re at a 90-degree angle to lower your body and activate your chest, back, and tricep muscles. Hold the pose for 1 count before lifting yourself back up again.  Try doing 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps when you do dips. Wear a weighted belt or ankle weights if you want to make the exercise more difficult. If you don’t have access to parallel bars, you can also do dips using a bench instead.","output":"Interval training alternates between high-intensity and low-intensity activities for effective workouts.

Answer:","output":"Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar is known as the \\"Father of the Indian Constitution.\\" He was a renowned Indian jurist, economist, politician, and social reformer who played a vital role in the formation of the Indian Constitution.  Born on April 14th, 1891, in the town of Mhow in Madhya Pradesh, India, to parents of the Mahar caste, which was considered \\"untouchable\\" within the hierarchical caste system, Ambedkar had personal experiences with social inequality and discrimination. These experiences fuelled his determination to combat social oppression and fight for equal rights for every section of society, making him a key figure in modern India's socal and political history. Educated at the University of Bombay, Columbia University in the United States, and the London School of Economics, Dr. Ambedkar held doctorates in economics from both Columbia University and the University of London, offering him a deep understanding of the constitution-making processes of many successful nations.  After India gained its independence from British colonial rule on August 15, 1947, the need for a comprehensive governing legal document became apparent. A Constituent Assembly was formed for this purpose, and they appointed Ambedkar as the Chairman of the Drafting Committee on August 29, 1947.  As the head of the Drafting Committee, Dr. Ambedkar was entrusted with the task of drafting the Constitution of India. His wide-ranging knowledge and experience were instrumental in structuring the Indian constitution. He carefully studied constitutions from around the world to ensure that India's Constitution would include the best aspects of all. Under Dr. Ambedkar’s leadership, the committee worked for 2 years, 11 months, and 18 days before the Constitution was finally adopted by the Indian Republic. The Constitution of India was adopted on November 26, 1949, and came into effect on January 26, 1950, declaring India a sovereign, socialist, secular, and democratic republic. Dr. Ambedkar's contributions to the Constitution include provisions for social reform, promoting equality and discouraging discrimination of any sort, and he was especially determined to improve the conditions for India's \\"Untouchable\\" community. He was the driving force behind certain crucial articles related to social justice, like the abolition of untouchability (Article 17), the prohibition of discrimination (Article 15), and providing reservations for socially and educationally backward classes (Article 16(4)). Dr. Ambedkar, throughout his career, aggressively campaigned against social discrimination towards untouchables, women, and labour. He also played a significant role in the implementation of the Indian economy's state-controlled aspects as envisaged by the constitution. For his invaluable contributions to the creation and shaping of the Constitution of India, Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar is deservedly hailed as the Constitution's \\"father.\\" His life and works remain an inspirational touchstone for generations of Indians fighting against social injustice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

This detail is related by the film's narrator (the voice of Michael Hordern), who comments ironically on the events that transpire. The widow (Marie Kean), disdaining offers of marriage, devotes herself to the raising of her son.While still in his teens, Barry falls in love with his older cousin, Nora Brady (Gay Hamilton). A wealthy English army officer named Captain John Quin (Leonard Rossiter) meets and begins courting Nora, leading the jealous Barry to challenge Quin to a duel. They fire pistols at ten paces and Quin falls. Believing that he has killed Quin and will be arrested by the British for murder, Barry flees.On the road to Dublin, Barry is robbed and his horse stolen by a middle-aged highwayman (Arthur O'Sullivan) and the man's son. Penniless, Barry enlists in the British army and finds himself in boot camp. During training, Barry gets into a brawl with a local bully named O'Toole (Pat Roach), and is forced to fight bare-knuckle against the guy. Barry wins the fight by dodging all of O'Toole's blows and knocks out his opponent, which earns him popularity from the rest of his fellow recruits.After basic training, Barry and his unit are sent to France to fight in the Seven Years' War (1756-1763) between the alliance of Great Britain and Prussia and the alliance of France, Austria and Russia. While still in a training camp, Barry learns from an old friend, Captain Grogan (Godfrey Quigley), that Captain Quin is not dead after all and has married Nora. The whole duel was a ploy by Nora's relatives to make Barry flee from Ireland so she can marry Quin.After the death of Grogan in a skirmish, Barry, fed up with the brutality of war, deserts from the British army.

Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals.  Which zoologist learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day?  Hint: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.

Movie plot title: The Road to El Dorado Movie plot: In Spain 1519, two con artists, Tulio and Miguel, win a map to the legendary City of Gold, El Dorado, in a rigged gambling match. After their con is discovered, the two evade capture and hide aboard one of the ships to be led by HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s to the New World. During the trip, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but manage to break free and take a rowboat with the help of CortÃ©s' horse, Altivo. Later, they land on an unknown shore at the edge of Mexico, and Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a large waterfall. Believing it to be a dead end, they suddenly encounter a native woman being chased by guards; when the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them to a secret entrance behind the falls, along with the woman, and into a city truly made of gold, El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kind-hearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. Tzekel-Kan, seeking to seize the city from Tannabok, insists that the two, mistaken as gods, demonstrate their powers. Tulio and Miguel bicker between themselves, while a nearby volcano begins to erupt. When Tulio yells at Miguel to stop pestering him, the volcano suddenly stops erupting, and the citizens take this as proof of their godhood. Celebrations are held, and the pair are given luxurious quarters to stay, along with charge of the woman, Chel. Chel is aware the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok, but disapproves Tzekel-Kan in sacrificing a civilian as the gods' ritual. Tulio convinces Tannabok to build them a vessel that will allow them to leave the city with all the gifts they've been given, which will take three days. Miguel explores the city, allowing Chel to get romantically close to Tulio. Miguel comes to appreciate the peaceful life that the citizens seem to enjoy, and joins in with some of their activities.... Answer:","output":"Tzekel-Kan felt Miguel and Tulio are not gods when Miguel received a small cut because gods are typically believed to be immortal and invulnerable, so a cut would indicate that they are actually mortals and not divine beings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Generate a detailed description of this data.","output":"The given data, \\"3 COUNTIES_REPRESENTED Suffolk,\\" provides information about geographical representation in a specific context, likely related to a political, demographic, or statistical analysis of a region. In this case, the data indicates that there are three distinct entities (possibly governmental or administrative) that represent the county of Suffolk. This detailed description will break down the various aspects the data can shed light on. 1. Geographical Context: Suffolk is a county situated in the East of England, United Kingdom. It encompasses a predominantly rural area with several charming and historic towns, such as Ipswich, Bury St Edmunds, and Newmarket. It is bordered by the North Sea to the east and adjacent counties, such as Norfolk to the north, Cambridgeshire to the west, and Essex to the south. 2. Representation: The data suggests that there are three organizations, governments, or administrative entities that represent the interests and concerns of the people living within the county. These representatives might be grouped based on geographic districts, population density, or political divisions. Such representation aims to address the social, economic, and political needs of Suffolk's residents and promote their overall well-being.  3. Types of Representation: As the data does not provide specific information about these representing entities, they can range from various tiers of government (local councils, parliamentary constituencies) to non-governmental groups. Some possibilities include:    a. Local Councils: There may be three primary local councils, which are responsible for providing essential services, such as waste management, housing, and public health. These councils also participate in policy planning, zoning regulations, and infrastructural improvement for their respective regions within Suffolk.    b. Parliamentary Constituencies: Suffolk might be divided into three electoral sections, which determine the allocation of representatives in the national or regional legislative assemblies. In the case of the United Kingdom, these representatives would be Members of Parliament (MPs) who serve in the House of Commons.    c. Non-governmental Groups: Various non-profit organizations or community-based initiatives that focus on representing the interests of the Suffolk communities in matters related to environmental policy, education, or specific industries (e.g., agriculture, tourism) can be represented in this data too. In conclusion, the data \\"3 COUNTIES_REPRESENTED Suffolk\\" provides a snapshot of the geographical representation within the county of Suffolk. While the specific entities and the nature of their representation are not explicitly mentioned, this information points to a political or administrative structure wherein three distinct groups serve the needs and interests of the people living in this region. Further research or context is needed to ascertain the exact nature and mandate of these representations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Assess the situation The gardener realized that the bags they had were too small to fit the excess vines. They needed to come up with an alternative solution for disposing or repurposing the vines. Step 2: Consider alternative disposal methods Since the bags were too small, the gardener thought about alternative ways to get rid of the excess vines. They considered composting the vines, repurposing them for a different gardening task, or finding a larger, more suitable bag. Step 3: Evaluate potential solutions The gardener weighed the pros and cons of each alternative solution. Composting would be an environmentally friendly way to dispose of the vines, while repurposing them for a different task could save time and money. Finding a larger bag was also an option but might require additional effort and resources. Step 4: Choose the best solution In the end, the gardener decided that composting was the most efficient and sustainable solution. They would create a compost pile with the excess vines, adding nutrients back into the soil and avoiding waste. Step 5: Implement the solution The gardener started a compost pile in a suitable location, properly layering the excess vines with other organic materials to create an optimal environment for decomposition. Step 6: Monitor progress The gardener regularly checked the compost pile, turning it to ensure even decomposition and proper airflow.

Would \\"However, the League's involvement in an Egyptian revolt (from 460–454 BC) resulted in a disastrous defeat, and further campaigning was suspended.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"The Persian Wars, also known as the Greco-Persian Wars, were a series of conflicts that took place between the Persian Empire, led by Kings Darius I and Xerxes I, and the city-states of Greece, primarily Athens and Sparta. These wars occurred between 499 BC and 449 BC. The main theaters of conflict during the Persian Wars were in Asia Minor, Thrace, the Aegean Sea, and the Greek mainland, including major battles at Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea. Your answer, \\"However, the League's involvement in an Egyptian revolt (from 460–454 BC) resulted in a disastrous defeat, and further campaigning was suspended,\\" refers to a later point in time and a different war. After the Persian Wars, Athens established a military alliance called the Delian League, intending to continue the struggle against the Persian Empire and to free the Greek city-states under Persian control. However, the League's involvement in the Egyptian rebellion against Persian rule (460-454 BC) indeed led to a catastrophic defeat. While this does highlight a post-Persian War Athenian military venture, it is not a direct response to the question about where the Persian Wars took place. A more appropriate response to the question about the location of the Persian War would be: The Persian Wars took place primarily in Asia Minor, Thrace, the Aegean Sea, and the Greek mainland, with crucial battles occurring at Marathon, Thermopylae, Salamis, and Plataea between the Persian Empire and the city-states of Greece, particularly Athens and Sparta, from 499 BC to 449 BC."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Photo: FORVM MMX      One of the world's earliest representations of Christ has been unearthed in southern Spain by a team of archaeologists, a glass plate which shines new light on the arrival of Christianity in Spain.      The green glass paten, the plate which holds the Holy Eucharist in churches, is the earliest depiction of Jesus found in Spain and is in excellent condition compared to similar pieces discovered around Europe.      “We know it dates back to the 4th century, in part because popes in the following centuries ordered all patens to be made out of silver,” Marcelo Castro, head of the Forum MMX excavation project, told The Local.      The team of archaeologists have so far managed to find 81 percent of the paten at the site of a religious building in Cástulo, an ancient Iberian town in the province of Jaén, Andalusia.      Measuring 22 centimetres in diameter, it shows three beardless men with short hair and halos over their heads.      According to Castro, the figures are Jesus and the apostles Paul and Peter as depicted in Christ in Majesty, an early Christian art form which copied Roman and Byzantine styles.      The Forum MMX team have been able to establish the paten was made in the 300s thanks to coins and ceramic objects found at the same site.      “We were wary about presenting the paten as a 4th century piece in case it clashed with previous studies into the chronology of Christianity in Spain,” Castro explained.      But their estimates coincide with the rule of Constantine, the first Roman emperor to claim conversion to Christianity, who also ensured the religion's clandestine followers were no longer persecuted.      The paten was put on display on Wedneday at the Archaeological Museum of Linares (Jaén), alongside other ancient pieces such as a mosaic of Cupid (Mosaico de los Amores), unearthed in 2012 and named as one of the discoveries of the year by National Geographic. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

The United States has brought  Abu Anas al Libi -- an alleged al Qaeda operative whom U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers captured in Libya this month -- to New York, a U.S. attorney's office said Monday. He was transferred to law enforcement custody and brought to the United States on Saturday, according to a letter from the office of Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to a federal judge. Al Libi is expected to appear before a judicial officer on Tuesday, Bharara's office said. His family in Tripoli said they were shocked that he was in the United States. They had received no details of his whereabouts from the U.S. or Libyan governments, family members told CNN. His son, Abdullah, said the family hoped to get him a lawyer that would \\"work with him, for him.\\" It was unclear if al Libi already has a lawyer. \\"We don't want him talking to just anyone,\\" Abdullah said. \\"We don't want just any lawyer asking him questions.\\" A U.S. official said al Libi received care at a medical facility in New York for a pre-existing medical condition and is \\"doing better.\\" The official did not detail the medical issue. His wife told CNN this month that al Libi has a severe case of hepatitis C and that she was worried about his health. U.S. special operations forces captured al Libi in Tripoli more than a week ago. The 49-year-old native of Libya is accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The United States had been holding him aboard a Navy ship, U.S. officials said. He was questioned there by members of a high-value detainee interrogation team, the officials said. American officials have described him as \\"one of the world's most wanted terrorists.\\" He was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York in the embassy bombings and in connection with his alleged roles in al Qaeda conspiracies to attack U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Somalia. Some terrorism experts have questioned how much valuable intelligence al Libi would be able to provide for his captors. A former jihadist associate told CNN last week that it was unlikely that he was still playing an active role with the terrorist network. His wife said he was no longer a member of al Qaeda, had been living a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan oil ministry. Al Libi was captured October 5 on the street in front of his home as he returned in his car from morning prayers. President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have previously said they prefer to try individuals such as al Libi in American courts. Trying such suspects on American soil has been a controversial topic in the past. In 2009, Holder said five detainees with alleged ties to the September 11, 2001, attacks would be transferred from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to New York for trial in civilian court. Later Holder reversed course, announcing that accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and others would be tried in a military commission at Guantanamo instead. State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said last week that there was no chance that al Libi would end up at Guantanamo. \\"The administration's position on Guantanamo is clear. Our goal is not to add to the population, it's to reduce it, which we've done. ... Our policy is not to send any new detainees to Guantanamo,\\" she said. Still, Rep. Peter King, R-New York, said Monday that it was \\"unfortunate that al Libi is on American soil, ending the interrogation process.\\" \\"It shows the inherent flaws in the U.S. policy decision to try (terror suspects) in the U.S. because once you arrive on U.S. soil, that ends the interrogation of these high value detainees,\\" Kind said, said, adding would not have happened if al Libi had been sent to Guantanamo Bay and faced a military commission there. King, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, credited the government with giving advance notice of al Libi's arrival to New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg and NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelley, which allowed them to have security measures in place. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"In this article, a man named Abu Anas al Libi, who is believed to be part of a group called al Qaeda, was captured by U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers in a country called Libya. After he was captured, he was taken to New York, in the United States. He is accused of being involved in some very bad actions, like bombings, and officials think he is \\"one of the world's most wanted terrorists.\\" He will be faced with a judge and will need a lawyer to help defend him.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"No, the answers to these two questions would not be the same. They are completely different questions and need separate approaches to answer them.  Answer for Question 1:  To go from Ahmadnagar to Pune Airport, follow the following steps: 1. Choose your preferred mode of transport, such as car, bus, or train. 2. If traveling by car, use a GPS or a map application to get the driving directions from Ahmadnagar to Pune Airport. 3. If traveling by bus, check for available bus services and their schedules between Ahmadnagar and Pune. After reaching Pune, you may take either a taxi or public transport to reach the airport. 4. If traveling by train, check for train schedules between Ahmadnagar and Pune railway stations. Once you arrive at the Pune station, you can take a taxi or public transport to the airport. 5. Ensure you have enough time for travel and reaching the airport, considering possible delays like traffic, bus/train schedules, or any other unforeseen issues. Answer for Question 2: To group similar but not exact product names, follow these steps: 1. Start by collecting all the product names in a list. 2. Develop an algorithm that can measure the similarity of the names (for example, using similarity metrics like Jaccard, Levenshtein distance, or Cosine similarity). 3. Based on the similarity metric, identify a threshold to determine if two product names should be considered 'similar.' 4. Use a clustering algorithm, like hierarchical clustering or k-means, to group similar product names based on the similarity metric and threshold. Alternatively, you can also use fuzzy matching or supervised/unsupervised machine learning techniques to group similar products. 5. Review and fine-tune the algorithm if needed to ensure accurate grouping."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What two fires advanced towards the Grant Village area? ?  Almost 250 different fires started in Yellowstone and the surrounding National Forests between June and August. Seven of them were responsible for 95% of the total burned area. At the end of July, the National Park Service and other agencies had fully mobilized available personnel, and yet the fires continued to expand. Smaller fires burned into each other, propelled by dry storms which brought howling winds and dry lightning strikes but no rain. On August 20, the single worst day of the fires and later dubbed \\"Black Saturday\\", more than 150,000 acres (610 km2) were consumed during one of many intense fires. Ash from the fires throughout the park drifted as far away as Billings, Montana, 60 miles (97 km) to the northeast. The wind driven flames jumped roads and firelines, and burning embers started new fires a mile (1.6 km) or more ahead of the main fires. Ground fires raced the fuel ladder to the forest canopy and became crown fires with flames over 200 feet (61 m) high. On that single day, more Yellowstone land burned than in all other fires combined since the establishment of the park. Throughout the summer, fires made huge advances of 5 to 10 miles (8.0 to 16.1 km) a day, and there were even occasions when more than 2 miles (3.2 km) in one hour were recorded.One large group of fires was known as the Snake River Complex. These fires were in the southern section of the park, in the headwaters region of the Yellowstone and Snake Rivers. The largest fire in the group was the Shoshone fire which was started by lightning on June 23. The prescribed natural burn policy was still in effect, and at first no efforts were made to suppress this fire. It smoldered with little movement for several weeks, then rapidly started expanding towards the northeast on July 20.The Red fire started near Lewis Lake on July 1, and like the Shoshone fire, advanced little for several weeks. The fire then moved northeast on July 19, and combined with the Shoshone fire in August. As these two fires advanced towards the Grant Village...

President Donald Trump’s decision to reverse a policy of separating families coming across the U.S. southern border came in the wake of a political firestorm that fired up opposition Democrats and alarmed even some Republicans. At the very least, it likely set the stage for immigration to be a key issue in November. Trump was in combat mode Wednesday during a political rally in Duluth, Minnesota, where he vowed to make immigration a central focus in the upcoming congressional campaign. “If you want to create a humane, lawful system of immigration then you need to retire the Democrats and elect Republicans to finally secure our borders,” Trump said to an enthusiastic crowd, some chanting, “Build the wall!” Just hours earlier, the president reversed his controversial policy of separating children from their parents by signing an executive order in the White House. “We are going to have strong, very strong, borders. But we are going to keep the families together,” he said. Trump decided to back away from the controversial policy of separating families after an outcry from around the country that included protests in several states, including Arizona, Texas, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Also driving the outrage was a recording of children crying out for their parents released by the investigative journalist group ProPublica. The separation policy drew condemnation from Republicans including former first lady Laura Bush and a host of Democrats. “We should be able to agree that we will not keep kids in child internment camps indefinitely and hidden away from public view,” said Maryland Democratic Congressman Elijah Cummings. “What country is that? This is the United States of America!” Advocates for a tough border policy sided with the president including Art Arthur of the Center for Immigration Studies.

A plunger is a tool we use to help clear a blocked drain, like when you can't flush your toilet or water goes down so slowly in your sink. It looks like a rubber cup on a stick. Here's a simple way to use a plunger: 1. Pick the best plunger: Make sure to choose a plunger that has a big rubber cup. For toilets, use a plunger with a flange, which looks like a little extra bit sticking out from the bottom of the cup. 2. Get a good seal: Put the rubber part of the plunger (the cup) right over the hole where the water goes down. You want to make sure that all the sides of the rubber cup touch the surface around the hole, creating a tight seal. 3. Fill with water: The plunger needs water inside the cup to work well. Add some water into the blocked sink or toilet if the water level is too low, so that it covers the rubber cup. 4. Push and pull: Hold the stick part of the plunger with both hands and push down gently. Then, pull up with a quick, strong motion. You might need to do this a few times. 5. Check the results: After pushing and pulling a few times, quickly lift the plunger up. If you see the water going down quickly, hooray! You've cleared the blockage! If not, repeat steps 4 and 5 until the water flows easily. And that's it! Now you know how to use a plunger to fix your blocked drain like a superhero!

Despite his apparent success and dedication to his community, he faces tough competition from his opponent, Vikram Singh. They both want to win the upcoming election to become the head of the municipal council. As the campaigning heats up, Tiwari Bhaisaab learns of an unlikely endorsement from a mysterious and feared outlaw, Raghav \\"Raghu\\" Yadav. Raghu is a Robin Hood-esque figure, a modern bandit who steals from the rich and helps the poor. Despite his criminal actions, Raghu is popular amongst the lower class in the town. Tiwari Bhaisaab, initially reluctant to accept the support of a criminal, has a change of heart when he learns about Raghu's good deeds and intentions. This newly formed alliance strengthens Tiwari Bhaisaab's chances of winning the election, but it also catches the attention of the local police and intelligence agencies, who have long been trying to track down and apprehend Raghu. Unbeknownst to Tiwari Bhaisaab, Vikram Singh has another card up his sleeve - Kishore Srivastava, a corrupt police officer who has personal vendetta against both Tiwari Bhaisaab and Raghu. Kishore collaborates with Vikram, aiming to bring down Tiwari Bhaisaab's campaign and reputation, while also settling his scores with Raghu. As the election inches closer, Tiwari Bhaisaab and Raghu must work together to not only secure a victory in the election but also thwart the sinister plans of Vikram Singh and Kishore Srivastava. Their bond deepens when both men reveal dark secrets from their past, uniting them against their common enemies. On the eve of the election, Raghu organizes a surprise rally in support of Tiwari Bhaisaab, gathering a massive crowd.

Question:   A piece of sandpaper was rubbed across a glass table, then the sandpaper was rubbed across some gravel. The friction will be less between the sandpaper and the glass table or or the sandpaper and the gravel.? Answer:","output":"According to the given paragraph, rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces. In the given situation, we have two different scenarios: the sandpaper being rubbed across a glass table and the sandpaper being rubbed across some gravel. Between the two surfaces, the glass table is relatively smooth compared to the gravel. When the sandpaper is rubbed across the glass table, there is less friction between the two surfaces due to the relatively smooth nature of the glass. On the other hand, gravel consists of small pieces of rock and other materials, which inherently makes it a rough and irregular surface. When the sandpaper is rubbed against the gravel, the rough surface of the sandpaper interacts with the rough surface of the gravel. As a result, there is increased contact between the small, abrasive particles in both surfaces, leading to a much higher amount of friction.

Blood In Blood Out The film received mixed reviews from critics. It holds a 55% rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 11 reviews. On IMDb it holds an 8/10. The TV Guide review stated \`\`similarity to Edward James Olmos' American Me, in which a tormented drug dealer travels the same route through prison society as Miklo. The principal difference between the two films is that Bound By Honor is by far the glossier effort, relentlessly picturesque in the seamlessly anesthetized manner of mainstream Hollywood films.'' Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum for the Chicago Reader wrote that this \`\`ugly three-hour snoozefest is apparently supposed to do for East Los Angeles Chicanos what the Godfather movies did for New York mafiosi...''

Our goal is to find out what the value of \\"o\\" is. Here is the original equation: -11*o - 7*o - 145 = 11*o Now, let's start by adding the two terms on the left side that have an \\"o\\" in them. In easier words, let's combine -11*o and -7*o: (-11 - 7) * o - 145 = 11*o (-18) * o - 145 = 11*o Now we have: -18*o - 145 = 11*o Next, we want to get all the \\"o\\" terms together on one side of the equation and the number terms on the other side. To do this, let's add 18*o to both sides of the equation: -18*o + 18*o - 145 = 11*o + 18*o This simplifies to:  -145 = 29*o Now we just have to find what \\"o\\" is! To do that, let's divide both sides of the equation by 29: -145 / 29 = 29*o / 29 This gives us the answer: o = -5 So, the value of \\"o\\" that solves this equation is -5!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the context and implications slightly differ in each example. In the sentence \\"The Boy Scouts were going to accept him as a member,\\" the word \\"accept\\" refers to the process of approving or welcoming someone into a group or organization, in this case, the Boy Scouts. Here, \\"accept\\" implies that the boy has met certain requirements or criteria, and the Boy Scouts acknowledge that he is an appropriate candidate for inclusion in their group. The underlying message in this context is that membership is contingent on meeting certain standards or expectations, and acceptance into the group is a form of social validation. In the sentence \\"Accept students for graduate study,\\" the word \\"accept\\" refers to the process of admitting students into an academic program, specifically at the graduate level. While the fundamental meaning is still about allowing someone to join or participate, the context here is educational.

Article: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Options: A: An effective way to identity Dyslexia at an early stage. B: A learning disorder involving one's intelligence. C: Dyslexia -- a problem affecting one's reading and writing.

Answer the following question: Answer the question below:   A person with a high fever will have narrowing or widening of the blood vessels in the skin?    Assuming that:  When your brain senses that your body temperature is increasing, it sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin to increase in diameter. Answer:","output":"A person with a high fever will typically experience widening of the blood vessels in the skin, also known as vasodilation. When the body's temperature increases due to fever, the hypothalamus, which acts as the body's thermostat, senses this change and initiates a response to help regulate the temperature. The hypothalamus releases chemicals which act as messengers and are carried by the blood to various parts of the body, including the blood vessels in the skin. These messengers signal the blood vessels to increase in diameter, allowing more blood to flow near the surface of the skin. This is a vital process because when the blood vessels widen, they increase the amount of heat that can be lost from the body through the skin, thereby helping to cool the body down. The increased blood flow to the skin's surface may make a person with a fever appear flushed or feel warmer to the touch. Additionally, this process may be accompanied by other mechanisms that the body uses to dissipate excess heat, such as sweating. Sweating is a cooling mechanism wherein the body releases water through the skin, which evaporates and takes away heat energy from the body as it changes from liquid to vapor. This further aids in reducing the body's temperature. It is essential to note that while vasodilation in response to fever can be an effective way for the body to manage increased temperatures, it is not always sufficient to bring the body temperature back to normal levels. In some cases, medical intervention may be necessary to treat the underlying cause of the fever and help the person’s body effectively regulate temperature. In summary, a person with a high fever will generally experience vasodilation or widening of blood vessels in the skin as the body's response to increased temperature. This process, along with other mechanisms such as sweating, allows the body to release excess heat and helps regulate the overall body temperature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

During the Great Depression, she served in the Works Progress Administration as Midwest Bureau Director of the Federal Theater Project. Glaspell is known to have composed nine novels, fifteen plays, over fifty short stories, and one biography. Glaspell was highly regarded in her time, and was well known as a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright. Her short stories were regularly printed in the era's top periodicals, and her New York Times obituary states that she was \\"one of the nation's most widely-read novelists.\\" However, Glaspell's idealistic tales of strong and independent female protagonists were less popular in the post-war era that stressed female domesticity, and her novels fell out of print after her death.  In 1940 a new generation of influential Broadway-based critics began publishing derogatory reviews of her plays, having a sizable effect on her long-term standing. Exacerbating the issue was Glaspell's reluctance to seek publicity and her tendency to downplay her own accomplishments, perhaps a result of her modest Midwestern upbringing. Accordingly, in the United States her work was seriously neglected for many years. Internationally, she received some attention by scholars who were primarily interested in her more experimental work from the Provincetown years.  In the late 1970s feminist critics began to reevaluate Glaspell's career, and interest in her work has grown steadily ever since. Today, Glaspell scholarship is a \\"burgeoning\\" field, with several book-length biographies and analyses of her writing being published by university presses in recent years. After a century of being out of print, a large portion of her work has been republished. With major achievements in drama, novel, and short fiction, Glaspell is often cited as a \\"prime example\\" of an overlooked female writer deserving canonization. Perhaps the originator of modern American theater, Glaspell has been called \\"the First Lady of American Drama\\" and \\"the Mother of American Drama.\\"  In 2003 the International Susan Glaspell Society was founded, with the aim of promoting \\"the recognition of Susan Glaspell as a major American dramatist and fiction writer.\\" Her plays are frequently performed by college and university theater departments, but she has become more widely known for her often-anthologized works: the one-act play Trifles, and its short-story adaptation, \\"A Jury of Her Peers\\". Since the late 20th century, these two pieces have become staples of theatre and Women's Studies curricula across the United States and the world.

The Maple Leafs announced on Monday that Andersen will be sidelined for three to four weeks because of an upper-body injury he suffered in a pre-Olympic qualifier. Another addition to the squad. Welcome to goaltender Philipp Grubauer! #TeamEUR #WCH2016 pic.twitter.com/ryjnxzGrFb — Team Europe (@TeamEUR_WCH) September 6, 2016 Grubauer’s addition to Team Europe makes him the ninth Capitals player named to a World Cup roster, as the German joins Nicklas Backstrom (Sweden), John Carlson (United States), Braden Holtby (Canada), Evgeny Kuznetsov (Russia), Matt Niskanen (United States), Dmitry Orlov (Russia), T.J. Oshie (United States) and Alex Ovechkin (Russia) at the tournament. Capitals Coach Barry Trotz will also serve as an assistant coach for Team Canada. The 2016 World Cup of Hockey will be held in Toronto from Sept. 17 through Oct. 1, meaning that players competing in it are expected to miss the start of NHL training camp. With Washington’s top two goaltenders in Holtby and Grubauer both participating, there will be more preseason opportunities for the organization’s other goalies, including prospects Adam Carlson and Vitek Vanecek. Joe Cannata, who Washington signed in free agency, is expected to enter training camp as the top goalie while Holtby and Grubauer are absent. Grubauer, 24, represented Germany in international competition at the 2014 world championship, two world junior championships (2009 and 2011) and the 2008 world U-18 championship. Most recently, Grubauer stopped 26 of 28 shots on Sunday in Germany’s 3-2 victory over Latvia to earn Germany a berth in the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Grubauer posted a 3-0-0 record with two shutouts, a 0.67 goals-against average and a .970 save percentage in three games at the final Olympic qualification tournament. With the addition of Grubauer, the Capitals are one of four NHL teams with two goaltenders playing in the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Grubauer had an 8-9-1 record in 2015-16 with a 2.32 goals-against average and a .918 save percentage, and he has posted a 15-15-6 record with a 2.38 goals-against average and a .921 save percentage in 42 career NHL games. Team Sweden, featuring Backstrom, will face Team Europe, featuring Grubauer, on Sept. 14 in an exhibition game at the Verizon Center.

Harris was appointed the university's president in 1921. He was the first BYU president to have a doctoral degree. Harris made several important changes to the school, reorganizing it into a true university, whereas before, its organization had remnants of the Academy days. At the beginning of his tenure, the school was not officially recognized as a university by any accreditation organization. By the end of his term, the school was accredited under all major accrediting organizations at the time. He was eventually replaced by Howard S. McDonald, who received his doctorate from the University of California. When he first received the position, the Second World War had just ended, and thousands of students were flooding into BYU. By the end of his stay, the school had grown nearly five times to an enrollment of 5,440 students. The university did not have the facilities to handle such a large influx, so he bought part of an Air Force Base in Ogden, Utah and rebuilt it to house some of the students. The next president, Ernest L. Wilkinson, also oversaw a period of intense growth, as the school adopted an accelerated building program. Wilkinson was responsible for the building of over eighty structures on the campus, many of which still stand. During his tenure, the student body increased six times, making BYU the largest private school at the time. The quality of the students also increased, leading to higher educational standards at the school. Finally, Wilkinson reorganized the LDS Church units on campus, with ten stakes and over 100 wards being added during his administration.

Ask at the seafood counter whether or not the scallops being sold are wet or dry. If they're wet, they've been treated with a chemical (sodium tripolyphosphate) that helps the scallops absorb moisture. Dry scallops haven't been treated so they're fresher, easier to sear, and have a sweeter, brinier taste. Avoid wet scallops since the chemical can make it hard to sear the scallops and the chemical leaves a fishy aftertaste. If you're unable to talk with someone at the seafood counter and are purchasing pre-packaged scallops, you will still need to find out if the scallops are wet or dry. Most labels will clearly state if the scallops are wet or dry. But, if the label doesn't say, check the package for milky white liquid in the bottom. If you see this liquid and the scallops look opaque or really white, they're probably wet scallops. If you don't see any liquid and the scallops plump and clearer, they're most likely dry scallops. While some markets will remove the little flap of muscle that connects the scallop to its shell, others won't. Check over your muscles to make sure these little flaps are all removed since they can be tough. To remove the side muscle, simply pinch it and pull it away. You can throw away the side muscles or save them to make a fish stock. If you accidentally miss a side muscle, it's safe to eat. Take a paper towel and blot any excess moisture from the scallops. Season the scallops with a little salt before you're ready to start pan frying them. The salt can also help draw out extra moisture from the scallops. Try to get the scallops as dry as possible since this will help create a golden brown sear.","output":"When buying scallops, ensure they are dry and not treated with sodium tripolyphosphate for better taste, easier searing, and freshness; check labels and packaging for signs of wet scallops and remove side muscles before cooking for best results."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Catalan language With the union of the crowns of Castille and Aragon (1479), the use of Spanish gradually became more prestigious. Starting in the 16th century, Catalan literature experienced a decline, the language came under the influence of Spanish, and the urban and literary classes became bilingual. Q: When were Castille and Aragon united?","output":"The crowns of Castille and Aragon were united on October 19, 1469, through the marriage of Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castille. This crucial event ultimately led to the formation of the Kingdom of Spain. The union became official when Ferdinand and Isabella were jointly crowned as monarchs of Castille and Aragon in 1479, following the death of John II of Aragon, Ferdinand's father. The union of these two powerful kingdoms had a profound impact on the development of the Catalan language and its literature. Although both crowns maintained their separate institutions, laws, and customs, the rise of Spanish as a common and prestigious language began to overshadow the use of Catalan, particularly among the noble and ruling classes. Throughout the 16th century, Catalan literature faced a decline, and the influence of the Spanish language in administration, education, and public life grew stronger. As the literary and urban classes in the territories of the Crown of Aragon (including Catalonia, Valencia, and the Balearic Islands) became bilingual, the cultural, social, and political importance of the Catalan language diminished. This decline in the status of Catalan persisted over the centuries, even in the face of various efforts to revive its importance. Although Catalan has experienced periods of resurgence in modern times, particularly in the early 20th century and during the transition to democracy in Spain, the historical effects of the union of Castille and Aragon continue to be felt in the linguistic landscape and cultural identity of the Catalan-speaking regions. Today, Catalan is still spoken by millions of people across various regions in Spain, as well as in parts of France and Italy. Moreover, it has been recognized as an official language in Catalonia, the Balearic Islands, and Valencia, where it maintains a rich and diverse literary and cultural tradition. Efforts to promote and preserve the Catalan language and its cultural heritage continue, both within these regions and among Catalan-speaking communities around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: What are the names of the two archipelagos of India? is inside the article: India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane., can you guess it ?

A seventh movement (the soprano solo \\"Ihr habt nun Traurigkeit\\") was added for the equally successful Leipzig premiere (February 1869), and the work went on to receive concert and critical acclaim throughout Germany and also in England, Switzerland and Russia, marking effectively Brahmss arrival on the world stage. Brahms also experienced at this period popular success with works such as his first set of Hungarian Dances (1869), the Liebeslieder Walzer, Op. 52 (Brahms), (1868/69), and his collections of lieder (Opp. 43 and 46–49). Following such successes he finally completed a number of works that he had wrestled with over many years such as the cantata Rinaldo (cantata) (1863–1868), his Two String Quartets, Op. 51 (Brahms) Op. 51 nos. 1 and 2 (1865–1873), the third piano quartet (1855–1875), and most notably his Symphony No. 1 (Brahms) which appeared in 1876, but which had been begun as early as 1855. How many years did it take Brahm to complete A German Requiem Op. 45?","output":"To find the number of years it took Brahms to complete A German Requiem Op. 45, we need to identify the starting and ending years of its composition. According to the article: 1. Brahms began composing A German Requiem Op. 45 after his mother's death in February 1865. 2. Six movements were completed by 1866. 3. A seventh movement was added for the Leipzig premiere in February 1869. Since Brahms started composing A German Requiem Op. 45 in 1865 and added the last movement in 1869, it took him 4 years to complete the piece (1869 - 1865 = 4)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What country of origin does Yu Ying-shih and Asian studies have in common? The answer to this question is:","output":"The country of origin that Yu Ying-shih and Asian studies have in common is China.  Yu Ying-shih (1930-2021) was a renowned Chinese-born American historian and scholar, recognized for his expertise in Chinese intellectual history and historiography. Born in the Anhui Province of China, Yu Ying-shih's early life was spent in China before he eventually moved to the United States to continue his academic pursuits. His keen understanding of Chinese history, society, culture, and classical literature allowed him to contribute significantly to the field of Asian studies, particularly in the realm of Chinese history. Asian studies, as an interdisciplinary academic field, encompasses the history, culture, politics, religion, and literature of various Asian countries, among which China is a particularly significant contributor. China, being one of the world's oldest civilizations with a rich cultural heritage and historical legacy, has long been a significant focus area within Asian studies. Chinese history and culture have been an essential part of understanding not only Asian societies but also the global impact of such an influential civilization. In summary, the country of origin that connects both Yu Ying-shih and Asian studies is China, owing to Yu Ying-shih's Chinese birth and his extensive scholarly contributions to the understanding of Chinese history and culture, which in turn contributes towards the broader field of Asian studies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In order to buy a hotel, you'll need to put together as much money as you can for a down payment. In addition, you'll need money to close the sale and run the hotel until it begins returning profits to you.","output":"1. Determine your budget and financial capabilities: Before you start looking at hotel businesses to buy, you should first determine how much money you have available for investment. This includes not just the initial acquisition cost, but also any necessary renovations, updates, and working capital to run the business until it starts generating a profit. Keep in mind that hotel businesses can be quite expensive, especially if you're looking at larger or more upscale properties. You may wish to consider a combination of personal savings, loans, and investment from outside partners to fund your purchase.   2. Research the hotel industry and market: Having a clear understanding of the hotel industry and the market in your targeted area is crucial when looking to buy a hotel business. Research the market trends, demographics, economic conditions, and competition in the desired location. This information will help you decide the best type of hotel to buy, and it will give you a better idea of the long-term viability and potential profitability of the business. 3. Find hotel properties for sale: Use various methods to identify potential hotel businesses for sale. You can search online real estate and business listing websites, contact hotel brokers (who specialize in these types of transactions), or network with other professionals in the industry for leads. It's important to consider multiple options so you can find a hotel that best fits your budget, goals, and location preferences. 4. Perform a thorough due diligence: Once you have identified hotel properties of interest, you need to evaluate them comprehensively and determine if they meet your investment criteria. This includes reviewing the hotel's financial statements, occupancy rates, profit margin, and condition of the property. You should also investigate whether there are any liens, pending lawsuits, or outstanding tax issues associated with the property. Hiring a professional, such as a hotel consultant, a commercial real estate attorney, and an accountant, can help in this process by providing expert insights and legal guidance. 5. Develop a business and marketing plan: Before you make any decisions, you should create a detailed business and marketing plan for the hotel you wish to buy. This plan should outline your strategy for improving operations, increasing revenue, attracting and retaining guests, and achieving long-term success. Consider factors like room pricing, customer service, amenities that will differentiate you from competitors, and your ideal target market. Additionally, explore various marketing channels and strategies to maximize your exposure to potential guests. 6. Negotiate and finalize the deal: Once you have found a hotel that satisfies your criteria and completed due diligence, the next step is to make an offer and negotiate the terms of the sale with the seller. Work with your attorney and accountant to prepare an offer that protects your interests and still remains attractive to the seller. During this negotiation phase, you can request concessions, such as a price reduction or favorable payment terms. 7. Arrange financing: With the deal under contract, you must now secure any necessary financing to complete the acquisition. Traditional banks, specialized hotel lenders, and private investors are all potential sources of funding. Make sure you have a robust financial plan and a strong credit score to make your financing application more appealing to lenders. 8. Close the deal and assume ownership: After settling the financing, you will need to close the transaction. Work with your attorney and other professionals to ensure all the required documentation is properly completed. Once everything is in order, you will take ownership of the hotel, obtain the necessary licenses and insurance, and begin running the business. 9. Implement your business and marketing plan: With the hotel business now under your control, it's time to implement your strategies as outlined in your business and marketing plan. This could include renovating the facilities, improving the quality of service, and launching marketing campaigns. It's essential to monitor the results of your efforts and be prepared to adapt your strategies as needed. 10. Continuously improve and grow your hotel business: Finally, continuously look for ways to improve your hotel business and increase profitability. Keep up with industry trends, invest in staff training and development, and frequently review your business and marketing plans to ensure you remain competitive in your market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: The classic Key West-style house just off Fleming looked much like the rest of the residences on the block - two-story wooden frame walls and peaked roofs with shallow porches nearly butting up against the sidewalk. Chloe's rusting blue Vespa was tucked away beside the house, in the narrow space separating it from the neighbors. To anyone walking by outside, everything looked quiet and peaceful. Inside, Chloe was pissed. Everything had been going great and then those stupid fuckers had decided to show up a week early, forcing her to scramble to pack a week's work into a single day. She wore a black bandana wrapped around her head, covering her buzz cut pink hair. Numerous smudges of dirt on her cheeks and the tip of her nose testified to the heavy-duty cleaning she'd been doing for the past five hours. She wore loose fitting shorts and a tight-fitting tank top that had once been white. In her bare feet she pushed a mop across the hardwood floors, grumbling to herself. She heard the door open and looked up to see Paul standing in the doorway. Even though it wasn't his fault, she glared at him as he came in. As much as Chloe liked a clean house, she hated housework, and this wasn't even her house. This particular space was sparsely decorated with just a few worn pieces of furniture and some bad condo art on the walls. After six months of being sealed up tight with the air conditioner off, it smelled of dust and mildew and needed a good airing out. \\"What are you doing?\\" asked Paul, closing the door behind him. \\"Mopping,\\" she said, her voice flat. \\"Right. But why are you mopping here? Whose house is this anyway?\\" \\"It's one we just added to the roster last week. The cleaning service hasn't had a chance to get in here yet.\\" \\"I see that,\\" said Paul. \\"So why're you cleaning it tonight?\\" \\"We're cleaning it tonight because the Guidarizzi's decided to make a surprise visit to their winter home in Key West. They're coming in tomorrow afternoon. Every other decent place is filled up, so we have to use this one instead.\\" Question: What is probably true about Chloe?

To find that out, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 7: (7 * k) / 7 = -21 / 7 When we do this division, we find out that: k = -3 And there you go!

Which entity is this text about? Menachem Begin ( listen ; Hebrew: m@nakhem be'giyn Menahem Begin, Polish: Mieczyslaw Biegun; Russian: Menakhem Vol'fovich Begin Menakhem Volfovich Begin; 16 August 1913 - 9 March 1992) was an Israeli politician, founder of Likud and the sixth Prime Minister of Israel. In 1978 Begin, aided by Foreign Minister Moshe Dayan and Defense Minister Ezer Weizman, came to Washington and Camp David to negotiate the Camp David Accords, leading to the 1979 Egypt-Israel Peace Treaty with Egyptian President, Anwar Sadat. Before going to Washington to meet President Carter, Begin visited Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson for his advice. Under the terms of the treaty, brokered by US President, Jimmy Carter, Israel was to hand over the Sinai Peninsula in its entirety to Egypt. The peace treaty with Egypt was a watershed moment in Middle Eastern history, as it was the first time an Arab state recognized Israel's legitimacy whereas Israel effectively accepted the land for peace principle as blueprint for resolving the Arab-Israeli conflict. Given Egypt's prominent position within the Arab World, especially as Israel's biggest and most powerful enemy, the treaty had far reaching strategic and geopolitical implications.  Almost overnight, Begin's public image of an irresponsible nationalist radical was transformed into that of a statesman of historic proportions. This image was reinforced by international recognition which culminated with him being awarded, together with Sadat, the Nobel Peace Prize in 1978.  Yet while establishing Begin as a leader with broad public appeal, the peace treaty with Egypt was met with fierce criticism within his own Likud party. His devout followers found it difficult to reconcile Begin's history as a keen promoter of the Greater Israel agenda with his willingness to relinquish occupied territory. Agreeing to the removal of Israeli settlements from the Sinai was perceived by many as a clear departure from Likud's Revisionist ideology. Several prominent Likud members, most notably Yitzhak Shamir, objected to the treaty and abstained when it was ratified with an overwhelming majority in the Knesset, achieved only thanks to support from the opposition. A small group of hardliners within Likud, associated with Gush Emunim Jewish settlement movement, eventually decided to split and form the Tehiya party in 1979. They led the Movement for Stopping the Withdrawal from Sinai, violently clashing with IDF soldiers during the forceful eviction of Yamit settlement in April 1982. Despite the traumatic scenes from Yamit, political support for the treaty did not diminish and the Sinai was handed over to Egypt in 1982.  Begin was less resolute in implementing the section of the Camp David Accord calling for Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He appointed Agriculture Minister Ariel Sharon to implement a large scale expansion of Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied territories, a policy intended to make future territorial concessions in these areas effectively impossible. Begin refocused Israeli settlement strategy from populating peripheral areas in accordance with the Allon Plan, to building Jewish settlements in areas of Biblical and historic significance. When the settlement of Elon Moreh was established on the outskirts of Nablus in 1979, following years of campaigning by Gush Emunim, Begin declared that there are \\"many more Elon Morehs to come.\\" During his term dozens of new settlements were built, and Jewish population in the West Bank and Gaza more than quadrupled.

Since taking office, he has sought to reduce the 72 billion (Â£49 billion) debt burden that Puerto Rico owes its creditors. In June 2015, the governor publicly declared that the island was unable to pay all of its obligations. Unlike municipalities on the US mainland, Puerto Rico cannot legally file for bankruptcy, as American cities like Detroit have done when faced with similar crises. In September 2015, the government unveiled what it called an economic recovery programme. Mr Padilla Garcia has worked with the island's development bank to restructure its debt burden.

Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Leon establishes the first settlement in 1508. 1500s - Indigenous Amerindian Taino population is virtually wiped out by disease and new settlers. African slave labour is imported. 1868 - A popular uprising against Spanish rule is suppressed but becomes a symbol of the independence struggle. 1898 - Spain cedes Puerto Rico to the US at the end of the Spanish-American War. 1900 - US Congress establishes a civil government under the Foraker Act but maintains strict control over island affairs. Puerto Ricans are granted US citizenship in 1917 under the Jones Act. 1940s - Puerto Rico gains partial self-rule with popularly elected governors. 1952 - Puerto Rico becomes a self-governing commonwealth of the United States.

Tourism plays a crucial role in the economy, attracting millions of visitors annually.

We'll pretend that the letter 'b' is a toy. Let's figure out how to solve the math problem! The problem is: b - 6*b + 77 = 2*b First, let's focus on the toys (b's) on the left side. We have 1 b and then we take away 6 b's. So, 1 b - 6 b = -5 b. Now our problem looks like this:  -5*b + 77 = 2*b Now, we want to bring all the toys (b's) together. To do that, we will add 5 b's to both sides of the equation: -5*b + 5*b + 77 = 2*b + 5*b This simplifies to: 77 = 7*b Now, we want to know how many toys (b's) there are in total. To find that, we can share these 77 equally among the 7 b's. So, we will divide 77 by 7: 77 ÷ 7 = 11 That means there are 11 toys (b's) in total! So, the solution is b equal to 11."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question: Answer the question based on the following text.  Question:   If Mary is running and race and begins to breathe hard, what happens to the air pressure in her lungs as she expands her chest increases or decreases?    Text:  Exhaling, or breathing out, decreases the size of the chest, which increases air pressure inside the lungs. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided text, we can infer that when Mary is running a race and begins to breathe hard, the air pressure in her lungs undergoes changes. Specifically, as she expands her chest while inhaling, the reverse process of the described scenario for exhaling would occur. The text states that exhaling decreases the size of the chest and subsequently increases the air pressure inside the lungs. This suggests that when Mary inhales and expands her chest, it allows for more air to enter her lungs, which causes the chest cavity to increase in size. Consequently, the air pressure inside her lungs decreases. In summary, as Mary takes deeper breaths and expands her chest while running a race and breathing hard, the air pressure in her lungs decreases in response to the chest cavity's expansion and increased air intake. This contrasting relationship between chest size and air pressure in the lungs helps maintain efficient respiratory function, enabling her to continue running and meet the increased oxygen demands of her body during the race."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Who was the matchmaker that was helping Penelope find a suitor? Movie plot title: Penelope Movie plot: Penelope Elcott (Natalie Wood) is the wife of wealthy banker James Elcott (Ian Bannen). Penelope decides to disguise herself as an old woman and rob her husband's bank. While the police, including Lieutenant Horatio Bixbee (Peter Falk), rush to get to the bank, Penelope escapes in a red wig and yellow suit. She donates some of the stolen money to a Salvation Army worker and donates the suit to a second-hand thrift shop. Con artists Sabada (Lila Kedrova) and Ducky (Lou Jacobi) immediately recognize the suit as an original designer outfit from Paris, and purchase it for a mere 7. Penelope visits her psychiatrist, Gregory (Dick Shawn), and tells him all about her criminal activities.

During the chase, she stole a diamond set watch of the Professor's. She next stole on her wedding day. When she caught her maid of honor Mildred Halliday (Norma Crane) kissing James, she swiped Mildred's earrings and necklace. Gregory suggests she is stealing to attract attention from her distant husband. A young woman, Honeysuckle Rose, is accused of being the thief. Gregory wants to return the stolen money to the bank, but panics when he hears police cars arriving.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person who is jailed?, using the article: Kelly is a prostitute who shows up in the small town of Grantville, just one more burg in a long string of quick stops on the run after being chased out of the big city by her former pimp. She engages in a quick tryst with local police captain Griff, who then tells her to stay out of his town and refers her to a cat-house just across the state line. Instead, she decides to give up her illicit lifestyle, becoming a nurse at a hospital for handicapped children. Griff doesn't trust reformed prostitutes, however, and continues trying to run her out of town. Kelly falls in love with J.L. Grant, the wealthy scion of the town's founding family, an urbane sophisticate, and Griff's best friend. After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry. It is only after Kelly is able to finally convince Griff that she truly loves Grant and has given up prostitution for good that he agrees to be their best man. Shortly before the wedding, Kelly arrives at Grant's mansion, only to find him on the verge of molesting a small girl. As he grinningly tries to persuade her to marry him, arguing that she too is a deviant, the only one who can understand him, and that he loves her, Kelly kills him by striking him in the head with a phone receiver.

(), is an American stand-up comedian, writer, actor, and filmmaker. He is known for his use of observational, self-deprecating, dark, and shock humor. In 2012, C.K. won a Peabody Award and has received six Primetime Emmy Awards, as well as numerous awards for The Chris Rock Show, Louie, and his stand-up specials Live at the Beacon Theater (2011) and Oh My God (2013). He has won the Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album twice. In August 2005, C.K. starred in a half-hour HBO special as part of the stand-up series One Night Stand. Inspired by the work ethic of fellow comedian George Carlin, who had committed to dropping all of his existing material and starting over every year, In June 2006, C.K. starred in and wrote Lucky Louie, a sitcom he created. The series premiered on HBO and was videotaped in front of a studio audience; it was HBO's first series in that format. Lucky Louie is described as a bluntly realistic portrayal of family life. HBO canceled the series after its first season. He appeared in three films in 2008: Welcome Home Roscoe Jenkins, Diminished Capacity, and Role Models. C.K. launched his first hour-long special, Shameless, in 2007, which aired on HBO and was later released on DVD. In March 2008, he recorded a second hour-long special, Chewed Up, which premiered on Showtime Network on October 4, 2008, and was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy or Variety Special.  C.K. and his wife Alix Bailey divorced in 2008, with C.K. and Bailey sharing joint custody of their children. In a 2010 interview, C.K. talked about how, after his divorce, he thought, \\"well, there goes my act.\\" He alluded to the way that his marriage had been central to his act and his life, and he said that it took him approximately a year to realize \\"I'm accumulating stories here that are worth telling.\\" One element in his preparation for stand-up was training at the same boxing gym as Lowell, Massachusetts fighter Micky Ward, trying to \\"learn how to ... do the grunt work and the boring, constant training so that you'll be fit enough to take the beating.\\"  On April 18, 2009, C.K. recorded a concert film titled Hilarious. Unlike his previous specials--which had all been produced for television networks--Hilarious was produced independently, directed by C.K. himself, and sold to Epix and Comedy Central after it was complete. As a result, it was not released until late 2010. It was published on DVD and CD in 2011. It is the first stand-up comedy film accepted into the Sundance Film Festival. From 2009 to 2012, C.K. played Dave Sanderson, a police officer and ex-boyfriend of Leslie Knope (played by Amy Poehler) in the sitcom Parks and Recreation. He also co-starred in the romantic comedy fantasy film The Invention of Lying, directed by and starring Ricky Gervais, in 2009.

Rachel took their dog for a walk while Lindsey played with their dog at home, and","output":"as the sun began to set, the atmosphere in their cozy little neighborhood transformed into a picturesque canvas of warm hues. With autumn in full swing, the sight of trees shedding their golden leaves and the faint scent of chimney smoke in the air brought about a sense of serenity that was hard to come by in their bustling city lives. Rachel cherished these walks with her four-legged companion, Max, as it gave her a chance to unwind, clear her head, and reflect on her thoughts and feelings. Max, an energetic Golden Retriever, eagerly bounded through the crunchy leaves, his wagging tail showing just how much he enjoyed these walks as well. As they walked along the winding path through the park, Rachel couldn't help but be grateful for the strong bond that had formed between her and Max over the years. Whenever she felt down or anxious, merely spending a few moments with Max seemed to have a therapeutic effect on her emotions, and she often wondered if he too could sense her gratitude. Meanwhile, back at their home, Lindsey was actively engaged in a playful game of fetch with their feisty Corgi named Daisy. Lindsey, who had always been a fan of calmer indoor activities, found playing with Daisy to be both exciting and soothing. Although they had initially gotten Daisy to keep Max company, she had become an integral part of Lindsey's routine, providing the perfect dose of lightheartedness and comfort that helped her break away from her daily stresses. As the crimson sun dipped below the horizon, the sky painted with a myriad of colors slowly began transforming into a soft blanket of twinkling stars. Rachel and Max, having completed their walk, returned home to the waiting warmth of their small abode. The moment the door opened, Daisy, sensing her canine companion's return, eagerly scampered over and enthusiastically greeted Max with a series of playful barks and nuzzles. Lindsey looked up from her book, her face breaking into a contented smile as she watched the two dogs banter lovingly. The simple bond between these four souls was truly a beautiful sight to behold. They all settled down in the living room, where a crackling fire roared within the hearth. The scent of burning wood mingled with the comforting aromas of freshly brewed herbal tea that Lindsey had prepared to be shared between the two of them. As they sat down on the comfortable sofa, Rachel began recounting her walk with Max while Lindsey shared stories about their playtime with Daisy. The hours passed by peacefully, with laughter and lighthearted conversation filling the air. As the night grew increasingly darker, the two shared stories about life, love, and their dreams for the future. At one point, Max and Daisy tucked by their side, the two realized just how lucky they were to have found a companion in each other, and how their world had become even brighter with the addition of their beloved pets. With full hearts and a sense of gratitude, the night passed as they continued talking, occasionally sharing knowing glances, and pausing to stroke the soft fur of their sleeping dogs. In these moments, time seemed almost to stand still, making room for the simple yet profound joy that comes from sharing life with those you love the most. And as their laughter and whispers eventually turned into gentle snores, the warmth of the fire, the closeness of their family, and the knowledge that they were surrounded by love, carried them off into a blissful slumber."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Mortimer was born in Hampstead, London, the only child of Kathleen May (nee Smith) and Clifford Mortimer, a barrister who became blind in 1936 when he hit his head on the door frame of a London taxi but still pursued his career. Clifford's loss of sight was not acknowledged openly by the family. John Mortimer was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford and Harrow School, where he joined the Communist Party, forming a one-member cell. Originally Mortimer intended to be an actor (his lead role in the Dragon's 1937 production of Richard II gained glowing reviews in The Draconian) and then a writer, but his father persuaded him against it, advising: \\"My dear boy, have some consideration for your unfortunate wife... With weak eyes and doubtful lungs, Mortimer was classified as medically unfit for military service in World War II. He worked for the Crown Film Unit under Laurie Lee, writing scripts for propaganda documentaries.  I lived in London and went on journeys in blacked-out trains to factories and coal-mines and military and air force installations. For the first and, in fact, the only time in my life I was, thanks to Laurie Lee, earning my living entirely as a writer. If I have knocked the documentary ideal, I would not wish to sound ungrateful to the Crown Film Unit. I was given great and welcome opportunities to write dialogue, construct scenes and try and turn ideas into some kind of visual drama.  He based his first novel, Charade, on his experiences with the Crown Film Unit.  Mortimer made his radio debut as a dramatist in 1955 with his adaptation of his own novel Like Men Betrayed for the BBC Light Programme. But he made his debut as an original playwright with The Dock Brief starring Michael Hordern as a hapless barrister, first broadcast in 1957 on BBC Radio's Third Programme, later televised with the same cast and subsequently presented in a double bill with What Shall We Tell Caroline? at the Lyric Hammersmith in April 1958 before transferring to the Garrick Theatre. It was revived by Christopher Morahan in 2007 as part of a touring double bill, Legal Fictions.  His play A Voyage Round My Father, given its first radio broadcast in 1963, is autobiographical, recounting his experiences as a young barrister and his relationship with his blind father. It was memorably televised by BBC Television in 1969 with Mark Dignam in the title role. In a slightly longer version the play later became a stage success (first at Greenwich Theatre in 1979 with Dignam, then a year later at the Theatre Royal Haymarket, now starring Alec Guinness). In 1981 it was remade by Thames Television with Laurence Olivier as the father and Alan Bates as young Mortimer. In 1965, he and his wife wrote the screenplay for the Otto Preminger film Bunny Lake is Missing, which also starred Olivier.

Given the question: Information:  - The Mekong giant catfish, \\"Pangasianodon gigas\\" (, ; /\\"try riec\\"/), is a very large, critically endangered species of catfish (order Siluriformes) in the shark catfish family (Pangasiidae), native to the Mekong basin in Southeast Asia and adjacent China. In Thai folklore, this fish is regarded with reverence, and special rituals are followed and offerings are made before fishing it.  - The Ariidae or ariid catfish are a family of catfish that mainly live in marine waters with many freshwater and brackish water species . They are found worldwide in tropical to warm temperate zones . The family includes about 143 species .  - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example).  - Loricariidae is the largest family of catfish (order Siluriformes), with 92 genera and just over 680 species to date, with new species being described each year. Loricariids originate from freshwater habitats of Costa Rica, Panama, and tropical and subtropical South America. These fish are noted for the bony plates covering their bodies and their suckermouths. Several genera are sold as \\"plecos\\", notably the suckermouth catfish, \\"Hypostomus plecostomus\\", and are popular as aquarium fish.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Candiru (English and Portuguese or \\"candirú\\" in Spanish), \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\", also known as cañero, toothpick fish, or vampire fish, is a species of parasitic freshwater catfish in the family \\"Trichomycteridae\\" native to the Amazon Basin where it is found in the countries of Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.  - The wels catfish (or ; \\"Silurus glanis\\"), also called sheatfish, is a large species of catfish native to wide areas of central, southern, and eastern Europe, in the basins of the Baltic, Black, and Caspian Seas. It has been introduced to Western Europe as a sport fish and is now found from the United Kingdom all the way east to Kazakhstan and China and south to Greece and Turkey. It is a scaleless freshwater fish recognizable by its broad, flat head and wide mouth. Wels catfish can live for at least fifty years and have very good hearing to compensate for their poor sight.  - Crepuscular animals are those that are active primarily during twilight (i.e., the period immediately after dawn and that immediately before dusk). It is thus to be distinguished from diurnal and nocturnal behavior where an animal is active during the hours of daylight or the hours of darkness respectively. The term is not precise, however, as some crepuscular animals may also be active on a moonlit night or during an overcast day. The term matutinal is used for animals that are only active before dawn, and vespertine for those only active after sunset.  - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards.  - Corydoras is a genus of freshwater catfish in the family Callichthyidae and subfamily Corydoradinae. The species usually have more restricted areas of endemism than other callichthyids, but the area of distribution of the entire genus almost equals the area of distribution of the family, except for Panama where \\"Corydoras\\" is not present. \\"Corydoras\\" species are distributed in South America where found east of the Andes to the Atlantic coast, from Trinidad to the Río de la Plata drainage in northern Argentina. Species assigned to \\"Corydoras\\" display a broad diversity of body shapes and coloration. \\"Corydoras\\" are small fish, ranging from in SL.  - Callichthyidae is a family of catfishes (order Siluriformes), called armored catfishes due to the two rows of bony plates (or scutes) running down the length of their bodies. This family contains some of the most popular freshwater aquarium fish, such as the species of \\"Corydoras\\".  - Brackish water or briny water is water that has more salinity than fresh water, but not as much as seawater. It may result from mixing of seawater with fresh water, as in estuaries, or it may occur in brackish fossil aquifers. The word comes from the Middle Dutch root \\"brak\\". Certain human activities can produce brackish water, in particular civil engineering projects such as dikes and the flooding of coastal marshland to produce brackish water pools for freshwater prawn farming. Brackish water is also the primary waste product of the salinity gradient power process. Because brackish water is hostile to the growth of most terrestrial plant species, without appropriate management it is damaging to the environment (see article on shrimp farms).  - Detritivores, also known as detrivores, detritophages, detritus feeders, or detritus eaters, are heterotrophs that obtain nutrients by consuming detritus (decomposing plant and animal parts as well as feces). There are many kinds of invertebrates, vertebrates and plants that carry out coprophagy. By doing so, all these detritivores contribute to decomposition and the nutrient cycles. They should be distinguished from other decomposers, such as many species of bacteria, fungi and protists, which are unable to ingest discrete lumps of matter, but instead live by absorbing and metabolizing on a molecular scale (saprotrophic nutrition). However, the terms detritivore and decomposer are often used interchangeably.     What is the relationship between 'ariidae' and 'siluriformes'? The answer is:","output":"Ariidae is a family of catfish that is part of the order Siluriformes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Given the question: Information:  - Cartmel Priory church serves as the parish church of Cartmel , Cumbria ( formerly in Lancashire ) . The priory was founded in 1190 by William Marshal , created 1st Earl of Pembroke , intended for the Augustinian Canons and dedicated to Saint Mary the Virgin and Saint Michael . To support the new house William granted it the whole fief of the district of Cartmel . It was first colonised by a prior and twelve monks from Bradenstoke Priory in Wiltshire . The only other surviving monastic building is the gatehouse which faces the village square . The church is an active Anglican parish church in the deanery of Windermere , the archdeaconry of Westmorland and Furness , and the diocese of Carlisle . Its benefice is united with those of St Mary , Allithwiate , St Peter , Field Broughton , St John the Baptist , Flookburgh , St Paul , Grange - over - Sands , Grange Fell Church , Grange - Over - Sands , and St Paul , Lindale , to form the benefice of Cartmel Peninsula . The church is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade I listed building .  - A friar is a member of one of the mendicant orders founded since the twelfth or thirteenth century; the term distinguishes the mendicants' itinerant apostolic character, exercised broadly under the jurisdiction of a superior general, from the older monastic orders' allegiance to a single monastery formalized by their vow of stability. The most significant orders of friars are the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians and Carmelites.  - The Franciscans are a group of related mendicant religious orders within the Catholic Church, founded in 1209 by Francis of Assisi. These orders include the Order of Friars Minor, the Order of Saint Clare, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. Theses orders adheres to the teachings and spiritual disciplines of the founder and of his main associates and followers, such as Clare of Assisi, Anthony of Padua, and Elizabeth of Hungary, among many others.   - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - Abbot, meaning father, is an ecclesiastical title given to the male head of a monastery in various traditions, including Christianity. The office may also be given as an honorary title to a clergyman who is not actually the head of a monastery. The female equivalent is abbess.  - The Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel or Carmelites (sometimes simply Carmel by synecdoche) is a Roman Catholic religious order founded, probably in the 12th century, on Mount Carmel in the Crusader States, hence the name Carmelites. However, historical records about its origin remain uncertain. Saint Bertold has traditionally been associated with the founding of the order, but few clear records of early Carmelite history have survived, and this is likely to be a later extrapolation by hagiographers.  - The Peerage of England comprises all peerages created in the Kingdom of England before the Act of Union in 1707. In that year, the Peerages of England and Scotland were replaced by one Peerage of Great Britain.  - The River Eea is a small river in the Lake District, Cumbria, England running through the Furness region, which was once part of Lancashire. The River Eea is a relatively short system that arises from numerous small becks and streams throughout the Cartmel Valley. Its course is approximately 10 km long and the mouth is on Sand Gate marshes near Flookburgh, between Barrow and Kendal. It principally flows in a south-westerly direction.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - A monk (from , \\"monachos\\", \\"single, solitary\\" and Latin \\"monachus\\") is a person who practices religious asceticism, living either alone or with any number of other monks. A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy.  - A priory is a monastery of men or women under religious vows that is headed by a prior or prioress. Priories may be houses of mendicant friars or religious sisters (as the Dominicans, Augustinians, Franciscans, and Carmelites, for instance), or monasteries of monks or nuns (as the Benedictines). Houses of canons regular and canonesses regular also use this term, the alternative being \\"canonry\\".  - The Local Government Act 1972 (c 70) is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom that reformed local government in England and Wales on 1 April 1974.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - North West England, one of nine official regions of England, consists of the five counties of Cheshire, Cumbria, Greater Manchester, Lancashire and Merseyside. The North West had a population of 7,052,000 in 2011. It is the third most populated region in the United Kingdom after the South East and Greater London.  - Furness is an area of Cumbria in northwestern England. Together with Cartmel it forms North Lonsdale, which was historically an exclave of Lancashire. The region may be split into two areas: Low Furness and High Furness. The former consists of the headland bounded on west by the Duddon estuary and on the east by Morecambe Bay, while the latter extends inland into the Lake District and contains the Furness Fells. Off the southern tip of Low Furness is Walney Island, eighteen kilometers in length, as well as several smaller islands.  - Cumbria County Council is the county council of Cumbria, a county in the North West of England. Established in 1974, following its first elections held a year before that, it is an elected local government body responsible for the most significant local services in the county, including county schools, county roads, and social services.  - Cartmel is a village in Cumbria, England, north-west of Grange-over-Sands and close to the River Eea. The village was once known as Kirkby in Cartmel, as it was the location of the church for the large parish of Cartmel. It is the location of the 12th century Cartmel Priory. Historically in Lancashire, boundary changes brought it into the newly created county of Cumbria in 1974.  - A monastery is a building or complex of buildings comprising the domestic quarters and workplaces of monastics, monks or nuns, whether living in communities or alone (hermits). A monastery generally includes a place reserved for prayer which may be a chapel, church or temple, and may also serve as an oratory.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - A non-metropolitan county, or colloquially, shire county, is a county-level entity in England that is not a metropolitan county. The counties typically have populations of 300,000 to 1.4 million. The term \\"shire county\\" is, however, an unofficial usage. Many of the non-metropolitan counties bear historic names and most end in the suffix \\"-shire\\" such as Wiltshire or Staffordshire. Of the remainder, some counties had the -shire ending and have lost it over time; such as Devon and Somerset. \\"Shire county\\" is, strictly, a dual-language tautology since the French-derived \\"county\\" means the same as the older Anglo-Saxon word \\"shire\\".  - A nun is a member of a religious community of women, typically one living under vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. She may have decided to dedicate her life to serving all other living beings, or she might be an ascetic who voluntarily chose to leave mainstream society and live her life in prayer and contemplation in a monastery or convent. The term \\"nun\\" is applicable to Catholics (eastern and western traditions), Orthodox Christians, Anglicans, Lutherans, Jains, Buddhists, Taoists, Hindus and some other religious traditions.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - Prior, derived from the Latin for \\"earlier, first\\", (or prioress for nuns) is an ecclesiastical title for a superior, usually lower in rank than an abbot or abbess. Its earlier generic usage referred to any monastic superior.  - Cumbria (; locally ) is a non-metropolitan county in North West England. The county and Cumbria County Council, its local government, came into existence in 1974 after the passage of the Local Government Act 1972. Cumbria's county town is Carlisle, in the north of the county, and the only other major urban area is Barrow-in-Furness on the southwestern tip of the county.  - In Christianity, an abbess (Latin \\"abbatissa\\", feminine form of \\"abbas,\\" abbot) is the female superior of a community of nuns, which is often an abbey.  - Grange-over-Sands is a town and civil parish on Morecambe Bay  with a wide tidal range, hence the \\"sands\\" name  roughly midway between Barrow-in-Furness and Kendal in Cumbria, England. Grange-over-Sands was created as an urban district in 1894 and lies historically within Lancashire. In 1974 Cumbria was created under Local Government re-organisation which absorbed the area referred to as \\"Lancashire North of the Sands\\" or North Lonsdale. Grange is now in South Lakeland District. The town remains part of the County Palatine of Lancashire and is part of the Duchy of Lancaster. It had a population of 4,042 in 2001, increasing to 4,114 at the 2011 Census.  - An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era.  - Barrow-in-Furness (; commonly known as Barrow) is a town and borough in Cumbria, North West England. Historically part of Lancashire, it was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1867 and merged with adjacent districts in 1974 to form the Borough of Barrow-in-Furness. At the tip of the Furness peninsula, close to the Lake District, it is bordered by Morecambe Bay, the Duddon Estuary and the Irish Sea. In 2011, Barrow's population was 57,000, the second largest urban area in Cumbria after Carlisle. Natives of Barrow, as well as the local dialect, are known as Barrovian.  - Lancashire (; archaically the County Palatine of Lancaster; abbreviated Lancs.) is a non-metropolitan ceremonial county in north west England. The county town is Lancaster although the county's administrative centre is Preston. The county has a population of 1,449,300 and an area of . People from Lancashire are known as Lancastrians.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - West Wales is the western region of Wales.  Some definitions of West Wales include only Pembrokeshire, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, which historically comprised the Welsh principality of \\"Deheubarth\\" and was called \\"South West Wales\\" in the Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS). Other definitions include Swansea and Neath Port Talbot but exclude Ceredigion. The \\"West Wales and the Valleys\\" NUTS area includes more westerly parts of North Wales. The preserved county of Dyfed covers what is generally considered to be West Wales, which, between 1974 and 1996, was also a county, with a county council and six district councils.  - A mendicant (from , \\"begging\\") is one who practices mendicancy (begging) and relies chiefly or exclusively on charitable donations to survive. In principle, mendicant religious orders do not own property, either individually or collectively, and members have taken a vow of poverty, in order that all their time and energy could be expended on practicing or preaching and serving the poor. It is a form of asceticism.  - A parish church (or parochial church) in Christianity is the church which acts as the religious centre of a parish. In many parts of the world, especially in rural areas, the parish church may play a significant role in community activities, often allowing its premises to be used for non-religious community events. The church building reflects this status, and there is considerable variety in the size and style of parish churches. Many villages in Europe have churches that date back to the Middle Ages, but all periods of architecture are represented.  - Pembrokeshire (, or ) is a county in the south west of Wales. It borders Carmarthenshire to the east and Ceredigion to the north east. Pembrokeshire County Council's headquarters are in the county town of Haverfordwest.  - Pembroke Castle is a medieval castle in Pembroke, West Wales. Standing beside the Pembroke River, it underwent major restoration work in the early 20th century. The castle was the original seat of the Earldom of Pembroke.  - A parish is a church territorial unit constituting a division within a diocese. A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church. Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).  - Pembroke is a historic settlement and former county town of Pembrokeshire in West Wales. The town features a number of historic buildings and complexes and is one of the major population centres in the county. It was the birthplace of Henry Tudor, later Henry VII of England.  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - The Earldom of Pembroke is a title in the Peerage of England that was first created in the 12th century by King Stephen of England. The title, which is associated with Pembroke, Pembrokeshire in West Wales, has been recreated ten times from its original inception. With each creation beginning with a new first Earl, the original seat of Pembroke Castle is no longer attached to the title.

But officials in the Brazilian town of Biritiba Mirim, 70km (45miles) east of Sao Paulo, _ . They plan to prohibit residents from dying early because the local cemetery  has reached full capacity. There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated  and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims. A 2003 decree  by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area. Biritiba Mirim, a town of 28,000 inhabitants, not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away. The bill also calls on people to take care of their health in order to avoid death. \\"I haven't got a job, nor am I healthy. And now they say I can't die.

What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step of the process described is Glycolysis, which occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell and involves the breakdown of glucose. During glycolysis, one molecule of glucose (a six-carbon sugar) is split into two molecules of pyruvate (a three-carbon compound). This process produces a small amount of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is the cell's primary energy currency, and NADH, a high-energy electron carrier molecule. Since glycolysis does not require oxygen, it can take place in both aerobic (oxygen-rich) and anaerobic (oxygen-poor) environments. After glycolysis, the fate of the pyruvate molecules depends on the availability of oxygen in the cell. If there is sufficient oxygen, the cell proceeds with the aerobic respiration process, which includes the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, to produce a significantly larger amount of energy. If oxygen is scarce, as described in your statement, anaerobic respiration or fermentation occurs, which generates far less ATP than aerobic respiration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Map that named America is a puzzle for researchers WASHINGTON | Mon Dec 3, 2007 1:47pm EST WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The only surviving copy of the 500-year-old map that first used the name America goes on permanent display this month at the Library of Congress, but even as it prepares for its debut, the 1507 Waldseemuller map remains a puzzle for researchers. Why did the mapmaker name the territory America and then change his mind later? How was he able to draw South America so accurately? Why did he put a huge ocean west of America years before European explorers discovered the Pacific? \\"That's the kind of conundrum, the question, that is still out there,\\" said John Hebert, chief of the geography and map division of the Library of Congress. The 12 sheets that make up the map, purchased from German Prince Johannes Waldburg-Wolfegg for 10 million in 2003, were mounted on Monday in a huge 6-foot by 9.5-foot (1.85 meter by 2.95 meter) display case machined from a single block of aluminum. The case will be flooded with inert argon gas to prevent deterioration when it goes on public display December 13. Researchers are hopeful that putting the rarely shown map on permanent display for the first time since it was discovered in the Waldburg-Wolfegg castle archives in 1901 may stimulate interest in finding out more about the documents used to produce it. The map was created by the German monk Martin Waldseemuller. Thirteen years after Christopher Columbus first landed in the Western Hemisphere, the Duke of Lorraine brought Waldseemuller and a group of scholars together at a monastery in Saint-Die in France to create a new map of the world. The result, published two years later, is stunningly accurate and surprisingly modern. \\"The actual shape of South America is correct,\\" said Hebert. \\"The width of South America at certain key points is correct within 70 miles of accuracy.\\" Given what Europeans are believed to have known about the world at the time, it should not have been possible for the mapmakers to produce it, he said. The map gives a reasonably correct depiction of the west coast of South America. But according to history, Vasco Nunez de Balboa did not reach the Pacific by land until 1513, and Ferdinand Magellan did not round the southern tip of the continent until 1520. \\"So this is a rather compelling map to say, 'How did they come to that conclusion,'\\" Hebert said. The mapmakers say they based it on the 1,300-year-old works of the Egyptian geographer Ptolemy as well as letters Florentine navigator Amerigo Vespucci wrote describing his voyages to the new world. But Hebert said there must have been something more. \\"From the writings of Vespucci you couldn't have prepared the map,\\" Hebert said. \\"There had to be something cartographic with it.\\" Waldseemuller made it clear he was naming the new land after Vespucci, describing how he came up with the name America based on the navigator's first name. But he soon had misgivings about what he had done. An atlas Waldseemuller produced six years later shows only part of the east coast of the Americas, and refers to it as Terra Incognita -- unknown land. \\"America has gone out of his lexicon,\\" Hebert said. \\"(No) place in the atlas -- in the text or in the maps -- does the name America appear.\\" His 1516 mariner's map, on the same scale as the 1507 map, steps back even further, showing only parts of the new continents and reconnecting the north to Asia. South America is labeled Terra Nova -- New World -- and North America is labeled Terra de Cuba -- Land of Cuba. \\"Essentially he's reconnecting North America to the Asian mainland, suggesting a continual world of land mass rather than separated by those bodies of water that separate us from Europe and Asia,\\" Hebert said. Why the rollback? No one knows. In writings accompanying the 1516 map, Waldseemuller comes across as if he \\"has seen the better of his error and is now correcting it,\\" Hebert said. He speculated that power politics played a role. Spain and Portugal divided the globe between them in 1494, two years after Columbus, with territory to the east going to Portugal and land to the west to Spain. That demarcation line is oddly absent from the 1507 Waldseemuller map, and flags marking territorial claims in South America suggest Portugal controls the region's southernmost land, even though it is in Spain's area of influence. On the later map, the southernmost flag is Spanish, Hebert said. \\"It is possible one could say the 1507 map is influenced strongly by Portuguese sources and conceivably the 1516 map may be influenced more by Spanish sources,\\" he said. Although the map conceals many mysteries, one thing is clear: it represents a revolutionary shift in the way Europe viewed the world. \\"This is ... essentially the beginning or first map of the modern age, and it's one that everything builds on from that point forward,\\" Hebert said. \\"It becomes a keystone map.\\" What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. The 1507 Waldseemüller map, the only surviving copy of the 500-year-old map that first used the name America, is going on permanent display at the Library of Congress. 2.

Question: Speakers of different languages not only describe the world differently but think about it differently too, according to a new study. Researchers used a cartoon cat Sylvester to study how language was reflected   in the gestures people made. Dr. Sotaro Kita of the University of Bristol's Department of Experimental Psychology  , showed the cartoon to a group of native English, Japanese and Turkish speakers and then watched their gestures as they described the actions they had seen. He found speakers of the three different languages used different gestures to describe the same event, which appeared to reflect the way the structure of their languages expressed that event. For example, when describing a scene where the cat swings on a rope, the English speakers used gestures showing an arc trajectory    and the Japanese and Turkish speakers tended to use straight gestures showing the motion but not the arc. Dr. Kita suggests this is because Japanese and Turkish have no proper verb to express the English meaning \\"to swing\\". While English speakers use the arc gesture as their language can readily express the change of location and the arc-shaped trajectory, Japanese and Turkish speakers cannot as easily express the idea of movement with an arc trajectory so they use the straight gesture. Dr. Kita said, \\"My research suggests that speakers of different languages cause different spatial   images of the same event in a way that matches the expressive possibilities of their own languages. In other words, language influences   spatial thinking at the moment of speaking.\\" 69. After watching the gestures of speakers of the three different languages, Dr. Kita concluded that    _   . A) Japanese and Turkish people couldn't express the meaning of \\"swing\\" B) English was obviously better than Japanese and Turkish C) no word in Japanese and Turkish could express some ideas of English D) every language had its own special way to describe things Answer:","output":"D) every language had its own special way to describe things"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The mitotic cell division process consists of several stages, including prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, followed by cytokinesis where the cytoplasm gets divided, and two daughter cells are formed."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Enable two-factor authentication (2FA): To add an extra layer of security to your account, enable two-factor authentication. This requires a second form of verification, such as a text message or authenticator app, when signing in from a new device. 4. Check account settings: Review your Gmail settings, including filters, forwarding, and the \\"Send mail as\\" option, to ensure that the hacker has not made any unauthorized changes. 5. Revoke unauthorized access: Go to the \\"Security\\" section in your Google account settings and check for any unfamiliar devices, apps, or services that have access to your account. Revoke access to anything suspicious. 6. Notify contacts: If the hacker sent emails on your behalf or accessed your contacts, notify your contacts about the situation and advise them to ignore any suspicious emails from your account. 7. Check associated accounts: Review any accounts linked to your Gmail, such as social media or online banking, and ensure they have not been compromised. 8. Update security questions and recovery information: Ensure that your security questions and recovery email or phone number are up-to-date and not manipulated by the hacker. 9.

Given the following context:  Throughout the 360° Tour, the band worked on multiple album projects, including: a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse; a dance record produced by RedOne and will.i.am; and Songs of Ascent. However, the latter was not completed to their satisfaction, and by December 2011, Clayton admitted it would not come to fruition. The sessions with Danger Mouse instead formed the foundation of U2's next album, and they worked with him until May 2013 before enlisting the help of producers Paul Epworth, Ryan Tedder, Declan Gaffney, and Flood. The band suspended work on the album late in 2013 to contribute a new song, \\"Ordinary Love\\", to the film Mandela: Long Walk to Freedom. The track, written in honour of Nelson Mandela, won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. In November 2013, U2's long-time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm, Principle Management. McGuinness, who had managed the group for over 30 years, was succeeded by Guy Oseary.

Answer:","output":"Given the two facts above, when an animal perspires, its bodily water decreases. Perspiration, also known as sweating, is a process through which animals regulate their body temperature. When the body temperature rises, the sweat glands produce sweat, which then evaporates from the skin's surface and helps cool the body down. Fact 1 states that when an animal sweats, its bodily water decreases. This is because the water in sweat comes from the body's internal fluids, primarily blood plasma and extracellular fluid. As the animal perspires, these fluids are drawn out to the skin's surface, leading to a reduction in the animal's bodily water content.

They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminating 50% of the world's oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions. On the run from his own government, he seeks refuge in the Israeli embassy.

Question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Some scientists say that animals in the ocean are increasingly threatened  by noise pollution caused by human beings. The noise that affects sea animals comes from a number of human activities. Such noises are added to natural sounds. These sounds include the breaking of ice fields, underwater earthquakes, and sounds made by animals themselves. Decibels  measured in water are different from those measured on land. A noise of one hundred and twenty decibels on land caused pain to human ears. In water, a decibel level of one hundred and ninety-five would have the same effect. Some scientists have planned to set a noise limit of one hundred and twenty decibels in oceans. They have found that noises at that level can frighten and confuse  whales. A team of American and Canadian scientists discovered that loud noises can seriously hurt some animals. The research team found that powerful underwater explosions were causing whales in the area to lose their hearing. This seriously affected the whales' ability to exchange information and find their way. Some of the whales even died. The explosions had caused their ears to bleed and become infected. Many researchers whose work depends on ocean sounds disagree to a limit of one hundred and twenty decibels. They say such a limit would mean an end to important industrial and scientific research. Scientists do not know how much and what kinds of noises are harmful to ocean animals. However, many scientists suspect  that noise is a greater danger than they believed. They want to stop noises from harming creatures in the ocean. Question: We can know from the passage that many scientists think that the noise limit  of one hundred twenty decibels would   _  .

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Process: - The diaphragm contracts - The lungs expand - Air is pulled from outside the body, into the lungs - The membranes in the lungs collect oxygen molecules - Oxygen is transferred to red blood cells - Red blood cells distribute oxygen throughout the body -   Question: suppose the lungs expand more happens, how will it affect LESS oxygen reaching the body.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"The lung expansion is primarily related to the volume of air being pulled into the body and does not directly influence the amount of oxygen getting transferred to the red blood cells, which subsequently distribute oxygen throughout the body. The amount of oxygen that is absorbed in the lungs is dependent on various factors including the concentration of oxygen in the inhaled air, the diffusion capacity of the lungs, the amount of oxygen-carrying hemoglobin in the blood, and the cardiac output. If the lungs were to expand more, this would likely initially increase the volume of air being inhaled. However, this doesn't necessarily mean more oxygen would reach the body.  The efficacy of oxygen transfer in the lungs depends on a delicate balance of many physiological variables. If lung expansion were to increase substantially, it might actually alter this balance and could potentially even lead to less efficient oxygen transfer. For example, excessively large breaths might distend the lung tissues and disrupt the normal architecture of the alveoli (the microscopic air sacs responsible for oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange), thus impairing gas exchange.  Moreover, larger lung volumes may also cause changes in airway resistance and alter the mechanics of breathing, which could lead to faster, more superficial breathing. This can result in an increase in dead space ventilation (i.e. areas of the lung where air is ventilated but doesn't participate in gas exchange), reducing the fraction of each breath that is effectively used for oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange. Therefore, if the lungs expand more, it could possibly result in less oxygen reaching the body, considering potential negative impacts on the efficiency of lung function, oxygen-carbon dioxide exchange, and breathing mechanics. So, there might be a negative or \\"less\\" impact on oxygen distribution throughout the body if lungs were to expand more than they functionally should. However, this would highly depend on the specifics of the individual case and additional body's compensatory mechanisms.  Please note also that these predictions would best be confirmed empirically, with tests that can directly measure lung function and oxygenation levels. It is advisable to consult a healthcare provider to understand the specifics of lung physiology and pathophysiology."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In cosmology and astronomy the phenomena of stars, nova, supernova, quasars and gamma-ray bursts are the universe's highest-output energy transformations of matter. All stellar phenomena (including solar activity) are driven by various kinds of energy transformations. Energy in such transformations is either from gravitational collapse of matter (usually molecular hydrogen) into various classes of astronomical objects (stars, black holes, etc.), or from nuclear fusion (of lighter elements, primarily hydrogen). The nuclear fusion of hydrogen in the Sun also releases another store of potential energy which was created at the time of the Big Bang. At that time, according to theory, space expanded and the universe cooled too rapidly for hydrogen to completely fuse into heavier elements. This meant that hydrogen represents a store of potential energy that can be released by fusion. Such a fusion process is triggered by heat and pressure generated from gravitational collapse of hydrogen clouds when they produce stars, and some of the fusion energy is then transformed into sunlight.

(CNN) -- In the shadows of Mount Redoubt, Alaskans are calmly waiting for the volcano to erupt -- an event that could occur at any time. Alaska's Mount Redoubt volcano spews ash and steam during an eruption in 1989. \\"The level of seismic activity\\" has \\"increased markedly\\" in recent days at the 10,197-foot peak located about 100 miles southwest of Anchorage, the state's most populous city, according to the Alaska Volcano Observatory. \\"We don't have a crystal ball,\\" said Peter Cervelli, a research geophysicist with the observatory, which is aggressively monitoring the volcano. But \\"we expect based on the past behavior of this volcano that this activity is going to culminate in an eruption.\\" \\"It's not the closest volcano to Anchorage,\\" Cervelli said, but \\"it has the potential to disrupt air traffic at OPTIONS: - Alaska.\\" - Alaska Volcano Observatory.\\" - Alaskans.\\" - Anchorage.\\" - CNN.\\" - Mount Redoubt.\\" - Peter Cervelli.\\" - Volcano.\\"","output":"\\"Anchorage.\\" The potential interruption stems from the ash clouds that can result from volcanic eruptions. Volcanic ash poses a severe risk to aviation, as the fine particulate matter can clog aircraft engines, leading to potential engine failure. Given the proximity of Mount Redoubt to Anchorage, which houses a significant airport hub, any major eruption could lead to flight cancellations and reroutes. These decisions would inevitably be driven by prevailing winds and the altitude to which the volcanic ash reaches. Besides, Anchorage was already affected by the 1989 eruption of Mount Redoubt, which caused hundreds of flight cancellations and reroutes. The city also experienced ashfall, which irritated eyes and respiratory systems, damaged cars and buildings, and incurred cleanup costs. Hence, there is a considerable concern about the disruptive potential of another eruption. Peter Cervelli and his team at the Alaska Volcano Observatory are closely monitoring the seismic activity of Mount Redoubt. The use of state-of-the-art equipment, including seismometers and GPS instruments, enables scientists to track the volcano's movements and detect signs of imminent eruption accurately. Their efforts are critical to providing as much warning as possible to communities potentially affected by an eruption. While the unpredictability of volcanic activity means that the exact timing and scale of an eruption cannot be pinpointed, the heightened seismic activity under Mount Redoubt is a clear indication that magma is moving beneath the volcano. This perception raises the alarm for a potential eruption, a reality with possibly significant impacts for the residents of Anchorage and all Alaskans who may be in the path of volcanic ash plume or its downstream effects.  However, Alaskans are no stranger to volcanic activities with over 40 active volcanoes in the state, which is situated within the Pacific \\"Ring of Fire.\\" From past experiences, Alaskans have developed a level of resilience and preparedness against these natural threats, ensuring that, even in the face of possible disruption and hardship brought about by a volcanic eruption, they remain calmly waiting and ready for whatever events may unfold."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Guilt can be productive; it can help us grow and mature and, most importantly, learn from our behavior when we offend or hurt others or ourselves. This type of guilt serves a purpose and encourages us to redirect our moral and/or behavioral compass.  For example, if you said something offensive to a close friend over which you feel guilty because it upset them, you will learn not to say those types of things or else you risk losing friends. In other words, you will learn from your mistake. In this sense, then, the guilt has worked productively to positively reshape your behavior.  To give another example, if you feel guilty because you ate an entire bag of chips, that's your brain's way of reminding you about a behavior you probably already know is unhealthy and can adversely affect your well-being. Thus, the rational feeling of guilt motivates you to reflect on and change your behavior for the better. Guilt can also be unproductive, in the sense that you feel guilt even when your behavior doesn't need reflection or transformation. This is irrational guilt that can devolve into a cycle where you begin to feel guilty when there is nothing to feel guilty about and you then ruminate on that guilt.  For example, many first-time parents worry about going back to work because they think leaving their child with a nanny or in daycare will cause unknown damage to their child's mental and physical development. In reality, however, that's just not the case; in fact, most children develop normally irrespective of whether one or both parents work. There's nothing to really feel guilty about in this situation, but many people do, nevertheless. Put differently, this feeling of guilt doesn't produce anything but more irrational guilt.  Unproductive guilt can have adverse effects on your cognitive well-being. For example, you may become overly self-critical, experience low self-esteem, and doubt your self-worth. It is important to recognize that sometimes we feel guilty for things over which we had no control, such as a car crash or not arriving in time to say goodbye to a loved one before he passed. Sometimes people involved in such traumatic events overestimate their knowledge of the event and what they could have done. In other words, these individuals think they could or should have done something but, in reality, could not have. These intense feelings of guilt can produce feelings of helplessness and a feeling of having lost control. For example, perhaps you feel guilty that you survived a car accident, while your friend was killed. This is known as survivor's guilt, which often emerges when we try to explain and make sense of traumatic events that we experience. In the case of serious guilt, you may want to seek professional help from a therapist who can help you work through your feelings of guilt. Engage in self-exploration to really get in touch with your feelings and to determine that it is guilt that you are experiencing and not another emotion. Studies using MRI scans of the brain have shown that guilt is an emotion that is distinct from shame or sadness. At the same time, these studies show that shame and sadness were often also present and correlate with guilt. Thus, it is important that you spend some time reflecting on your feelings in order to precisely pinpoint what you need to address.  Define your thoughts, feelings, surroundings, and body sensations. You can do this cognitively, through the practice of mindfulness, meaning that you just focus on what you're feeling in that moment without judgement or reaction. Alternatively, you can write your feelings down in a journal. Writing out what you're experiencing can help you clarify those emotions as you try to put them into words. Example: I am feeling overwhelmed today with guilt, and I also feel sad. I can't stop thinking about it. I can tell that I’m stressed because I have a tension headache, tension in my shoulders, and a nervous feeling in my stomach. Think about what is causing these guilty feelings. Again, consider writing everything down to begin the process of working through the feeling of guilt. Here are some examples:  \\"I let Fido out and he got run over by a car. I feel guilty that Fido is now dead because our whole family loved him so much.\\" \\"I didn't study for the exam and I got an F. I feel guilty that I let my parents down because they pay so much for me to go to school.\\" \\"I broke up with Bobby. I feel guilty that he hurts so much.\\" \\"My friend's mom passed away, and my mom is still alive and healthy. I feel guilty because my friend's life is in pieces and mine is perfect.\\" You will have to accept that you cannot change the past or what has happened. Acceptance also involves acknowledging difficulty and recognizing that you are able to withstand painful feelings in the present moment. This is the first stage in dealing appropriately with your guilt and moving forward. It is helpful to tell yourself affirming statements that emphasize acceptance and tolerance. Examples of these statements are:  \\"I know dealing with guilt is hard, but for now I know I can endure.\\" \\"This is difficult, but I can accept what has happened and not fight or avoid this feeling - it is what it is.\\" Summary:","output":"Guilt can be both productive and unproductive, depending on the situation and how it influences our behavior. Productive guilt helps us learn from our mistakes and redirects our moral and behavioral compass, leading to personal growth. Unproductive guilt, on the other hand, is irrational and can lead to negative psychological effects. To address feelings of guilt, it is important to engage in self-exploration and reflection to accurately identify the emotions being experienced. Defining thoughts, feelings, and body sensations can help in understanding the situation. Mindfulness or journaling may be useful tools in this process. Once the cause of the guilt is understood, acceptance of the situation and the inability to change the past is crucial. Affirming statements emphasizing acceptance and tolerance can help in coping with the difficult feelings related to guilt. If guilt becomes too overwhelming, seeking professional help from a therapist may be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. On February 26, 2014, Combs premiered \\"Big Homie\\", featuring Rick Ross and French Montana, as the first single from his mixtape MMM (Money Making Mitch), which was originally scheduled to be released that year. The song was released for digital download on March 24, and two days later the trailer for the music video was released. The full version of the music video was released on March 31. Combs used his former stage name Puff Daddy for the album. MMM was released as a free mixtape album of 12 tracks on November 4, 2015.

Adrian Sinbad is a wealthy owner of an oil company, and the descendant of a long-line of great mariners. He and a small group of people sail to the Bay of Bengal after learning that his oil rig had been sunk by a band of pirates.

Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up? Pack a preparedness kit  and keep it in a safe location. In a major earthquake, it's possible that you won't be able to get into your house. Keep supplies in your car trunk or an outside storage shed if possible. Pack whatever your family is likely to need, enough for three days to a week, including food, water, medication, first aid and personal hygiene supplies, flashlights, a portable radio, blankets, clothes and shoes, cash, or camp stove, candles, matches or lighters, and a whistle.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which student studied more about keystone species?  Hint: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. Removing yourself from the possibility of running into the bully can help avoid their insults altogether. Take a new route when leaving class, increase your privacy online and make sure you're never alone with the bully unless necessary. If you're in a class together, ask if your teacher can sit you away from them.  You can also ask to leave a few minutes early so you can avoid them when walking out. If the bullying occurs in the breakroom or on your walk to class, go with a friend. The bully is less likely to be mean to you in the presence of someone else. If you want, you can tell your friend what's going on with the bully or you can just simply ask them to walk with you. Tune that bully out by listening to that new album you like or watching videos on YouTube. This will drown out any insults they might be hurling at you while giving you an opportunity to do something fun. Killing two birds with one stone! Maybe you're in your room or at work when the bully begins going off.  Do something else! Fold up clothes when your big sister is being mean or tidy up your desk if your coworker is at it again. Sometimes, the best policy is to simply get away from them completely.  Don't let them give you more insults that you can handle. Simply stand up and walk away and go do something fun.

They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity.

We have the equation -4693*i + 144988 = -8680 + 23987 - 29881. First, let's add and subtract the numbers on the right side of the equation. We have: -8680 + 23987 - 29881 = -578 Now the equation looks like this: -4693*i + 144988 = -578. We want to find the value of i. So, we need to get i alone on one side of the equation. Let's move 144988 to the right side. To do that, we'll subtract 144988 from both sides. Here's what that looks like: -4693*i = -144988 - 578 Now let's add the numbers on the right side: -144988 - 578 = -145566 So now we have -4693*i = -145566. The last step to find the value of i is to divide both sides of the equation by -4693: i = -145566 / -4693 And when we divide those numbers, we get: i = 31 So the answer is i = 31.

The question is related to the Watergate scandal that took place during the presidency of Richard Nixon in the early 1970s. It seeks to identify the press secretary who, in an attempt to minimize the political impact of the scandal, downplayed the seriousness of the Watergate break-in. The break-in at the Democratic National Committee headquarters in the Watergate complex led to revelations of widespread corruption in the Nixon administration and ultimately culminated in his resignation in 1974. By inquiring about the press secretary's response to the Watergate scandal, this question highlights the role of government officials in shaping public perception and how they sometimes attempt to manipulate or dismiss potentially damaging information.

Write some highlights for the following article: Chelsea are close to agreeing the second biggest Premier League shirt sponsorship ever with Turkish Airlines. A £25million-a-year deal is expected to be finalised by Christmas. The negotiations with the big spending airline, famous for its Lionel Messi and Kobe Bryant TV adverts, were first revealed by Sports Agenda last September. The money would be a significant advance on the £18m-a-year Samsung currently pay to have their name on Chelsea shirts and would propel the club above Liverpool and Arsenal in the PL shirt sponsorship table. Scroll down for video. Launch: Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (left) and then Chief Executive Peter Kenyon at launch in 2005. Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich wants his club — hot favourites to be crowned champions — to be as dominant on football’s commercial side as they are on the pitch. But the west London club, already deep in talks with Turkish Airlines before former Liverpool chief executive Christian Purslow was brought in to revamp the commercial operation, still lag well behind Manchester United. The Old Trafford shirt sponsorship with Chevrolet, that began this season, is worth £53m annually. Barcelona have had their shirts sponsored by Turkish Airlines in the past. Spreading their wings: Turkish Airlines linked up with Manchester United. Clare Balding could end up spending just 20 days a year presenting racing on Channel 4 when she finally agrees a new contract to accommodate her other broadcasting options.

Clare Balding could end up spending far less time presenting racing on Channel 4 when she agrees terms. FIFA plan to end live video streaming of the post-executive committee meeting press conferences because of the pounding that president Sepp Blatter subsequently receives on social media.

The England Cricket Board’s choice to succeed commercial director John Perera, who brought in 1billion worth of TV rights and sponsorships, has already ruffled a few feathers. Sanjay Patel allegedly made an insensitive comment about committing suicide while on a panel at the Business of Cricket Awards. Patel was responding to a Somerset representative who admitted he was depressed about falling attendances and participation.

The RFU offer to the International Rugby Board to win the right to host next year’s World Cup included an £80million guarantee and half of the 2.3m tickets being sold by the IRB to competing nations, sponsors and corporate hospitality. So although ER (England Rugby) 2015 have only 140,000 of their allocation still to shift, tens of thousands of seats are likely to be returned by the IRB. That will leave ER 2015 to sell the returns at late notice — some for supposedly sell-out matches. The gloves are off already in the battle for the IAAF presidency between Lord Coe and Ukraine’s Sergey Bubka, even with the election not due until next August.

Lessons of New York’s Prison Escape It’s a good thing that the Federal Bureau of Investigation opened a corruption inquiry at the maximum security prison in northern New York where prison workers smuggled in tools, including hacksaw blades, that helped two convicted murderers to escape last month. The escape, from the Clinton Correctional Facility, shows how easy it is for guards and workers to bypass screening systems that are supposed to keep drugs, weapons and other contraband out of jails and prisons. This problem goes far beyond one horribly mismanaged prison in New York. Controlling smuggling by corrections officers is difficult, because other officers either turn a blind eye to it or fail to enforce security protocols that are meant to prevent it. This problem was underscored in an alarming report issued last fall on New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex by the city’s Department of Investigation. The report revealed that an investigator posing as a guard was able to smuggle large quantities of drugs, along with alcohol and a razor blade, into the Rikers complex. The undercover investigator was able to walk into all six of the Rikers jails he attempted to enter with the pockets of his cargo pants bulging with heroin, pain killers and marijuana. In reviewing videotape of shift changes, investigators saw uniformed guards walking through metal detectors carrying plastic bags that had not been scanned with the X-ray machine. The report said that weapons and narcotics remained easily available to any inmate with enough money to pay for them. Mark Peters, the commissioner for the Department of Investigation, added that officers and civilian staff members often did not sell the drugs directly to inmates but served as couriers, shuttling contraband between people on the outside and the inmates for a fee. The department recommended more measures to prevent illegal conduct by guards, like placing drug sniffing dogs at staff entrances and putting employee lockers outside the gates, to prevent civilian clothing and other items from ever entering the jail. The problem at Rikers was also the case at the Clinton prison, where two prison employees have been criminally charged with smuggling in chisels, hacksaw blades and other tools to the inmates without any difficulty. So far, a dozen Clinton prison workers have been placed on administrative leave, the superintendent has been replaced and tighter security measures like weekly cell inspections imposed. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has also ordered the state inspector general to investigate what happened at Clinton. The F.B.I. is on the right track in focusing on possible criminal conduct by employees and inmates, including drug trafficking. If the prison was so porous that it could allow in tools, more lucrative contraband could find its way in as well. It makes sense for officials to look beyond the circumstances that led to the Clinton escape and beyond Clinton itself to other prisons in the system. These kinds of failures are not limited to New York. After all, it has often been shown nationally that when jails and prisons are awash in drugs, it’s because corrections officers are at the root of the problem.

Unfortunately, this app has fallen short of my expectations, and I can only grant it a 2-star rating due to its limited functionality and user experience. Upon first use, I found that the interface was not very user-friendly, making it difficult to navigate between the different sections. The design is outdated and could significantly benefit from an update to align with modern app standards. Issues with the app's speed and responsiveness compounded the issue, leading to an overall frustrating experience. Additionally, the app touts its ability to provide extensive information through log-reading, but I was disappointed with the actual depth of the features offered. The log filters appeared to be quite limited and were not customizable to fit my needs. As a result, I had to spend more time manually sorting through log entries to find the ones relevant to my situation. Another downside was the app's instability.

The Valley has a more fertile soil, it's not overgrazed, and the trees and bushes are abundant, and the productivity has increased several fold over the past decade. Biodiversity in the Valley is varied, and the soils are nutritious and retain more water, nitrogen and carbon.  Which area experiences less soil erosion?  Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil. In the northern Chinese province alone, 400 million are affected every year with an associated 54 billion yuan of annual economic loss due to grassland degradation. Answer:","output":"The Valley experiences less soil erosion compared to the Gorge. The Valley has fertile soil, abundant trees and bushes, and increased productivity over the past decade. It also has higher biodiversity, which makes the ecosystem more adaptable and able to withstand disasters. In contrast, the Gorge has suffered negative effects due to deforestation, leading to poor soil quality, a decline in biodiversity, and increased susceptibility to soil erosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:Due to being an irresponsible adult who doesn’t understand the concept of saving money, my brother doesn’t have a car at the moment. He’s currently struggling getting to and from work, because his job (which is near where I live) is a 20 minute drive from his home. On public transportation, that’s about an hour and a half commute.  At first I didn’t mind helping him out, because despite his flaws that have led him to this situation, he’s my brother and I want to be there for him. But it’s turned into a weekly thing, where at least twice a week he’s either asking me for rides, asking to borrow my car for days, or asking if I can lend him money. Sometimes I’m busy, and sometimes I just really don’t feel like it. I’m currently on break from school, so it’s not like I have an excuse to not want to let him borrow my car, I just don’t want to. I want to be able to know that it’s in my possession ready for me to use if I need it for whatever reason, even if it’s just to go to a friends house.  The thing is, aside from this issue, my brother and I get along well. I don’t want to hurt his feelings and have it hurt our relationship.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what makes food for themselves and other organisms?\\" is \\"honeybees\\", given that  most plants make food for themselves and other organisms? A:","output":"No, \\"honeybees\\" would not be the correct answer to the question \\"what makes food for themselves and other organisms?\\" While honeybees do produce honey, which serves as a food source for themselves and other organisms, they are not the primary organisms responsible for making food for themselves and others. Instead, you are right to point out that most plants are the main organisms that make food for themselves, as well as providing a foundation of energy and nutrients for other living organisms within ecosystems. This process is called photosynthesis. Plants, being autotrophs, can convert sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water into glucose – a type of sugar that can be used as an energy source – and oxygen as a byproduct. This glucose serves as the primary source of energy for the plants themselves, allowing them to grow and reproduce. In addition, the glucose they produce also serves as a crucial energy source for heterotrophs (organisms that cannot produce their own food), like animals and insects, including honeybees. So, a more accurate answer to the question would be \\"plants,\\" given their ability to produce food for themselves and a wide range of other organisms through the process of photosynthesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:      Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman speaks during the Future Investment Initiative Forum in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Oct. 24, 2018. (Handout ./Reuters)      The Saudi government has come under intense criticism for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, and some Saudi social media users have come up with a way to fight back: boycotting Amazon.com.      Over the past few days, Saudi Twitter users have used hashtags such as #BoycottAmazon and #مقاطعة_امازون_وسوق_دوت_كوم to encourage their compatriots and allies to stop using Amazon as well as Souq, an online retailer bought by Amazon last year. According to Bloomberg News, the calls for a boycott topped Twitter’s trending topics in Saudi Arabia for several hours Sunday.      The boycott effort appears to be linked to The Washington Post’s coverage of the killing of Khashoggi, who was a contributing columnist to the newspaper. Post owner Jeffrey P.

He was killed Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul to get a document he needed for his planned marriage.      The journalist’s disappearance — and the kingdom’s belated admission that he was killed at the consulate — caused a global publicity crisis for Saudi Arabia and Mohammed. Riyadh has repeatedly denied that the crown prince had any knowledge of a plan to kill Khashoggi, but many observers find that claim unlikely.      Still, many Saudis still support Mohammed: “What happened to Khashoggi is terrible and goes against Islam,\\" one Saudi citizen in the town of Ad Dilam said to The Post last week. \\"Our crown prince did not do that. We trust him, and we feel the changes he has made for us.”      It’s unclear how much the Amazon boycott drive represents popular opinion in Saudi Arabia. The country has one of the most active Twitter user bases in the Arab world, but analysts say the use of pro-government bots is widespread and often designed to get certain messages onto trending lists.      Many of the tweets calling for a boycott of Amazon used similar if not identical language, suggesting some degree of coordination. Some users also used the hashtags to criticize the call for boycott, saying it would not make a difference.      #مقاطعه_امازون_وسوق_دوت_كوم who ever created this hashtag clearly knows nothin about world economics, you really think not buying headphone with ur 20 riyals would bring Jeff bezos to his knees! — Dr. Hamoud Somaily (@HamoudSomaily) November 5, 2018      Amazon had been looking toward Saudi Arabia as an area of potential growth.

Updated at 2:35 p.m. |||||       Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia at the Pentagon in March. (Cliff Owen/AP)      Recep Tayyip Erdogan is the president of Turkey.      [Recep Tayyip Erdoğan: Suudi Arabistan’ın, Cemal Kaşıkçı’nın öldürülmesi hakkında hâlâ cevaplaması gereken birçok soru var]      The story is all too familiar: Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi journalist and a family man, entered Saudi Arabia’s Consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2 for marriage formalities. No one – not even his fiancee, who was waiting outside the compound — has ever seen him again.      Over the course of the past month, Turkey has moved heaven and earth to shed light on all aspects of this case. As a result of our efforts, the world has learned that Khashoggi was killed in cold blood by a death squad, and it has been established that his murder was premeditated.      Yet there are other, no less significant questions whose answers will contribute to our understanding of this deplorable act. Where is Khashoggi’s body? Who is the “local collaborator” to whom Saudi officials claimed to have handed over Khashoggi’s remains? Who gave the order to kill this kind soul? Unfortunately, the Saudi authorities have refused to answer those questions.      We know the perpetrators are among the 18 suspects detained in Saudi Arabia. We also know those individuals came to carry out their orders: Kill Khashoggi and leave. Finally, we know the order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.      Some seem to hope this “problem” will go away in time. But we will keep asking those questions, which are crucial to the criminal investigation in Turkey, but also to Khashoggi’s family and loved ones. A month after his killing, we still do not know where his body is. At the very least, he deserves a proper burial in line with Islamic customs. We owe it to his family and friends, including his former colleagues at The Post, to give them an opportunity to say their goodbyes and pay their respects to this honorable man. To ensure that the world will keep asking the same questions, we have shared the evidence with our friends and allies, including the United States.      As we continue to look for answers, I would like to stress that Turkey and Saudi Arabia enjoy friendly relations. I do not believe for a second that King Salman, the custodian of the holy mosques, ordered the hit on Khashoggi. Therefore, I have no reason to believe that his murder reflected Saudi Arabia’s official policy. In this sense, it would be wrong to view the Khashoggi slaying as a “problem” between two countries. Nonetheless, I must add that our friendship with Riyadh, which goes back a long time, doesn’t mean we will turn a blind eye to the premeditated murder that unfolded in front of our very eyes. The killing of Khashoggi is inexplicable. Had this atrocity taken place in the United States or elsewhere, authorities in those countries would have gotten to the bottom of what happened. It would be out of the question for us to act any other way.      No one should dare to commit such acts on the soil of a NATO ally again. If anyone chooses to ignore that warning, they will face severe consequences. The Khashoggi murder was a clear violation and a blatant abuse of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. Failure to punish the perpetrators could set a very dangerous precedent.      This is another reason we were shocked and saddened by the efforts of certain Saudi officials to cover up Khashoggi’s premeditated murder rather than serve the cause of justice, as our friendship would require. Though Riyadh has detained 18 suspects, it is deeply concerning that no action has been taken against the Saudi consul general, who lied through his teeth to the media and fled Turkey shortly afterward. Likewise, the refusal of the Saudi public prosecutor — who recently visited his counterpart in Istanbul — to cooperate with the investigation and answer even simple questions is very frustrating. His invitation of Turkish investigators to Saudi Arabia for more talks about the case felt like a desperate and deliberate stalling tactic.      The murder of Jamal Khashoggi involves a lot more than a group of security officials, just as the Watergate scandal was bigger than a break-in and the 9/11 terror attacks went beyond the hijackers. As responsible members of the international community, we must reveal the identities of the puppetmasters behind Khashoggi’s killing and discover those in whom Saudi officials — still trying to cover up the murder — have placed their trust.

Blue/Bloomberg Photographer: Victor J. Blue/Bloomberg      Saudis who are angry at The Washington Post’s coverage of the kingdom in the aftermath of Jamal Khashoggi’s murder are calling for a boycott of Amazon.com Inc. because of its shared ownership by U.S. billionaire Jeff Bezos.      \\"Boycott Amazon\\" was the top trending hashtag on Twitter in Saudi Arabia for several hours on Sunday, as users circulated images showing the deletion of the Amazon smartphone app. They also called for a boycott of regional subsidiary Souq.com, acquired by Amazon last year. Neither Amazon nor The Washington Post were immediately available for comment.      Many citizens have felt that their country is under attack since Saudi agents killed Khashoggi, a Post columnist and insider turned critic, at the kingdom’s consulate in Istanbul. They’ve been particularly upset by an op-ed article by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan recently published in the Post, and by the newspaper’s coverage -- along with other international media -- of gruesome information about the murder obtained from anonymous Turkish officials.      ‘Media War’      “It became clear before our eyes that this is an organized media war,\\" said Bandar Otyf, a Saudi journalist with more than 100,000 Twitter followers who was among those calling for the boycott. “As Twitter users and activists and citizens, we don’t have power abroad, but we have simple things like boycotting.\\"      Many Saudis are learning for the first time that Bezos, the founder and chairman of Amazon, separately owns the Washington Post, Otyf said, adding that “if we affect even a portion of their business, we’re satisfied.\\"      While few in Saudi Arabia use Amazon directly, Souq.com is popular. Last year, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund invested in a competing e-commerce firm called Noon, which was founded by the chairman of Emaar Properties.      Some tweets about the boycott appeared to be automated or copied and pasted.      \\"I was so excited for Black Friday! But unfortunately since #Washingtonpost is double standards against my country #saudiArabia and support propaganda of Erdogan I decide to stop any plans to buy anything in @amazon,\\" one such tweet read. It was repeated eight times on different accounts with the same spelling errors. Efforts to contact users behind those accounts weren’t successful. ||||| Dubai (CNN Business) Saudis unhappy with the Washington Post's coverage of the killing of its journalist Jamal Khashoggi are taking aim at Jeff Bezos' business interests in the Middle East.      Thousands of social media users in Saudi Arabia backed calls for a boycott of Amazon ( AMZN ) and its regional subsidiary on Monday. Bezos owns the Washington Post and is still by far the biggest shareholder in Amazon.      Khashoggi, a columnist for the Washington Post, was killed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul last month. Saudi officials first denied all knowledge of his fate before admitting later that his killing was premeditated murder.      The Post has been demanding information about Khashoggi's death and justice for his killers. It described Saudi Arabia's version of events as a \\"coverup\\" last month.      On Friday, the Post published an op-ed by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan where he wrote : \\"The order to kill Khashoggi came from the highest levels of the Saudi government.\\"      Saudis have used Twitter and local media outlets to denounce what they described as a \\"media campaign\\" aimed at tarnishing Saudi Arabia's image and undermining efforts by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to modernize the country.      A Saudi journalist, Bandar Otyf, tweeted to his 105,000 followers that the Post \\"consistently publishes articles that are defaming.\\"      \\"Let's defend our nation ... boycott Amazon to send a message to its owner so he is aware of the scale of the damage,\\" Otyf added.      Amazon doesn't have a big presence in the Middle East but the company last year bought Souq.com , the region's leading e-commerce platform based in Dubai, to extend its reach.      \\"Boycott Amazon and Souq.com\\" was one of the top trending hashtags in Saudi Arabia on Monday. By 4:30 pm in Riyadh (8:30 am ET), it had been mentioned in over 8,000 tweets.      \\"It's not acceptable, the [Amazon] owner is the same owner of the paper that attacks our nation and its leaders,\\" said another Twitter user.      Bezos has so far not spoken out about the killing, but the Post's publisher Fred Ryan has kept up the pressure on the Saudi authorities.      Ryan said on Thursday Khashoggi was \\"lured into a death trap.\\" He also announced an initiative — the Press Freedom Partnership — to \\"increase awareness of the importance of an independent press.\\"      One Twitter user said he was not going to join the boycott. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In response to the Washington Post's coverage of the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, some Saudi social media users have started a boycott campaign against Amazon.com and its regional subsidiary, Souq.com.

A Cambridge University educated research scientist is so desperate to live the life of a wheelchair-bound person she is prepared to pay a doctor help her become disabled. Since childhood, Chloe Jennings-White has made several attempts at injuring herself so she can finally climb into her own wheelchair. In 2010 she even found a doctor overseas willing to help her become disabled by cutting her sciatic. and femoral nerves, but she could not afford the £16,000 costs. Scroll down for video. Chloe Jennings-White adjusting her leg braces at her home on May 16, 2013, in Salt Lake City, Utah. She uses a wheelchair, even though her legs are fine, and has chosen to live as a disabled person, due to a rare condition. 'I might never be able to afford it, but I know, truly and deeply, I won't regret it if I ever can,' she said, referring to the doctor who might be able to help her become disabled. Chloe, 58, from Salt Lake City, Utah, suffers from a rare condition called Body Integrity Identity Disorder, or BIID. Sufferers do not accept one of their own limb or limbs and seek to amputate them or become paraplegic. Able to stand: Chloe, 58, pictured out hiking in May this year in Salt Lake City, Utah. She wears leg braces and uses a wheelchair, even though her legs are healthy. Some experts believe it is caused by a neurological fault, in which the brain's mapping system cannot see a certain body part. The Cambridge graduate believes both of her legs do not belong to her and dreams of being paralysed from the waist down. 'Something in my brain tells me my legs are not supposed to work,' she said. 'Having any sensation in them just feels wrong.' For years she bandaged herself secretly, but now lives openly with her condition despite facing intolerance, insults, and sometimes online threats. Chloe first realised she was different at the age of four, after visiting her Aunt Olive, who was using leg braces after a bike accident. 'I wanted them too,' she said. 'I wondered why I wasn't born needing them and felt something was wrong with me because I didn't have them.' At the age of nine, Chloe even took action and pedalled her bike off a four-foot high acting stage on Hampstead Heath, north London, landing on her neck. 'I only wanted to stop my legs working but could have broken my neck or died,' she added. From then on, Chloe lived out her fantasy in secret, pretending to be disabled when alone, playing risky sports and climbing trees in the hope of hurting her legs. Without her leg brace on in her bathroom in Salt Lake City, US. Her distorted body image causes her to sit in a wheelchair even though she can stand and ski. Now, as an adult, Chloe enjoys the. excitement of downhill skiing and the possibility she might fall and. suffer serious leg fractures. 'I ski extremely fast, and aim for the most dangerous runs,' she said. BIID occurs when a person's idea of how they should look does not match their actual physical form. The condition affects just a small percentage of the population. The sufferer wants to have an amputation. In most cases, the limb that the person would like removed is healthy. Many psychologists and neurologists have tried to understand what the root cause of the condition is. The theory is that BIID occurs when the brain is not able to provide an accurate plan of the body. Some experts believe the cause to be psychological. One. theory is that a person with BIID may have seen an amputee at an. earlier age and this image has replaced their own thoughts about what. constitutes the ideal person. To become a better person they feel that a certain limb will have to be amputated. In severe cases, a person with BIID may harm the limb they wish to be removed or force doctors into removing it. Others manage to cope with the illness by using canes and prosthetic attachments to help them feel complete. 'Doing. any activity that brings a chance of me becoming paraplegic gives me a. sense of relief from the anxiety caused by the BIID. 'My. friends and family can get a little worried about me skiing, as they. know I ski very aggressively and they know that in the back of my mind I. actually want to get paralysed.' Chloe had a real skiing accident seven years ago, which left her with a minor back injury and a reason to get leg braces. She researched the braces online and came across BIID for the first time. She discovered there were others like her. 'It was a huge relief,' she said. 'I wasn't a freak - there were hundreds of others like me.' She took part in a BIID research study. with psychiatrist Michael First, from New York, who diagnosed her in. Spring 2008 and recommending she use a wheelchair. At first, she used the chair in private, but eventually gained the courage to reveal her secret to friends and work colleagues. 'The. chair gives me psychological relief, instead of physical,' she said. 'I. know it can be difficult for people without BIID to understand, but. it's what we feel.' In 2009 she was involved in a serious. 75mph car crash and suffered pre-concussion amnesia and cannot remember. the 15 minutes before the impact. It was not a deliberate act, according to police. reports, but she worries she might have subconsciously wanted it to happen. Now,. Chloe spends most of her time in a wheelchair, but has to get out for. various household tasks and walk down the steps to her car. With her doctor, Dr Mark Malan. He is helping her with her condition Body Integrity Identity Disorder, or BIID. Chloe is a research scientist and graduate from Cambridge University. 'I can't afford to convert my home for disabled access so I just use the chair as much as I can,' she said. She fantasises about having a car crash without hurting anyone else just so she can damage her own legs. 'Any time when I'm driving I sort of conjure up accident scenarios in my mind where I will become paraplegic,' she admitted. Psychiatrist Dr Mark Malan, who treats Chloe, said: 'The question I often ask is, is it better to have somebody pretending to use a wheelchair, or to commit suicide? Chloe Jennings-White pictured hiking with her friend David Allen earlier this year in Salt Lake City, Utah, where she now lives. She is rarely seen out of her wheelchair.

Cambridge graduate Chloe outside her workplace, the University of Utah, US. She sometimes has to get out of her chair to walk up stairs or get into a car. 'One possibility could be to do some sort of nerve blocking so that that limb could not actually be used for a period of time, to let the patient test the reality of being physically disabled temporarily. 'It would give BIID sufferers a chance to change their minds if they wanted to.'

The Emphasis on Taxpaying One of the most noteworthy aspects of the \\"We Are the 53%\\" movement is the pride in paying federal income taxes. This is an unusual message from conservatives, who have traditionally expressed disdain for contributing money to the federal government. However, the founders of the Tumblr blog argue that their focus on tax-paying isn't contradictory. They believe that paying taxes is the responsible thing to do, but this doesn't mean they support high tax rates. The issue of tax rates, they argue, should be separate from the broader discussion surrounding social responsibility. The Depressing Nature of \\"We Are the 53%\\" Max Read, a contributor at Gawker, has described the 53% initiative as depressing. What makes the movement disheartening, Read writes, is that many of the contributors could just as easily be members of the Occupy Wall Street's \\"99%.\\"  Rather than seeing their stories as a call for help, the 53% view their financial struggles as a badge of pride. This mindset prevents people from holding accountable the large banking conglomerates whose reckless and self-serving behavior has caused widespread hardship. Instead, the 53% claim responsibility for their own financial situations and place blame squarely on their own shoulders. A Complex Narrative: Pride vs. Advocacy The rise of \\"We Are the 53%\\" reveals a complicated conflict within the conservative camp. On one hand, these individuals express pride in their contributions to society by paying taxes and taking responsibility for their lives. They argue that government handouts only serve to undermine individual work ethic and encourage dependency. On the other side, Occupy Wall Street's 99% movement seeks to expose the massive wealth inequality and corporate greed that has left so many struggling to make ends meet. For the 99%, the blame for their circumstances lies with the powerful financial elite who have exploited the system, rather than on themselves. Conclusion The conservative response to Occupy Wall Street in the form of \\"We Are the 53%\\" highlights the contrasting narratives and perspectives present in American society today. While both movements are expressions of legitimate concerns, they reflect deeply divided opinions on the nature of individual responsibility and the role of government in ensuring economic fairness. In this polarized climate, it remains to be seen whether these debates will merely serve to reinforce existing divisions or promote greater understanding and productive dialogue."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Select from the following. 1. no; 2. yes; Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: Is {a,a} equal to {a}? To answer this question, we need to understand the concept and definition of a set in mathematics. A set is defined as a collection of distinct objects, called elements, which are neither ordered nor repeated. In a set, each element can only appear once. With this definition in mind, we can analyze the given sets. In the first set, {a,a}, \\"a\\" is repeated twice. However, as we just learned, a set cannot have duplicate elements. Therefore, the set {a,a}, when simplified, becomes {a}. Now, comparing the simplified version of the first set to the second set {a}, we find that they are equal, as both sets only consist of a single element 'a'. So, the answer to Question 1 is \\"yes\\", {a,a} is equal to {a}. Question 2: What is [math]sqrt{x^2}[/math] equal to? For this question, we need to understand the concept of square roots and exponentiation. When we square a number or variable (raise it to the power of 2), it is denoted as x^2. The process of finding the square root is essentially the inverse of squaring. Mathematically, the square root of a number squared (x^2) would be written as √(x^2). In this case, the square of any real number x is equal to x^2, and the square root of x^2 is equal to the absolute value of x, denoted as |x|. This is because the square of both a positive and a negative number x will be positive, and their square roots will return the non-negative value of x. Hence, the answer to Question 2 is that [math]sqrt{x^2}[/math] is equal to |x|, the absolute value of x. Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? Given the information discussed above, it is clear that Questions 1 and 2 are addressing different concepts. While Question 1 is focusing on set theory and understanding the simplification of sets containing duplicate elements, Question 2 is dealing with mathematical operations involving square roots and exponentiation. So, the answer is \\"no\\", Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing, as they explore different mathematical concepts and principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Jimbo and Jedd are both farmers who have lakes and water wells downstream from their farms. Jimbo's products have been in high demand recently, so he has started to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his farms. Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses because his products aren't wanted as much by the people in his town.  But I can use this background: Huge amounts of chemicals, such as fertilizers and pesticides, are applied to farm fields (see Figure below ). Some of the chemicals are picked up by rainwater. Runoff then carries the chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. Dissolved fertilizer causes too much growth of water plants and algae. This can lead to dead zones where nothing can live in lakes and at the mouths of rivers. Some of the chemicals can infiltrate into groundwater. The contaminated water comes up in water wells. If people drink the polluted water, they may get sick.  What is an answer for this question: Who will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes? The answer is:","output":"Jedd will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes due to his decreased use of fertilizers on his farm. The background information provided explains that large amounts of chemicals such as fertilizers can be picked up by rainwater, and runoff then carries these chemicals to nearby rivers or lakes. When dissolved fertilizer enters water bodies, it can lead to excessive growth of water plants and algae, which ultimately can result in dead zones where marine life cannot survive. In the present situation, Jimbo and Jedd both have lakes and water wells downstream from their farms. However, the demand for Jimbo's products has increased significantly, causing him to use very high amounts of fertilizers on his crops. This could result in substantial chemical runoff entering the lake downstream from Jimbo's farm, thereby increasing the likelihood of a dead zone forming due to excessive growth of water plants and algae. On the other hand, Jedd has recently decreased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm because the demand for his products has decreased in his town. With less fertilizer being used on Jedd's crops, the amount of chemical runoff entering the lake downstream from Jedd's farm will be significantly reduced. Consequently, the risk of a dead zone forming in Jedd's lake is lower compared to Jimbo's lake. Moreover, the potential for groundwater contamination from these fertilizers is also an important consideration. The background information highlighted that chemicals can infiltrate groundwater, and this contaminated water may then come up in water wells, posing a risk to human health if ingested. While both Jimbo and Jedd have wells downstream from their farms, Jedd's reduced fertilizer usage will mean there is a lower risk of groundwater contamination and hence, a lower risk to human health, considering the relationship between contaminated water and adverse health effects. In conclusion, Jedd will be less likely to cause dead zones in their respective lakes due to his decreased use of fertilizers compared to Jimbo, who has increased his fertilizer usage. Additionally, Jedd's reduced fertilizer use will result in a lower risk of groundwater contamination and minimize potential harm to human health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A ceremony was also held as the hall's South Steps were renamed the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Steps. On Sunday, there will be remembrance services and on Monday a two-minute silence to mark Armistice Day. In the Middle East, more than 100 RAF service personnel from the 83 Expeditionary Air Group were among the first to mark the commemoration, with a sunset ceremony at their base. At noon on Saturday, Afghan war widows marched with widows from World War Two, the Korean War and the Gulf War to the Cenotaph in Whitehall for a 30-minute service. And football grounds across the country paused shortly before the afternoon fixtures as a minute's silence was observed. This year's Royal British Legion Festival of Remembrance also marked the 70th anniversaries of the Battle of the Atlantic and the Dambuster raids. A television audience of 5.2 million is expected to watch the event on BBC One which featured performances by singer James Blunt, Katie Melua, the tenor Alfie Boe and new group, the Poppy Girls. As well as the Queen and Prince Philip, other members of the Royal Family attended, including the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The event saw tributes from performers interspersed with real-life stories from former and serving forces personnel, including the last Dambuster. Squadron Leader Johnny Johnson was given a standing ovation and applauded for more than a minute as he stood with the Torch of Remembrance. There was also a standing ovation for the Chelsea Pensioners, with the Queen and duke rising to their feet as the men marched into the hall. The Poppy Girls, an all-girl group picked from a search for talent among forces families, performed their new single The Call (No Need To Say Goodbye) which is raising money for the Poppy Appeal. The Queen seemed particularly pleased to witness an emotional reunion for one of the young members of the group. Megan Adams, 10, from Stirling, was not expecting to see her father, Lieutenant Commander Billy Adams, for another three months as he has been serving with the Royal Navy in the Seychelles as part of an anti-piracy task force.

The audience loudly applauded the special moment, with the Queen smiling broadly and looking pleasantly surprised as she exchanged comments with Prince Philip and Princess Anne. The War Widows' Service is organised by the War Widows' Association (WWA), which has more than 4,000 members.

The Cenotaph in central London will also be the focus of the national service of Remembrance on Sunday, while a two-minute silence will be held at 11:00 on Armistice Day, to commemorate the end of World War One.

The packs they carried on their backs were the weight of a small child and I was told supporting that load for 26 or so miles, was all in a day's work in the field. They may have failed to officially set a new record because they were a man down when they finished but later, as they gathered in Downing Street, David Cameron wondered whether the record keepers could be persuaded to let their better time stand. Ahead of this weekend's events Prince Harry and Prince Philip visited the Field of Remembrance outside Westminster Abbey to pay their respects and observe a two-minute silence. On Saturday morning, Commando 999 raised money for the \\"Royal Marines Family\\" by attempting to break the world speed march record. They tried to carry kit and weapons weighing over 40lbs (18kg) 26.2 miles (42km) through central London in under four hours 19 minutes to commemorate the Royal Marines' 350th birthday. The Royal Marines were quicker than previous attempts but did not beat the record as one man had to pull out half a mile before the end. They completed the race around London in four hours, 17 minutes and 21 seconds. They raised more than Â£20,000 to help Royal Marines who have been affected mentally and physically by war.

Q:Given the following context:  By the end of the medieval period a complex body of customary law had come into existence dealing with the four \\"Mendip mineries\\". That the medieval control was in the hands of the monastic foundations may indicate some continuity of tenure of large-scale holdings, focused on the mines, from the Roman period.William Wilberforce's visit to Cheddar in 1789, during which he saw the poor circumstances of the locals, inspired Hannah More to begin her work improving the conditions of the Mendip miners and agricultural workers. Under her influence, schools were built and children were formally instructed in reading and Christian doctrine. Between 1770 and 1813 some 7,300 ha (18,000 acres) of land on the hills were enclosed, mainly with dry stone walls that today form a key part of the landscape. In 2006 funding was obtained to maintain and improve the walls, which had steadily deteriorated over the years. Over 300 \\"Mendip Motor Cars\\" were built by an engineering works based in Chewton Mendip in the years immediately before and after World War I. In World War II a bombing decoy was constructed on top of Black Down at Beacon Batch in an attempt to confuse bombers aiming to damage the city of Bristol, and piles of stones (known as cairns) were created to prevent enemy aircraft using the hilltop as a landing site.In the 1960s, the tallest mast in the region at 293 metres (961 ft) above ground level, the Mendip UHF television transmitter, was installed on Pen Hill near Wells, one of the highest points of the Mendips.

Richard Barlow, 24, from Big Arowry, North Wales, enticed ‘naive’ youngsters by posing as the 19-year-old American megastar in online chat-rooms and music sites. A court heard Barlow, who has been jailed for three years, also pretended to be a teenage boy and even a young girl to meet children where he encouraged them to strip and perform sex acts over Skype. Richard Barlow (left), 24, posed as pop star Justin Bieber to groom girls as young as seven over the internet. He groomed children aged between seven and 11 for his own sexual gratification and even used headphones and cameras to record them. Barlow blackmailed some victims by threatening to upload films he had already made of them for family and friends to see if they did not do as he said. When police raided his home and seized his computer they found a shocking video of him enticing a seven-year-old girl to perform a sex act on herself via a webcam. He was arrested and charged with inciting a child to engage in sexual activity, three charges of engaging in sexual activity with a child over the Internet and 12 charges of making indecent images. On Wednesday at Mold Crown Court he pleaded guilty to all charges and was jailed for three years. Barlow was also ordered to sign on the Sex Offenders Register for life. Sentencing Judge Peter Heywood said: ‘It is clear that for a significant period of time you have had an unhealthy interest in this sort of activity. ‘You engaged in conversation with young girls to encourage them to engage in sexual activity with them. ‘Heaven knows how they will be affected in their future lives. They may seem to be only images but they are young children being exploited by others. ‘Huge sums of money are made by people who have a prurient interest in this sort of material. ‘I would be failing in my public duty if I did anything other than pass an immediate custodial sentence.’ On Wednesday at Mold Crown Court Barlow pleaded guilty to all charges and was jailed for three years. Prosecutor Jonathan Austin told the court police seized computer equipment when they executed a search warrant at the address in September 2012. He said Barlow, who lived with his parents, also had a fetish for feet and persuaded other girls to show their feet via his webcam. Officers found a total of 2,200 indecent images and 116 films of children had also been downloaded off the internet. Defending, Owen Edwards said his client had pretended to be Justin Bieber, and others younger than himself, to entice naive young girls. He said: ‘This behaviour is shocking. ‘He has to face up to what he has done and to face up to the sentence. He knows he is going to prison. ‘This is yet another of these sad examples of the internet opening up activities which would never have been indulged in had it not been there..’ After the case DC Rachel Garbutt, from North Wales Police, said: ‘The sentence sends out a strong message to the community that these types of offences will not be tolerated. ‘These offences are never victimless and people who commit them will be dealt with accordingly by the police and the courts.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

Movie title: Delirious Movie plot: The film begins with homeless young man Toby Grace (Michael Pitt) wandering through New York City bumming for change and essentially seeking a way to subside profitably when he accidentally bumps into celebrity-wannabe-photographer Les Galantine (Steve Buscemi) waiting outside a building for recording star K'Harma Leeds (Alison Lohman) as she leaves. When Toby follows Les home and asks for a warm place to sleep for the night Les agrees partly because Toby proves himself to be an honest type and also because the homeless man suggests he can function as a lackey for the photographer. Toby has a seeming value as he repairs things within his grasp like the stationary bike in Les's apartment as well as the radiator. When Les takes Toby to a club to get pictures of K'Harma, Toby is smitten with the young female singer. Les learns that hot shot actor Chuck Sirloin (Jack Gwaltney) is getting surgery on his penis and manages to scoop the photos for a local tabloid magazine. When Les takes Toby to an STD Daytime Drama Benefit, influential casting director Dana (Gina Gershon) is immediately attracted to the purity of the young man and determines to boost his career for his attention. Because of his ability to get the shots of Chuck Sirloin Les is invited to the next K'Harma concert and by chance Toby gets pulled into K'Harma's party and ends up spending the night talking with her as she bonds with his sense of stability as compared to her own sense of homelessness. K'Harma invites Toby to a party with Elvis Costello and Toby brings Les along but when Les takes photos at the party K'Harma is upset and security ejects the two men. When Les sells the photos of K'Harma to an online news site Toby goes to live with Dana who casts the homeless young man in a reality show as a homeless man and his fame is immediate causing Les to plot a revenge against the man he believes he has helped without receiving what a sense of loyalty or adequate recompense.

Save your money for something better! Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? The answer to this question is:","output":"The review provided clearly depicts the product in an unflattering light. There are several reasons why this is the case, as detailed below: 1. The reviewer's initial impression of the product is negative, indicated by the title \\"Absolute junk.\\" This strong choice of words sets the tone for the rest of the review, making it clear that the product did not live up to their expectations. 2. The reviewer goes on to explain that the product was broken right out of the box, which further contributes to the negative perception of the product. A product that is damaged or non-functional upon purchase can lead to a frustrating experience for the consumer, further contributing to an unflattering review. 3. The mention of the lost receipt and the inability to return or exchange the product adds to the reviewer's dissatisfaction. It suggests that the customer felt stuck with a useless product, which may have amplified their negative emotions towards the item. 4. In line with this, the reviewer compares purchasing the product to \\"flushing 6.00 down the toilet.\\" This metaphor conveys a strong sense of regret and waste, implying that the product is not only disappointing but also not worth the money spent on it. 5. The review concludes with a recommendation for potential buyers to save their money for something better. This conclusive statement implies that the product is not worth anyone's time or investment, discouraging others from considering it as a viable option. In summary, the review portrays the product in a highly unflattering light, highlighting various negative aspects such as poor quality, broken condition upon purchase, frustration with the inability to return the item, wasted investment, and a recommendation against purchasing it altogether. This negative depiction may have a significant impact on potential buyers and their decision-making process, potentially steering them away from the product in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this lower case.","output":"The sentence with all lower case letters would be as follows:  \\"this pagoda festival is held for more than one month from the second week of june to the third of july (nayone to waso).\\" While the task requested seems simple, modifications in text like this could impact various factors. In written English, capitalization plays an integral role as it's not just a matter of style but also can affect the meaning of sentences. Here are several ways capitalization is essential and why we usually use it:  1. To start a sentence: The first letter of the first word in a sentence should always be capitalized. For example, the sentence \\"This pagoda festival is held for more than one month from the second week of June to the third of July (Nayone to Waso)\\" starts with a capital 'T' in 'This'. 2. Capitalizing proper nouns: A proper noun denotes a specific person, place, or thing that has a name and is unique. 'June' and 'July' are the names of specific months; thus they are proper nouns and need to be capitalized. 3. Title Capitalization: It is used in the title of books, movies, articles, etc. Each major word in the title is capitalized. 4. Capitalizing acronyms and abbreviations: It is usually done to form an abbreviation or acronym. 5. Honorifics and names: Words used in front of names like 'Dr.', 'Mrs.', 'President' are capitalized. In the sentence provided, the real reason 'This,' 'June,' and 'July' are capitalized is that the first is the starter of the sentence, and the other two are proper nouns. Changing them to lower case could potentially make it harder to understand the sentence depending on the context it is used in."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In transipration, at warmer temperatures water molecules move faster, and the rate of evaporation from stomata is therefore much faster.  Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are cooler or warmer ):   Donna wants to have her water molecules move faster through transpiration, so she will make the temperature cooler or warmer? A:","output":"Donna wants to have her water molecules move faster through transpiration, so she will make the temperature warmer. Transpiration is the process by which plants lose water in the form of vapor through tiny pores called stomata, mainly found on the surfaces of leaves. This process is essential for plants, as it helps in cooling the plant, facilitates the uptake and transportation of essential nutrients, and maintains the turgor pressure in plant cells, among other functions. As mentioned in the passage, at warmer temperatures, water molecules move at a faster rate, leading to increased evaporation from the stomata. This means that the rate of transpiration will be higher in warmer conditions compared to cooler conditions. When the temperature is warmer, more kinetic energy is available for the water molecules, causing them to move more rapidly and evaporate more quickly from the stomata. As a result, the entire process of transpiration is accelerated. Therefore, if Donna wants to increase the rate at which water molecules move through transpiration, she should aim to create a warmer environment for her plants. This will enhance the movement of water molecules and promote faster evaporation, leading to an increased transpiration rate. However, it is important to note that excessively high temperatures may lead to negative effects on the plant's overall health and productivity, so a balance should be maintained to ensure the optimal growth and functioning of the plant."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Eating too much fatty food, exercising too little and smoking can raise your future risk of heart disease. But there is another factor that can cause your heart problems more immediately: the air you breathe. Previous studies have linked high exposure  to environmental pollution to an increased risk of heart problem, but two analyses now show that poor air quality can lead to heart attack or stroke  within as little as a few hours after exposure. In one review of the research, scientists found that people exposed to high levels of pollutants  were up to 5% more likely to suffer a heart attack within days of exposure than those with lower exposure. A separate study of stroke patients showed that even air that the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be of \\"moderate\\"  quality and relatively safe for our health can raise the risk of stroke as much as 34% within 12 to 14 hours of exposure. The authors of both studies stress that these risks are relatively small for healthy people and certainly modest compared with other risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure. However, it is important to be aware of these dangers because everyone is exposed to air pollution regardless of lifestyle choices. So stricter regulation by the EPA of pollutants may not only improve environmental air quality but could also become necessary to protect public health. Question: What can we learn from the text? Options: A: Eating fatty food has immediate effects on your heart. B: The EPA conducted many studies on air quality. C: Moderate air quality is more harmful than smoking, D: Stricter regulations on pollutants should be made. Answer:","output":"D: Stricter regulations on pollutants should be made. Step-by-step justification: 1. The article discusses the effects of environmental pollution on heart problems. 2. It mentions that even moderate air quality, which is considered relatively safe by the EPA, can raise the risk of stroke within hours of exposure. 3.

Summarize: The 19-year-old right-back has not missed a minute's action since being handed his Wolves debut on 6 December. \\"Making my debut was one thing,\\" he told BBC WM 95.6. \\"But having the fans chant my name - I couldn't believe it. \\"We were at Fulham. I heard the fans chant and I thought 'Is that my name?'\\" He joked: \\"I always dreamed of having my own chant but didn't think it would happen so soon.\\" The highly-rated England Under-20 international admits that his rise to prominence has been rapid, significantly aided by his development on loan under Mike Jackson at Shrewsbury over the final seven weeks of last season. Shrewsbury were bound for relegation to League Two, but Iorfa learnt a lot, playing in the then unaccustomed role of right-back, having come through Wolves' system as a central defender. \\"I've been playing centre-back longer,\\" he said. \\"But, when I went on loan to Shrewsbury, it was at right-back and it was a big step for me. You don't realise the tempo of it and playing in front of fans too. That helped me when I got my chance at Wolves.\\" Iorfa could not have picked a more dramatic match in which to make his Wolves debut, a 2-1 home defeat by Bournemouth, in which Wolves lost following a controversial red card, later overturned, to Iorfa's team-mate Rajiv van La Parra. \\"I'd been training with the first team all season and to actually make my debut without going on the bench first was a surprise. But the manager has shown great faith in me,\\" he added. Since that defeat, Wolves have turned the corner, having not lost in the league since - and only on penalties in the FA Cup third-round replay with Fulham.

When most people think of air pollution, they think of the pollution outdoors. But it is just as easy to have indoor air pollution. Your home or school classroom probably doesn't get much fresh air. Sealing up your home reduces heating and cooling costs. But this also causes air pollution to stay trapped indoors. And people today usually spend a majority of their time indoors. So exposure to indoor air pollution can become a significant health risk.  Paragraph: Two neighboring cities had very different health related problems. Twin city had increased air pollution, their people experiencing all kinds of respiratory diseases, while Pine city had problems with age related diseases.

Plot title: Before Sunrise Movie plot: The film starts on June 16, 1994 with Jesse meeting CÃ©line on a train from Budapest and striking up a conversation with her. Jesse is going to Vienna to catch a flight back to the United States, whereas CÃ©line is returning to university in Paris after visiting her grandmother. When they reach Vienna, Jesse convinces CÃ©line to disembark with him, saying that 10 or 20 years down the road, she might not be happy with her marriage and might wonder how her life would have been different if she had picked another guy, and this is a chance to realize that he himself is not that different from the rest; in his words, he is \\"the same boring, unmotivated guy.\\" Jesse has to catch a flight early in the morning and does not have enough money to rent a room for the night, so they decide to roam around in Vienna. After visiting a few landmarks in Vienna, they share a kiss at the top of the Wiener Riesenrad at sunset and start to feel a romantic connection. As they continue to roam around the city, they begin to talk more openly with each other, with conversations ranging from topics about love, life, religion, and their observations of the city. CÃ©line tells Jesse that her last boyfriend broke up with her six months ago, claiming that she \\"loved him too much\\". When questioned, Jesse reveals he had initially come to Europe to spend time with his girlfriend who was studying in Madrid, but they had broken up when she was avoiding him while he was there. He decided to take a cheap flight home, via Vienna, but it did not leave for two weeks so he bought a Eurail pass and traveled around Europe. When they are walking alongside the Donaukanal (Danube canal) they are approached by a man who, instead of begging, offers to write them a poem with a word of their choice in it. Jesse and CÃ©line decide on the word \\"milkshake\\", and are soon presented with the poem Delusion Angel (written for the film by the poet David Jewell).

Please answer the following question: Process:  - The air is cold - Water is in the air - The water forms tiny ice crystals - The ice crystals collide with each other - The ice crystals stick to each other - The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The ice crystals get too heavy to be in the air - The ice crystals become snowflakes - The snow flakes fall to the ground as snow.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more steam is produced happens, how will it affect MORE snow.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case refers to the addition of more steam to the atmosphere. To determine whether this perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on the process of snow formation, let us first analyze the different steps involved in the process: 1. The air is cold - Necessary for ice crystal and snowflake formation. 2. Water is in the air - The presence of moisture or humidity in the air is essential for the snowfall process. 3. The water forms tiny ice crystals - As the temperature is cold, water vapor in the air condenses and forms ice crystals. 4. The ice crystals collide with each other - This is a crucial step in snowflake formation, as individual ice crystals need to come into contact to form larger structures. 5. The ice crystals stick to each other - The bonding between ice crystals creates snowflakes. 6. The ice crystals get bigger as more of them stick together - The accumulation of ice crystals causes the snowflakes to increase in size. 7. The ice crystals become too heavy to be in the air - This determines when the snowflakes will fall to the ground. 8. The snowflakes fall to the ground as snow - The culmination of the entire process. Now, let's examine the effect of adding more steam (essentially water vapor) to the atmosphere: When more steam is added to the atmosphere, it leads to an increase in humidity or moisture content in the air. This additional moisture has the potential to affect the snow formation process indirectly by altering some of the steps involved. Higher humidity can increase the number of tiny ice crystals formed in the atmosphere. With more ice crystals available, there is an increased likelihood of these crystals colliding and sticking together, leading to the formation of larger snowflakes. This could increase the overall amount of snowfall. However, several factors need to be considered for this perturbation to have a substantial effect on snow formation: 1. Temperature: If the temperature is not sufficiently cold, the additional steam will not cause an increase in snowfall, as the ice crystals may not form or may melt before reaching the ground. 2. Atmospheric conditions: The presence of other atmospheric conditions, such as winds or air pressure, may also influence the snow formation process and counteract the effects of additional steam. In conclusion, the addition of more steam to the atmosphere can indirectly affect the process of snow formation by increasing the moisture content of the air. This could lead to higher concentrations of ice crystals and consequently more snowfall. However, this effect is dependent on other factors such as temperature and atmospheric conditions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Here is a breakdown of each option and why \\"natural habitat\\" is the most appropriate answer: - Back yard: While a fox might occasionally be seen in someone's backyard, this is not the primary location where they spend the majority of their time. They may venture into residential areas when searching for food or shelter, but this is not their preferred environment. - Hen house: A fox might attempt to enter a hen house to access a source of food, but it is not where they live or spend most of their time. This option refers to a situation where the fox may cause problems for humans, but it is not an accurate representation of their overall behavior. - Storybook: While foxes appear in many artworks, literature, and mythologies, a storybook is a work of fiction and not a real-life location where a fox would be found. Thus, this option is not relevant to answering the question. - Natural habitat: This option is the most suitable answer because foxes spend most of their time in their natural habitat, which can include a variety of environments such as forests, grasslands, deserts, and even some urban areas. Foxes are highly adaptable animals and can be found in different parts of the world, where they reside primarily in these natural settings. - Bathroom: This option is not relevant to the actual location where a fox would live or spend its time. A bathroom is an indoor space within human constructions, and foxes are not commonly found in such places.

Article: Tigers are among the most admired and most feared animals in the world . When we think of a tiger, we think of danger. We think of the big teeth and large feet of it. We also think of beauty. The tiger is a hunter that hunts alone. In fact , tigers are probably better than any other land mammal  at catching large animals without help. Even so, the life of this big-game hunter isn't easy. Finding food can be difficult, especially for a tiger that is old or weak. Most of the animals it tries to attack get away. A tiger sometimes goes weeks without eating. When that happens, it may hunt animals that can be dangerous even for a tiger. When they are in a bad situation, some tigers may even attack humans. But in fact, tigers kill very few people each year. Most tigers run away when they see people. What tigers have done to people can't compare to what people have done to tigers. Over the last 200 years, we have almost killed tigers in the wild . Today, the tiger is one of the most endangered animals on Earth. A tiger may live 20 years or more, if it is not disturbed by humans. Female  tigers usually live longer than male tigers, because the males live more dangerously. It isn't easy for people to tell a male from a female unless the female happens to be with her babies.Only females take care of the young. The big difference between males and females is size. Male tigers are much bigger. Tigers are big eaters. In a single year, one tiger must eat about 70 deer or other large animals. That is one reason why tigers hunt alone. If they lived in big groups, they could never find enough animals to feed them all. Question: According to the passage, why do tigers hunt alone? Answer: Available choices: 1. They can run faster hunting alone.; 2. They can't get along well with other tigers.; 3. They can hide themselves easily in this way.; 4. They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers.; The answer is:","output":"4. They can't find enough animals to share with other tigers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With its help, I have significantly improved my time management skills and productivity. I am rating this app with 4 stars, and here's why: First of all, the app's interface is clean and user-friendly, which makes for a seamless experience. The variety of timers and settings available provide full customization according to my daily schedule. I really appreciate the option to set unique profiles for weekdays and weekends, helping me to distinguish between my work and personal life. Additionally, the notifications feature makes it incredibly easy to stay on track and adhere to my planned activities. They are non-intrusive and blend perfectly into my daily routine. However, there are a few areas in which I believe the app could improve, which is why I couldn't rate it 5 stars. For instance, it would be nice if there was an option to sync data across devices. I often switch between my phone and tablet, and having my settings available on all my devices would be quite helpful. Secondly, though the app is generally stable, I have encountered occasional crashes, mostly while trying to adjust multiple settings at the same time. While not a significant hindrance to my overall experience, an update fixing these issues would be highly appreciated. In conclusion, com.alfray.timeriffic has proven to be a great app for managing my time effectively. With a few minor enhancements, I would not hesitate to give it a perfect score.

In a 1991 interview, Zappa reported that he was a registered Democrat but added \\"that might not last long—I'm going to shred that\\". Describing his political views, Zappa categorized himself as a \\"practical conservative\\". He favored limited government and low taxes; he also stated that he approved of national defense, social security, and other federal programs, but only if recipients of such programs are willing and able to pay for them. He favored capitalism, entrepreneurship, and independent business, stating that musicians could make more from owning their own businesses than from collecting royalties. He opposed communism, stating, \\"A system that doesn't allow ownership ... has—to put it mildly—a fatal design flaw.\\" He had always encouraged his fans to register to vote on album covers, and throughout 1988 he had registration booths at his concerts. He even considered running for president of the United States as an independent.Zappa was an atheist. He recalled his parents being \\"pretty religious\\" and trying to make him go to Catholic school despite his resentment. He felt disgust towards organized religion (Christianity in particular) because he believed that it promoted ignorance and anti-intellectualism. Some of his songs, concert performances, interviews and public debates in the 1980s criticized and derided Republicans and their policies, President Ronald Reagan, the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), televangelism, and the Christian Right, and warned that the United States government was in danger of becoming a \\"fascist theocracy\\".In early 1990, Zappa visited Czechoslovakia at the request of President Václav Havel. Havel designated him as Czechoslovakia's \\"Special Ambassador to the West on Trade, Culture and Tourism\\". Havel was a lifelong fan of Zappa, who had great influence in the avant-garde and underground scene in Central Europe in the 1970s and 1980s (a Czech rock group that was imprisoned in 1976 took its name from Zappa's 1968 song \\"Plastic People\\").

However, they do not convey the exact same meaning. 1. The first sentence is quite clear in its structure and meaning:  \\"Düzce is a village in the District of Yüreğir, Adana Province, Turkey.\\"  This sentence conveys that Düzce is a village located in the District of Yüreğir, and that the District of Yüreğir is part of Adana Province in Turkey. 2.

How to do squats and lunges  Stand erect with your feet approximately one shoulder width apart.  From there, you can widen or narrow your stance depending on which muscles you are targeting-a wider stance works the hamstrings and glutes, while a narrower stance works the quads. Point your toes slightly outwards, as this helps to stabilize your stance.","output":"Now let's move onto the steps of doing squats and lunges.  Squats: Step 1: With the comfortable stance as described, stand erect with your feet shoulder-width apart. Having your toes pointed outwards, this seems a stable position to start from. Step 2: Extend your hands out in front of you to keep your balance. You can also bend the elbows or clasp the fingers. Step 3: Lower your body as much as you can by pushing the hips back and bending the knees. You'll feel stretching in your thighs and your hamstrings. Step 4: Pause when your thighs are parallel with the ground, this should look like you're about to sit on a chair.  Step 5: Push your body up to the original position, through your heels lifting yourself up back with proper spinal control.  Step 6: Make sure you inhale as you lower yourself down and exhale when you push back up. Each round of this is considered as one squat.  Justifying steps 1-6: Proper posture and technique in performing squats are crucial, both to achieve the desired results and to avoid injury. It’s also important to control the breath to maintain balance and coordination. Now, for Lunges: Step 1: Maintaining the same starting posture, standing straight with your feet shoulder-width apart, extend one foot forward, while keeping your back foot in its original position. Step 2: Lower your body until the front knee is at 90-degree angle, almost touching the ground. Your back knee should also be dropping towards the ground, but should not touch the ground.  Step 3: Pause in this position for a moment, you'll feel the stretch in your front thigh and your back leg’s calf muscle.  Step 4: Push back up to the original standing position, moving your feet back to their original position. Make sure to push through your heels to stand back up. Step 5: Repeat the steps with the opposite leg moving forward this time. This makes one complete round of a lunge. Justifying steps 1-5: Lunges are a quad-dominant exercise. They specifically target the largest muscle in your body with the goal to strengthen and tone the legs, and also develop core strength. The breathing technique for lunges is the same as squats; inhale as you drop the knee down, and exhale as you stand back up. Be cautious about keeping your spine neutral during all these movements, avoid hunching or extending your lower back."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Steeleye Span are an English folk rock band formed in 1969. Still active today, along with Fairport Convention, they are amongst the best known acts of the British folk revival, and were among the most commercially successful, thanks to their hit singles \\"Gaudete\\" and \\"All Around My Hat\\". They had four Top 40 albums and achieved a certified gold record with sales of \\"All Around My Hat\\". Throughout their history, Steeleye Span have seen many personnel changes. With their star now conspicuously ascendant, the band brought in producer Mike Batt (best known for his musical association with the Wombles and, more recently, Katie Melua) to work on their eighth album, All Around My Hat, and their biggest success would come with the release of the title track as a single - it reached number 5 in the UK Charts in late 1975. The single was also released in other European countries and gave them a breakthrough in the Netherlands and Germany.  Other well-known tracks on the album included \\"Black Jack Davy\\" (sampled by rappers Goldie Lookin Chain on their track \\"The Maggot\\") and the rocky \\"Hard Times of Old England\\". But while All Around My Hat was the height of the band's commercial success, the good times were not to last long. Despite touring almost every year since 1975, they have not had another hit single, nor any success in the album chart since the late 1970s.  The follow-up album Rocket Cottage (1976), also produced by Batt, proved to be a commercial flop, despite having much in common musically with its immediate predecessor. The opening track, \\"London\\", was penned by Rick Kemp as a follow-up to \\"All Around My Hat\\", in response to a request from the record label that Kemp describes as \\"we'll have another one of those, please\\", and released as a single. The song failed to make the UK Chart, in complete contrast to \\"All Around My Hat\\", despite having much in common with its predecessor - a 12/8 time signature, upbeat tempo, solo verses and full harmony chorus. Rocket Cottage also included experimental tracks \\"Fighting for Strangers\\" (with sparse vocals singing concurrently in a variety of keys) and, on the final track, excerpts of studio banter between the band members and a seemingly impromptu rendition of \\"Camptown Races\\", in which Prior gets the lyrics wrong.  But while their seventh album, Commoners Crown, was one of their most interesting and varied, including the epic \\"Long Lankin\\", the advent of punk saw the mainstream market turning away from folk rock almost overnight, heralding a downturn in commercial fortunes for the band. However, as a thank you to their committed fans (and also to possibly to garner some publicity for their underperforming album), Steeleye Span showered attendees of a November 1976 concert in London, England, with the then-equivalent of US13,600 in British pound notes. The unannounced idea was Maddy Prior's, and--remarkably--no-one was injured in the rush to grab the falling bills. Indeed, contemporary press reports indicated that it took some time for the crowd to even realise what was happening. Thanks to their connection with Mike Batt, band members appeared in Womble costumes on Top of the Pops, performing the Wombles hit \\"Superwomble\\".

Edwin Lee Wells won a championship in 1932 between the American League (AL) champion team and whom? Answer:","output":"Edwin Lee \\"Eddie\\" Wells was an American Major League Baseball player, a left-handed pitcher who won the 1932 World Series Championship with the New York Yankees. The Yankees were the American League (AL) champion team during the 1932 season. To answer the question about whom the AL champion, New York Yankees, played against to win the championship in 1932, we need to identify the National League (NL) champion team from that same year. The 1932 World Series saw the New York Yankees face off against the Chicago Cubs. The Chicago Cubs were the NL champions in the 1932 season. The 1932 World Series took place from September 28 to October 1, consisting of four games in total. The New York Yankees, including Eddie Wells, emerged victorious in all four games, achieving a sweeping (4-0) win against the Chicago Cubs. It is also noteworthy that the 1932 World Series was the stage for one of the most iconic moments in baseball history, when Babe Ruth of the Yankees famously called his home run shot, known as the \\"Called Shot,\\" in the fifth inning of Game 3 at Wrigley Field in Chicago. In conclusion, Edwin Lee Wells won the 1932 World Series Championship with the American League champion team, the New York Yankees, against the National League champion team, the Chicago Cubs. The Yankees' four-game sweep in the 1932 World Series solidified their status as one of the dominant teams of that era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"Yes, the premise does entail the hypothesis. The concept of entailment in logic refers to a fundamental relationship between statements. If a premise entails a hypothesis, it means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true.  In this particular context, the premise states \\"There's no doubt it was chloral\\". Essentially, this is expressing a high degree of certainty or total confidence that the substance under discussion was indeed chloral. Float to the hypothesis, \\"Are we certain that it was chloral?\\" This clearly implies a question seeking confirmation or certainty about the identity of the same substance - chloral.  So, if we break it down, the certainty expressed in the premise undeniably guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. Because the premise leaves no room for doubt about it being chloral, it definitely ensures the truth of the question posed in the hypothesis regarding certainty about it being chloral.  In other words, since we are certain in the premise that it was chloral (There's no doubt it was chloral), therefore, the hypothesis that questions that certainty (Are we certain that it was chloral?) can also be valid or true. Hence, the premise does entail the hypothesis. This is based on the logical and syntactical structure of the premise and hypothesis.  However, it's important to note that the entailment doesn't depend on real-world certainty or physical validation of the substance being chloral. Entailment, in this context, is purely a relationship between the meanings of the two sentences irrespective of the actual-world truth of the substance's identity."},{"instruction":"A cat is a carnivore which means they don't do what?

I dined here last Friday evening with my family and we all left feeling frustrated and disappointed by our experience. Although I usually have had a fantastic time visiting this establishment, this time, it was a completely different story. The moment we walked in, we noticed that the ambiance had taken quite a nosedive. There were dirty plates piled up on a nearby table and floors desperately in need of sweeping. Even though the decor was still elegant, the untidy appearance overshadowed everything else. What followed was an excruciatingly long waiting time just to be seated, despite having a reservation. We could see that the place was not packed, and several tables remained empty the entire time. The hostess seemed overwhelmed, seemingly unable to efficiently manage the seating. Our bad luck continued when it was time to place our orders. We had to flag down our server multiple times before they could take our order, and it appeared that they were not familiar with the menu items. Explaining dietary restrictions and asking for recommendations was an arduous task that required all our patience. The food, usually the saving grace at any restaurant, just did not measure up this time. My once-favorite dish lacked seasoning and was served lukewarm. My partner's entree was missing a key ingredient, and others at the table experienced similar missteps. It was truly disheartening to see what was once a beloved eatery take such a turn. To top it all off, our dedicated server seemed to have disappeared into thin air. We waited a lengthy amount of time for our check, only to have it delivered by a different server who appeared to be just as confused and overwhelmed. The overall lack of organization and attentiveness ultimately made our dinner experience tedious and tiresome. It is my hope that this review will be taken as constructive criticism because this restaurant used to hold a special place in my heart. In order for me to return, I would need to see significant improvements in cleanliness, service, and food quality. It really was a letdown to see a once-thriving business falter, and I sincerely hope there will be positive changes in the future. Rating: 1.5/5 stars"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: Before 2006, geneticists had largely attributed the ethnogenesis of most of the world's Jewish populations, including Ashkenazi Jews, to Israelite Jewish male migrants from the Middle East and \\"the women from each local population whom they took as wives and converted to Judaism.\\" Thus, in 2002, in line with this model of origin, David Goldstein, now of Duke University, reported that unlike male Ashkenazi lineages, the female lineages in Ashkenazi Jewish communities \\"did not seem to be Middle Eastern\\", and that each community had its own genetic pattern and even that \\"in some cases the mitochondrial DNA was closely related to that of the host community.\\" In his view this suggested \\"that Jewish men had arrived from the Middle East, taken wives from the host population and converted them to Judaism, after which there was no further intermarriage with non-Jews.\\"","output":"The notable aspect about the female Ashkenazi population's DNA was that it did not seem to be of Middle Eastern origin, and instead, each community had its own genetic pattern, often closely related to the host community.

The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Fort Eben-Emael is an inactive Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal. It was designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 19311935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. The fort was neutralized by glider-borne German troops (85 men) on 10 May 1940 during the Second World War. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. Still the property of the Belgian Army, the fort has been preserved and may be visited.  - The Battle of Maastricht was one of the first battles that took place during the German Campaign on the Western Front during World War II. Maastricht was a key city in order to capture the Belgian Fort Eben - Emael and split the allied armies in half .  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.    What entity does 'battle of maastricht' has the relation 'point in time' with? The answer is:","output":"The 'Battle of Maastricht' has the relation 'point in time' with World War II. This refers to the specific timeframe during which this battle took place. The Battle of Maastricht occurred in the early stages of World War II, specifically during the German Campaign on the Western Front. The city of Maastricht was crucial for the Germans to capture the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael and further their efforts in splitting the allied armies in half.  This ‘point in time’ relation could also specifically point to the year 1940, when the Battle of Maastricht took place, a direct part of the major expansive conflict known as World War II which lasted from 1939 to 1945.  It's important to note that the 'point in time' relation implies a temporal connection between the Battle of Maastricht and World War II. That is, the Battle of Maastricht did not just occur during the period of World War II; it was an integral component of the broader military actions of that global conflict, and represents a significant moment within that specific historical context.  The events and outcomes of this battle directly influenced and were influenced by the sequential developments within World War II. This battle was part of Germany's strategic plan to neutralize the significant defenses of the Allies and pave the way for their further advancement into Belgium and other occupied territories. Furthermore, understanding this 'point in time' relation contributes to our understanding of the broader political, military, and social impacts of World War II."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Steven Lee Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known for his work with the rock band Toto. A prolific session musician, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather has released seven solo albums, the latest of which, Transition, was released in January 2013. The 1989 album Lukather came about after Toto had been recording and playing for 11 years, and the consensus among the band members was to take a break. As Lukather had written a number of songs that did not appear on Toto albums, he decided to pursue a solo album, with the intention of presenting a dimension of his music that fans would be unfamiliar with. He collaborated with many notable musicians, including Eddie Van Halen, Richard Marx, Jan Hammer, Steve Stevens, and fellow Toto members Jeff Porcaro and David Paich. Lukather has said that the album was produced very simply, and that a lot of ambient studio noise--counting off on various tracks, for instance--is audible on it. He also credits bands Pink Floyd, Cream, Led Zeppelin, and guitarists Jimi Hendrix, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, and Eric Clapton as influences on the album. The single \\"Swear Your Love\\" came from the album.  Candyman, recorded and mastered from March 1993 through November 1993, was a collaboration of musicians who were for the most part also in Lukather's band Los Lobotomys. Toto familiars Simon Phillips and David Paich participated as well as David Garfield, John Pena, Chris Trujillo, Lenny Castro, Larry Klimas, Fee Waybill, Richard Page, and Paul Rodgers. Lukather recorded the album in mostly live takes with little overdubbing. Some international fans were confused about whether Candyman was a Steve Lukather album or a Los Lobotomys album. The Japanese and US releases of Candyman were under the Los Lobotomys name rather than Lukather's; the Japanese release also featured a version of the Hendrix song \\"Red House\\". The European release of Candyman was credited to Lukather alone. Additionally, the touring band for the album was sometimes introduced as \\"Steve Lukather and Los Lobotomys\\" and sometimes as just \\"Los Lobotomys\\". The song \\"Borrowed Time\\" was released as a single in Europe and included \\"Red House\\" as a B-side.  Lukather describes 1997's Luke as a much different and more \\"introspective\\" album than his previous two solo efforts. The album is a concentrated collection of many of Lukather's musical influences, and he deliberately let those influences come out on the album. Luke is an experimental album, and like Candyman it was recorded mostly in live sessions with minimal overdubbing and processing afterwards. Luke also features instrumentation not heard on previous Lukather albums: pedal steel, Harmonicas, Mellotrons, and experimental guitar, bass, and drum sounds. The US version of Luke includes a version of the Jeff Beck song \\"The Pump\\". The song \\"Hate Everything About U\\" was released as a single.","output":"This text is about Steven Lee Lukather, an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger, and record producer.

And what does  Meryl Streep  have to say about all this?  She  was part of a Hollywood movement that repeatedly campaigned for Polanskiâs release and for his ability to return to the United States over the past 15 years.  Streep   along with numerous other members of the Hollywood elite  gave Polanksi a standing ovation at the Academy Awards in 2003 after Polanski was awarded an Oscar for The Pianist. Thereâs no plausible deniability here. Unlike with Weinstein   Streep  canât claim  she  didnât know Polanski was a child rapist. Everybody knew. Every time  she  has been asked about Roman Polanski   Streep  has defended him.  She  has not disavowed the admitted child rapist and accused serial sex abuser of women and children in the two months since the Hollywood and political sex abuse scandal broke. How can  Streep  legitimately call  herself  a âfeministâ and say  she  is standing up for female victims of sexual assault given this refusal to disavow?  Meryl Streep herself  referred to Harvey Weinstein as âGodâ during a 2012 speech  labeling him âthe punisherâ.  Meryl Streep  2017: Weinstein is \\"disgraceful\\".

It suggests that the individual (in this case, \\"you\\") has expressed a desire or has demonstrated a behavior that indicates they are interested in being skilled or helpful in various tasks or situations. Step 2: Analyzing the hypothesis The hypothesis in question is \\"I know you want to repair everything\\". This statement means that the individual (again, \\"you\\") is believed to have the desire or intent to fix or mend any and all things. Step 3: Comparing the premise and the hypothesis Now, we will compare the information given in the premise to the information expressed in the hypothesis. The premise states that the individual wants to be \\"handy like\\", while the hypothesis assumes that this \\"handiness\\" translates into wanting to repair everything. This is an extrapolation, and it is important to examine whether or not it is a logical leap. Step 4: Assessing the validity of the hypothesis given the premise While wanting to be \\"handy like\\" may involve fixing or repairing objects, it does not exclusively mean wanting to \\"repair everything\\". Being handy can include a wide range of skills such as fixing objects, assembling furniture, or helping out with various tasks. The premise does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the individual wants to repair everything specifically. Step 5: Conclusion Given the premise \\"Know you want to be handy like\\", it does not logically entail the hypothesis \\"I know you want to repair everything\\". While being handy may encompass repairing things, the premise only suggests a more general interest in being skilled or helpful and does not provide sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To understand the whole situation and the reasons behind her decision, let's delve deeper into the story. Susan, an aspiring artist, loved working with different types of materials to create beautiful and unique pieces. One fine day, she decided to try her hand at pottery, a skill she'd always wanted to learn. After attending a few pottery classes and learning the necessary techniques, she started working on her very first project - a beautiful clay pot for her home. While working on her project, Susan was extremely excited and wanted to make the clay pot a conspicuous and impressive piece. She spent hours envisioning the perfect shape, size, and artistic design for her pot. However, as Susan passionately crafted her masterpiece, she lost track of its proportions. Her enthusiasm got the better of her, and she wound up making an enormously large pot, much bigger than initially intended. Upon completing her clay pot, Susan proudly admired her handiwork. She was eager to take it home and find the perfect spot in her house. However, she soon realized that the pot's immense size posed a significant problem. Her home, being a modest one, simply didn't have the space required to accommodate this unexpectedly colossal pot. She attempted to place the pot in various corners of her house, but it always seemed to be in the way, obstructing movement and functionality in the room. Disappointed but not defeated, Susan finally made a difficult decision. She decided that keeping the massive clay pot in her home wasn't a feasible option. Instead, she had to find an alternative solution to ensure that her masterpiece wouldn't go to waste. Eventually, Susan chose to gift the huge clay pot to her friend, who owned a spacious garden. Her friend was thrilled with this unexpected gift and found a beautiful, well-suited spot for it in her garden. It served as an eye-catching, artistic centerpiece, drawing admiration from all who saw it. Even though Susan had to let go of her creation, she didn't feel disheartened. She focused on the positives that came from the experience - she'd learned the valuable skill of pottery and gained the experience necessary to keep proportions in check for her next project. Moreover, Susan's giant clay pot had found a home where it was admired and appreciated, and that brought immense satisfaction to her as an artist. The lesson she learned also inspired her to continue honing her pottery skills and create even more beautiful, well-sized pieces to display proudly in her home."},{"instruction":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What collection did the money Gregory put in a safe deposit box come from?, using the article: Paul Gregory, a Canadian confidence trickster operating in London, targets a wealthy Canadian woman in Britain to sell her collection of valuable coins.

The band's line-up comprises lead vocalist, guitarist and keyboardist Charlie Simpson, guitarist and vocalist Alex Westaway, bassist Dan Haigh and drummer Omar Abidi. Although generally considered a post-hardcore band, Fightstar are commonly known to implement additional metal and alternative rock elements into their sound, as well as several other genres. During the band's initial emergence, they were faced with much skepticism due to Simpson's former pop career. However, they began to receive positive reactions to early live shows and their debut EP, \\"They Liked You Better When You Were Dead\\" (2005), was a critical success. Since then, their four studio albums have obtained top 40 chartings and critical praise.   - McFly is an English pop rock band formed in London in 2003. The band consists of Tom Fletcher (lead vocals, ukulele, guitar and piano), Danny Jones (lead vocals, harmonica and guitar), Dougie Poynter (bass guitar and vocals), and Harry Judd (drums). They were signed to Island Records from their 2004 launch until December 2007, before creating their own label, Super Records.  - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Pop music is a genre of popular music that originated in its modern form in the Western world as a softer alternative to rock and roll. The terms \\"popular music\\" and \\"pop music\\" are often used interchangeably, although the former describes all music that is popular and includes many styles. \\"Pop\\" and \\"rock\\" were synonymous terms until the late 1960s, when they were increasingly used in opposition from each other.  - Son of Dork were a British pop punk band formed by James Bourne after his previous band, Busted, split in January 2005. The name of the band came from a scene in the 1990 film \\"Problem Child\\" where the chant \\"Son of Dork\\" is used. Their debut single, \\"Ticket Outta Loserville\\", was released in November 2005, reaching No. 3 on the UK Singles Chart. Their second single, \\"Eddie's Song\\", reached No. 10 in January 2006.  - Pop punk (also known as punk-pop) is a punk rock music genre and a fusion genre that combines elements of punk rock with elements of pop music. Pop punk typically combines fast punk rock tempos, power chord changes and loud, distorted electric guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes.  - AllMusic (previously known as All Music Guide or AMG) is an online music guide service website. It was launched in 1991 by All Media Guide which later became All Media Network.  - James Elliot Bourne (born 13 September 1983 in Rochford, Essex, England) is an English singer-songwriter and co-founder of pop rock bands Busted and Son of Dork as well as a solo electronic project, Future Boy. From 2013-2015 he was a member of supergroup McBusted, which consisted of himself, Busted bandmate Matt Willis, and McFly.  - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.  - Hard rock is a loosely defined subgenre of rock music that began in the mid-1960s, with the garage, psychedelic and blues rock movements. It is typified by a heavy use of aggressive vocals, distorted electric guitars, bass guitar, drums, and often accompanied with pianos and keyboards.  - In musical terminology, tempo (\\"time\\" in Italian; plural: \\"tempi\\" ) is the speed or pace of a given piece or subsection thereof, how fast or slow. Tempo is related to meter and is usually measured by beats per minute, with the beats being a division of the measures, though tempo is often indicated by terms which have acquired standard ranges of beats per minute or assumed by convention without indication. Tempo may be separated from articulation, or articulation may be indicated along with tempo, and tempo contributes to the overall texture. While the ability to hold a steady tempo is a desirable skill, tempo is changeable, and often indicated by a conductor or drummer. While practicing, an electronic or mechanical device, a metronome, may indicate the tempo, as one usually works one's way up to being able to perform at the proper tempo. In other words it is the speed at which a passage of music is or should be played.  - \`\` You Said No '' ( also known by its original title , \`\` Crash and Burn '' ) is a song by English pop punk band Busted .

He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid  from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly.

While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The inhabited history of the Las Vegas Valley stretches to 23,000 b.c. , when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake. During this period, the indigenous people lived in caves, hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline. The landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries. The glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated. Fossils tell an obscure story of man's slow and sporadic development. Around 3000 b.c. , native Archaic Indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture. By this time, the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today, with one exception — the presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas. These springs fed a network of streams draining through the Las Vegas Wash to the Colorado River. The areas surrounding the springs were desert oases: sprawling collections of grasses, trees, and wildlife. Many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern Las Vegas metropolis. For about 4000 years, the Archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization. Signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium a.d. , when the Anasazi Indians inhabited the valley. Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest. This permitted the Anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced society — the ability to live in permanent shelters year-round without need to follow wildlife. Mysteriously, the Anasazi vanished from the valley around a.d.

Answer the following question: Question: how much sulfur dioxide is in propane I found the following answer on Google: Sulfur dioxide (also sulphur dioxide) is the chemical compound with the formula . Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","output":"No, the answer you found is not correct. The question asks about the presence of sulfur dioxide in propane, and the provided answer only gives the chemical formula for sulfur dioxide without addressing its presence in propane. To better answer the question, let's first understand what propane and sulfur dioxide are and their respective compositions. Propane (C3H8) is a hydrocarbon belonging to the alkane series, and it consists of three carbon atoms and eight hydrogen atoms. It is mainly used as a fuel for heating, cooking, and powering engines. Propane is a clean-burning fuel, and it is a byproduct of both petroleum refining and natural gas processing. Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a chemical compound comprised of one sulfur atom and two oxygen atoms. It is a colorless gas with a pungent odor and is commonly associated with the burning of fossil fuels like coal and crude oil. Sulfur dioxide can be produced during some volcanic eruptions and by industrial processes that involve oxidizing sulfur-containing compounds. Now coming back to the question at hand: The molecular composition of propane does not contain any sulfur atoms, so it does not have any sulfur dioxide in its pure form. Natural gas, which propane is a component of, may contain very small amounts of sulfur-containing impurities like hydrogen sulfide (H2S). However, these impurities are typically very low in concentration and are removed during gas processing to meet safety and environmental requirements. Thus, the purified propane available for consumer use contains negligible to no sulfur dioxide. Therefore, to answer the question, the amount of sulfur dioxide in propane is practically nil or insignificant, as propane does not contain sulfur in its chemical structure and is processed to remove any impurities prior to consumer use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process The answer is:","output":"indirectly impacting a step of the process. An increase in the domestic budget can have a positive effect on improved safety from flooding, though it may not directly impact the specific steps of the process mentioned. The additional funds, if allocated towards flood management and infrastructure projects, can support efforts to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the flood management systems in place. Indirect ways in which an increased domestic budget can improve safety from flooding include: 1. Enhancing Dam Infrastructure: Additional funds can be used to improve the design, construction, and maintenance of dams. This could involve reinforcing the dam structure, incorporating advanced technologies to monitor water levels, and implementing an efficient control system to regulate the flow of water through floodgates. 2. Investing in Research and Development: The domestic budget may allocate resources towards research and development to discover and implement innovative solutions for flood management. This can lead to better understanding of flood risks, improved modeling of potential flood scenarios, and the development of more effective flood prevention and mitigation strategies. 3. Flood Forecasting and Early Warning Systems: The increased budget can support the establishment or improvement of flood forecasting and early warning systems. These systems contribute to better preparedness and timely response in the event of a potential flooding situation. They help communities and authorities to evacuate or take preventive actions, thus minimizing the impact of flooding events. 4. Capacity Building and Training: Investment in capacity building and training programs for personnel involved in flood management, such as engineers, technicians, and emergency responders, can help enhance the overall efficiency of the flood management process and boost safety standards. 5. Land-use Planning and Floodplain Management: The additional funds can be used to develop and enforce better land-use planning and floodplain management guidelines. This ensures that vulnerable areas are not subjected to inappropriate development, thereby reducing the overall risk of flooding in the region. 6. Flood Mitigation Measures: Increased financial resources can support the implementation of various flood mitigation measures, such as constructing levees, floodwalls, and channel improvements. These measures help reduce the risk and impact of flooding events by redirecting excessive water away from vulnerable areas. In conclusion, while an increase in the domestic budget does not directly impact any step of the process specified, it can indirectly contribute to improved safety from flooding by providing the necessary financial resources to support various flood management initiatives. These initiatives, in turn, can lead to better infrastructure, advanced technologies, and efficient strategies for managing flood risks, ultimately providing enhanced protection against flood damage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Close      U.S. Senator Max Baucus said the U.S. and China must collaborate on curbing greenhouse... Read More      Senator Max Baucus, nominated to become U.S. ambassador to China, told lawmakers he would place top priority on boosting trade while also pressing that nation over computer breaches and crackdowns on dissidents.      “The U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world,” Baucus, a Montana Democrat, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee today at his confirmation hearing. “It will shape global affairs for generations to come. We must get it right.”      Baucus said he’ll take aim at breaches in computer security affecting U.S. companies. He said both nations must collaborate on curbing greenhouse gas emissions, including projects on energy efficiency, transportation and carbon limits.      He said he would cooperate with China on threats by North Korea’s nuclear program, and would address China’s Nov. 23 declaration of an air defense identification zone in the East China Sea, covering areas claimed by Japan and South Korea. That action sparked a rebuke by Secretary of State John Kerry.      Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican, said China’s “aggressive behavior” is “part of a pattern of their ambition to dominate that part of the world.”      “We are seeing a time of rising tensions in Asia” and the U.S. must keep a close alliance with other countries in the region, McCain said.      “I don’t disagree with you,” Baucus responded.      No Opposition      There was no sign of opposition from Baucus’s fellow senators.      “I am sure you will be confirmed,” committee Chairman Bob Menendez, a New Jersey Democrat, told Baucus as the hearing began in Washington. The chairman scheduled a committee vote on the nomination for Feb. 4.      Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, the top Republican on the foreign relations panel, said Baucus has a strong track record on free trade and urged him to keep “Western values front and center.”      “I look forward to seeing you on the ground there,” Corker said.      Baucus was nominated by President Barack Obama to succeed Gary Locke as ambassador. He would enter the post at a time of tension and prospects in the relationship between the world’s two biggest economies. His departure also would shake up the leadership of the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is chairman, potentially slowing tax-law revisions and free-trade deals.      Retirement Planned      Baucus had planned to retire from Congress at the end of this year, his sixth term.      In his testimony to the committee, Baucus stressed his free-trade background in Congress, working on deals with Chile, Australia, Panama, Peru and other nations. He said he has traveled extensively to markets for U.S. goods, including Russia, Japan, Spain and Belgium.      “I have learned some core lessons along the way,” he said. “Among the most important, I have become a firm believer that a strong geopolitical relationship can be born out of a strong economic relationship, which often begins with trade.”      China has been flexing its power in Asia as it asserts claims to disputed territories and resources. It has been involved in tense disputes with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines, and expanded national military spending by 10.7 percent to 740.6 billion yuan (122 billion) in 2013.      Dissident Crackdown      China’s crackdown on dissenters included the jailing this month of legal scholar Xu Zhiyong. Xu, the most prominent activist jailed since Nobel Peace Prize winner Liu Xiaobo in 2009 was sentenced by a Beijing court to four years in prison on charges of gathering a crowd to disturb public order.      Other issues include cyber-attacks and efforts to gain trade secrets of U.S. firms.      Trade tensions between the U.S. and China are running high. Since Obama took office in 2009, the two nations have sparred over trade in goods and services including autos, poultry, clean-energy manufacturing, tires, rare-earth elements and credit-card payments.      China joined the World Trade Organization in 2001, and the U.S. has filed 15 disputes against the Asian nation, more than any other country, according to a report from the U.S. Trade Representative’s office in December. The agency on Jan. 13 said China wasn’t adhering to a WTO ruling involving trade in steel, the first time U.S. officials challenged China’s claim of compliance.      Intertwined Economies      The nations’ economies are becoming more intertwined, with U.S. trade in goods with China almost quadrupling, to 512 billion, from 2003 through 2013, according to Commerce Department data. The U.S. trade deficit with China declined about 7 percent last year, to 294 billion, after increasing for four years.      Baucus’s confirmation would begin a series of changes in Senate committee leadership, which may in turn lead to shifts in policy areas. His departure from the Finance panel would probably elevate Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden to lead the committee, which determines tax, trade and health policy.      Wyden, who now leads the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, would be replaced by Senator Mary Landrieu, a Louisiana Democrat with close ties to the oil and natural gas industries.      The shift in leadership would make it tougher, if not impossible, to enact major changes in the U.S. tax code this year. Baucus and his House Republican counterpart, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan, have traveled the U.S. to promote a tax-code overhaul and released discussion drafts on four areas of tax policy.

Max Baucus to be the next U.S. Ambassador to China.      Testifying on Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Baucus (D-Mont.) brushed aside questions from Republicans about whether Democrats orchestrated his move to China. Some have suggested President Barack Obama made the appointment so Montana Lt. Gov. John Walsh could be installed in the Senate, giving him a boost ahead of the November election in which he hopes to win Baucus’ seat for a full term.      Text Size -      +      reset      Walsh said Monday that an interim appointment could help his prospects for keeping the key Senate seat under Democratic control.      When asked whether he ever spoke with Montana’s governor or his former chief of staff, Jim Messina, about who will succeed him in the Senate, Baucus simply responded “no.”      Baucus, one of the most senior members of the Senate and chairman of the powerful Finance committee, faced mostly friendly questions from members of both parties.      Still, he stumbled into a gaffe, at one point telling Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) that he is “no real expert on China.”      Johnson asked Baucus what motivated the Chinese to recently form the Air Defense Identification Zone that overlaps disputed territories with Japan, a move widely viewed as further souring relations between the rival Asian powers.      “I’m no real expert on China. But it’s my strong belief that Chinese people are just as proud as we Americans are proud,” Baucus said.      After the hearing, an aide emphasized that Baucus’s answer was simply an example of his humility as he prepares to move into the new position.      “The Senator was being humble, that is the Montana way,” the aide said.      After hearing Baucus’s answer to Johnson, McCain said he was “concerned” over the Montana senator’s answers and warned him to be skeptical when dealing with the country’s leadership.      “This isn’t a matter of if they’re proud as we are proud,” McCain said. “This is a matter of a rising threat or challenge to peace and security in Asia because of the profound belief in Chinese leadership that China will regain the dominant role” in Asia.      “I don’t base my comments to you on John McCain’s opinion. I base it on the opinion of every expert I know of China. And that is … there is a growing threat of another ‘Guns of August,’” McCain added, referring to a book documenting how escalations between bordering countries can provoked World War I.      McCain then recommended Baucus consult with former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger on how to deal with China. Baucus said he intends to do so soon and did not push back against the Arizona senator’s comments.      “I don’t disagree with you,” Baucus said. “The whole thing in life is hope for the best and assume for the worst.”      Despite the misstep when answering Johnson, Baucus still appears a lock for eventual Senate confirmation. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee will advance his nomination to the Senate floor possibly as soon as next Tuesday.      “I am sure you will be confirmed,” Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) told Baucus, one of several assurances he gave the six-term senator throughout the hearing.      Baucus made clear that while he will work to implement and enforce the policy of President Barack Obama, he will also offer a measure of independence from the administration and avoid “just parroting the talking points.”      Those comments confirmed what many in the Senate already know: Despite his likely confirmation into the Obama administration later this year, Baucus will remain his own man in China, a trait that cheered his colleagues.      “I don’t think you’re the type of person to take direction from some 25-year old at the White House,” said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.), the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “I think you’ve shown independence.” ||||| Sen. Max Baucus (D-MT) is set to be confirmed as the nation’s next ambassador to the People’s Republic of China. “For more than two decades, Max Baucus has worked to deepen the relationship between the United States and China,” President Barack Obama said when announcing is nomination. Baucus was, perhaps, being more modest about his qualifications when he told Sen. Ron Johnson (R-WI) during confirmation hearings recently that he is “no expert” on China.            Johnson asked Baucus for his thoughts on why the PRC unilaterally declared an air defense zone recently around a series of Pacific islands under Japanese control.      “Senator, I’m no real expert on China,” Baucus replied. “It’s my strong belief that Chinese people are just as proud as we Americans.”      Watch the clip below via Senate Foreign Relations Committee:      h/t Benny Johnson      [Photo via screen grab ]      — —      > >Follow Noah Rothman (@NoahCRothman) on Twitter      Have a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com |||||","output":"A big important man named Senator Max Baucus spoke about the United States and China.

A). no; B). yes;","output":"B). yes Step-by-step explanation: 1. We have the original statement: \\"Stretching her back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\" 2. Let's break this statement down:    - \\"Stretching her back\\" is referring to the woman's action.    - \\"the woman smiled at the girl\\" describes the result of the action. 3. Now let's consider the alternate phrasing: \\"Stretching the woman's back, the woman smiled at the girl.\\"    - \\"Stretching the woman's back\\" still refers to the woman's action, just using different wording.    - \\"the woman smiled at the girl\\" remains unchanged and still describes the result of the action. 4. Comparing the two statements - despite the different wording, both describe the same situation: the action of the woman stretching her back and then smiling at the girl. Conclusion: Since both statements describe the same situation, it is possible to draw the same conclusion from both statements.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process might be a volcanic eruption.  Step by step thinking: - The pressure beneath the Earth's surface has been increasing due to the trapped gases. - These gases have already pushed molten magma towards the surface, and the magma has been cooling. - As the pressure continues to build up over time, it eventually reaches a critical point. - At this critical point, the pressure becomes too high to be contained any longer. Justification: The volcanic eruption serves as a release for the built-up pressure caused by the gases and molten magma. This eruption can result in the expulsion of magma, ash, and other volcanic materials, which can cool and harden into new rock formations on the Earth's surface. This final step is a natural consequence of the increasing pressure beneath the Earth's surface and provides a balance to the geological processes occurring below."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"The movie featuring the song \\"Days in the Sun\\" is \\"Beauty and the Beast,\\" released in 2017. This film, directed by Bill Condon, is a live-action adaptation of Disney's 1991 animated feature film of the same name. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" is based on the French fairy tale \\"La Belle et la Bête,\\" written by Gabrielle-Suzanne Barbot de Villeneuve and later abridged and modified by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont. \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" stars Emma Watson as Belle, a young woman who becomes a prisoner in an enchanted castle ruled by a cursed beast, played by Dan Stevens. The film also features an impressive supporting cast, including Luke Evans as Gaston, Kevin Kline as Maurice, Josh Gad as LeFou, and a talented ensemble providing the voices for the animated objects in the castle, such as Ewan McGregor as Lumière, Ian McKellen as Cogsworth, Emma Thompson as Mrs. Potts, and Audra McDonald as Madame Garderobe. \\"Days in the Sun\\" is a song from the 2017 adaptation, composed by Alan Menken with lyrics by Tim Rice. This new song was created specifically for the live-action film, and it is not present in the original 1991 animated movie. \\"Days in the Sun\\" is a beautiful ballad that highlights the emotions and memories of the characters, offering insights into their lives before the enchantment that transformed the prince into the beast and the castle's staff into household objects. In the song, the characters, led by Mrs. Potts, reminisce about their past lives before the curse, yearning for the joy and warmth they once knew. The song also emphasizes the theme of time passing, as the characters recall their lost humanity and hope for the enchantment to be broken so they can be free to live as they once did. The lyrics poignantly express their longing for the idyllic days they once knew and the importance of love and connection in breaking the spell. The live-action adaptation of \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" received a positive reception from critics and audiences alike, praised for its loyalty to the original animated film while also providing new depth to the story and characters with additional songs, new story elements, and visually stunning special effects. \\"Days in the Sun\\" is just one example of how the 2017 film enhanced the narrative, proving that the magic of the original can be reimagined and appreciated in a new light."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

(AP Photo/Michelle Rindels) (Associated Press) Thousands of people gather at the Paris casino in Las Vegas for the Nevada State Democratic Convention on Saturday, May 14, 2016. They are picking delegates to send to the national convention in July.... (Associated Press)      LAS VEGAS (AP) — The Nevada Democratic Convention turned into an unruly and unpredictable event, after tension with organizers led to some Bernie Sanders supporters throwing chairs and to security clearing the room, organizers said.      Friction between Bernie Sanders' supporters and state Democratic Party leaders had flared throughout the day on Saturday. The convention was scheduled to end by 7 p.m. and when it hadn't wrapped up by 10 p.m., authorities at the Paris Las Vegas casino informed party organizers they could no longer provide the security necessary to handle the crowd.      Sanders national communications director Michael Briggs didn't have immediate comment on the events in Nevada when reached by phone on Sunday morning.      The hostilities began when Sanders supporters accused state party leaders of putting them at a disadvantage, and they objected to procedural votes to approve the rules of the event on Saturday. They also questioned a credentials committee's disqualification of 58 would-be Sanders delegates. State party officials said the would-be delegates didn't provide acceptable identification and did not meet the May 1 deadline to register as Democrats.      State party officials said some Clinton-supporting delegates were ruled ineligible too, although in lower numbers.      Clinton has a five-delegate advantage over Sanders in Nevada, 20 to his 15, and is expected to win a majority of the state's eight unpledged superdelegates — party officials who can vote for the candidate they choose. Going into Tuesday's primaries in Kentucky and Oregon, Clinton has 1,716 pledged delegates from primaries and caucuses, compared with 1,433 for Sanders.      Some Sanders supporters upset with Saturday's proceedings protested against state party chairwoman, Roberta Lange, outside the Nevada State Democratic Party headquarters on Sunday. Her cellphone number was posted on social media and officials said Lange had received hundreds of phone calls and text messages, including death threats.      Sanders tried to tamp down the tensions roiling even before the convention. He issued a statement on Friday, reminding supporters that all Democrats shared the common goals of defeating Donald Trump and electing Democrats to office.      \\"Working together respectfully and constructively on Saturday at the Nevada Democratic convention will move us closer to those essential goals,\\" he said. ||||| The Nevada State Democratic Party ended its state convention late Saturday amid security concerns about unruliness, the state party said Sunday.      The state convention heated up Saturday night as supporters of presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., became upset over procedural issues and the delegate seating process.      The convention’s main purpose was to pick delegates who will go in July to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. In the state’s Feb. 20 Democratic presidential caucuses, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton beat Sanders.      Saturday’s event ended at 10 p.m. at Paris Las Vegas, three hours after its scheduled end time, after the hotel-casino’s security director told party and campaign officials that “the property could no longer provide the necessary security under conditions made unruly and unpredictable,” the Nevada State Democratic Party said, adding that the hotel-casino had requested a “prompt conclusion.”      Unrest continued after the convention. A protest unfolded Sunday outside the Nevada State Democratic Party’s headquarters, at 6233 Dean Martin Drive in Las Vegas, where, the state party said in a statement, Sanders backers defaced the building’s exterior walls. A report was filed with the Metropolitan Police Department.      Some of the graffiti was aimed at state party Chairwoman Roberta Lange, who presided over Saturday’s convention.      “Fire Roberta,” said one message scrawled in sidewalk chalk on the wall next to the party’s door. Another message said: “#FREETHE64,” a reference to a dispute over 64 Sanders supporters who didn’t qualify to be delegates at the convention.      The party called the issue a “false controversy” created by Sanders national staff members who were at the convention to incite an uproar.      Party officials have said those people didn’t meet the criteria for various reasons, including not registering as Democrats by a deadline, or having incomplete or wrong information on file and not responding to prior requests to correct it. Eight potential delegates for Clinton also were turned away.      Separately, the state party said Lange’s cellphone number was posted on social media, and she received thousands of text messages, phone calls and emails, including death threats.      The Sanders campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment Sunday.      Saturday’s event ended with Lange accepting a motion to appoint delegates preapproved by the Clinton and Sanders campaigns, organizers said. She also accepted a motion to elect the state central committee according to rules submitted by county party chairs.      A security guard went with Lange off the stage and stayed with her because of the rising unruliness.      At one point, police officers stood at the front of the stage, and lights were dimmed to encourage protesting convention attendees to leave, according to attendees and YouTube video posted on social media.      Sanders supporters had conflicts with party leaders before the convention, too. They had sued the state party and lost in court Friday after alleging that deadlines were improperly changed to prevent some from running for party leadership posts.      “We were just trying to force the democratic process,” said Angie Morelli, an attendee elected to be a national delegate representing Sanders. “This party is supposed to be the party of unity and inclusion.”      Morelli criticized how the event was handled. “That’s not how you unite a party. … They didn’t care about giving us any voice whatsoever.”      Before the convention, Democratic leaders including Sanders and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., had issued calls encouraging all to work together respectfully at the convention.      The Nevada State Democratic Party will send 43 delegates to the national convention.      Clinton received seven of the 12 national delegate slots up for grabs at the state convention after narrowly turning out more supporters than the Sanders camp. Out of nearly 3,400 qualified state-level delegates who showed up, Clinton had 33 more than Sanders. Clinton had 1,695 delegates seated at the state convention. Sanders had 1,662.      Clinton went into the state convention with a delegate lead in Nevada after winning the Feb. 20 caucuses, but Sanders supporters outnumbered Clinton’s backers at the April county conventions, where results are not tied to any national delegates.      After the convention, Clinton has a 20-15 delegate advantage over Sanders. She is also expected to win a majority of Nevada’s eight unpledged superdelegates.

LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com/AP) — A Los Angeles judge has ordered the release of a man who spent more than three decades in prison for murder after prosecutors conceded he did not get a fair trial.      The district attorney’s office said during a hearing Wednesday in Superior Court that there were errors in the case against 62-year-old Andrew Wilson.

Earlier this week a judge allowed a woman to give evidence in court wearing a burqa for the first time.","output":"Title: Schools and the Niqab: A Discussion on Women's Visibility Hello kids! Today, we are going to talk about a lady named Dr. Sarah Wollaston. She works in a place called Totnes, Devon, and she has something to say about schools and a special piece of clothing called the niqab. Now, you might be wondering, what is a niqab? A niqab is a type of clothing worn by some women, which covers their face, except for their eyes. It is a part of their culture and religion. Dr. Sarah Wollaston is worried that some schools might not be treating women fairly if they allow them to wear the niqab. She thinks that when women wear this special clothing, they become \\"invisible.\\" That means that people might not notice them or think they are important. Recently, a school called Birmingham Metropolitan College decided not to ban the niqab. That means students can wear the niqab if they want to. This decision came after students expressed that wearing the niqab is important to them. Oh, and guess what happened earlier this week? A judge allowed a woman to wear a burqa in court. A burqa is like a niqab, but it covers the whole body and face, with just a small opening for the eyes. This is a big deal because it's the first time a woman has been allowed to wear a burqa in court. It shows that people are trying to understand and respect different cultures and clothing choices.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

Write a title: The Palestinian Fatah Movement threatened to boycott the upcoming presidential elections unless the cause of Yasser Arafat #39;s is revealed.","output":"Title: Palestinian Fatah Movement Demands Revelation of Yasser Arafat's Cause of Death as a Condition for Participation in the Upcoming Presidential Elections The ongoing political tensions within the Palestinian territories have taken a new turn, as the Palestinian Fatah Movement has recently issued an ultimatum, demanding that the truth surrounding the cause of Yasser Arafat's mysterious death be revealed before they agree to participate in the forthcoming presidential elections. The Palestinian Fatah Movement, a historic political and military faction that played a vital role in the Palestinian struggle for independence and nationhood, has expressed its strong reservations and skepticism regarding the incomplete knowledge of the late leader’s demise as a significant obstacle to their engagement in the upcoming political process. Yasser Arafat, the iconic figurehead of the Palestinian resistance and the founding father of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), died suddenly on November 11, 2004, while being treated in French military hospital Le Val-de-Grâce. Arafat's unexpected passing has been a subject of speculation and controversy ever since, with many theories suggesting that he may have been poisoned, thereby making his death an act of assassination. Despite numerous investigations, however, the precise cause of Arafat's death has not been conclusively determined, much to the frustration of Palestinians and the international community. The Palestinian Fatah Movement's decision to withhold its participation in the forthcoming Palestinian Authority (PA) presidential elections unless the truth behind Arafat's death is uncovered, can be seen as a reflection of the movement's commitment to safeguarding the historical legacy and political legitimacy of its founding leader. The organization aims to hold those responsible for the alleged assassination accountable and to ensure that justice is served for its revered leader and the entire Palestinian nation, who continue to struggle under the ongoing Israeli occupation and political fragmentation. This demand by the Fatah movement may also be viewed in the context of internal Palestinian politics. With leaders inside the Fatah movement feeling marginalized or discontented with the recent political developments, revealing the cause of Arafat's death could provide new opportunities for regaining influence within the Palestinian political arena. Moreover, it may provide a rallying point for the various Palestinian factions to foster a sense of unity and shared objectives in the protracted quest for self-determination and statehood. The repercussions of Fatah's potential election boycott could be dramatic, as the movement remains a significant political force in Palestinian politics and society. Its absence from the electoral process might lead to a decreased voter turnout, tarnish the overall credibility of the election results, or exacerbate the fragile political climate in the Palestinian territories due to the delicate balance of power among various factions. Given the profound consequences of Fatah's ultimatum, it is in the best interest of both the Palestinian territories and the international community to address this long-standing issue. Doing so would not only honor Arafat’s memory but also pave the way for the inclusion of all Palestinians in a fair and transparent political process, ultimately contributing to lasting peace, stability, and prosperity in the region."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Lee received every threat that was sent to him from his stalker.

Process:  - Water evaporates from the ground up to the sky - Water droplets are in clouds - The air gets cold - Water droplets turn into ice crystals - Ice crystals in clouds stick together and become snowflakes.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is a drought in progress happens, how will it affect LESS snow.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a drought in progress can have an effect on the process, both directly and indirectly. A drought is characterized by a prolonged period of below-average precipitation, which can result in a reduced availability of water on the ground. This can affect the process of snow formation in the following ways: 1. Direct effect: Since water availability is lower during a drought, there will be less water evaporating from the ground and rising into the atmosphere. This will lead to a reduced amount of water vapor available to form clouds, making it less likely for the cloud formation process to reach the stage where water droplets become ice crystals and eventually snowflakes. 2. Indirect effect: Droughts can also lead to higher temperatures and changes in atmospheric circulation patterns. Warmer air is capable of holding more water vapor, making it harder for the water droplets in clouds to cool and condense into ice crystals. This can further reduce the possibility of snowflake formation. In summary, a drought in progress can directly and indirectly affect the process of snow formation by reducing the availability of water vapor in the atmosphere, as well as changing the temperature and circulation patterns, making it less likely for snowflakes to form. Consequently, this can result in less snow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

And the answer is?","output":"The Bichon Frise is a small breed of dog, known for its friendly, affectionate, and sociable temperament. They have a distinct appearance, characterized by their white, curly, and soft coat, which typically consists of hypoallergenic hair as opposed to fur. This makes them an excellent choice for individuals with allergies or sensitivities to pet dander. The Bichon Frise belongs to the non-sporting or companion dog group, and they originated from the Mediterranean region. Their ancestry can be traced back to the Barbet, a water dog, and the Standard Poodle. From these breeds, Bichons inherited their signature fluffy, curly hair and endearing personalities. The name \\"Bichon Frise\\" is comprised of two parts: \\"Bichon\\" which is a term that signifies a group of small dog breeds, and \\"Frise,\\" which is derived from the French word \\"frisé\\" meaning curly or fluffy. The Bichon Frise is closely related to other breeds in the Bichon family, which includes the Bichon Bolognese, the Bichon Havanese, the Bichon Maltese, and the Bichon Tenerife. These breeds were popular among European nobility during the Renaissance era, where they were often kept as cherished pets, lap dogs, and companions. Bichon Frises are typically small dogs, with adult males and females averaging around 9.5 to 11.5 inches in height at the withers and weighing between 12 to 18 pounds. They possess a level of intelligence that makes them quite trainable, and they enjoy participating in various dog sports, such as obedience, agility, and rally. These dogs also have a friendly and outgoing nature, allowing them to get along well with other pets, including dogs and cats, and they tend to thrive in households with children. Bichons are known for their playful, energetic demeanor, and they require regular exercise and mental stimulation to keep them healthy and content. The Bichon Frise's coat requires a fair amount of grooming to maintain its soft, fluffy appearance. Frequent brushing is necessary to prevent matting and tangling, and regular trims or professional grooming every few months will also help to ensure that their coat stays clean and healthy. In summary, the Bichon Frise is a small, friendly, and affectionate dog breed that is known for its white, curly coat and sociable temperament. They are intelligent, trainable, and make excellent companions for families with children and other pets. Their hypoallergenic hair is a bonus for those with allergies or sensitivities to pet dander, making them a popular and lovable choice for many households."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The same jury that convicted Carla Hughes of two counts of murder Tuesday for the death of Avis Banks spared her life, declining to impose the death penalty.

Carla was found guilty and the people in charge said she will have to stay in prison for her entire life. They did not give her the strictest punishment, but she will not be able to leave the prison. This happened in a place called Mississippi, where hurting a pregnant woman is considered a very, very bad thing.

The sentence does not explicitly state whether Gerth is serious or not, but it is merely looking for confirmation or clarification.

To determine if the second sentence is true, given that the first sentence is true, there needs to be a distinction between the sentences.

Since it is impossible to evaluate the second sentence's truth based on the first sentence's truth, we cannot conclude if the second sentence is true or not based on the information given.

They called this \\"camping\\" outside the hospital, even though it's not like the kind of camping you do in the woods with a tent and a campfire. The reporters knew they might have to wait for a very long time, maybe even two whole weeks! To pass the time while they were waiting, they tried to find fun things to do. They talked to each other, played games, and even wrote stories about what it was like to wait for the baby. Once Kate went into labor, which means she started the process of having her baby, the reporters knew they would have to be very alert all day and all night. They didn't want to miss the moment when the baby was finally born. So, all these reporters are still waiting outside the Lindo Wing day and night, hoping to be the first ones to tell the world about the newest member of the royal family. And when the baby is born, they will all be very excited to share the news with everyone who has been waiting for it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have an indirect effect on the process. If there are fewer receptors taking over and reproducing, it will likely result in a slower rate of viral replication. This would, in turn, lead to a reduced number of newly produced virus particles and thus, a slower rate of cell damage. While fewer cells would be impacted overall, the infection would still spread, albeit at a slower pace.

The professor gave Nick but not Logan an A because  Choose from:  + Nick showed poor knowledge of the periodic table of elements..  + Logan showed poor knowledge of the periodic table of elements..","output":"The professor gave Nick but not Logan an A because Logan showed poor knowledge of the periodic table of elements. This became evident during the course of the semester while they were both enrolled in the advanced chemistry class. The professor had high expectations from all the students, and aimed to ensure that everyone gained a deep understanding of the subject. At the beginning of the semester, both Nick and Logan showed enthusiasm and keen interest in learning about the periodic table of elements. They participated in class discussions, submitted assignments on time, and asked relevant questions. However, as the semester progressed, a clear distinction emerged in the performance of the two students. On one hand, Nick consistently demonstrated a strong grasp of the periodic table and its underlying concepts. He could accurately identify the atomic number, mass, and electron configurations of various elements. In addition, Nick could also describe the various trends observed across periods and groups, such as atomic radius and ionization energy, and make insightful connections that underpinned the intrinsic properties of the elements. Nick's exceptional proficiency in this area was not just limited to rote memorization, but a profound understanding of how the periodic table was organized and how the elements interacted with one another. This was particularly evident in his impressive performance in the laboratory, where he accurately predicted the outcomes of various chemical reactions based on his knowledge of the periodic table. In stark contrast, Logan struggled to demonstrate adequate knowledge of the periodic table of elements. Despite his initial interest and dedication, he consistently failed to recall basic information about the elements, such as their symbols and placement on the periodic table. Additionally, he struggled to understand and apply the general trends and patterns observed across groups and periods. Moreover, his lack of understanding made it difficult for him to make connections among the elements, which affected his ability to predict the outcomes of chemical reactions and problem-solving tasks. During lab exercises, Logan often relied on his classmates and written resources to guide him, as his limited knowledge of the periodic table hampered his capability to conduct experiments independently and effectively. As the semester concluded, the professor had no choice but to take into account the evident discrepancies in the performance of the two students. While Nick displayed a comprehensive understanding and impressive mastery of the periodic table of elements, Logan's persistent struggle to grasp its fundamental concepts and principles led to his subpar performance. Consequently, the professor felt it was only fair to award Nick an A for his achievements, while Logan was not given the same grade due to his inadequate grasp of the periodic table of elements. In conclusion, despite their initial enthusiasm and commitment, the different levels of understanding and application of the periodic table of elements led to divergent outcomes for Nick and Logan. While Nick's extensive knowledge and practical application of the concepts earned him an A, Logan's poor knowledge of the periodic table left him trailing behind, ultimately resulting in a lower grade. The professor's decision underscored the importance of a profound knowledge of the periodic table of elements, which is the foundation of chemistry."},{"instruction":"You are given a new situation: Two rivers spring from the same mountain. Olt was a fast moving river, while Mures river was slow moving and deep. Both rivers are very important for the local economies.  and a hint : The major zones in river ecosystems are determined by the river bed's gradient or by the velocity of the current. Faster moving turbulent water typically contains greater concentrations of dissolved oxygen, which supports greater biodiversity than the slow moving water of pools. These distinctions form the basis for the division of rivers into upland and lowland rivers. The food base of streams within riparian forests is mostly derived from the trees, but wider streams and those that lack a canopy derive the majority of their food base from algae. Anadromous fish are also an important source of nutrients. Environmental threats to rivers include loss of water, dams, chemical pollution and introduced species. A dam produces negative effects that continue down the watershed. The most important negative effects are the reduction of spring flooding, which damages wetlands, and the retention of sediment, which leads to loss of deltaic wetlands.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Tom Ford was born on August 27, 1961, in Austin, Texas, the son of realtors Shirley Burton (nee Shirley Ann Thrasher) and Thomas David Ford. He spent his early life in the suburbs of Houston, Texas, and in San Marcos, outside Austin; his family moved to Santa Fe, New Mexico, when he was 11. In Santa Fe, he entered St. Michael's High School and later moved to Santa Fe Preparatory School, from which he graduated in 1979. When interviewing for jobs after graduation, Ford said that he had attended The New School's Parsons division, but concealed that he graduated in architecture, and that his work at Chloe was a low-level public relations position. Despite his lack of experience in fashion, Ford called American designer Cathy Hardwick every day for a month in hopes of securing a job at her sportswear company. Hardwick eventually agreed to interview him. She later recalled the incident: \\"I had every intention of giving him no hope. I asked him who his favorite European designers were. He said, 'Armani and Chanel.' Months later I asked him why he said that, and he said, 'Because you were wearing something Armani'. Is it any wonder he got the job?\\" Ford worked as a design assistant for Hardwick for two years.  In 1988, Ford moved to Perry Ellis, where he knew both Robert McDonald, the company's president, and Marc Jacobs, its designer, socially. He worked at the company for two years, but grew tired of working in American fashion. In a later interview with The New York Times, he commented, \\"If I was ever going to become a good designer, I had to leave America. My own culture was inhibiting me. Too much style in America is tacky. It's looked down upon to be too stylish. Europeans, however, appreciate style.\\"  At the time, Italian fashion house Gucci was struggling financially and was seeking to strengthen its women's ready-to-wear presence as a part of a brand overhaul. The company's creative director, Dawn Mello said, \\"no one would dream of wearing Gucci\\". In 1990, Mello hired Ford as the brand's chief women's ready-to-wear designer and Ford moved to Milan. \\"I was talking to a lot of people, and most didn't want the job,\\" Mello said. \\"For an American designer to move to Italy to join a company that was far from being a brand would have been pretty risky.\\" Ford and his longtime partner, fashion journalist Richard Buckley, relocated to Milan that September.  Ford's role at Gucci rapidly expanded; he was designing menswear within six months, and shoes soon after that. When Richard Lambertson left as design director in 1992, Ford took over his position, heading the brand's ready-to-wear, fragrances, image, advertising, and store design. In 1993, when he was in charge of designing eleven product lines, Ford worked eighteen-hour days. During these years, there were creative tensions between Ford and Maurizio Gucci, the company's chairman and 50% owner. According to Mello, \\"Maurizio always wanted everything to be round and brown, and Tom wanted to make it square and black.\\" Though Maurizio Gucci wanted to fire Ford, Domenico De Sole insisted that he remain. Nonetheless, Ford's work during the early 1990s was primarily behind the scenes; his contributions to Gucci were overshadowed by those of Mello, who was the company's public face.

The word scourge - 'a cause of suffering' - is metaphorically derived from what instrument of punishment?","output":"The word \\"scourge\\" as a metaphor for 'a cause of suffering' is derived from an ancient instrument of punishment called a scourge or a whip. A scourge is a type of whip that consists of multiple lashes or tails that are often knotted and attached to a single handle. It was used predominantly as a tool for inflicting physical punishment, pain, and suffering on people, and occasionally animals, in various societies throughout history. The scourge's reputation as a brutal and agonizing instrument of punishment can be traced back to ancient civilizations such as the Romans and Egyptians. The Roman flagrum, for example, was a particularly vicious version that featured several lashes with metal or bone enhancements, such as balls, hooks, or sharp points. Whipping with a scourge like this was so terrifying that it was often enough to scare people into obedience. This Roman practice of scourging was later adopted in the Medieval Europe, where it became not only a method of punishment for criminals but also a means of self-inflicted penance for religious purposes. The members of various monastic orders, such as the flagellants, would scourge themselves to display humility, atone for sins, or seek divine intervention in times of crisis. The term ‘scourge’ eventually evolved not just to represent the physical instrument itself but also to symbolize anything that caused widespread suffering, affliction, or devastation. When used metaphorically, a scourge can refer to various abstract concepts or entities, such as diseases, natural disasters, oppressive regimes, or any other force that brings about widespread misery and hardship. For instance, the rapid spread of the bubonic plague during the 14th century, which led to the death of an estimated 75-200 million people across Europe and Asia, was often referred to as the \\"Great Scourge.\\" Another example is the use of the term \\"scourge of war\\" to describe the widespread human suffering and devastation caused by military conflicts. In conclusion, the word \\"scourge\\" as a metaphor for 'a cause of suffering' is derived from the instrument of punishment called a scourge or whip. The whip's reputation as a brutal and agonizing tool for inflicting pain and suffering on people throughout history has allowed the term to become synonymous with any force or entity that causes widespread affliction and misery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The wheel must make approximately 265.15 revolutions per minute to keep a speed of 60 km/hour. What is the diameter of the wheel?","output":"To find the diameter of the wheel, we need to determine the distance covered by the car in one minute at a speed of 60 km/hour and then relate it to the number of revolutions the wheel makes in that minute. First, let's convert the speed from km/hour to meters/minute: 60 km/hour = 60,000 meters/hour Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, we divide by 60 to get the distance covered in one minute: 60,000 meters/hour ÷ 60 minutes/hour = 1,000 meters/minute Now, we know that the wheel makes 265.15 revolutions per minute. To find the distance covered in one revolution, we divide the distance covered in one minute by the number of revolutions per minute: 1,000 meters/minute ÷ 265.15 revolutions/minute ≈ 3.772 meters/revolution This distance is the circumference of the wheel, which is the distance covered in one complete revolution. The circumference (C) of a circle is related to its diameter (D) by the formula: C = πD Where π (pi) is approximately 3.14159.

We need to show that the three lines AD, BE, and CF are concurrent if and only if angle ACD=angle BCE.  Necessity: 1. Let angle BAE = angle CAF = alpha, angle ABD = angle CBF = beta, angle ACD = x, and angle BCE = y. 2. Define M, N, K as the intersections of AD, BE, CF with the sides of triangle ABC respectively. 3. By the **Ceva's Theorem**, if AD, BE, CF are concurrent, then:  frac{AK}{KB} cdot frac{BM}{MC} cdot frac{CN}{NA} = 1  4. Write the expression in terms of the areas of triangles formed by D, E, F:  1 = frac{AK}{KB} cdot frac{BM}{MC} cdot frac{CN}{NA} = frac{S_{triangle ACF}}{S_{triangle BCF}} cdot frac{S_{triangle ABD}}{S_{triangle ACD}} cdot frac{S_{triangle BCE}}{S_{triangle ABE}}  Where S_{triangle XYZ} denotes the area of triangle XYZ. 5. Express the areas using products involving the sides and the respective angles:  1 = frac{AC cdot AF cdot sin alpha}{BC cdot BF cdot sin beta} cdot frac{AB cdot BD cdot sin beta}{AC cdot CD cdot sin x} cdot frac{BC cdot CE cdot sin y}{AB cdot AE cdot sin alpha}  6. Simplify the expression above:  1 = frac{AF}{BF} cdot frac{BD}{CD} cdot frac{CE}{AE} cdot frac{sin y}{sin x}  7. Express the ratios using the angles involved:  frac{AF}{BF} = frac{sin (B - beta)}{sin (A - alpha)}, quad frac{BD}{CD} = frac{sin (C - x)}{sin (B - beta)}, quad frac{CE}{AE} = frac{sin (A - alpha)}{sin (C - y)}  8. Substitute these ratios back into the equation:  1 = frac{sin (B - beta)}{sin (A - alpha)} cdot frac{sin (C - x)}{sin (B - beta)} cdot frac{sin (A - alpha)}{sin (C - y)} cdot frac{sin y}{sin x}  9. Simplify further:  1 = frac{sin (C - x)}{sin (C - y)} cdot frac{sin y}{sin x}  10. Thus,  frac{sin (C - x)}{sin x} = frac{sin (C - y)}{sin y} Rightarrow cot x = cot y  11. Since x, y in (0, pi), we deduce (x = y), i.e., angle ACD = angle BCE.  Sufficiency: 1. Assume angle ACD = angle BCE. 2. The steps above can be reversed, utilizing **Ceva's Theorem** in reverse, to establish that AD, BE, and CF are concurrent provided angle ACD = angle BCE holds.

Let's break it down: 1. Start with the given equation:    2cos 2A+4cos left(B+Cright)+3=0 2. Use the identity cos 2A = 2cos^2 A - 1 and cos(pi - A) = -cos A:    2(2cos^2 A - 1) + 4(-cos A) + 3 = 0 3. Simplify the equation:    4cos^2 A - 2 - 4cos A + 3 = 0    4cos^2 A - 4cos A + 1 = 0 4. Recognize this as a quadratic equation in terms of cos A:    (2cos A - 1)^2 = 0 5. Solve for cos A:    cos A = frac{1}{2} 6.

Let the price reduction for each piece of children's clothing be x yuan.  - The new selling price per piece will be 120 - x yuan. - The profit per piece after the reduction will be (120 - x) - 80 = 40 - x yuan. - The number of pieces sold per day increases by 2 for every 1 yuan reduction, so the new quantity sold per day is 20 + 2x pieces. Therefore, with a price reduction of x yuan, the store can sell left(20 + 2xright) pieces per day and make a profit of left(40 - xright) yuan per piece.  Part 2 To find the value of x that results in an average daily profit of 1200 yuan, we set up the equation: [ (20 + 2x)(40 - x) = 1200 ] Expanding and simplifying: [ 800 - 20x + 80x - 2x^2 = 1200 ] [ -2x^2 + 60x - 400 = 0 ] [ x^2 - 30x + 200 = 0 ] Solving this quadratic equation, we find: [ x_1 = 20, quad x_2 = 10 ] Since we aim to increase sales, we choose x = 20.

At the intersection of two walls, there are four corners: two diagonally opposite corners where a red side and a blue side meet, one corner where two red sides meet, and one corner where two blue sides meet. A twoway door connects the two diagonally opposite corners where sides of different colors meet. Knights can walk through doors but cannot walk through walls.  Let k(mathfrak{L}) be the largest number k such that, no matter how the labyrinth is painted, at least k knights can always be placed such that no two knights can ever meet. For each n, what are all possible values for k(mathfrak{L}), where mathfrak{L} is a labyrinth with n walls?","output":"Given the problem, we need to determine the number of ways Morgana can place the maximum number of knights such that no two knights will ever meet, no matter how Merlin paints the labyrinth with n walls. The answer to this problem is that the possible values of k is k = n + 1, where n is the number of walls. Here is the detailed step-by-step solution: 1. **Number of Regions**:     - We demonstrate by induction that the n walls divide the plane into binom{n+1}{2} + 1 regions.     - **Base Case**: For n=0, there are no walls and hence only one region, which is binom{0+1}{2} + 1 = 1.     - **Induction Hypothesis**: Assume it is true for some n=k that k walls create binom{k+1}{2} + 1 regions.     - **Induction Step**: When we add one more wall (n=k+1), it intersects each of the existing k walls exactly once, splitting each of those k regions into two. Thus:     [     text{New number of regions} = left( binom{k+1}{2} + 1 right) + (k+1)     ]     Simplifying:     [     = frac{(k+1)k}{2} + 1 + k + 1 = frac{k^2 + k}{2} + k + 2 = frac{k^2 + 3k + 2}{2} = frac{(k+2)(k+1)}{2} + 1 = binom{(k+2)}{2} + 1     ]     This proves the induction step and confirms that the number of regions created by n walls is binom{n+1}{2} + 1. 2. **Graph Representation**:     - Let G be a graph where vertices represent the regions formed by the walls and two regions (vertices) are connected by an edge if there is a door (intersection point of two differently colored sides) between them.     - At each intersection of two walls, there are binom{n}{2} intersection points, each corresponding to an edge in G. 3. **Connected Components**:     - As we add edges of G sequentially, each edge decreases the number of connected components by at most one.     - Initially, the number of connected components is binom{n+1}{2} + 1 (the number of regions).     - Each edge reduces the number of connected components by at most one:     [     text{Number of connected components} geq binom{n+1}{2} + 1 - binom{n}{2}     ]     Simplifying:     [     = left( frac{(n+1)n}{2} + 1 right) - frac{n(n-1)}{2} = frac{n^2 + n}{2} + 1 - frac{n^2 - n}{2} = 2n + 1     ] 4. **Placing Knights**:     - The minimum number of connected components is n + 1. Therefore, Morgana can place a knight in each connected component, ensuring they will not meet.      5. **Construction to Show Maximum**:     - Merlin can paint the walls such that the number of connected components is no more than n+1.     - For this, Merlin can place walls such that regions between them differ by exactly 1 number of walls. This arrangement ensures proper separation into connected components. 6. **Final Conclusion**:     - As shown by induction and through the construction, the value of k(mathfrak{L}) for n walls can be controlled and maintained at n + 1, no matter how the walls are painted by Merlin. Therefore, the largest number k such that Morgana can always place at least k knights without them ever meeting is n + 1.

Since P can complete 1/3 of the job in one hour, we can set up the following equation to find the time (t) it takes for P to finish 1/5 of the job: 1/3 * t = 1/5 To solve for t, we multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 1/3, which is 3: t = (1/5) * 3 t = 3/5 hours To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes per hour: t = (3/5) * 60 minutes t = 36 minutes Therefore, it will take P an additional boxed{36}  minutes to finish the job, working alone at his constant rate."},{"instruction":"A line that does not intersect with the graph of the function y=tan(2x+frac{pi}{4}) is (　　) A: x=frac{pi}{2} B: x=frac{pi}{4} C: x=frac{pi}{8} D: x=frac{pi}{2}","output":"Let 2x+frac{pi}{4}=kpi+frac{pi}{2}, where kin mathbb{Z}.

The scoop is centered at a random point inside a cube (0 leq x, y, z leq 1). We will consider how this scoop intersects with the multiple unit cubes formed by these planes.  Steps: 1. **Cubes Directly Intersected by the Sphere Center:**     - The cube that contains the center of the sphere is always intersected. This also applies to the 6 cubes adjacent to this central cube (sharing a face with it).     - Therefore, the central cube and these 6 face-adjacent cubes total to 7 cubes. 2. **Edge-Adjacent Cubes:**     - The next type of cubes to consider are the ones edge-adjacent to the central cube. For an edge-adjacent cube to be intersected, the center of the sphere must be within 1 unit of the edge.     - There are 12 such edge-adjacent cubes surrounding the central cube.     - The probability that the center of the sphere is within 1 unit of an edge of the cube is (frac{pi}{4}) because it covers the cylindrical volume formed by the radius of the sphere intersecting the cube edge.     - Thus, the contribution from these edge-adjacent cubes is (12 cdot frac{pi}{4} = 3pi). 3. **Corner-Adjacent Cubes:**     - Finally, there are cubes that are corner-adjacent to the central cube. These cubes are intersected if the sphere’s center lies within 1 unit of a corner of the central cube.     - There are 8 such corner-adjacent cubes.     - The probability that the center of the sphere is within 1 unit of a corner of the cube is (frac{pi}{6}), as it involves spherical caps touching the cube corners.     - Hence, the contribution from these corner-adjacent cubes is (8 cdot frac{pi}{6} = frac{4pi}{3}).

Let's examine why this function fits the given condition, albeit with a slight misunderstanding in the interpretation of the increase of y with respect to x. 1. Consider the function y = -frac{1}{x}.  2. To see how y changes as x increases, we look at the derivative of y with respect to x: frac{dy}{dx} = frac{1}{x^2}. 3.

Given the misunderstanding in the interpretation, the function y = -frac{1}{x} does not strictly satisfy the condition that y increases as x increases for x > 1 in the conventional sense (where we expect the function to move upwards as we move to the right).

Specifically, we need to show:    [    sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{[a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k]} < 4    ]    where ([a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k]) denotes the LCM of the integers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k). 2. **Key insight**: The LCM of (k) distinct positive integers is at least (frac{k^2}{4}). This is derived from the properties of divisors and the divisor function (tau(n)). 3. **Divisor function (tau(n))**: The number of divisors of a number (n) is denoted by (tau(n)). For any positive integer (n), (tau(n) leq 2sqrt{n}).

Therefore:    [    k leq tau(M) leq 2sqrt{M}    ]    Solving for (M), we get:    [    k leq 2sqrt{M} implies sqrt{M} geq frac{k}{2} implies M geq left(frac{k}{2}right)^2 = frac{k^2}{4}    ] 5. **Bounding the sum**: Using the inequality (M geq frac{k^2}{4}), we have:    [    frac{1}{[a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k]} leq frac{4}{k^2}    ]    Therefore, the sum can be bounded as follows:    [    sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{[a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k]} leq sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{4}{k^2}    ] 6. **Evaluating the series**: The series (sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{4}{k^2}) is a well-known series. For large (n), it converges to a value less than 4. Specifically:    [    sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{1}{k^2} = frac{pi^2}{6} approx 1.64493    ]    Thus:    [    sum_{k=1}^{infty} frac{4}{k^2} = 4 cdot frac{pi^2}{6} approx 4 cdot 1.64493 = 2.6298    ]    Since the series converges to a value less than 4, the partial sum for any finite (n) will also be less than 4. 7. **Conclusion**: Therefore, we have shown that:    [    sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{[a_1, a_2, ldots, a_k]} < 4    ]    for any positive integer (n).

The number of ways to arrange (n) objects (where repetitions are allowed) into (n) boxes is (n^n). This is because each of the n boxes has n choices of which ball type to contain. 3. **Double counting using combinations**: We can also count the number of ways using different combination principles. We can represent placing a ball numbered (j) into box (i) as (i, j). Let's denote the set of all such pairs (i, j) by points. There are n times n = n^2 such points (i, j) since both (i) and (j) can take n different values. 4. **Counting valid configurations**: To validate the configurations ensuring each box has exactly one ball, consider the following exclusion-inclusion principle: - There are (C_n^n = binom{n}{n} = 1) ways of placing balls ensuring each box gets one ball. - Subtract configurations where one box is not included, i.e., pick 1 box out of (n) and count valid configurations for the remaining (n-1) boxes:    [ C_n^1 times C_{(n-1) times n}^n ] - Add configurations where two boxes are not included, i.e., pick 2 boxes from (n):   [ C_n^2 times C_{(n-2) times n}^n ] - Continue this up until all n boxes (in the pattern). 5. **Using Exclusion-Inclusion principle**: Thus, we can write the equation: [ (-1)^0 C_n^0 C_{(n-0) n}^n - (-1)^1 C_n^1 C_{(n-1)n}^n + (-1)^2 C_n^2 C_{(n-2)n}^n - cdots + (-1)^n C_n^n C_{(n-n)n}^n = n^n ] Rearrange this: [ n^n = sum_{k=0}^{n} (-1)^{k} C_n^k C_{(n-k) n}^n ] 6. **Equating to given condition**: Given ( C_{n}^{*} = C_{n}^{n-k} ), we notice the given sum is actually the same but starts from k=1 with an additional negative sign: [ sum_{k=1}^{n} (-1)^{k-1} C_{n}^{k} C_{m}^{n} = (-1)^{n+1} n^n ] Therefore, the given equation: [ C_{n}^{1} C_{n}^{n}-C_{n}^{2} C_{2 n}^{n}+cdots+(-1)^{n+1} C_{n}^{n} C_{m}^{n}=(-1)^{n+1} cdot n^{n} ] holds true, showing as coefficient sums to  (-1)^{n+1} n^n.

To determine the probability that the product of the two numbers on the top of the dice is prime, we first need to understand the conditions under which the product of two numbers is prime. A product of two numbers is prime if and only if one of the numbers is 1 and the other number is a prime number. This is because a prime number has exactly two distinct positive divisors: 1 and itself. 2. The prime numbers less than or equal to 6 (the numbers on a six-sided die) are 2, 3, and 5. Therefore, the possible prime numbers that can appear on the dice are 2, 3, and 5. 3. For each prime number, there are two possible scenarios: the prime number can appear on the first die and 1 on the second die, or the prime number can appear on the second die and 1 on the first die. This gives us a total of 2 choices for each prime number. 4. Since there are 3 prime numbers (2, 3, and 5), and each prime number can appear in 2 different ways (as described in step 3), the total number of favorable outcomes is:    [    2 times 3 = 6    ] 5. The total number of possible outcomes when rolling two six-sided dice is:    [    6 times 6 = 36    ] 6.

Substituting the coordinates of point P(3, -2) into this equation, we get: [ dfrac{3}{a} + dfrac{-2}{-a} = 1 implies dfrac{3}{a} + dfrac{2}{a} = 1 implies dfrac{5}{a} = 1 ] Solving for a, we find: [ a = 5 ] Thus, substituting a = 5 back into the equation, we obtain: [ dfrac{x}{5} - dfrac{y}{5} = 1 implies x - y - 5 = 0 ] **Case 2: The intercepts are equal to 0.** In this scenario, the slope of the line can be determined using the slope formula, given by dfrac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}.

The area of triangle ABC, S_{triangle ABC}, can be expressed as: [S_{triangle ABC} = frac{1}{2}absin C = frac{1}{2} cdot frac{2sqrt{2}cos A}{cos B} cdot sqrt{2} cdot sin(A+B)] [= frac{2cos A}{cos B} cdot sin(A+B) = frac{2cos A}{cos B} cdot (sin Acos B + cos Asin B)] [= 2sin Acos A + 2tan Bcos^2 A = 2sin Acos A + tan Acos^2 A] [= 2sin Acos A + sin Acos A = 3sin Acos A = frac{3}{2}sin 2A.] 4. The area is maximized when 2A = frac{pi}{2}, implying A = frac{pi}{4}. At this angle, tan A = 1 and tan B = frac{1}{2}. This also means sin B = frac{sqrt{5}}{5}. 5. Using the Law of Sines again, we find frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}. Substituting the values, we get: [a = frac{bsin A}{sin B} = frac{sqrt{2} times frac{sqrt{2}}{2}}{frac{sqrt{5}}{5}} = sqrt{5}.] Therefore, the value of a when the area of triangle ABC is at its maximum is boxed{sqrt{5}}."},{"instruction":"f alpha is an acute angle and tan alpha = 1, then the value of cos alpha is: A: frac{1}{2} B: frac{sqrt{2}}{2} C: frac{sqrt{3}}{2} D: 1","output":"Given that tan alpha = 1, we can deduce the value of alpha and subsequently find cos alpha. 1. Since tan alpha = 1, we know that alpha corresponds to an angle where the opposite side and adjacent side of a right triangle are equal. This condition is met by a 45^{circ} angle in a right-angled isosceles triangle. Therefore, we have:    tan alpha = 1 implies alpha = 45^{circ}. 2. Knowing alpha = 45^{circ}, we can find cos alpha using the trigonometric identity for a 45^{circ} angle in a right triangle, where the lengths of the two shorter sides are equal. The cosine of an angle in a right triangle is the length of the adjacent side divided by the length of the hypotenuse. For a 45^{circ}-45^{circ}-90^{circ} triangle, the sides are in the ratio 1:1:sqrt{2}, which means:    cos 45^{circ} = frac{1}{sqrt{2}} = frac{sqrt{2}}{2}.

This is represented by the shaded area in the following figure: ![](https://i.imgur.com/jRxjMdM.png) The probability that Mr. Zhang will take one of the first three buses is equal to the ratio of the shaded area to the total area.

Therefore, the probability that Mr. Zhang will take one of the first three buses is: P = frac{frac{1}{2} times 20 times (60 - x)}{1200} = frac{1}{12} times (60 - x) Since x is a random variable uniformly distributed between 7:00 and 7:20, the expected value of x is 7:10, or 430 minutes after midnight.

To do this, we look at the discriminant Delta of the quadratic equation x^2 - 2kx - 1 = 0. The discriminant Delta is given by Delta = b^2 - 4ac, where a = 1, b = -2k, and c = -1. Substituting these values into the formula for Delta, we get: [ Delta = (-2k)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (-1) = 4k^2 + 4. ] Since 4k^2 is always non-negative for any real number k, and adding 4 to it makes it strictly positive, we have: [ Delta = 4k^2 + 4 > 0. ] This positive discriminant Delta > 0 implies that the quadratic equation has two distinct real roots. Therefore, the graph of the quadratic function intersects the x-axis at two points, regardless of the value of k.  Part 2: Finding the Intersection Points with the x-axis Given that the axis of symmetry of the graph is the y-axis, the coefficient of x in the vertex form of the quadratic equation must be 0. This means that the term involving k must be nullified, leading to -frac{-2k}{2 cdot 1} = 0. Solving for k gives us k = 0. Substituting k = 0 into the original equation, we get the simplified quadratic function: [ y = x^2 - 1. ] To find the points of intersection with the x-axis, we set y = 0 and solve for x: [ x^2 - 1 = 0 implies x^2 = 1 implies x = pm 1. ] Therefore, the points of intersection with the x-axis are (1, 0) and (-1, 0).

Thus, the x part of the equation changes from (x-1) to (x-1+2), leading to the intermediate equation y=2(x-1+2)^2+3. 2. **Shift 1 unit down**: This operation affects the y-coordinate. To shift the graph down by 1 unit, we subtract 1 from the y part of the equation. Therefore, the intermediate equation y=2(x-1+2)^2+3 becomes y=2(x-1+2)^2+3-1 after this downward shift.

Given that the sum of the first two terms is 10, we can write this as: [a_1 + a_2 = a_1 + a_1 cdot r = 10] Substituting the given common ratio r = -3, we get: [a_1 + a_1 cdot (-3) = 10] [a_1 - 3a_1 = 10] [-2a_1 = 10] Solving for a_1, we find: [a_1 = frac{10}{-2}] [a_1 = -5] Now, to find the third term a_3, we use the formula for the nth term of a geometric sequence: [a_3 = a_1 cdot r^{3-1}] [a_3 = -5 cdot (-3)^2] [a_3 = -5 cdot 9] [a_3 = -45] Therefore, the third term of this geometric sequence is boxed{-45}, which corresponds to choice boxed{D}."},{"instruction":"Given two sequences, each containing 150 numbers:   2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, …, 2•(1501)+2;   3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, …, 3•(1501)+3.

Hence, D is the midpoint of NA'.    - Given that M is the midpoint of A'A and N is the midpoint of NC', quadrilateral MA'NC' is a parallelogram with M and N its midpoints, making D lie on NC'. 4. **Cyclic quadrilateral**:    - Consider triangles triangle NC'C and triangle A'MN.

Therefore, the coordinates of A and B are A(2,0) and B(0,2), respectively. As the circle is symmetric about the x-axis and y-axis, the tangent line MN to the circle at the point of tangency with the circle will be perpendicular to the radius at that point. Therefore, OC perp MN at the point of tangency. When OC perp MN, |MN| will be at its minimum because any other position of MN would result in a longer line segment due to the properties of a right triangle (the hypotenuse is always longer than either of the two other sides). The minimum length of MN is twice the length of the horizontal segment from C to the point where OC perp MN. This distance can be calculated using the coordinates of C(1,1) and the concept of the 45-45-90 right triangle (formed by A, C, and the point of tangency). In a 45-45-90 triangle, the legs are equal, and each leg is sqrt{2} times less than the length of the hypotenuse, which in this case is the radius (1).

To solve this problem, we first need to establish a representation for the elements in the 10 times 10 grid. Each number in the grid can be represented systematically in such a way that we respect the placement of numbers from 1 to 100 in consecutive order. Let's denote numbers in the i-th row and j-th column as follows:    [    a_{ij} = 10(i-1) + j    ]    where (i) ranges from 1 to 10 (rows) and (j) ranges from 1 to 10 (columns). 2.

This can also be done in (n!) ways.    - The reason for the independent sequences is that each distinct arrangement of men and women determines a unique set of pairs. 5. **Assigning Pairs to Positions:**    Once we have (n) pairs formed, we can place these pairs in (n) specific position sets ({{1, n+1}, {2, n+2}, ldots, {n, 2n}}). There are (n!) ways to assign (n) pairs to these (n) position sets. 6. **Swappings within Pairs:**    For each pair of one woman and one man, either can occupy the original or opposite position. This means for each pair we independently have 2 choices:    - The woman in the first position and the man opposite.    - The man in the first position and the woman opposite.    Since there are (n) pairs, and each pair can be swapped, we have (2^n) possible ways to determine these internal positions. 7. **Combining the Factors:**    - Permutations of women: (n!)    - Permutations of men: (n!)    - Assigning pairs to position sets: (n!)    - Swapping within pairs: (2^n)    Therefore, the total number of valid starting arrangements is given by:    [    n! cdot n! cdot n! cdot 2^n = (n!)^2 cdot 2^n    ] # Conclusion: There are (boxed{(n!)^2 cdot 2^n}) possible starting line-ups ensuring at least (n-1) women on the pitch at any rotation step."},{"instruction":"Find all values of x such that [3^x + 4^x + 5^x = 6^x.]","output":"To find all values of x that satisfy the equation [3^x + 4^x + 5^x = 6^x,] we first observe that x = 3 is a solution since [3^3 + 4^3 + 5^3 = 27 + 64 + 125 = 216 = 6^3.] To prove this is the only solution, we divide both sides of the original equation by 6^x to obtain [frac{3^x}{6^x} + frac{4^x}{6^x} + frac{5^x}{6^x} = 1.] Simplifying the fractions using the property a^m / a^n = a^{m-n}, we get [left( frac{1}{2} right)^x + left( frac{2}{3} right)^x + left( frac{5}{6} right)^x = 1.] Let's define a function f(x) as [f(x) = left( frac{3}{6} right)^x + left( frac{4}{6} right)^x + left( frac{5}{6} right)^x.] This simplifies to [f(x) = left( frac{1}{2} right)^x + left( frac{2}{3} right)^x + left( frac{5}{6} right)^x.] We note that each term in f(x) decreases as x increases because the bases of the exponents are all less than 1.

Dividing the entire equation by x^2 yields: [x^2 + 2px + 1 + frac{2p}{x} + frac{1}{x^2} = 0.] Introducing a substitution y = x + frac{1}{x}, we can rewrite the equation as: [y^2 = x^2 + 2 + frac{1}{x^2}.] This simplifies the equation to: [y^2 - 2 + 2py + 1 = 0,] which further simplifies to: [y^2 + 2py - 1 = 0.] Solving for p gives us: [p = frac{1 - y^2}{2y}.] For x being negative, by the AM-GM inequality, we have: [y = x + frac{1}{x} le -2.] This leads to an inequality involving p: [frac{1 - y^2}{2y} - frac{3}{4} = -frac{(y + 2)(2y - 1)}{4y} ge 0.] Therefore, we have: [p = frac{1 - y^2}{2y} ge frac{3}{4}.] However, if y = -2, then x + frac{1}{x} = -2, which implies x^2 + 2x + 1 = 0, yielding a single negative root x = -1. This does not meet the condition of having at least two distinct negative roots. Thus, y < -2, and consequently, p > frac{3}{4}. On the other hand, if we assume p > frac{3}{4}, applying the quadratic formula to y^2 + 2py - 1 = 0 gives: [y = -p pm sqrt{p^2 + 1}.] Since p > frac{3}{4}, we find that: [-p - sqrt{p^2 + 1} < -2.] This implies that one of the possible values of y is less than -2.

Using the hockey-stick identity (or Christmas stocking theorem) in combinatorics, we have:    [    sum_{k=3}^{n} binom{k}{3} = binom{n+1}{4}    ]    Applying this identity, we get:    [    sum_{k=3}^{2001} binom{k}{3} = binom{2002}{4}    ]    and:    [    sum_{k=3}^{20} binom{k}{3} = binom{21}{4}    ] 6. Subtracting these, we find:    [    sum_{k=21}^{2001} binom{k}{3} = binom{2002}{4} - binom{21}{4}    ] 7. Therefore, the original sum (S) becomes:    [    S = 6 left( binom{2002}{4} - binom{21}{4} right)    ] 8.

What are those values of ( k ) for which it is possible to color the small cubes with two colors in such a way that each small cube has exactly two neighbors of the same color? (Two small cubes are considered neighbors if they share a face.)","output":"1. First, let's examine why (k) must be even for the desired coloring to exist.      We use a 3D coordinate system with unit vectors (mathbf{i}), (mathbf{j}), and (mathbf{k}) parallel to the edges of the small cubes. From the center of each cube, we draw vectors to the centers of its adjacent cubes that have the same color. Each of these vectors is either equal to or opposite one of the unit vectors. If there is a vector from the center of cube (O_1) to the center of cube (O_2), there must also be a vector from (O_2) back to (O_1). Therefore, the sum of all vectors among the (k^3) cubes must be the zero vector:     [     a_1 mathbf{i} + a_2 mathbf{j} + a_3 mathbf{k} + b_1 (-mathbf{i}) + b_2 (-mathbf{j}) + b_3 (-mathbf{k}) = mathbf{0}     ]     where (a_1, a_2, a_3, b_1, b_2, b_3) represent the number of cubes from which vectors in the directions (mathbf{i}, mathbf{j}, mathbf{k}, -mathbf{i}, -mathbf{j}, -mathbf{k}) respectively, are drawn. This results in the equation:     [     (a_1 - b_1) mathbf{i} + (a_2 - b_2) mathbf{j} + (a_3 - b_3) mathbf{k} = mathbf{0}     ]     This equality holds if and only if (a_1 = b_1), (a_2 = b_2), and (a_3 = b_3). Thus, we get the relation:     [     k^3 = 2(a_1 + a_2 + a_3)     ]     which implies (k^3) is even, meaning (k) itself must be even. Hence, (k) being even is a necessary condition. 2. Now let's construct a valid coloring for even (k). Let (k = 2l), where (l) is an integer. Consider an array of small cubes arranged in a (2l times 2l times 1) block.

By stacking these (2l times 2l times 1) blocks with alternating layers, where the top layer's cubes above (A) cubes are (B) cubes and vice-versa, we ensure that each cube in the stack has two adjacent cubes on its sides of the same color while the cubes directly above and below it are of the opposite color.

Each of the 2 werewolves in his pack eats 5 people a week, so 2 * 5 = 10 people a week. The ghost feeds on the energy of 2 people per week. Now, let's add these numbers together to find the total number of people consumed per week: Lead vampire: 5 people/week Vampire group: 15 people/week (3 vampires * 5 people) Alpha werewolf: 7 people/week Werewolf pack: 10 people/week (2 werewolves * 5 people) Ghost: 2 people/week Total consumed per week = 5 + 15 + 7 + 10 + 2 = 39 people/week Now, we divide the total number of people in the village by the total number of people consumed per week to find out how many weeks the village will last: 200 people / 39 people/week ≈ 5.13 weeks Since you can't have a fraction of a week in this context, the village will last for boxed{5}  full weeks before the population is completely consumed."},{"instruction":"There is a regular tetrahedron with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 written on its four faces.

Since angle APB = 100^circ and angle BPD = 100^circ, we know that angle DPC = angle CPB = angle BPD (as angle BPD spans half of BC due to its equidistant property from D). 6. **Sum of angles in quadrilateral**:    [    angle BPB + angle BPC + angle CPD + angle PDB = 360^circ    ]    We note that angle BPD = 100^circ, and since it repeats as angle CPB:    [     angle BPC = 360^circ - 2 times 100^circ = 160^circ    ]    Conclusion: 160^circ.

Therefore, no even ( n ) can satisfy the condition as it will have at least one even digit in ( n^2 ). 3. **Check Numbers Divisible by 5**:    If ( n ) is odd and divisible by 5, then ( n = 10k + 5 ) for some integer ( k geq 0 ). Consider ( n^2 ):    [    n^2 = (10k + 5)^2 = 100k^2 + 100k + 25    ]    Here, the second-to-last digit of ( n^2 ) is given by 2 (from the term 25).

Rearrange the terms:    [    x^3 + 3xy(x + y) + y^3 - 1 = 3xy(x + y - 1)    ] 4. Factor the left-hand side:    [    (x + y)^3 - 1 = 3xy(x + y - 1)    ] 5. Factor the difference of cubes:    [    (x + y - 1)((x + y)^2 + (x + y) + 1) = 3xy(x + y - 1)    ] 6. Simplify the equation:    [    (x + y - 1)((x - y)^2 + (x + 1)^2 + (y + 1)^2) = 0    ] 7. From the above equation, we have two cases:    - (x + y = 1)    - ((x, y) = (-1, -1)) 8. The curve consists of the line (x + y = 1) and the point ((-1, -1)). 9. To form an equilateral triangle with vertices (A, B, C) on the curve, one vertex must be ((-1, -1)) and the other two vertices must lie on the line (x + y = 1). 10.

The total cost of the pencils is the number of pencils multiplied by the average price of a pencil. Since there are 75 pencils and each pencil costs 2.00, the total cost for the pencils is: Total cost of pencils = 75 pencils * 2.00/pencil = 150 The total cost of the pens is the number of pens multiplied by the average price of a pen.

Combining these, we get:    [    N(n) = A cdot 3^n + B cdot 2^n    ] 8. **Determine constants ( A ) and ( B ):**    Using the initial condition ( N(1) = 4 ):    [    4 = A cdot 3^1 + B cdot 2^1    ]    [    4 = 3A + 2B    ]    Using the second condition ( N(2) = 14 ):    [    14 = A cdot 3^2 + B cdot 2^2    ]    [    14 = 9A + 4B    ]    Solving these equations:    [    3A + 2B = 4    ]    [    9A + 4B = 14    ]    Multiply the first equation by 2:    [    6A + 4B = 8    ]    Subtract the first equation from the second:    [    (9A + 4B) - (6A + 4B) = 14 - 8    ]    [    3A = 6    ]    [    A = 2    ]    Substitute ( A = 2 ) back into the first equation:    [    3(2) + 2B = 4    ]    [    6 + 2B = 4    ]    [    2B = -2    ]    [    B = -1    ]    Thus, the closed form is:    [    N(n) = 2 cdot 3^n - 2^n    ] The final answer is ( boxed{2 cdot 3^n - 2^n} )."},{"instruction":"The number  16^4+16^2+1  is divisible by four distinct prime numbers.

Notice that (16 = 2^4), so we can rewrite the expression in terms of powers of 2:    [    16^4 + 16^2 + 1 = (2^4)^4 + (2^4)^2 + 1 = 2^{16} + 2^8 + 1    ] 2. Next, we recognize that (2^{16} + 2^8 + 1) can be factored using the sum of cubes formula. Recall that (a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a+b+c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - bc - ca)) when (a + b + c = 0). However, in this case, we use a different approach:    [    2^{16} + 2^8 + 1 = (2^8 + 1)^2 - (2^4)^2    ] 3. We recognize this as a difference of squares:    [    (2^8 + 1)^2 - (2^4)^2 = (2^8 + 1 + 2^4)(2^8 + 1 - 2^4)    ] 4. Simplify the factors:    [    2^8 = 256, quad 2^4 = 16    ]    [    2^8 + 1 = 257, quad 2^8 + 1 + 2^4 = 257 + 16 = 273, quad 2^8 + 1 - 2^4 = 257 - 16 = 241    ] 5. Thus, we have:    [    2^{16} + 2^8 + 1 = 273 times 241    ] 6. Now, we factorize 273 and 241:    [    273 = 3 times 7 times 13    ]    [    241 text{ is a prime number}    ] 7. Therefore, the prime factors of (16^4 + 16^2 + 1) are (3, 7, 13,) and (241). 8.

To demonstrate this, consider any (i neq l):     [     f^+(X_i) = sum_{x in X_i} f^+(x) = sum_{x in X_i cap X_l} (f(x) + 1) + sum_{x in X_i setminus X_l} f(x)     ]     [     f^+(X_i) = sum_{x in X_i} f(x) + |X_i cap X_l|     ]     For (i = l):     [     f^+(X_l) = sum_{x in X_l} f^+(x) = sum_{x in X_l} (f(x) + 1) = sum_{x in X_l} f(x) + |X_l|     ]     [     f^+(X_l) = f(X_l) + |X_l|     ] 5.

By reflecting triangle (MNC) over (MN) so that it coincides with (MKB), we form the parallelogram (ANKB) (Refer to Fig. 1 in the problem). 4. If (AN = AB), the rhombus is already formed. This occurs because in this configuration each side of the parallelogram is equal, satisfying the properties of the rhombus. 5. Assume (AN < AB) (Refer to Fig. 2 in the problem). Let’s draw a circle centered at (A) with radius (AB). Since (N) lies inside the circle and (M) outside the circle, the circle intersects the segment (NM) at point (P). 6.

A: If alpha parallel beta, then m perpendicular n B: If alpha perpendicular beta, then m parallel n C: If m perpendicular n, then alpha parallel beta D: If n parallel alpha, then alpha parallel beta","output":"Option A asserts that if alpha parallel beta, then m perpendicular n. From the given information, we know that m perpendicular alpha. If alpha parallel beta, it follows that m is perpendicular to beta because if a line is perpendicular to a plane, it is also perpendicular to all lines in that plane that are parallel to the original plane. Since n is a line in beta, this implies that m perpendicular n. Thus, the statement in Option A is correct. We can dismiss Options B, C, and D based on the following reasoning: - Option B suggests m parallel n if alpha perpendicular beta, but there is no necessary relationship between the line m and any line in the perpendicular plane beta. - Option C claims that if m perpendicular n, then alpha parallel beta. However, m being perpendicular to n doesn't necessarily mean the planes have to be parallel. - Option D implies that if n parallel alpha, then alpha parallel beta.

This is an arithmetic series where the first term a_1 is 30, the last term a_n is 50, and the number of terms n can be found by the formula n = (a_n - a_1)/d + 1, where d is the common difference, which is 1 in this case since we are dealing with consecutive integers. So, n = (50 - 30)/1 + 1 = 20 + 1 = 21. The sum of an arithmetic series can be found by the formula S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n), where S_n is the sum of the first n terms. So, x = S_n = 21/2 * (30 + 50) = 21/2 * 80 = 21 * 40 = 840. Next, let's find the value of y, which is the number of even integers from 30 to 50, inclusive. The even integers in this range start at 30 and end at 50, and they occur every other number. So we can find the number of even integers by dividing the range by 2. The number of even integers y = (50 - 30)/2 + 1 = 20/2 + 1 = 10 + 1 = 11. Now, we can find the value of x + y: x + y = 840 + 11 = 851.
