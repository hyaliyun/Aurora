Substance D, a powerful and dangerous drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted.

Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor abandoned his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris.

Write the answer: What make of car was founded in 1963 in a tractor factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, and is now a subsidiary of Volkswagen?","output":"The make of car that was founded in 1963 in a tractor factory in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, and is now a subsidiary of Volkswagen is Automobili Lamborghini S.p.A., commonly known as Lamborghini. Lamborghini was the brainchild of its founder, Ferruccio Lamborghini, who was an Italian industrialist with a passion for engineering and automobiles. Before venturing into the automotive industry, Ferruccio was successful in his tractor manufacturing business, Lamborghini Trattori. The legend goes that Ferruccio, an owner of high-end sports cars, including Ferraris, was not entirely satisfied with certain aspects of his vehicles. Motivated by the ambition to create a perfect grand tourer, he decided to establish his own car manufacturing company. The foundation of Lamborghini as a car manufacturer was laid in a tractor factory located in a small Northern Italian village, Sant'Agata Bolognese, in 1963. The brand's emblem, the Raging Bull, was inspired by Ferruccio's zodiac sign, Taurus (the bull), and his interest in the Spanish culture and tradition of bullfighting. The logo symbolizes power, strength, and resilience, all attributes that Lamborghini models exhibit. Lamborghini's very first production car, the 350GT, was launched in 1964. It was well-received and followed by iconic models like the Miura, Espada, Jarama, and Urraco. In 1974, they released the attention-grabbing Lamborghini Countach, which exemplified the brand's commitment to cutting-edge design and elite performance capabilities. Over the years, Lamborghini experienced numerous ups and downs in the business world. It went through bankruptcy, a series of ownership changes, and challenges stemming from the oil crisis in the 1970s. The ownership of the company changed hands several times between the Mimran brothers, Chrysler, and finally the Indonesian company Megatech.  In 1998, the Volkswagen Group stepped in and acquired Lamborghini under their Audi brand. Being a subsidiary of Volkswagen, Lamborghini has witnessed significant growth, financial stability, and access to advanced engineering technology. Today, it has established itself as an elite and high-performance luxury sports car manufacturer, known for its avant-garde designs, precision engineering, and state-of-the-art technologies. Some of the most recent and celebrated models launched under Volkswagen's ownership include the Lamborghini Gallardo, Murciélago, Aventador, Huracán, and the Urus SUV. These automobiles showcase the brand's excellence in performance, distinctive design language, and engineering expertise, securing Lamborghini's position as a leader in the luxury sports car market. In conclusion, Lamborghini's journey from a tractor manufacturing unit in Sant'Agata Bolognese, Italy, to becoming a prestigious subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group is a testament to the brand's persistence, dedication to quality, and love for automotive innovation. With a rich history and present-day success, Lamborghini remains a symbol of luxury, performance, and exclusivity in the automotive world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We hear of him at a dinner given by his countryman, Isaac Bickerstaff, author of Love in a Village, Lionel and Clarissa, and other successful dramatic pieces. The dinner was to be followed by the reading by Bickerstaff of a new play. Among the guests was one Paul Hiffernan, likewise an Irishman; somewhat idle and intemperate; who lived nobody knew how nor where, sponging wherever he had a chance, and often of course upon Goldsmith, who was ever the vagabond's friend, or rather victim. Hiffernan was something of a physician, and elevated the emptiness of his purse into the dignity of a disease, which he termed _impecuniosity_, and against which he claimed a right to call for relief from the healthier purses of his friends. He was a scribbler for the newspapers, and latterly a dramatic critic, which had probably gained him an invitation to the dinner and reading. The wine and wassail, however, befogged his senses. Scarce had the author got into the second act of his play, when Hiffernan began to nod, and at length snored outright. Bickerstaff was embarrassed, but continued to read in a more elevated tone. The louder he read, the louder Hiffernan snored; until the author came to a pause. \\"Never mind the brute, Bick, but go on,\\" cried Goldsmith. \\"He would have served Homer just so if he were here and reading his own works.\\"  1.

The text infers that Hiffernan was indeed somewhat inebriated, as the wine at the gathering befogged his senses. 13. Being in a state of drunken lethargy caused Hiffernan to begin nodding off, eventually loudly snoring during the reading of Bickerstaff's play. 14.

Answer:","output":"The last step of the process is photosynthesis, during which the plant converts carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into glucose (sugar) and oxygen. This occurs within the chloroplasts of the plant cells, where the pigment chlorophyll captures energy from sunlight. The chemical reaction can be represented as follows: 6 CO2 (carbon dioxide) + 6 H2O (water) + light energy → C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 (oxygen) The glucose produced serves as an energy source for the plant's growth, and the oxygen is released back into the atmosphere as a byproduct."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It tells the story of Collegiate Assessor Kovalyov, who one day wakes up to find that his nose has mysteriously gone missing, only to later encounter it living an independent life disguised as a high-ranking official. Step 2: Analyze main themes and symbols There are a few key themes and symbols in \\"The Nose\\" that can be related to cultural values. These include absurdity, social hierarchy and status, appearances, and bureaucracy. Step 3: Relate themes to Russian cultural values From the themes mentioned above, the cultural value that stands out in the story is the emphasis on social hierarchy and status within the Russian society of that time. Gogol satirizes the obsession with social standing by depicting how characters interact based on their ranks and positions in society. For example, Kovalyov feels humiliated and uncomfortable when he cannot present himself properly due to the absence of his nose. The nose itself adopts a high-ranking position as a state councilor, further highlighting the absurdity of social hierarchies and artificial importance placed on them. Step 4: Conclusion In conclusion, \\"The Nose\\" represents the value of social hierarchy and status in Russian culture during that period. Through the use of satire and absurdity, Gogol criticizes the arbitrariness of social standings and the superficial nature of interactions between individuals based solely on their positions within the hierarchy. This can be considered as a reflection of the societal values and attitudes in Russia at the time that Gogol was writing."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is because understanding Alex's requirements helps Skylar create a customized and effective filing system. To proceed with this task, Skylar should consider the following steps: 1. Discuss with Alex: Begin by asking Alex about his experiences and struggles in organizing tax documents. Identify his priorities, preferences, and the scope of documents he deals with. 2. Research tax document categories: It's essential to have a basic understanding of the different types of tax documents, such as W-2s, 1099s, and receipts for deductions. This knowledge will help categorize and sort the documents in an organized manner. 3. Determine the organization method: Evaluate the use and frequency of accessing specific documents and decide on a suitable method for organizing them. It could be chronological, alphabetical, or based on document type. 4. Assess available storage space: Analyze the available space in Alex's office or home to determine the most appropriate storage system. This system could be a filing cabinet, binders, or digital storage. Depending on the space and type of documents, it's essential to select a fitting storage solution that allows easy access and retrieval. 5. Think about the long-term: Tax documents need to be stored for several years, so the filing system must be adaptable to accommodate new documents and handle changes in tax laws and requirements. It should also be designed with security in mind – protecting sensitive documents from potential theft, damage, or loss. Once Skylar has a thorough understanding of Alex's needs, he can create a tailored filing system, making it easier for Alex to manage and store his tax documents. This efficient system will ultimately save time, minimize stress, and ensure that Alex's records are properly maintained and available when needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This hospital had stood the test of time and was once considered an institution of great importance. The rustic, ivy-laden walls of the hospital bore witness to the countless stories of healing, growth, and even despair that unfolded within its corridors. As the years went by, the hospital began to struggle to maintain its once-stellar reputation due to a number of factors, including underfunding from the local government, a lack of qualified staff, and outdated practices. Then, in a turn of fate for the better, Jayasurya, a young and ambitious psychiatrist from a prestigious medical college, came to work at the hospital. He was driven by his innate desire to help those who were less fortunate, having grown up in a home where his parents instilled in him a sense of justice and empathy for others.

Her educational background and worldly experiences provided her with the tools necessary to transform the small-town institution into a well-regarded center for mental health care. Despite their shared goal of helping the patients within the hospital, tensions soon began to arise between Jayasurya and Rakhi Devadas. Rakhi, driven by the need for structure and efficient management, enforced strict ways of dealing with the patients, believing that keeping them controlled and confined would lead to a quicker resolution of their mental health issues. Jayasurya, on the other hand, believed that treating the patients with compassion and providing them with opportunities to express themselves and their emotions would lead to a healthier state of mind. The situation deteriorated further when Ruben Isaac, a young and charismatic social worker who recently joined the hospital's staff, began advocating for a more liberal approach to treating the patients. Ruben believed that giving the patients more freedom and the chance to interact with others in a safe and nurturing environment would have a significantly positive impact on their mental health. This only served to intensify the debate that was already brewing between Jayasurya and Rakhi. As the discord between the hospital staff escalated, the patients bore the brunt of the inconsistency between the approaches that were being employed in their care. Some of the patients seemed to respond positively to Rakhi's strict regime, while others showed vast improvements under the more nurturing and empathetic care provided by Jayasurya and Ruben. Despite their differences, the three worked tirelessly to improve the lives of those who came to their hospital seeking help. As their stories intertwined, they began to realize that perhaps there was merit to each approach, and compromise was possible. They also started to understand that every patient was unique, and what worked for one individual might not be the same for another. In time, they set aside their egos and chose the path of collaboration. By combining their distinct skills and experiences, they were able to create a healing environment that prioritized the individual needs of every patient. As they continued to learn from one another and pool their knowledge, the hospital began to prosper. The small-town mental hospital, which had once been on the brink of closure, soon became a haven for those suffering from mental health issues. Patients from all walks of life were welcomed with open arms, bearing witness to the transformational power of unified thought and action. The events that transpired at the hospital serve as a poignant reminder that by putting aside our differences and working together, we can aspire to create a world that attends to the needs of each individual, regardless of the challenges that they face."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Article: A qualified doctor who rarely practiced but instead devoted his life to writing. He once said: \\"Medicine is my lawful wife, and literature is my lover.\\" Russian writer Anton Pavlovich Chekhov, was a great playwright and one of the masters of the modern short story. When Chekhov entered the Moscow University Medical School in 1879, he started to publish hundreds of comic short stories to support his family. After he graduated, he wrote regularly for a local daily newspaper. As a writer he was extremely fast, often producing a short story in an hour or less. Chekhov's medical and science experience can be seen through the indifference  many of his characters show to tragic events. In 1892, he became a full time writer and published some of his most memorable stories. Chekhov often wrote about the sufferings of life in small town Russia. Tragic events control his characters who are filled with feelings of hopelessness and despair. It is often said that nothing happens in Chekhov's stories and plays. He made up for this with his exciting technique for developing drama within his characters. Chekhov's works combined the calm attitude of a scientist and doctor with the sensitivity  of an artist. Some of Chekhov's works were translated into Chinese as early as the 1940s. One of his famous stories, The Man in a Shell, about a school teacher's extraordinarily orderly life, was selected as a text for Chinese senior students. Question: Which of the following adjectives can't be used to describe Chekhov? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Warm-hearted.\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the answer \\"Warm-hearted\\" cannot be used to describe Chekhov based on the information provided in the article.

On his return to Nuremberg in 1495, Durer opened his own workshop (being married was a requirement for this). Over the next five years his style increasingly integrated Italian influences into underlying Northern forms. Durer's father died in 1502, and his mother died in 1513. His best works in the first years of the workshop were his woodcut prints, mostly religious, but including secular scenes such as The Men's Bath House (ca. 1496). These were larger and more finely cut than the great majority of German woodcuts hitherto, and far more complex and balanced in composition. It is now thought unlikely that Durer cut any of the woodblocks himself; this task would have been performed by a specialist craftsman. However, his training in Wolgemut's studio, which made many carved and painted altarpieces and both designed and cut woodblocks for woodcut, evidently gave him great understanding of what the technique could be made to produce, and how to work with block cutters. Durer either drew his design directly onto the woodblock itself, or glued a paper drawing to the block. Either way, his drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the block.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"Did Durer keep his drawing designs?\\" is \\"The drawings were destroyed while carving the wood\\"?","output":"Yes, according to the information provided in the paragraph, Durer's drawings were destroyed during the cutting of the woodblock. He either drew his designs directly onto the woodblock or glued a paper drawing to the block. In both cases, the drawings were lost in the process of carving the wood. This means that Durer did not keep his drawing designs as they were an integral part of the woodcut production process and were not preserved beyond that stage."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the aftermath of the First World War, Greece attempted further expansion into Asia Minor, a region with a large native Greek population at the time, but was defeated in the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922, contributing to a massive flight of Asia Minor Greeks.

Help as much as you can. This was 20 years ago, maybe. My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Do these questions have the same meaning? What should i do get over a girl? How do I get over a girl I cannot be with?","output":"While both of these questions have similar themes and may lead to similar advice, they have slightly different meanings: 1. \\"What should I do get over a girl?\\" In this question, the person is asking for advice or steps for getting over a girl or a romantic interest they are emotionally attached to. The specific reason for wanting to get over her is not mentioned. It could be due to a breakup, unrequited love, or any other reason that makes it necessary for them to move on from their feelings for this girl. 2. \\"How do I get over a girl I cannot be with?\\" This question is more specific about the reason behind needing to get over the girl. In this case, the person acknowledges that they cannot be with her, possibly due to external circumstances, personal choices, or other barriers that prevent them from being together. The focus is on coping with the feelings that arise from the impossibility of the relationship. To answer both of these questions, here are some general steps and advice for getting over a girl or romantic interest: 1. Acceptance: The first step towards healing is recognizing and accepting that the relationship has ended, or you cannot be with her. This involves acknowledging the reality and letting go of any hope or expectations for a future together. 2. Give yourself time to grieve: It is natural to feel sad, angry, or confused after a breakup, or when you realize that you cannot be with the person you desire. Allow yourself to experience these emotions without judgment or self-blame. 3. Cut off contact: If it is not possible to maintain a healthy, casual friendship with the girl, it might be helpful to cut off contact temporarily. Create some distance between you and the person, both physically and virtually (on social media, for instance). 4. Focus on self-improvement: Invest in yourself by engaging in activities that make you feel good and help you grow as an individual. This could include exercising, developing new hobbies, learning new skills, reading, or joining social clubs. 5. Seek support: Talk to trusted friends or family members about your feelings. They can provide a listening ear and offer constructive advice. Additionally, you may consider seeking professional help from a therapist if your emotions are overwhelming you. 6. Create new memories: Start participating in new experiences that can create new, positive memories without the presence of the girl you are trying to get over. This helps reshape your view of life and rebuild your identity without her. 7. Set new goals: Set new personal or professional goals to work towards. This can help you focus on your growth and future, rather than dwelling on the past. 8. Stay patient: Healing takes time, and getting over someone does not happen overnight. Be patient with yourself, and know that it is okay for the process to take a while. In summary, while both questions are centered around dealing with feelings for a girl, the main difference lies in the specificity of the situation - whether the motivation for moving on is unspecified or due to acknowledging that they cannot be with the person in question. Regardless, the recommendations to deal with the emotions arising from either situation are quite similar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, his dream is rudely interrupted by a professional baseball star named Kiichiro Naito, played by Shinichi Tsutsumi. Seeking revenge for this interruption, Kimihiko vows to become a professional baseball player himself, hoping to outshine and outperform Kiichiro Naito on the playing field. His decision to pursue a career in professional baseball represents his determination to prove himself and compete against the person who spoiled his chance to fulfill his dream with a maiko. While Kimihiko focuses on his quest for revenge, his ex-girlfriend Fujiko decides to become an apprentice geisha, likely fueled by her own desires and aspirations. This further complicates the plot, as Kimihiko's past connection to Fujiko and her new venture into the world of maiko brings another layer of emotion and intrigue to the story. Throughout the movie, Kimihiko and Naito engage in a fierce rivalry where they try to out-do each other in various arenas apart from just baseball. This includes K-1 (a form of kickboxing), cooking, acting, and even politics. This intense competition between the two characters serves to not only provide entertainment and a dose of humor to the movie but also allows both characters to grow and develop in their respective pursuits. As the story unfolds, the rivalry between Kimihiko and Naito, as well as the personal transformations of Kimihiko, Fujiko, and other characters, offer insights into themes like ambition, personal growth, and finding one's identity and passions in life. While the movie is filled with humor and eccentricity, it ultimately highlights the importance of chasing one’s dreams, the lengths people are willing to go for revenge, and finding fulfillment in one's own life choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is a lapping machine Suggested answer: This can take two forms. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"A lapping machine is a precision finishing device used in various industries to effectively polish and finalize various parts to achieve the desired surface finish, flatness, and geometry. This machinery works by abrading the surface of the target material, leading to its modification and optimization for its intended application. Lapping machines are essential in the manufacturing process due to their ability to produce high levels of dimensional accuracy without causing any damage to the components. It is true that lapping machines can take different forms, depending on the application and the material being processed. Generally, they can be classified into two broad categories: flat lapping machines and cylindrical lapping machines. 1. Flat Lapping Machines: Flat lapping machines are used for surface finishing or polishing flat surfaces on various materials, including ceramics, metals, glass, and plastics. These machines use a combination of abrasive particles, a lapping plate, and a liquid called \\"lapping slurry\\" that is added to improve the workpiece's movement on the plate. Flat lapping machines are further categorized into single-sided and double-sided lapping machines. Single-sided lapping machines have a single lapping plate, whereas double-sided machines have two or more plates arranged in a planetary motion. 2. Cylindrical Lapping Machines: Cylindrical lapping machines are designed to finish the external and internal surfaces of cylindrical workpieces. These machines accomplish this task using a range of lapping tools, which can either be abrasive stones or specialized lapping wheels. The lapping tools are typically mounted on a spindle, and during the lapping process, the tools work in conjunction with the workpiece to remove material and produce a finessed, polished surface. This category of lapping machines is particularly relevant in industries that heavily rely on precision-engineered cylindrical components, such as automotive, aerospace, and hydraulic equipment manufacturing. To summarize, the suggested answer is partially accurate as it points out that lapping machines can take different forms. However, a more comprehensive validation of the answer should include the classification of lapping machines into flat and cylindrical lapping machines and a brief explanation of their applications and working principles. It is crucial to understand these distinctions because the appropriate lapping machine may vary depending on the specific requirements and dimensions of the workpieces involved, which ultimately impacts the quality, precision, and performance of the components in their final application."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The celebrated Henry Graves Supercomplication is a masterpiece of horology - the science of measuring time - and took eight years to make by hand. Swiss watchmaker Patek Philippe was commissioned to make it by New York banker Henry Graves in 1925, and it is considered to be the most complicated watch ever made.

Indicate the presence of numerical data in the abstract (whether numerical data plays a key role in medical records), solely using the information from the abstract. Abstract: More than 90% of patients with so-called primary or idiopathic osteoarthritis of the hips in whom sufficient data were available to make an assessment of the normality of the hip joint at the cessation of growth clearly showed demonstrable abnormalities in the hip joint. The most common are mild acetabular dysplasia and/or pistol grip deformity. This latter deformity is associated with mild slipped capital femoral epiphysis (recognized or unrecognized at the time), Legg-Perthes' disease (recognized or unrecognized at the time), multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, and/or the presence of an intraacetabular labrum, as well as, in certain instances, acetabular dysplasia. When these abnormalities are taken in conjunction with the detection of other metabolic abnormalities that can lead to osteoarthritis of the hip and which may not be recognized readily, such as hemochromatosis, ochronosis, calcium pyrophosphate disease, and monarticular rheumatoid arthritis, it seems clear that either osteoarthritis of the hip does not exist at all as a primary disease entity or, if it does, is extraordinarily rare.

Before discussing that, let's review the entire respiratory process for better understanding: 1. Inhalation: Air is taken in through the mouth or nose, as you mentioned. The air is then warmed, moistened, and filtered as it passes through the nasal cavity and enters the throat, or pharynx. The air then travels through the larynx (voice box) and into the trachea (windpipe). 2. Trachea and bronchi: The trachea branches into two bronchi (right and left), each leading to a lung. These bronchi further divide into smaller air passages called bronchioles. 3. Lungs: Within the lungs, the bronchioles eventually end in tiny air sacs called alveoli. There are around 300 million alveoli in each lung, providing a large surface area for gas exchange. 4. Gas exchange (external respiration): In the alveoli, oxygen from the inhaled air diffuses through the thin walls of the alveoli and capillaries (tiny blood vessels) into the blood. Hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells, binds to the oxygen and carries it throughout the body. 5. Internal respiration: In body tissues, hemoglobin releases oxygen, which diffuses into cells. Simultaneously, carbon dioxide, a waste product from cellular metabolism, diffuses out of cells and into the blood. 6. Carbon dioxide transport: Carbon dioxide is transported back to the lungs in the blood, predominantly as bicarbonate ions. 7. Exhalation: Finally, the process of exhalation takes place. The diaphragm, the main muscle used in breathing, and the intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) relax, causing the lungs to recoil. This reduction in lung volume increases the pressure inside the alveoli, forcing carbon dioxide-rich air out of the alveoli and eventually expelling it from the body through the nose and mouth as we breathe out. This last step marks the completion of the respiratory cycle. In summary, the last step of the respiratory process after carbon dioxide removal is the exhalation of air, through which carbon dioxide is expelled from the body. This is a crucial process as it maintains the delicate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the body and ensures the proper functioning of our cells and organs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I had previously known his divorce but, up until this point, not the reasoning. He told me, straight out, that he had cheated. Now, cheating in itself is one thing. I try not to judge since everyone has a past and I was never always innocent myself, however his attitude about it was what was very off-putting to me. He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette!

Keeping up with the pace, Google has yet again made significant strides towards enhancing the user experience with local recommendations. The multinational tech giant has replaced Google Places with Google Plus Local, marrying the utility of personalized reviews with the power of social networking. The transition weaves Google's various products into a more cohesive, integrated interface for users. Google Places had been the go-to tool for users seeking information about local businesses such as restaurants, bars, shops, and other notable places. Its main feature was providing users with extensive listing information, compiled from web data and user reviews. However, with the evolution of Google+, Google is now broadening its horizons to enhance the accuracy and interactivity of local recommendations using crowdsourced reviews and social connections. Enter Google Plus Local, an innovative tool that harnesses the power of Google+ and integrates it with the mapping functionality of Google Maps. This easy-to-use service operates as a social layer across all elements of Google, building a more sophisticated and condensed navigational and informational landscape. It collects reviews, ratings, and other data about local businesses and organizes them all into a synchronous system. One of the most significant factors that set Google Plus Local apart from Google Places is its mainstream adoption of Zagat scores. Zagat, an established restaurant review brand, was acquired by Google in 2011. Since then, it has played an influential role in Google's local business rating system. Google Plus Local uses the 30-point rating system from Zagat to provide users with a comprehensive overview of businesses. The score, based on user reviews, covers various aspects like food quality, decor, service, and cost, providing valuable insights and helping users make an informed choice based on their preferences and budget. But the revamping doesn't stop there. Along with the Zagat score, Google Plus Local incorporates reviews from users' friends and connections on Google+. This feature augments the social interaction on the platform, allowing users to see trustworthy and personalized reviews from friends and other community members. It introduces an element of transparency and authenticity, since it showcases genuine experiences from known individuals, which often have more impact than anonymous reviews. Google Plus Local isn't just an update; it's a significant upgrade. The integration of Google+ with Google's other products creates a more contiguous and interactive user experience. Google’s ardent drive to encourage users to adopt Google+ as their primary social networking platform is evident in this synchronised ecosystem. Google Plus Local serves as a milestone in Google’s plans to weave Google+ into every aspect of its product ecosystem and represents an integral part of its holistic approach to digital consumer services. In conclusion, Google's replacement of Google Places with Google Plus Local marks a significant shift in their approach to providing local recommendations. With the integration of Zagat scoring and reviews from Google+ users' friends, this tool offers detailed and reliable information about local businesses. As Google continues to incorporate Google+ with its other products, users can now look forward to a seamless, more personalized user experience. The introduction of Google Plus Local indeed highlights Google’s commitment to innovation and improved usability, reinforcing its dominance in the digital navigation and recommendation industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

WLUK-TV reports it took hours to free the snake, which had wrapped itself around the engine.      The snake's owner said it had been missing for more than a month. It's illegal to have such a snake in Omro, so the owner was fined 313.      Police say they'll dismiss the ticket if the owner pays for the SUV's damages, which fittingly include a displaced serpentine belt.      Keller says he'll adopt the python.      ___      Information from: WLUK-TV, http://www.fox11online.com ||||| OMRO, Wis. (WLUK) -- A driver and her son having some car trouble pull over and pop open the hood -- to find themselves staring into a serpent's eyes.      \\"I've never done anything like this before in my life! Most of my rescues are taking them out of people's houses,\\" said Steve Keller.      Keller is the self-proclaimed \\"Snake Man\\" who pulled the serpent from the woman's SUV.      The slithering surprise sent Omro police racing to Keller for help. They brought the \\"Snake Man\\" in for backup when the ball python wrapped itself tight around an unsuspecting driver's engine.      \\"I don't know why I risked my own body for a snake, but I did, it's what I do,\\" Keller said.      Keller says the python, native to Africa and used to much warmer temperatures, found heat under the hood and got cozy.            \\"Getting one unwrapped from an engine block was not fun. I've got all kinds of cuts and bruises on my arms from trying to dig into this thing and try to get him out in one piece,\\" Keller said.      It took hours, a tow truck and a \\"Snake Man\\" to get the stubborn python out.      The SUV's engine was damaged by the snake. The animal is also being treated for cuts and burns.      \\"We got him out in one piece, but the burns could turn into a fatality in a couple of weeks; we don't know until it has some time to heal,\\" said Keller.      The \\"Snake Man\\" has rescued over 500 of these critters in the past 12 years. Keller says this rescue was a first, and one of his toughest.      Police say the snake escaped from its owner more than a month ago. Omro police say it's illegal to own a ball python and they've fined the snake's owner 313. |||||Summary:","output":"In Omro, Wisconsin, a motorist named Chris Nguyen found himself facing an unexpected issue when he discovered a 4-foot-long ball python wrapped around his mother's SUV engine. The snake had reportedly been missing from its owner for over a month and had found refuge in the warm engine compartment. After several hours and assistance from police officers and snake rescuer Steve Keller, the python was successfully removed. The snake is currently being treated for cuts and burns from the ordeal. Owning a ball python is illegal in Omro, and the snake's owner was consequently fined 313. The fine may be dismissed if the owner pays for the SUV damages, which include a displaced serpentine belt. Snake rescuer Steve Keller has expressed intentions to adopt the python."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Which United States Marine Corps aviator preceded United States Navy Commander Scott Carpenter as one of the first Americans in space? A:","output":"The United States Marine Corps aviator who preceded United States Navy Commander Scott Carpenter as one of the first Americans in space was Marine Lieutenant Colonel John Glenn. John Glenn, born on July 18, 1921, in Cambridge, Ohio, was a highly decorated fighter pilot during World War II and the Korean War, who later became a test pilot before being selected as a member of NASA's Mercury Seven astronauts in 1959.  John Glenn's historic spaceflight took place on February 20, 1962, aboard the Mercury-Atlas 6 spacecraft, named Friendship 7. During this mission, he became the first American to orbit the Earth, making three orbits in just under five hours. This achievement showcased American ingenuity and progress in the early stages of the Space Race against the Soviet Union, which had already put cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin into orbit about a year earlier on April 12, 1961. Scott Carpenter, who was also part of NASA's original Mercury Seven group, followed John Glenn on May 24, 1962, aboard the Mercury-Atlas 7 spacecraft, named Aurora 7. Carpenter successfully orbited Earth three times as well, but various complications during his mission caused a delay in his landing and recovery. It is important to note that both John Glenn and Scott Carpenter were pioneers in American space exploration, laying vital groundwork for future achievements such as the Apollo Moon landings and helping the United States become a global leader in space technology. After their careers as astronauts, both men continued to be involved in public service: Glenn served as a United States Senator from Ohio, and Carpenter pursued careers in oceanographic research and environmental conservation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Anatomically, the pancreas is divided into the head of pancreas, the neck of pancreas, the body of pancreas, and the tail of pancreas. The head is surrounded by the duodenum in its concavity. The head surrounds two blood vessels, the superior mesenteric artery and vein. From the back of the head emerges a small uncinate process which extends to the back of the superior mesenteric vein and ends at the superior mesenteric artery. The neck is about 2.5 cm (1 in) long and lies between the head and the body and in front of the superior mesenteric artery and vein. Its front upper surface supports the pylorus (the base) of the stomach. The neck arises from the left upper part of the front of the head. It is directed first upward and forward, and then upward and to the left to join the body; it is somewhat flattened from above downward and backward. On the right it is grooved by the gastroduodenal artery. The body is the largest part of the pancreas and lies behind the pylorus, at the same level as the transpyloric plane.

Would \\"For United States individual income tax, adjusted gross income (AGI) is total gross income minus specific reductions.\\" be a reasonable answer?","output":"While your provided statement begins to define adjusted gross income (AGI), it does not directly address modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). Here's a more comprehensive answer: Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is a measure used by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to determine eligibility for certain tax benefits, deductions, and credits. MAGI is calculated by taking your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and adding back specific items that have been previously excluded or deducted from the computation of your AGI. To understand MAGI, it's essential to know what AGI is. As you mentioned, AGI is the total gross income (all sources of income such as wages, interests, dividends, and capital gains) minus specific reductions (also known as adjustments or deductions, e.g., educator expenses, student loan interest, alimony payments, and contributions to retirement accounts). After determining the AGI, certain items excluded or deducted from your AGI are added back to calculate your MAGI. Depending on your tax situation, these items may include: 1. Deduction for student loan interest 2. Deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses 3. Excluded foreign earned income and housing costs 4. Nontaxable Social Security benefits 5. Tax-exempt interest income 6. Deduction for IRA contributions It's essential to understand that the specific additions may differ depending on the tax provision you're trying to qualify for, such as Roth IRA contributions, American Opportunity Tax Credit, or the Premium Tax Credit under the Affordable Care Act. In summary, Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI) is a measure used by the IRS to determine your eligibility for specific tax benefits.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What are the full names of the men who return to Madame Tanya's house as ghosts?, using the article: Engineers George Melton and Allan Chadwick work furiously to complete a design on time, even though it is Christmas Eve. Michael O'Brien, the third partner in the firm, arrives with presents for all and kindly lets their employees leave. The three old men then go home to the mansion they share with Madame Tanya, an elderly countess dispossessed by the Russian Revolution, for a dinner with prestigious guests. When the guests cancel at the last minute, George is convinced it is because of his dark past. To relieve George's black mood, Michael comes up with an idea to obtain new guests for dinner. Each man throws out a wallet containing 10 and his business card into the street. George's is found by Arlene Terry, who merely gives the money to her driver and discards the wallet. However, the other two are returned by more considerate people: Texas cowboy James Houston and teacher Jean Lawrence. They stay for dinner and soon become good friends with the three men and Madame Tanya. James and Jean also fall in love with each other, delighting the three men. When the engineers have to travel to another city on business, Madame Tanya begs Michael to take the train rather than fly.

United‘s match Sunday against the New York Red Bulls marks both the end of a critical homestand and the start of an onerous stretch, a late-summer overlap that promises to set the tone for the MLS club’s playoff push. It’s the last of four consecutive dates at RFK Stadium and the beginning of four games across 12 days against Eastern Conference opponents. Given the current circumstances and imminent demands, United is famished for three points against its archrivals. “You’ve got to focus on both aspects” of the next two weeks, Coach Ben Olsen said Friday, “but most of that focus is on Sunday and taking care of business here at home, putting up another win and continuing to improve because each of the last three games we’ve taken a step forward. The pieces are fitting in; now it’s important to go on a run.” [There’s lots of soccer on TV this weekend. Here’s where you can watch.] United (6-8-9, 27 points) has shown marked improvement in recent weeks, though only the 2-0 victory over reigning champion Portland last weekend was fully satisfying. The previous two outings — draws against Montreal and Philadelphia — were marred by lost leads and dropped points. United is seeking to win consecutive games for the first time this season. (It has not lost two in a row, either.) By no means would a draw or defeat spoil United’s playoff aim; 10 games remain after Sunday, and D.C. was tied for the conference’s sixth and last postseason berth entering the weekend. But four of the next five are on the road — and United is not a good away team (1-4-6 with seven goals scored). The busiest stretch of the year will accelerate with a trip to Montreal on Wednesday, a home game against Chicago next Saturday, then a midweek visit to New York City FC five days later. After a break for World Cup qualifiers, United will go to Red Bull Arena on Sept. 11. “I hate when you say ‘must-win games,’ but it kind of has that feel,” captain Bobby Boswell said. “If we go out and win, I think a lot of teams look at us and say, ‘This team wants to be in the playoffs, and when they show up, they are a real contender.’ “We believe that; I think not a lot of people watching us believe that. If we can show what we’re capable of, we can put some fear into other people. But if we lay an egg, people will say, ‘It’s symbolic of their season.’ ” Near the bottom of league scoring all summer, United is showing signs of life in the attack. Improved rhythm and ball movement led to back-to-back multiple goal performances for the first time this year. Consistency should pay dividends, as Olsen appears to have settled on his midfield and forward after months of interchange: Marcelo Sarvas in defensive midfield, Jared Jeffrey and Luciano Acosta in central midfield, Lloyd Sam and Patrick Nyarko on the flanks, and Patrick Mullins at striker. Nick DeLeon, Lamar Neagle, Alvaro Saborio and Kennedy Igboananike await their turn. The Red Bulls (10-9-6, 36 points) will steam into RFK on a 3-0-4 roll in league play and 5-0-5 in all competitions, the last setback coming July 3 against NYCFC at Yankee Stadium. Coach Jesse Marsch mixed regulars and reserves for their midweek CONCACAF Champions League match in San Salvador, a 1-1 draw with Alianza. The stream of results has come despite long-term injuries to four regulars: Defenders Gideon Baah (broken leg) and Connor Lade (knee) are out for the year, defender Damien Perrinelle (ankle) will miss several more weeks and midfielder Dax McCarty, a former United captain, is recovering from a leg fracture. “There’s a good vibe with this group right now,” Olsen said. “We are primed to improve and go on a run, but that means nothing if you don’t step out Sunday and understand what it’s going to take to beat a very good Red Bulls team.” Olsen will return to the sideline after serving a one-game suspension for an ejection against Philadelphia. Sam will face his former team for the first time since United acquired him July 7. “It’s huge, not just because it’s New York but the timing and where we are at, where we can be if we come out with three points,” Boswell said. “It’s a big deal.” Assistant coach Chad Ashton has won both games when filling in for the suspended Olsen this season. Including the last few minutes of the Philadelphia match two weeks ago, when Olsen was ejected and Steve Birnbaum scored in added time, Ashton’s goal differential is plus-six. The Insider could not resist, tongue in cheek, raising those statistics with Olsen. Clearly, he needs to step aside. “I consider it every day,” Olsen said. “I made the recommendation upstairs” to the front office. On a serious note: “Listen, Chad has been a big part of this coaching staff for a while. He doesn’t get any glory. He is a real soldier for this club.” With the college soccer season launching (women kick off today, men next Friday), MLS teams will keep a close eye on their homegrown prospects. For United, that means Eryk Williamson, a sophomore attacker at the University of Maryland. Barring major injury, an alarming drop in form or considerable overseas offers, United hopes to sign him to a homegrown contract after this college season, the Insider has learned. (To maintain NCAA eligibility, he won’t sign a pro deal until he’s sure of leaving school.) Williamson, 19, is a U.S. under-20 national team starter from Alexandria, Va. Last fall at Maryland, he started in all but one of his 20 appearances and posted five goals and three assists. The Terrapins — Big Ten favorites who are ranked No. 4 in the NSCAA preseason poll — will open the season next Friday against No. 16 UCLA at StubHub Center in Carson, Calif. The home opener at Ludwig Field is Aug. 29 against Hartford, followed by a local clash with visiting Georgetown on Sept. 2. United’s stretch of home matches has illuminated an issue with the stadium lights: Several bulbs appear dark. It doesn’t seem to affect TV coverage, and except for spectators glaring skyward, the audience probably hasn’t noticed. Here’s the explanation from Events DC, the organization that manages the facility: The bank of lights that show two rows of lights off are emergency lights that will turn on in case of a power outage via the backup generator. The other tower lights that appear to be out have been addressed since the beginning of this month, one tower of lights at a time. In order to change these lights (lanterns), electricians need to go on the roof, suspend from a harness and change manually. For safety reasons, given the heat this month, they have only been able to work in the early morning hours. This maintenance is an on-going process as light lanterns that work today may be out tomorrow. The on-field visibility is of utmost importance and has not been impeded during this routine maintenance. Lightning, not lighting, might be an issue Sunday: A weather front is expected to crash through the Washington area, with a high chance of thunderstorms throughout the afternoon. ESPN will carry the match, with coverage starting at 3 p.m. and kickoff shortly thereafter. Jonathan Yardley and Taylor Twellman are the announcers. The game is also available on ESPN Deportes, the WatchESPN app and ESPN3.com. The referee is Ismail Elfath. After a weather-related postponement Wednesday, the Richmond Kickers (11-6-6) will return to action Sunday against Orlando City B (8-8-7) in Melbourne, Fla. The Kickers are unbeaten in seven straight (6-0-1) and fifth in the USL’s 14-team Eastern Conference with seven regular season matches left. United midfielder Miguel Aguilar is scheduled to report. Goalkeeper Andrew Dykstra is also likely. Wednesday’s home game against the Charleston Battery was halted in the 21st minute because of a thunderstorm. Four United players started: goalkeeper Travis Worra, defenders Jalen Robinson and Luke Mishu, and midfielder Julian Buescher. D.C.

Please answer the following question: -  The sediment rolls down hill towards a river - The heavy items sink to the bottom - The lighter items float on the top and in convection cycles - As the river flows the sediment is moved - The sediment gets dumped through tributaries into lakes and the ocean - The sediment keeps moving around the world in convection currents.  What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"The first step in the process of sediment transportation, as described in the sequence of events, is when the sediment rolls down a hill towards a river. This step, also known as erosion, involves the detachment and movement of soil and rock fragments by gravity, water, wind, or ice. In this context, the primary agent of erosion is gravity, as it drives soil and rocks to roll down a hill or slope. This downhill movement of sediment is induced by factors such as the topography and steepness of the slope, the amount and type of precipitation, the composition and stability of soil, and the presence or absence of vegetation cover. Erosion is crucial in the process of sediment transportation, as it sets the stage for subsequent steps in the sediment cycle. The dislodged sediment, consisting of various particles in different shapes, sizes, and densities, then reaches the river where the heavy items sink to the bottom, and the lighter ones float on the top and in convection cycles. As the river flows, the sediment is eventually transported and reaches other bodies of water, such as lakes or the ocean. Understanding this process is essential in the study of geology and geomorphology. It helps scientists comprehend the dynamic nature of Earth's surface, the movement of sediments and nutrients, and the formation of various geological features such as deltas, beaches, and sedimentary rocks. Furthermore, knowing the factors influencing sediment transportation allows us to better manage and mitigate the potential impacts of erosion, such as reduced soil fertility, water pollution, and the loss of valuable land."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Coming off their win against the Eagles, the Redskins had a short turnaround and traveled to Cowboys Stadium to take on their hated rival the Dallas Cowboys for the 2012 edition of the annual Thanksgiving Day game. Washington had reason to be nervous, as they were 1-6 all-time on Thanksgiving, and 0-6 against Dallas. In the first, Washington got the ball first, but went three-and-out. After a Sav Rocca punt, Dallas had decent field position, and quickly reached the red zone. However, Washington's defense then stiffened, and held Dallas to a Dan Bailey 30-yard field goal. The teams then exchanged punts, and the first quarter concluded without any further scoring. In the second, Washington had the ball inside their own 35, and quarterback Robert Griffin III used a play-action pass, and found a streaking Aldrick Robinson for a 68-yard strike, and Washington took its first lead of the game, at 7-3. On Dallas' ensuing possession, Dallas moved the ball into Washington territory, but after Tony Romo completed an 11-yard pass to Dez Bryant that had Dallas in Washington territory, Redskins cornerback Josh Wilson hit him, and dislodged the football, which was subsequently recovered by safety DeJon Gomes into Dallas territory. Washington would capitalize, with their drive culminating in an Alfred Morris 1-yard touchdown run to extend Washington's advantage to 14-3. Dallas would then punt after just three plays, and Washington marched near midfield, before Griffin connected with wide receiver Pierre Gar&#231;on across the middle, and Garcon proceeded to streak to the endzone for a 59-yard score, and Washington led 21-3 with just over 2 minutes remaining in the half. Dallas would attempt to run a two-minute drill, but Romo's pass, intended for Cole Beasley was intercepted by DeAngelo Hall and returned inside the Dallas 25. With mere seconds remaining in the half, Griffin found Santana Moss in the corner of the endzone for a score, and a 28-3 halftime lead. In the third, Dallas marched down the field on their opening possession, but the drive stalled again, and Dallas settled for another Bailey field goal, this time from 33 yards out. The majority of the rest of the quarter proved to be a defensive struggle, as Romo was intercepted again, this time by London Fletcher, but Washington could not capitalize on it. After a Rocca punt, Dallas was pinned inside their 20, but Romo connected with a wide-open Dez Bryant, who streaked 85 yards to the end zone, and before you could blink, Dallas was back in the game, at 28-13 Washington. Going into the fourth, Washington was driving, in an attempt to extend their lead back to three scores. They would succeed in this endeavor, as Griffin found tight end Niles Paul for a 30-yard touchdown on third-and-inches, and Washington took a 35-13 lead with just under 13 minutes to go. Dallas, however, would not give up, as expected. To save time, Dallas ran a no-huddle offense, and was able to march down the field, and find Felix Jones for a 10-yard touchdown, and a subsequent quarterback draw by Romo cut the lead to 35-21 with just under 10 minutes remaining. On Washington's next possession, disaster struck. Robert Griffin III lofted a throw over the middle that he overthrew horribly, and it was easily intercepted by Charlie Peprah and returned inside the Washington 20. However, Washington's defense put Dallas into a 4th down situation, but Romo found Dez Bryant in the left corner of the end zone, and with over 8 minutes remaining, Dallas was now within a touchdown, as Washington's lead was merely 35-28. With his mettle about to be tested, Robert Griffin III led an efficient, clock-chewing drive that concluded with a Kai Forbath 48-yard field goal to extend Washington's advantage to 38-28 with just under three minutes remaining. Dallas, needing a touchdown, onside kick recovery, and field goal to send it to overtime, again marched into Washington territory, but couldn't get to the endzone, as Dez Bryant caught a pass in the endzone that was dislodged at the last minute by Madieu Williams, and Dallas had to settle for a 51-yard field goal by Bailey. This cut the score to 38-31, and Dallas lined up for an onside kick, needing a touchdown to tie the game, with 18 seconds remaining. However, it was recovered by DeAngelo Hall and returned to the Dallas 2, as Hall opted not to score, instead letting Robert Griffin III kneel-down to seal the deal. Griffin went 20-for-28 for 311 yards, 4 touchdowns and 1 interception, becoming the first rookie QB in NFL history to throw 4 passing touchdowns in back-to-back games. With the win, Washington improved to 5-6, 2-1 in the NFC East, and into second place in the NFC East by virtue of the tiebreaker over Dallas. Washington also won its first Thanksgiving game since the 1973 season, when they defeated the Detroit Lions. Washington improved to 2-6 all-time on Thanksgiving, and 1-6 against Dallas.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. As noted above, the 9/11 plotters spent somewhere between 400,000 and 500,000 to plan and conduct their attack. The available evidence indicates that the 19 operatives were funded by al Qaeda, either through wire transfers or cash provided by KSM, which they carried into the United States or deposited in foreign accounts and accessed from this country. Our investigation has uncovered no credible evidence that any person in the United States gave the hijackers substantial financial assistance. Similarly, we have seen no evidence that any foreign government-or foreign government official-supplied any funding. We have found no evidence that the Hamburg cell members (Atta, Shehhi, Jarrah, and Binalshibh) received funds from al Qaeda before late 1999. It appears they supported themselves. KSM, Binalshibh, and another plot facilitator, Mustafa al Hawsawi, each received money, in some cases perhaps as much as 10,000, to perform their roles in the plot. After the Hamburg recruits joined the 9/11 conspiracy, al Qaeda began giving them money. Our knowledge of the funding during this period, before the operatives entered the United States, remains murky. According to KSM, the Hamburg cell members each received 5,000 to pay for their return to Germany from Afghanistan after they had been selected to join the plot, and they received additional funds for travel from Germany to the United States. Financial transactions of the plotters are discussed in more detail in chapter 7. Requirements for a Successful Attack As some of the core operatives prepared to leave for the United States, al Qaeda's leaders could have reflected on what they needed to be able to do in order to organize and conduct a complex international terrorist operation to inflict catastrophic harm. We believe such a list of requirements would have included leaders able to evaluate, approve, and supervise the planning and direction of the operation; communications sufficient to enable planning and direction of the operatives and those who would be helping them; a personnel system that could recruit candidates, vet them, indoctrinate them, and give them necessary training; an intelligence effort to gather required information and form assessments of enemy strengths and weaknesses; the ability to move people; and the ability to raise and move the necessary money. The information we have presented about the development of the planes operation shows how, by the spring and summer of 2000, al Qaeda was able to meet these requirements. By late May 2000, two operatives assigned to the planes operation were already in the United States. Three of the four Hamburg cell members would soon arrive.  Question: \\"What time in 2000 does al Queada meet the requirements and what chapter can you find more details about financial transactions?\\" Response: \\"You can find more details about financial transactions in chapter 7 al Queada meets the requirements after the Hamberg members joined the conspiracy\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus.

Summarize this article: Nevada law prohibits gun owners from aiding or permitting a child to have access to a firearm. You cannot be convicted of a violation of this law if you keep your firearms in a secured locked container. To provide additional protection, keep the container in a place where children in the household can't get to it, such as in the top of a closet. Although not required by Nevada law, disassembling or locking your firearms before storing them helps protect children. If they somehow stumble upon your firearms, they won't be able to fire them if they are locked or disassembled. You can get a safety kit with cable-style locks to protect your firearms at your local police or sheriff's department. For a list of law enforcement agencies in Nevada that have safety kits available, visit https://www.projectchildsafe.org/safety/safety-kit/Nevada. Even if you don't disassemble your firearms, make sure they're unloaded before you store them. Keep the ammunition apart from your firearms so that even if children happen to access your firearms, they can't access the ammunition.  Your ammunition should also be stored in a locked container. Ammunition can be dangerous for children even if not loaded in a weapon. While Nevada law doesn't require you to store your ammunition separately from your firearms, this will keep children in your household safer. Make sure any children in your household are aware of firearms and how they should act around them. Instruct them that if they ever see a gun, even one that looks like a toy, they should not touch it and tell an adult immediately.  If there are adolescents or teenagers in your household who are trained to use firearms, such as for hunting or for target practice, make sure they understand that they should never touch or use a firearm without an adult present. Discourage children from snooping around the house for guns, even if they just want to look at it. Tell them that guns are not toys. Summary:","output":"Nevada law prohibits gun owners from allowing children access to firearms and recommends storing firearms in a secured locked container. To enhance safety, disassemble or lock firearms before storage, and keep ammunition separate in a locked container. Obtain safety kits from local law enforcement agencies and educate children about firearm safety, instructing them not to touch guns and to inform an adult immediately if they find one. If teens are trained to use firearms, ensure they only do so under adult supervision."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Her brother's oncologist, Dr. Barden, introduces Iris to Shepard Lambrick, a philanthropist, who offers her a deal: if she wins a parlor game at a dinner party, his charitable foundation will pay for Raleigh's leukemia treatment and locate a bone marrow donor for him immediately. Dr. Barden was a former winner of the game. Iris reluctantly accepts. The next day at Lambrick's manor, Iris is introduced to his son Julian and the other contestants: Lucas; Travis, a war veteran; Linda, an elderly, paralyzed woman; Peter, a gambling addict; Cal; Amy; and Conway, an alcoholic debtor. A steak and fois gras dinner is served but, Iris, a vegetarian, initially declines to eat it. Shepherd then offers her 10,000 to compromise her principles, and so she eats the steak. When Shepard realizes Conway is a recovering alcoholic, he offers Conway 10,000 to drink a glass of wine. When Conway declines he then offers him 50,000 to drink an entire decanter of Scotch. Conway accepts the 50,000 and reluctantly drinks the Scotch. After dinner ends, the game begins.

For week four, the Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks when they hosted the 1-2 Packers, the Bears having led the all-time series 93-89-2, but the Packers had won 9 of the previous 11 games. On offense, the Bears' worst-ranked rushing game (64 yards per game) had a chance to produce against the Packers, who were ranked 30th by allowing 156 yards per game, while opponents had run a league-most 37.3 times per game while scoring an also league-high five rushing touchdowns. Also, Matt Forte had recorded 336 yards and four touchdowns against the Packers in his last two games. The offense also was challenged by the pass defense, with defenders Sam Shields and Tramon Williams, who were stingy in man coverage. For the Bears' defense, the Packers had also struggled on the run, ranking 26th in the league with a 78-yard rushing average and the longest run being of 17 yards, while having averaged only 3.63 yards per carry. Additionally, Green Bay was ranked 28th in the league in yards. However, the team faced the Packers' passing attack, which featured the receiving duo of Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb. The former led the league in targets (37) and first downs (16), while ranking second in receiving yards (351), while the Bears had struggled with covering slant and dig routes, both of which Nelson excelled at. The latter had three touchdowns in 2014, but was used primarily for hitch and stick routes. The Packers were two-point favorites. Sherrick McManis, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Matt Slauson, Jared Allen, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery, and Ryan Mundy served as team captains for the game, while the honorary captains were Dick Butkus and Kurt Becker. The Packers won the coin toss, and decided to kick. On the first drive, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's six-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers responded with Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run. During Chicago's next drive, on 4th and 1, Cutler fumbled the snap, and upon picking up the ball, recorded a 16-yard run on an accidental fumblerooski. The drive continued into the second quarter, ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged touchdowns on the final three plays: Aaron Rodgers' three-yard pass to Nelson, Cutler's eight-yard pass to Jeffery, and Rodgers' 22-yard pass to Cobb. The Bears reached the Packers' nine-yard line by the final play of the first half; on the play, Cutler's pass for Bennett was ruled short of a touchdown. During the television review, Micah Hyde covered the camera angle, preventing the touchdown and ending the half with the Packers leading 21-17. In the third quarter, the Packers drove to the Bears' 34-yard line, where Rodgers completed a touchdown pass to Davante Adams, which would be nullified by a holding penalty on center Corey Linsley; Crosby would eventually kick a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler's pass for Josh Morgan would be tipped by Williams and intercepted by Clay Matthews, with Green Bay capitalizing on the takeaway with Rodgers' 11-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On the next drive, Shields intercepted Cutler, and Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal; however, a holding penalty on Jon Bostic led to Rodgers' three-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. On Chicago's next drive, Williams intercepted Cutler, but the play would be nullified; the Bears would subsequently punt. On the Packers' next drive, they would reach the Bears' 20-yard line before Crosby's field goal was blocked by Willie Young, the first block by the Bears in over a year. Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler on the final drive, and the Bears ran out the clock to end the game. The Bears recorded 496 yards, the first time since 1979 against the Minnesota Vikings that the Bears recorded such yardage and lost. The last time the team recorded more than 496 yards and lost occurred in 1947 against the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Cardinals. Additionally, the rushing attack recorded 102 yards in the first quarter, the first time Chicago recorded at least 100 rushing yards in the first quarter since 2010 against the Carolina Panthers.

I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower.

Star ratings are subjective and can vary depending on individual experiences and expectations. Additionally, this statement is too brief to make a fair judgment and provide a detailed and long answer. However, let's try to give a general analysis based on this statement. The reviewer appears to be experiencing difficulties in updating something, possibly a device or an application, while using a Jio sim card. Jio is a telecommunications company in India which provides primarily mobile network services, including data, voice, and messaging. From the perspective of the reviewer who has encountered this issue, they could be experiencing frustration and dissatisfaction due to the inability to update, which may have prevented them from utilizing particular features or applications they consider essential. Based on this information, it could be inferred that they might assign a low star rating, such as ★ or ★★. However, it's important to consider if this issue is limited to the Jio sim or if others have experienced similar problems, as isolated issues can sometimes result from individual user errors or technical difficulties unrelated to the product or service itself. Also, consider the user's overall experience and satisfaction with other aspects of the product or service. The issue they are facing might not be significant enough to strongly influence their overall rating. In summary, a precise star rating cannot be determined from the statement alone as it lacks the necessary context and information. It's also essential to evaluate other factors, such as the general sentiment of other users, technical variables, and the scope of the problem before accurately assigning a star rating."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage:In July 2011, Ball signed a new three-year contract, which extended his stay at the Pride Park club until at least 2014. Ball scored his first senior goal for the club in a 2–1 win at home to Bristol City on 10 December 2011. Ball then scored the opening goal of the game against West Ham which was a great curling effort form the edge of the area after being played in by Nathan Tyson, this was the second former England goal keeper (Robert Green) he had scored against after scoring his first goal against David James. Ball scored his 3rd goal for derby, which proved to be the winner against Coventry City, once again this proved to be a goal against an internationally capped goal keeper in Joe Murphy who at the time had been capped twice by the Republic of Ireland. Ball became a regular in the Rams matchday 16 until he picked up an ankle injury in a reserves game against Belper Town on 26 March 2012.

Here is a hypothesis: Worshipping the deities were the only reason people came to the Buddhist temples. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"Based on the given premise and hypothesis, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also true. The premise merely states that people went to Buddhist temples to worship the feminine Kannon deities, resculpted to represent Mary and Jesus. This does not provide direct evidence or imply that this act of worship was the only reason for people visiting the temples.  Buddhist temples are not solely places of worship; they play a variety of roles within their societies. They can be centres for community gathering, education, celebration of important events, meditation, and spiritual guidance. Historically, Buddhist temples have also often been places of refuge during times of conflict or crisis. Therefore, people could have come to the Buddhist temples for an array of reasons beyond worshipping the deities. Furthermore, worship activities within Buddhist temples are usually multifaceted. While devotion to deities is a part of religious life, Buddhists are also engaged in sutra chanting, meditation, offerings, and teachings of the Eightfold Path and the Four Noble Truths, which are central to Buddhist practices. The premise and hypothesis also appear to be discussing a specific historic context in which Buddhist statues were adapted to resemble Christian figures, likely during a period of Christian suppression. Again, this does not mean that the modified sculptures were the sole purpose for temple visits, since religious suppression periods often entail a covert continuation of the suppressed religion's customs and practices. In conclusion, the premise does not sufficiently justify the hypothesis being true. A more full view of the societal, historical, and religious context of temple visits would be necessary for a more accurate determination. Further investigation would be required to comprehensively understand the motivations behind visits to these Buddhist temples."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options:  A). yes;  B). it is not possible to tell;  C). no; Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Answer: B). it is not possible to tell.  Explanation: In the perspective of logical entailment in linguistics, Sentence 1 discusses the speaker's positive experience with an unspecified event and mentions that the atmosphere was good and fun. Sentence 2 states that the atmosphere got better with time. However, Sentence 1 does not provide any details about the change in the atmosphere over time, it only states that it was good. Hence, we cannot confirm if the atmosphere improved over time based solely on Sentence 1. Therefore, we cannot say that Sentence 2 is entailed by Sentence 1. Option A, \\"yes,\\" is incorrect because there is no explicit mention in Sentence 1 that suggests the atmosphere improved over time, and Option C, \\"no,\\" is also incorrect because we do not have enough information to deny the statement that the atmosphere improved over time.

Many gym goers have learnt to dread interval training but new research suggests that it may be the best way for women to get maximum benefits from exercise. The research shows that when it comes to running, women may get more out of high intensity interval training than their male counterparts. Earlier interval training studies primarily focused on highly trained males, but researchers say that they overlooked the variety of other populations that routinely use interval training. Drs Matt Laurent and Matt Kutz, at Bowling Green State University, Lauren Vervaecke, at the University of South Carolina, and Dr Matt Green at the University of North Alabama, put eight men and eight women between the ages of 19 and 30 through self-paced, high intensity interval training using different recovery periods. All of them reported at least a moderate fitness level and participation in at least one session of interval training a week. Participants used a treadmill for six, four-minute intervals performed at the highest intensity they felt they could maintain. Recovery periods between intervals consisted of one minute, two minute or four minute breaks. Throughout the intervals, the participants’ maximum oxygen consumption and heart rates were measured. Results revealed a significant effect of gender on both percentages. Across the trials, men self-selected a faster relative pace, but the women worked at a higher percentage of their maximum heart rate than the men, and a higher percentage of their maximum oxygen consumption. ‘I think what our data show is that there appear to be meaningful differences in how men and women self-regulate their workouts,’ Dr Laurent said. ‘Specifically, in our case, men and women tend to work at the same level of perceived exertion and feel similarly recovered between each interval, however, as they perform the interval runs women tended to work “harder” from a relative cardiovascular standpoint than men.’ Results also confirmed previous findings suggesting that a 2:1 work-to-rest ratio is optimal during HIIT for both men and women. The results also confirmed previous findings suggesting that a 2:1 work-to-rest ratio is optimal during high intensity interval training for both men and women. ‘I really think one of the “take home” points from our study was, despite the gender differences that we found, individuals performing high-intensity interval training should listen to, and trust, their body and pay attention to how they are feeling,’ said Dr Laurent. ‘Without having any feedback about their data, all the participants had to use to set their pace was how they felt during the run and how recovered they felt. ‘In that sense, when runners perform high-intensity intervals, trust that if you push yourself to run what you consider hard, you are probably at the correct intensity, and if you maintain recommended work-to-rest ratios you most likely will recover appropriately to get the most out of your workout, independent of gender.’ Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"1. Women may benefit more from high-intensity interval training (HIIT) than men when it comes to running, according to new research. 2. Previous HIIT studies primarily focused on highly trained males, but this study included a more diverse population. 3.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.  I am facing a new situation today: Ann decided to candy half of the fruit he received as a gift. She kept the other half to eat fresh and do juicing.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"When is a hemisphere tilted towards the sun?\\" with the following options:  - mild  - Vernal equinox  - autumn  - Spring  - Summer  - positive  - Autumnal Equinox  - Tropical The answer to this question is:","output":"Summer. In a more detailed explanation, the axial tilt of the Earth has a significant impact on the distribution and intensity of sunlight received by each hemisphere. When a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, that hemisphere experiences summer as it receives more direct sunlight. This increased sunlight results in longer days, higher temperatures, and more solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. During the summer season, the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the sun. This causes regions such as Britain to receive more direct sunlight, resulting in warmer and longer days. Conversely, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun during winter, it receives less direct sunlight, leading to shorter, colder days. The term \\"vernal equinox\\" refers to the time of year when the sun is directly above the equator, and day and night are of equal length. This event occurs around March 20th or 21st and marks the beginning of spring in the Northern Hemisphere. Similarly, the \\"autumnal equinox\\" occurs around September 22nd or 23rd and indicates the start of autumn. During these equinoxes, neither hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. The other options provided include \\"mild,\\" \\"autumn,\\" \\"spring,\\" \\"positive,\\" and \\"tropical,\\" which are not relevant to the question of when a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun. It is crucial to note that while the Northern Hemisphere experiences summer, the Southern Hemisphere tilts away from the sun and undergoes its winter season. In conclusion, the correct option for \\"when is a hemisphere tilted towards the sun\\" is \\"summer.\\" During summer, a hemisphere receives more direct sunlight, causing longer days and higher temperatures generally associated with this season."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

At this time, the system could provide positioning data between longitude 55°E to 180°E and from latitude 55°S to 55°N.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"Certainly! The BeiDou-2 system, also known as COMPASS, is a Chinese satellite navigation system that was developed to provide global coverage as an alternative to American GPS, Russian GLONASS, and European Galileo systems. In December 2012, the BeiDou-2 system began offering coverage for the Asia-Pacific region, marking an important milestone in its development. At that time, the BeiDou-2 system's coverage was limited to positions between longitude 55°E and 180°E, and from latitude 55°S to 55°N. This encompasses a vast area that includes most parts of Asia, as well as portions of the Pacific Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the region around Australia. The establishment of BeiDou-2's coverage in the Asia-Pacific region demonstrates the system's growing capabilities and China's commitment to providing accurate positioning data not only for its own nation but also for its neighbors and allies. The BeiDou-2 system plays a key role in various fields, such as transportation, weather forecasting, emergency services, and defense. Over the years, China has continued to improve the BeiDou system, launching additional satellites, expanding coverage, and enhancing signal accuracy. In July 2020, China completed the launch of its BeiDou-3 constellation, extending the system's coverage to the entire globe and further solidifying itself as a major player in the global satellite navigation market.

Q:Here's a question and a few possible answers:   Q: The bald eagle flew over the potato fields over what region of the place known for them? Possible A: alaska, hells canyon, south lake tahoe, central idaho, canada  Why is \\"central idaho\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","output":"\\"Central Idaho\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for several reasons. First and foremost, Idaho is widely known for its vast potato fields. The state of Idaho is the leading producer of potatoes in the United States, growing around one-third of the country's potatoes. Idaho's potato industry has a significant impact on its economy, and its potatoes are renowned for their high quality and taste. Therefore, it is sensible to associate potato fields with Idaho. Secondly, the bald eagle, which is the national bird and symbol of the United States, is also a common inhabitant of various regions in the country, including Idaho. The state's diverse landscape, which includes high mountain regions, forests, and rivers, provides an ideal habitat for bald eagles, as they need access to water and prey, such as fish. In Idaho, bald eagles can be found near lakes, reservoirs, and rivers, including protected areas within national forests and wildlife management areas. Among the other options in the question, some can be ruled out as less plausible, based on human common sense. For example, while Hells Canyon is located along the border of Idaho and Oregon, it is a deep gorge that follows the Snake River and is not an area typically known for agricultural production, let alone potato fields. South Lake Tahoe, situated in California near the border with Nevada, is known for its picturesque lake and ski resort, rather than potato farming. Alaska and Canada, being separate from the contiguous United States, are not the focus of a question inquiring about a \\"place known for [potato fields].\\" Furthermore, Idaho's climate, soil, and irrigation systems support the successful cultivation of potatoes. Idaho's central region, which includes the Snake River Plain, has a special combination of volcanic soil that is fertile and well-draining, and a climate that provides a consistent growing season with low humidity, which helps to control diseases and pests. Additionally, potatoes require ample water, and central Idaho's abundant water resources from rivers and reservoirs supplement irrigation needs for the area's vast potato fields. In summary, \\"central Idaho\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense due to its strong association with potato farming, the presence of bald eagles in the region, the suitability of Idaho's environment for potato cultivation, and the lesser plausibility of the other options provided. The coherence of these factors imbues the answer \\"central Idaho\\" with a sensibility that reflects common human understanding of the context provided in the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is a member of both the Pro Football Hall of Fame and College Football Hall of Fame.  - Florida State University (commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU) is an American public space-grant and sea-grant research university. Its primary campus is located on a 1,391.54-acre (5.631 km2) campus in Tallahassee, Florida, United States. It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida. Founded in 1851, it is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida.  - The Fred Biletnikoff Award is presented annually to the outstanding receiver in American college football by the Tallahassee Quarterback Club Foundation, Inc. (TQCF), an independent not-for-profit organization which created the award in 1994 and has sponsored it since. The award is named for Fred Biletnikoff, who played college football at Florida State University and professionally with the Oakland Raiders. Any NCAA Division I FBS player who catches the football through the forward pass is eligible to be selected as the award winner, although every winner since 1994 has been a wide receiver. A national selection committee consisting of over 540 journalists, commentators, broadcasters, and former players selects the award winner. No member of the board of trustees of the foundation has a vote.  - History. Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - A wide receiver (also referred to as wideouts or simply receivers) is an offensive position in American and Canadian football, and is the key player in most of the passing plays. They get their name because they are split out \\"wide\\" (near the sidelines), furthest away from the rest of the team. Wide receivers are among the fastest players on the field. The wide receiver functions as the pass-catching specialist.  - The Oakland Raiders are a professional American football franchise based in Oakland, California. The team commenced operations in 1960 as a member of the American Football League (AFL); they are currently members of the National Football League (NFL), which merged with the AFL in 1970. The Raiders currently compete in the NFL as a member club of the league's American Football Conference (AFC) West division and play their home games at the OaklandAlameda County Coliseum. At the end of the NFL's 2015 season, the Raiders boasted a lifetime regular season record of 444 wins, 397 losses, and 11 ties; their lifetime playoff record currently stands at 25 wins and 18 losses.

Question: Phoebe encounters who in the forest? Movie title: The Monster Squad Movie plot: The Monster Squad is a society of young pre-teens who idolize classic monsters and monster movies and hold their meetings in a tree clubhouse. Club leader Sean (Andre Gower), whose five-year-old sister Phoebe (Ashley Bank) desperately wants to join the club, is given the diary of legendary vampire hunter Abraham Van Helsing (Jack Gwillim) - but his excitement is toned down when he finds it's written in German. Sean, his best friend Patrick (Robby Kiger), and the rest of the Monster Squad visit an elderly man, known as the \\"Scary German Guy\\" (Leonardo Cimino), actually a kind gentleman, to translate the diary. When the Monster Squad wonders how the German man is knowledgeable about Van Helsing's battle with monsters, he wryly comments that \\"he has some experience with monsters\\" and his shirt sleeve briefly reveals a concentration camp tattoo.The diary describes, in great detail, an amulet that is composed of concentrated good. One day out of every century, as the forces of good and evil reach a balance, the otherwise indestructible amulet becomes vulnerable to destruction, and the next day of balance falls within a couple days, at the stroke of midnight. The kids realize they must gain possession of the amulet before the day of balance arrives; once they have the amulet, the kids can use it with an incantation from Van Helsing's diary to open a hole in the universe and cast the monsters into Limbo. As shown in the prelude, van Helsing had unsuccessfully attempted this one hundred years ago in order to defeat his old adversary Count Dracula; his apprentices then emigrated to the United States to hide the amulet, where it was out of Dracula's immediate reach.Dracula, meanwhile, seeks to obtain the amulet before the Monster Squad does, so that the Count can take control of the world and plunge it into darkness. To this end he assembles several monstrous allies: a mummy, and an amphibious gill-man, and a Wolfman, in addition to three school girls (Mary Albee, Joan-Carrol Baron, and Julie Merrill) whom the Count... Answer:","output":"The given film plot for \\"The Monster Squad\\" provides rich detail about the storyline, characters, and their encounters. However, it doesn't specifically mention who Phoebe encounters in the forest. This means I cannot provide a direct answer to your question based on the information given.  However, if I were to consider the full storyline of the film which isn't included here, it's known that Phoebe, the younger sister of the club leader Sean, encounters Frankenstein's Monster in the forest. This encounter is a crucial point in the movie as she befriends the Monster, who is perceived as a threat by the Monster Squad. This bond plays a significant role towards the end of the film. But, if you were to invest in a film proposal, you'd want to focus on a few factors beyond the script detail such as the production team's track record, the marketability of the story, and the potential for return on investment. Investing in a film is a risky business because a film's success isn't guaranteed and depends on a myriad of factors. So you might want to consider factors like the film's budget, the projected revenue, the team involved in the project (including actors, director, cinematographer and so on), and the potential audience for the film. This is in addition to the story detail (like who Phoebe encounters in the forest) which could affect the film's reception. The genre of the film, \\"The Monster Squad,\\" is a mix of horror and comedy, also known as horror-comedy, which has a niche but steady audience base. Moreover, investing in a remake or reboot of a film like \\"The Monster Squad\\"- if that's the proposal- comes with both opportunities (nostalgic fan base, already established storyline, characters and universe) and challenges (potential negative comparisons to the original, high expectations etc.).  To sum up, while character interactions and plot twists are important, they're just a piece of the puzzle.

Please write a short summary for the following article: NYPD officers in fresh assault claims: 'They were taking turns like a gang' The New York police department is facing renewed questions over the conduct of its personnel after a man alleged he was viciously assaulted without provocation by a group of uniformed officers. Santiago Hernandez, 23, claims that he was kicked, punched and zapped with pepper spray by up to six officers in 157th Street in the Bronx on 18 August. A video of his arrest captured by a nearby security camera and published by the local TV channel ABC 7 shows the police initially frisking him, then handcuffing him and finally piling on top of Hernandez as he lay on the sidewalk while apparently hitting him with batons. “They was taking turns on me. One kicks me, he steps back. Another one comes to punch me and he steps back. And another one comes and grabs my arm and hits me like 10 times with the baton. Another one comes and pepper sprayed me … they were taking turns like a gang,” he told ABC 7. The new allegations, that are being investigated by the NYPD’s internal affairs section, come at a difficult time for the force and its high-profile commissioner Bill Bratton. A grand jury has been called to decide whether to bring charges against an NYPD officer involved in the attempted arrest in Staten Island of Eric Garner for selling loose cigarettes. Garner, 43, died on 17 July as he was put in a chokehold – a procedure that has been banned in the force since 1993 – by officer Daniel Pantaleo, and was heard on video footage of the arrest saying, “I can’t breathe”. Last month a medical examiner found Garner had died of compression to his neck and chest, and declared his death a homicide. Bratton, whose career has been built upon his reputation for improving relations between law enforcers and the public, has has been rattled by the Garner death. In January he took up the job of NYPD chief, which he previously held in the 1990s, vowing to end the hostility that had been generated by the widely criticized “stop and frisk” policy. On Monday, Bratton faced two hours of questioning over the incident from the New York city council, focusing on the commissioner’s plans to retrain all 35,000 NYPD uniformed officers in how to make arrests with the minimum use of force. In addition to the training, the commissioner has also ordered the use of body cameras by some officers on patrol to record all their communications with individuals. Lawyers representing Hernandez in the new controversy have told ABC 7 that they will be bringing a civil complaint against the police. Hernandez, who is currently on parole having served six years in prison for gang assault, said he was left bruised by his treatment. He insists that all he did in the moments before he was allegedly assaulted was to ask officers simple questions such as why he was being searched and handcuffed. “I’m a person to ask questions. If I didn’t do nothing wrong, I’m trying to understand the reason,” he said. Summary:","output":"The New York Police Department (NYPD) is facing allegations of assault by a man who claims he was attacked without provocation by a group of uniformed officers. Santiago Hernandez alleges that he was kicked, punched, and pepper-sprayed by officers in the Bronx on August 18. The incident was captured on a nearby security camera and aired on local TV.

Here is the breakdown: 1. Subject: In both sentences, the subject is US 1.    Reasoning: US 1 refers to the same subject in both sentences - a main route in the highway system of the United States. 2. Time: In both sentences, the event takes place in 1977.    Reasoning: Both clearly specify that the changes occurred in the year 1977. 3. Action: In the first sentence, US 1 was 'moved' while in the second sentence US 1 was 'transferred'. Although these words differ, they mean virtually the same thing in this context.    Reasoning: Both 'moved' and 'transferred' mean a change in position, which fits the context of a roadway being re-routed. 4. Location: In both sentences, the new location of the US 1 includes Webster Avenue and the Cross Bronx Expressway.    Reasoning: Although the order and syntax of the locations are different in each sentence, they both describe the same locations. 5.

Why do US troops visit Tajikistan every so often?","output":"The text suggests that the United States Army and Marine Corps personnel periodically visit Tajikistan to conduct joint training missions. While the specific reasons are not detailed in the text, we can infer several likely reasons based on the given information and the general context. As the text indicates, Tajikistan is strategically located near Afghanistan, where the US has been engaged in military operations since 2001. Training in Tajikistan provides an opportunity for the US military personnel to adapt to the unique conditions and challenges that they might face in Afghanistan or similar operational environments. Joint training missions also facilitate inter-operability, allowing U.S. troops to work together with Tajik forces effectively. Tajikistan, being a part of NATO's Partnership for Peace program, shares the goal of promoting and maintaining stability in the Euro-Atlantic region. Therefore, these training missions could help the US and Tajikistan respond collectively to security threats.  The US has an interest in counterterrorism, especially given the proximity of Afghanistan, and these joint training sessions could thus enhance the counter-terrorism capabilities of both the US and Tajik forces. Furthermore, the joint exercises could also serve diplomatic purposes, creating a stronger rapport between the United States and Tajikistan, which could translate into broader military, political, and economic cooperation.    Lastly, training missions and visits may also be related to overseeing and ensuring the effective use of financial aid and military support the US provides to Tajikistan to help it secure its borders and combat transnational threats.

Loss of insect diversity and abundance is expected to provoke cascading effects on food webs and to jeopardize ecosystem services. Our understanding of the extent and underlying causes of this decline is based on the abundance of single species or taxonomic groups only, rather than changes in insect biomass which is more relevant for ecological functioning. Here, we used a standardized protocol to measure total insect biomass using Malaise traps, deployed over 27 years in 63 nature protection areas in Germany (96 unique location-year combinations) to infer on the status and trend of local entomofauna. Our analysis estimates a seasonal decline of 76%, and mid-summer decline of 82% in flying insect biomass over the 27 years of study. We show that this decline is apparent regardless of habitat type, while changes in weather, land use, and habitat characteristics cannot explain this overall decline. This yet unrecognized loss of insect biomass must be taken into account in evaluating declines in abundance of species depending on insects as a food source, and ecosystem functioning in the European landscape.

Introduction Loss of insects is certain to have adverse effects on ecosystem functioning, as insects play a central role in a variety of processes, including pollination [1, 2], herbivory and detrivory [3, 4], nutrient cycling [4] and providing a food source for higher trophic levels such as birds, mammals and amphibians. For example, 80% of wild plants are estimated to depend on insects for pollination [2], while 60% of birds rely on insects as a food source [5]. The ecosystem services provided by wild insects have been estimated at 57 billion annually in the USA [6]. Clearly, preserving insect abundance and diversity should constitute a prime conservation priority. Current data suggest an overall pattern of decline in insect diversity and abundance. For example, populations of European grassland butterflies are estimated to have declined by 50% in abundance between 1990 and 2011 [7]. Data for other well-studied taxa such as bees [8–14] and moths [15–18] suggest the same trend. Climate change, habitat loss and fragmentation, and deterioration of habitat quality have been proposed as some of the prime suspects responsible for the decline [9–11, 13, 18–22]. However, the number of studies on insect trends with sufficient replication and spatial coverage are limited [10, 23–25] and restricted to certain well-studied taxa. Declines of individual species or taxa (e.g. [7, 26]) may not reflect the general state of local entomofauna [27]. The total insect biomass would then be a better metric for the status of insects as a group and its contribution to ecosystem functioning, but very few studies have monitored insect biomass over an extensive period of time [28]. Hence, to what extent total insect biomass has declined, and the relative contribution of each proposed factor to the decline, remain unresolved yet highly relevant questions for ecosystem ecology and conservation. Here, we investigate total aerial insect biomass between 1989 and 2016 across 96 unique location-year combinations in Germany, representative of Western European low-altitude nature protection areas embedded in a human-dominated landscape (S1 Fig). In all years we sampled insects throughout the season (March through October), based on a standardized sampling scheme using Malaise traps. We investigated rate of decline in insect biomass, and examined how factors such as weather, habitat and land use variables influenced the declines. Knowledge on the state of insect biomass, and it’s direction over time, are of broad importance to ecology and conservation, but historical data on insect biomass have been lacking. Our study makes a first step into filling this gap, and provides information that is vital for the assessment of biodiversity conservation and ecosystem health in agricultural landscapes.      Discussion Our results document a dramatic decline in average airborne insect biomass of 76% (up to 82% in midsummer) in just 27 years for protected nature areas in Germany. This considerably exceeds the estimated decline of 58% in global abundance of wild vertebrates over a 42-year period to 2012 [56, 57]. Our results demonstrate that recently reported declines in several taxa such as butterflies [7, 25–27, 58], wild bees [8–14] and moths [15–18], are in parallel with a severe loss of total aerial insect biomass, suggesting that it is not only the vulnerable species, but the flying insect community as a whole, that has been decimated over the last few decades. The estimated decline is considerably more severe than the only comparable long term study on flying insect biomass elsewhere [28]. In that study, 12.2m high suction traps were deployed at four locations in the UK over the time period 1973–2002, and showed a biomass decline at one of the four sites only. However, the sampling designs differ considerably between the two studies. Suction traps mainly target high-flying insects, and in that study the catches were largely comprised of flies belonging to the Bibionidae family. Contrary, malaise traps as used in the present study target insects flying close to the ground surface (up to 1 meter), with a much wider diversity of taxa. Future investigations should look into how biomass is distributed among insect species, and how species trends contribute to the biomass decline. Although the present dataset spans a relatively large number of years (27) and sites (63), the number of repetitions (i.e. multiple years of seasonal distributions at the same locations) was lower (n = 26). We are however confident that our estimated rate of decline in total biomass resembles the true rate of decline, and is not an artifact of site selection. Firstly, our basic model (including an annual rate of decline) outperformed the null-model (without an annual rate of decline; ΔDIC = 822.62 units; Table 3), while at the same time, between-plot variation (i.s. σ site ) and residual variation (v) decreased by 44.3 and 9.7% respectively, after incorporating an annual rate of decline into the models. Secondly, using only data from sites at which malaise traps were operating in at least two years, we estimated a rate of decline similar to using the full dataset (Fig 4), with the pattern of decline being congruent across locations (S4 Fig). Taken together, there does not seem to be evidence that spatial variation (between sites) in this dataset forms a confounding factor to the estimated temporal trend, and conclude that our estimated biomass decline is representative for lowland protected areas in west Germany. In light of previously suggested driving mechanisms, our analysis renders two of the prime suspects, i.e. landscape [9, 18, 20] and climate change [15, 18, 21, 37], as unlikely explanatory factors for this major decline in aerial insect biomass in the investigated protected areas. Habitat change was evaluated in terms of changes in plant species composition surrounding the standardized trap locations, and in plant species characteristics (Ellenberg values). Land use changes was evaluated in terms of proportional surface changes in aerial photographs, and not for example changes in management regimes. Given the major decline in insect biomass of about 80%, much stronger relationships would have been expected if changes in habitat and land use were the driving forces, even with the somewhat crude parameters that were at our disposal. The decline in insect biomass, being evident throughout the growing season, and irrespective of habitat type or landscape configuration, suggests large-scale factors must be involved. While some temporal changes in climatic variables in our study area have taken place, these either were not of influence (e.g. wind speed), or changed in a manner that should have increased insect biomass (e.g temperature). However, we have not exhaustively analysed the full range of climatic variables that could potentially impact insect biomass. For example prolonged droughts, or lack of sunshine especially in low temperatures might have had an effect on insect biomass [59–62]. Agricultural intensification [17, 20] (e.g. pesticide usage, year-round tillage, increased use of fertilizers and frequency of agronomic measures) that we could not incorporate in our analyses, may form a plausible cause. The reserves in which the traps were placed are of limited size in this typical fragmented West-European landscape, and almost all locations (94%) are enclosed by agricultural fields. Part of the explanation could therefore be that the protected areas (serving as insect sources) are affected and drained by the agricultural fields in the broader surroundings (serving as sinks or even as ecological traps) [1, 63–65]. Increased agricultural intensification may have aggravated this reduction in insect abundance in the protected areas over the last few decades. Whatever the causal factors responsible for the decline, they have a far more devastating effect on total insect biomass than has been appreciated previously. The widespread insect biomass decline is alarming, ever more so as all traps were placed in protected areas that are meant to preserve ecosystem functions and biodiversity. While the gradual decline of rare insect species has been known for quite some time (e.g. specialized butterflies [9, 66]), our results illustrate an ongoing and rapid decline in total amount of airborne insects active in space and time. Agricultural intensification, including the disappearance of field margins and new crop protection methods has been associated with an overall decline of biodiversity in plants, insects, birds and other species in the current landscape [20, 27, 67]. The major and hitherto unrecognized loss of insect biomass that we report here for protected areas, adds a new dimension to this discussion, because it must have cascading effects across trophic levels and numerous other ecosystem effects. There is an urgent need to uncover the causes of this decline, its geographical extent, and to understand the ramifications of the decline for ecosystems and ecosystem services.

Insects are an integral part of life on Earth as both pollinators and prey for other wildlife and it was known that some species such as butterflies were declining. But the newly revealed scale of the losses to all insects has prompted warnings that the world is “on course for ecological Armageddon”, with profound impacts on human society.      Share your pictures of insects around the world Read more      The new data was gathered in nature reserves across Germany but has implications for all landscapes dominated by agriculture, the researchers said.      The cause of the huge decline is as yet unclear, although the destruction of wild areas and widespread use of pesticides are the most likely factors and climate change may play a role. The scientists were able to rule out weather and changes to landscape in the reserves as causes, but data on pesticide levels has not been collected.      “The fact that the number of flying insects is decreasing at such a high rate in such a large area is an alarming discovery,” said Hans de Kroon, at Radboud University in the Netherlands and who led the new research.      “Insects make up about two-thirds of all life on Earth [but] there has been some kind of horrific decline,” said Prof Dave Goulson of Sussex University, UK, and part of the team behind the new study. “We appear to be making vast tracts of land inhospitable to most forms of life, and are currently on course for ecological Armageddon. If we lose the insects then everything is going to collapse.”      The research, published in the journal Plos One, is based on the work of dozens of amateur entomologists across Germany who began using strictly standardised ways of collecting insects in 1989. Special tents called malaise traps were used to capture more than 1,500 samples of all flying insects at 63 different nature reserves.      Facebook Twitter Pinterest The malaise traps set in protected areas and reserves, which scientists say makes the declines even more worrying. Photograph: Courtesy of Courtesy of Entomologisher Verein Krefeld      When the total weight of the insects in each sample was measured a startling decline was revealed. The annual average fell by 76% over the 27 year period, but the fall was even higher – 82% – in summer, when insect numbers reach their peak.      Previous reports of insect declines have been limited to particular insects, such European grassland butterflies, which have fallen by 50% in recent decades. But the new research captured all flying insects, including wasps and flies which are rarely studied, making it a much stronger indicator of decline.      The fact that the samples were taken in protected areas makes the findings even more worrying, said Caspar Hallmann at Radboud University, also part of the research team: “All these areas are protected and most of them are well-managed nature reserves. Yet, this dramatic decline has occurred.”      The amateur entomologists also collected detailed weather measurements and recorded changes to the landscape or plant species in the reserves, but this could not explain the loss of the insects. “The weather might explain many of the fluctuations within the season and between the years, but it doesn’t explain the rapid downward trend,” said Martin Sorg from the Krefeld Entomological Society in Germany, who led the amateur entomologists.      Goulson said a likely explanation could be that the flying insects perish when they leave the nature reserves. “Farmland has very little to offer for any wild creature,” he said. “But exactly what is causing their death is open to debate. It could be simply that there is no food for them or it could be, more specifically, exposure to chemical pesticides, or a combination of the two.”      In September, a chief scientific adviser to the UK government warned that regulators around the world have falsely assumed that it is safe to use pesticides at industrial scales across landscapes and that the “effects of dosing whole landscapes with chemicals have been largely ignored”.      The scientists said further work is urgently needed to corroborate the new findings in other regions and to explore the issue in more detail. While most insects do fly, it may be that those that don’t, leave nature reserves less often and are faring better. It is also possible that smaller and larger insects are affected differently, and the German samples have all been preserved and will be further analysed.      In the meantime, said De Kroon: “We need to do less of the things that we know have a negative impact, such as the use of pesticides and the disappearance of farmland borders full of flowers.”      Facebook Twitter Pinterest As well as being pollinators insects provide food for birds and other animals and help control pests. Photograph: Kevin Elsby/Alamy      Lynn Dicks at the University of East Anglia, UK, and not involved in the new research said the work was convincing. “It provides important new evidence for an alarming decline that many entomologists have suspected is occurring for some time.”      “If total flying insect biomass is genuinely declining at this rate – about 6% per year – it is extremely concerning,” she said. “Flying insects have really important ecological functions, for which their numbers matter a lot. They pollinate flowers: flies, moths and butterflies are as important as bees for many flowering plants, including some crops. They provide food for many animals – birds, bats, some mammals, fish, reptiles and amphibians. Flies, beetles and wasps are also predators and decomposers, controlling pests and cleaning up the place generally.”      Climate change could wipe out a third of parasite species, study finds Read more      Another way of sampling insects – car windscreens – has often been anecdotally used to suggest a major decline, with people remembering many more bugs squashed on their windscreens in the past.      “I think that is real,” said Goulson. “I drove right across France and back this summer – just when you’d expect your windscreen to be splattered all over – and I literally never had to stop to clean the windscreen.” ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"A new study has found that the number of flying insects has declined by 76% over the past 27 years. The scale of the drop has alarmed scientists who stress that insects are essential for pollination and as a food source for other animals. The research, carried out in nature reserves across Germany, is the first to study all flying insects, including rarely studied species such as wasps and flies, rather than just specific groups such as butterflies. The cause of the loss remains unknown, but habitat destruction, pesticide use and climate change may all play a part."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Article: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. Question: What is the passage mainly about? Answer: OPT: A).

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Step 1: Identify the information in the first sentence. In the first sentence, the speaker is discussing the cost of something. They mention that the last time they looked at the cost, it was about a dollar fifty one way. They also decided against doing it because \\"fast isn't that bad yet.\\" Step 2: Identify the information in the second sentence. The second sentence states that \\"it cost me about a dollar fifty one way,\\" which is a clear, concise statement about the cost of something. Step 3: Compare the information in both sentences. Both sentences mention the cost of something being about a dollar fifty one way. This piece of information is consistent between both sentences. Step 4: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first. Since the core information about the cost being a dollar fifty one way is present in both sentences, we can conclude that the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, as it accurately represents part of the first sentence's information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Think outside the box, whilst inside the box (studio): As this studio is about working with constraints, I thought i’d google ‘constraints in filmmaking’ and see what comes up. One of the first links was to a journal article by Heidi Philipsen entitled ‘Constraints in Film Making Processes Offer an Exercise to the Imagination’. Interestingly enough the first sentence of her article states: “I would like filmmakers interested in thinking “outside the box” to recognize that they can benefit from being placed “inside a box.” I wonder if Paul had contemplated this whilst choosing the name for this studio. Throughout her article Philipsen challenges the notion that creativity is an intangible innate quality, existing within the mind of one source, but rather creativity arises from a multitude of sources. Alike all things shared she suggests that creativity is easier to enhance by changing environmental conditions, rather than encouraging people to ‘think more creatively’. Perceiving creativity in this way allows you to see it as an organisationally influenced phenomenon, rather than a psychological  and individual phenomenon. Which enables you to have more control over creativity and to encourage creativity once being aware of how it can be environmentally enhanced. As Csikzentmihalyi (1996) states “a genuinely creative accomplishment is almost never the result of a sudden insight, a lightbulb flashing on in the dark, but comes after years of hard work”. Constraints, as Philipsen suggests is one such way to manipulate the environment to enhance creativity. Students who attended The Film School in Denmark, who were forced into working with constraints for their  projects eventually considered constraints to be both useful and inspirational. Such constraints included: making a scene with a specific theme, within a specific deadline and with other specific conditions concerning the use of camera, sound, actors etc. Students stated that these constraints ultimately made them feel secure, inspired and focused and...

What are the most important words in the following sentence:  two sub trains sitting on tracks next to a station","output":"The most important words in the sentence \\"Two sub trains sitting on tracks next to a station\\" are: 1. Sub trains: This phrase is the central subject of the sentence. It specifies the type of transportation being discussed, and knowing that they are sub trains immediately helps form a mental picture of the scene being described. Additionally, the number \\"two\\" is an important detail about the quantity of sub trains. 2. Tracks: The presence of tracks in the sentence is crucial as it denotes the infrastructure on which the sub trains are situated. Mentioning tracks emphasizes the close relationship between the sub trains and the railway system, while also implying that the trains are stationary or temporarily not in motion. 3. Station: The station is a key component of this sentence as it establishes the context for the location of the sub trains. By specifying that the sub trains are next to a station, the sentence conveys important information about their purpose (picking up or dropping off passengers) and their current state (waiting, preparing to depart, or having just arrived). The connection between the sub trains and the station adds meaning and context to the overall sentence. Overall, \\"sub trains,\\" \\"tracks,\\" and \\"station\\" are the most important words in this sentence as they provide essential information about the subject and the context of the scene being described."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule.  The menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.

Step 1: Analyze the question. The question asks which evolutionary changes were the most important to Charles Darwin, the person who proposed the theory of evolution by natural selection. Step 2: Analyze the given statement. The statement provided, \\"Darwin discusses contemporary opinions on the origins of different breeds under cultivation to argue that many have been produced from common ancestors by selective breeding,\\" is related to Darwin's ideas on the role of selective breeding in the production of various domesticated breeds. Step 3: Compare the statement with Darwin's key evolutionary concepts. Selective breeding is an important aspect which illustrates how human intervention can lead to changes in species over generations. However, it is only a part of the overall theory of evolution by natural selection. The most important evolutionary changes to Darwin are those related to natural selection, adaptation, and the struggle for existence. Step 4: Check if the statement correctly answers the question. While the statement addresses a concept Darwin discussed, it mainly focuses on selective breeding and does not include aspects like natural selection, adaptation, or the struggle for existence. Therefore, the statement does not fully and comprehensively answer the question about the most important evolutionary changes to Darwin.

Question: suppose customers are not buying the products happens, how will it affect less chemical compounds produced.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"When customers are not buying the products, there is a direct influence on the production rate and demand for those products. In this case, businesses will adjust their manufacturing processes and decrease the production of these goods. As a result, this decrease in production will lead to less chemical compounds being generated by human industry. With reduced manufacturing activities, fewer pollutants and harmful chemicals will be emitted into the atmosphere. Consequently, there will be fewer chemical compounds released into the air, which lessens their chances of mixing with elements in clouds and forming acid rain. Now, let's analyze how this perturbation affects the second effect mentioned. The second effect is the interaction of chemical compounds with elements in clouds, which leads to the formation of acid rain. Since there are fewer chemical compounds being produced and subsequently released into the atmosphere, there will be a lower likelihood of these compounds mixing with elements in the clouds. This leads to a lesser formation of acid rain, significantly reducing its harmful effects on natural and man-made objects. The perturbation caused by customers not buying products has a direct influence on all the subsequent effects of chemical compounds production. By reducing the overall production of harmful compounds, we witness a domino effect that ultimately results in less acid rain being formed. Therefore, the supposed perturbation has a \\"less\\" effect on the second effect mentioned, as fewer chemical compounds in the atmosphere result in less acid rain formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Recall the relevant historical event: In this case, I know that the war being referred to is the Iran-Iraq War, which took place from 1980 to 1988. 2. Analyze period of time: During the 1980s, the United States had negative relations with Iran, particularly after the 1979 Islamic Revolution and the Iran hostage crisis. As a result, it is unlikely that the U.S. would have supported Iran in any conflict. 3. Determine the likely U.S. ally: Since Iraq was the other major power involved in the Iran-Iraq War, it becomes clear that the United States supported Iraq in its conflict against Iran. 4. Consider current historical knowledge: Recent declassified documents and information from public records have confirmed that the U.S. provided military and financial support to Iraq during the Iran-Iraq War.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  a giant caterpillar  for the following movie plot:  La Classe de NeigeA grey Renault is being driven along a highway leading into the mountains. Nicolas (Clement van den Bergh), a boy of about twelve, is sitting in the back seat, napping. On the dashboard are photos of Nicolas, his little brother Tom, and his mother. His father (François Roy) is driving.A teacher, Miss Grimm (Emmanuelle Bercot), is orienting parents, telling them what their children will need for a stay at an outdoor education centre in the mountains. Nicolass parents arrive late, and scoff at the idea of not telephoning their son while he is away. The father reminds everyone of a group of schoolchildren who were recently killed in a horrible bus accident, and asks what guarantee they have that their children will be safe. Miss Grimm says matter-of-factly that there is Nothing. The father announces that he will drive Nicolas himself, claiming that his son arriving in his fathers car will not make him an outcast.On the drive to the class trip, the father offers to stop for gas so that Nicolas will at last have enough redemption points to get the gift he has been eager to have: a flap book of human anatomy. The father asks Nicolas if he feels he deserves it.Nicolas is anxious he might wet the bed. His father expects him to put an undersheet on his bed in front of the other boys, and dismisses his apprehension with: You cant be the only one.Nicolas wakes from a nap when backed-up traffic finally gets to move past a bad road accident. Nicolas stares at the mangled cars, while his father concentrates on driving. Nicolas recalls the family watching on television the gruesome news coverage of the recent bus accident.They arrive at the outdoor education centre, where a class is already in progress. They can see Hodkann, the class tearaway (Lokman Nalcakan), acting up. The father prompts Nicolas for a better kiss good-bye, and parts awkwardly.Miss Grimm has said they will need snow to ski, but that they will have fun in any case. Nicolas recalls a visit to a fun fair six months before. He had wanted to... The answer is:","output":"Given the plot provided for \\"La Classe de Neige\\", the question could be formulated as follows:  \\"In a dream-induced or fantasy sequence within the movie, if Nicolas encounters any unusual, perhaps giant creature symbolic of his fears and undermined yet growing self-awareness, what might that creature be?\\" The answer to this is a giant caterpillar.  In the context of the story, a giant caterpillar could represent many things. Caterpillars are creatures in transition, just as Nicolas is transitioning from childhood to the cusp of adolescence. He is heading into a period of significant change - the class trip - which might transform him in the way a caterpillar transforms into a butterfly. A caterpillar must first endure a period of vulnerability and seclusion (the cocoon stage), just as Nicolas must navigate an unfamiliar and potentially uncomfortable environment on his school trip.  Moreover, the giant caterpillar can symbolize the tremendous burdens or fears Nicolas carries inside him, especially regarding wetting his bed or the pressure from his father. The 'giant' aspect emphasizes how these issues weigh on him, seemingly magnifying as he confronts them alone and away from home at the outdoor educational center.  Furthermore, using this creature - a caterpillar - a typically small and nondescript insect, when made giant, can symbolize the disproportionate magnitude of Nicolas's fears and discomforts compared to what is generally expected from a child his age.  This dream or fantasy encounter with a 'giant caterpillar' could serve as a crucial part of the narrative for Nicolas's self-discovery, realization of personal courage, and initiation of his journey towards self maturity amidst his challenging circumstances."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But when I went back to actually start my treatment I had a new orthodontist already.  That should have been my first red flag to not come back.  It took twice as long to get my trays as they had estimated, and when I'd call to check the status it was as if I was calling for the first time.  No one knew what was going on, they said they'd call Clear Correct but I'd never get a return phone call.  I finally had to have a stern talk with the office manager which seemed to finally help my case.  But regardless, getting the actual trays took about 12 weeks instead of their 6-8 week estimate. Once I started my trays, the orthodontist and everyone that worked there was very friendly and helpful. It wasn't until about a year later (2011) that things started to shift to an unorganized mess.  My (2nd) orthodontist left, I went through two other orthodontists within a matter 6 weeks, their recommendations and consultation on my trays were very inconsistent.

Background: Atmospheric convection is the result of a parcel-environment instability, or temperature difference layer in the atmosphere. Different lapse rates within dry and moist air masses lead to instability. Mixing of air during the day which expands the height of the planetary boundary layer leads to increased winds, cumulus cloud development, and decreased surface dew points. Moist convection leads to thunderstorm development, which is often responsible for severe weather throughout the world. Special threats from thunderstorms include hail, downbursts, and tornadoes.  Paragraph: Burr township is situated on the western side of the ridge, at a lower altitude, and is experiencing atmospheric convection every once in a while, while Jolt township, on the eastern side,  has a less windy, less cloudy environment and is situated at a higher altitude.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena? A:","output":"Jolt township is experiencing fewer atmospheric convection phenomena compared to Burr township. This is because Jolt township is located at a higher altitude on the eastern side of the ridge, which correlates with a less windy and less cloudy environment. Since atmospheric convection is influenced by factors such as temperature differences, wind patterns, and cloud development, the location and conditions in Jolt township result in reduced chances of atmospheric convection, leading to fewer occurrences of this phenomenon in comparison to Burr township."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process:  - A plant grows near or on a rock - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more time occurs happens, how will it affect LESS or SLOWER weathering occurring.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation would have an effect on the process, potentially leading to less or slower weathering occurring.  Weathering, including the one contributed by plants, is a slow process that takes place over a long period of time. If we increase the time scale, we allow more chances for the process of weathering to occur; however, the rate of weathering does not necessarily speed up as time increases. The rate of weathering is influenced by many factors, including the hardness of the rock, the type and abundance of vegetation, the climate, and the amount of time the rock material is exposed to the weathering process. In the scenario you've presented where a plant grows near or on a rock, over time, the plant's roots can penetrate the rock, and along with the plant's natural acids, gradually break the rock apart. However, if a perturbation such as the changes in plant growth behaviors happens (maybe due to disease, changes in environment, or other), the plant's function in weathering could decrease. For instance, if plant growth is slower or the plant died, the roots would not be able to break the rock as efficiently, leading to slower weathering process. Furthermore, if the balance of plant acids changes, less rock might be dissolved over the same time span. In terms of indirect effects, a decrease in plant-mediated weathering might also impact the overall rate of erosion since less fragmented rocks coud be less susceptible to being carried away by rainwater or wind. As a result, you might observe less or slower weathering over longer periods of time with this perturbation. It's important to note that this is a simplification of complex natural processes, and real-world scenarios could be influenced by a host of interconnected factors. But in general, any perturbations that reduce the effectiveness of the plant's rock-breaking actions could lead to less or slower weathering."},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Pete Rose,the famous baseball player,whom I have never met,taught me something so valuable that it changed my life.Pete was being interviewed in spring training the year he was about to break Ty Cobb's alltime hits record.One reporter asked, \\"Pete,you only need 78 hits to break the record.How many atbats   do you think you'll need to get the 78 hits?\\" Without hesitation,Pete said,\\"78.\\" The reporter yelled back,\\"Ah,come on Pete.You don't expect to get 78 hits in 78 atbats,do you?\\" Mr. Rose calmly shared his rule in life with all the reporters who were anxiously awaiting his reply.\\"Every time I step up to the plate,I expect to get a hit!

But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear   unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip.

Celenda's manservant had purchased two of the biggest and strongest oxen in Fena Kef and they now roasted over the hall's two huge braziers. The smell filled Celenda's nostrils. She closed her eyes and laid back on her silk divan, enjoying the sights and sounds. Her finger fiddled with a torn seam on the divan's armrest and her pleasure faded. She would have flogged her seamstress for allowing such a thing but the woman had fled a year ago. She could barely afford clothing acceptable to a woman of her position, though few could say for certain what that position was, so she simply wore less clothes overall. She raised her arms behind her back and let the warmth of the braziers flow over her body. Though the number shrank, many still enjoyed Celenda's frequent celebrations. Some laughed and shouted on one side, some coupled in the dark shadows and behind silk curtains. Most feasted and drank and everyone partook in the red lotus. Celenda beckoned a thin slave boy, one of her last few, and he came holding a bronze bowl. Dried red leaves covered the bottom of the bowl. 'Why is this bowl not full?' she shouted at the boy. He cringed but she could tell he was not really frightened. She could not afford to injure or kill him and everyone knew it. She slapped him, but not hard. If she hit too hard she would find herself with one less slave along with her diminishing supply of the red leaf. Instantly the thoughts of the crumbling villa, the torn furniture, and the diminishing coffers fled from her mind. Euphoria flowed in. She felt it in her fingers and toes.

Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Ticino , formally the Republic and Canton of Ticino (;  ; see also in other languages) is the southernmost canton of Switzerland. Ticino borders the Canton of Uri to the north, Valais to the west (through the Novena Pass), Graubünden to the northeast, Italy's regions of Piedmont and Lombardy to the south and it surrounds the small Italian exclave of Campione d'Italia.  - Switzerland, officially the Swiss Confederation, is a federal republic in Europe. It consists of 26 cantons, and the city of Bern is the seat of the federal authorities.  The country is situated in Western-Central Europe, and is bordered by Italy to the south, France to the west, Germany to the north, and Austria and Liechtenstein to the east. Switzerland is a landlocked country geographically divided between the Alps, the Swiss Plateau and the Jura, spanning an area of . While the Alps occupy the greater part of the territory, the Swiss population of approximately eight million people is concentrated mostly on the plateau, where the largest cities are to be found: among them are the two global cities and economic centres Zürich and Geneva.  - In the study of human settlements, an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central place (\\"usually a municipality\\") and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself.  - International education can mean many different things and its definition is debated. Some have defined two general meanings according to its involvement of students. The first refers to education that transcends national borders by the exchange of people, for example, by students travelling to study at an international branch campus, as part of a study abroad program or as part of a student exchange program. The second is a comprehensive approach to education that intentionally prepares students to be active and engaged participants in an interconnected world.  - Lugano  is a city in southern Switzerland in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino bordering Italy. It has a population of 71,500, and an urban agglomeration over 145,000. The 9th largest Swiss city, it is the largest in Ticino and largest with an Italian speaking majority outside Italy.  - Fleming College Florence was a two - year coeducational program that granted an Associate of Arts degree . Originally founded in Lugano , Switzerland in 1968 , the college relocated in 1972 to Torre Di Gattaia , just off Viale Michelangelo on a hill above to Florence , Italy .

The answer to this question is:","output":"- they make it increase Hurricanes have a significant impact on the amount of water contained in bodies of water. As massive storm systems, hurricanes bring torrential rains, powerful winds, and storm surges that can cause water levels to rise dramatically in affected areas. One of the primary ways in which hurricanes cause an increase in water levels is through heavy rainfall. As a hurricane moves over the ocean, it collects moisture from the warmer waters below and continuously adds it to the storm system. As the hurricane moves inland or interacts with land masses, it can drop tremendous amounts of fresh water in the form of rain. Depending on the size and intensity of the hurricane, this can lead to localized or widespread flooding in coastal areas or around bodies of water. Another way that hurricanes cause water levels to rise is through storm surges. A storm surge is a rise in sea level that occurs when strong winds from a hurricane push ocean water toward the coast. As the hurricane makes landfall, the storm surge can cause a large volume of water to move inland rapidly, flooding nearby bodies of water and potentially causing them to overflow. The combination of rapidly rising water levels and powerful waves can cause significant erosion and damage to coastlines and natural barriers, further increasing the influx of water into inland areas. Furthermore, hurricanes can impact the natural flow and drainage of water systems in the affected areas, causing temporary or permanent changes in the amount of water contained in rivers, lakes, or other bodies of water. For example, flooding caused by a hurricane can overwhelm storm drains and other municipal infrastructure, causing water to back up and spread into adjacent bodies of water. Overall, the best answer to the question of what hurricanes do to the amount of water contained in bodies of water is that they make it increase. This increase in water levels can lead to numerous environmental, economic, and social consequences, such as flooding, property damage, and displacement of communities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

During the late 19th and early 20th century, the Athenian theatre scene was dominated by revues, musical comedies, operettas and nocturnes and notable playwrights included Spyridon Samaras, Dionysios Lavrangas, Theophrastos Sakellaridis and others.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: What influence did the Italian opera have on the Greek theater? The answer to this question is:","output":"The Italian opera had a significant influence on the Greek theater, particularly in its early years following Greek independence in the 19th century. This influence can especially be seen in the development of the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama. The introduction of Italian opera elements into Greek theater proved to be highly popular and its impact can be observed in various aspects of the Greek theater's evolution. The Nobile Teatro di San Giacomo di Corfù, the first theatre and opera house of modern Greece, played a major role in bringing Italian opera influence to the country. This was the venue where the first-ever Greek opera, Spyridon Xyndas' The Parliamentary Candidate, was performed. The opera was notable for being based on a Greek libretto, but its underlying structure, style, and form were rooted in the Italian operatic tradition. During the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Italian opera's influence further permeated Greek theater, as it was dominated by various forms of musical entertainment, including revues, musical comedies, operettas, and nocturnes. Iconic Greek playwrights of this era, such as Spyridon Samaras, Dionysios Lavrangas, and Theophrastos Sakellaridis, were also influenced by Italian opera styles, integrating them into their respective works. In summary, the Italian opera served as a major influence on Greek theater, particularly during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Its introduction and integration into the Greek theater scene helped shape the development of the Heptanesean theatre and melodrama, contributing to the creation of new forms of musical entertainment and impacting the works of several significant Greek playwrights."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question.

Write a title for this article: A detailed transition plan for Syria, committing the country to democratic and religious pluralism, has been unveiled by an alliance of moderate opposition groups. The move comes as the UK foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, urges Russia to end its support for the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad. The High Negotiation Committee (HNC), an umbrella body representing more than 30 political and military forces seeking to wrest power from Assad, unveiled its 25-page plan at a meeting in London. Johnson and his counterparts from the EU, Turkey, the US and Gulf states, were in attendance. Prior to becoming foreign secretary, Johnson had been sceptical about the value of supporting the Syrian opposition, saying there was a case for making common cause with Assad to defeat Islamic State. But Johnson has now embraced the HNC statement. In his first intervention on the Syria issue as foreign secretary, he has challenged Russia to help depose Assad. His comments mark a change of tone from March, when he praised the Kremlin for aiding Assad after Syrian troops saved the world heritage site of Palmyra from destruction by Isis. In an article for Wednesday’s edition of the Times, Johnson writes that Russia’s “seemingly indefensible” military efforts in Syria are keeping in power the “one man who bears overwhelming responsibility” for the civil war. He points to the HNC’s transition plan as an answer to what will replace Assad – “a safe space, free from terror, to which migrants can return”. The new Syrian blueprint may also persuade Hillary Clinton it is worth investing political capital in seeking a solution in Syria, and not to dismiss the five-year civil war as a battle between two equally unsavoury anti-democratic forces. In the US presidential campaign, Clinton, the Democratic candidate, has said little about her plans for Syria, the biggest foreign policy headache facing the new administration, but she is seen as more interventionist than Barack Obama. Some Clinton foreign policy aides have been proposing a Syrian partition. The HNC blueprint sets out a six-month negotiating process leading to a single transitional governing body responsible for overseeing a unitary decentralised state, leading within 18 months to parliamentary presidential and municipal elections. The vision makes an unambiguous pledge to commit to democratic non-sectarian values. Assad and his immediate clique would be excluded from the transitional body. Salem al-Meslet, spokesman for the HNC, said: “We need a lasting solution to Syria’s nightmare, not local ceasefires or temporary cessations that can be exploited by the regime and its Russian ally. “The only way to a lasting solution is through political transition, through the United Nations. That is, transition from state terrorism to a country governed according to a social contract for all the Syrian people.” The vision promises to “build a political system that protects freedoms, safeguards individual rights, and that is founded upon the principles of liberty, equality, citizenship, and justice”. It promises all Syrian groups will be represented “without discrimination or exclusion based on religion, sect, ethnicity, or class” in one homeland “where women can enjoy their full public and individual rights and are ensured constitutionally protected active contribution in all state institutions and decision-making bodies and positions by at least a 30% quota”. It also proposes that the caretaker transitional governing body form a joint military council under its authority, which would include representatives from the revolutionary forces and the regime army “who have not stained their hands with Syrian blood”. It stresses it is not seeking swaths of the Syrian state officials to quit in the kind of disastrous clear-out of thousands of regime officials that led to chaos and sectarian reprisals in Iraq in 2003. The plan addresses the need for a national dialogue and addresses the inevitable tension between the need for accountability for war crimes, and the need for political reconciliation. Diplomatic advocates of the vision say “it is a positive vision for Syria … it is extremely pragmatic, very heavy on continuity, inclusivity, excluding only a very few … it should reassure the Syrian middle that supports neither Assad or the extremists. This is an attempt to tell the international community there is a way though this conflict.” The document also sets out plans for the right of refugees to return and national reconciliation programmes to deter reprisals and ensure rights of all citizens. Writing in the Times, Johnson describes Assad as a recruiting sergeant for Islamic State and says the HNC document is the first credible portrait of Syria without Assad. He praises the HNC vision as “democratic and pluralistic, but which also makes the commonsensical assumption that you cannot just sweep away all the existing structures of the state. That was (one of) the mistakes in Iraq, and it will not be repeated.” But the plan is likely to be dismissed as a pipe dream in view of the battles and sieges raging across Syria at present, as well as the apparent unwillingness of Russia to use its influence with Assad to end his destructive air bombardment and instead reopen talks about a political transition away from his regime. There are also questions about the extent to which the HNC still speaks for the military factions inside Syria fighting Assad and Isis, including the Kurdish YPG. But diplomats supportive of the HNC say all the moderate Syrian fighting forceshave been consulted and agree with document. It is also expected that at Wednesday’s meeting, the Turkish foreign minister will call for international support for a no-fly zone in northern Syria. Turkey’s offensive into northern Syria has driven Isis militants from the last 55-mile (90km) strip of border territory that they controlled. The country now wants international support for a deeper operation to take control of a rectangle of territory stretching about 25 miles into Syria – a buffer between two Kurdish-held cantons to the east and west and against Isis to the south.

Given the question: If energy enters organisms and their habitat in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds, then what does energy enter in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds?  Answer choices: - Generating heat  - volume  - colors of the spectrum  - organisms and their habitat  - density  - Transfers energy  - gravity  - it helps plants in growing The answer is:","output":"Organisms and their habitat, and it helps plants in growing. Energy entering organisms and their habitat in the form of sunlight or chemical compounds is a fundamental aspect of life on Earth. The primary source of energy for most organisms and their habitats is sunlight, which is transformed into usable energy through the process of photosynthesis. Chemical compounds can also provide energy, particularly in the case of chemosynthetic bacteria that live in extreme environments, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents. Sunlight, which consists of various colors in the visible spectrum, is essential for the growth and survival of autotrophic organisms, such as plants, algae, and some bacteria. Photosynthetic organisms, or autotrophs, capture light energy from the sun and convert it into chemical energy via photosynthesis. This chemical energy is stored in the form of glucose, which can be used for growth, reproduction, and other essential life processes. In the process of photosynthesis, light energy from the sun is absorbed by chlorophyll, a green pigment found in the chloroplasts of plant cells and photosynthetic bacteria. This light energy is then used to split water molecules into their constituent components – oxygen and hydrogen. The oxygen is released as a waste product, while the hydrogen is used to convert carbon dioxide from the atmosphere into glucose through a series of chemical reactions known as the Calvin cycle. This glucose can then be used by other organisms in the habitat, such as herbivores, who consume the photosynthetic organisms as a source of food. This energy transfer continues up the food chain, as predators eat herbivores, and so on, forming a web of interconnected organisms that make up a functioning ecosystem. This process ultimately enables the efficient utilization and transfer of energy within the habitat, supporting a diverse range of life. Chemical compounds can also serve as energy sources for certain organisms, as in the case of chemosynthetic bacteria. These bacteria are capable of obtaining energy from the oxidation of inorganic chemical compounds, such as hydrogen sulfide, found in deep-sea hydrothermal vents. In these environments, sunlight is inaccessible, and the bacteria must rely on these chemical compounds to generate energy. This energy is then used to fix carbon dioxide into glucose, supplying other organisms in these unique ecosystems with a source of energy. In summary, energy enters organisms and their habitat in the form of sunlight and chemical compounds, playing a crucial role in the growth and survival of both autotrophic and heterotrophic life forms. This energy is transformed and utilized in various ways, ultimately supporting the complex web of life that constitutes a thriving and diverse ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Wearing black T-shirts and yellow ribbons, the symbols of the city's democracy movement, they have taken to the streets in response to a decision by the senior Chinese leadership to set out clear limits on who can run for the position of chief executive, Hong Kong's top leader, in 2017. The rules make it virtually impossible for anyone not trusted by the Chinese government to stand for election. As a result, the protesters accuse Beijing of reneging on decades of vows to give Hong Kong people genuine democracy. But although there is widespread anger that Beijing may have violated the spirit of the agreements it has made, there is intense debate over whether it has violated the letter of the law. Alan Hoo, a top barrister and expert on the Basic Law, the city constitution, told BBC News that China had not broken any promises. \\"I think that its position is grossly misunderstood,\\" he says. \\"Firstly, it's not a promise. It is a legal obligation, a constitutional obligation that they put in the Basic Law.\\" Mr Hoo, chairman of the Basic Law Institute and a well-known pro-Beijing figure in Hong Kong, is referring to Article 45 of the Basic Law, which refers specifically to one person, one vote. \\"The ultimate aim is the selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures,\\" it says. It is Beijing's conservative interpretation of that line that has brought tens of thousands of protesters onto the streets. According to the rules announced at the end of August by the Standing Committee of China's parliament, candidates for chief executive must gain the support of a majority of a nominating committee. There can be only two to three candidates. CY Leung, the current chief executive, has further clarified that the nominating committee will be modelled on the existing election committee - composed of members largely loyal to Beijing - that selected him in 2012. \\"The people on the streets are asking for the right to nominate,\\" says Mr Hoo. \\"Universal suffrage, under the international covenant, means that there are express rights to elect or be elected. There is no express right to nominate.\\" This argument is disputed by those, including the former Hong Kong governor Chris Patten, who accuse the Chinese government of refusing to live up to its commitments by hiding behind flexible legal language. Years before the then British colony was returned to China in 1997, a number of senior Chinese leaders had assured the Hong Kong public that one person, one vote would be in its future. In a comment in the official People's Daily newspaper in March 1993, Lu Ping, then the director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said: \\"How Hong Kong develops its democracy in the future is entirely within the autonomy of Hong Kong.\\" And in a letter written in May 1984, then Premier Zhao Ziyang promised university students in Hong Kong that protecting the people's democratic rights was a basic principle of the government. He assured them that there would, someday, be democratic rule in Hong Kong. But just five years later, Mr Zhao, a relatively liberal-minded leader, would be punished for siding with the student demonstrators on Tiananmen Square, spending the rest of his life under house arrest. Emily Lau, chairwoman of the city's Democratic Party, believes those previous promises should still be honoured. She says universal suffrage should mean voters be given a choice of candidates from different political persuasions. North Korea and Iran also have one person, one vote, she says, but a sharply restricted list of candidates. \\"Are we going to be like Iran or North Korea?\\" she asks. \\"No, we are Hong Kong. We want to go by international standards and give voters a genuine choice.\\" The demonstrators say that, for the crowds to recede, the Hong Kong and Chinese governments must listen to the voices of the people. They argue that the general public are, at heart, pragmatic people who understand they are ultimately Chinese citizens. Ms Lau adds: \\"Whoever is elected by the Hong Kong people to be chief executive, I am quite sure that person would love China and love Hong Kong and would be able to defend the interest of the Hong Kong people and would also be able to work with Beijing. \\"Such people exist. Just give us some space, so that they can be nominated.  And allow the people to elect.\\" Q&A: Hong Kong's democracy controversy What is a summary of this text?","output":"The ongoing debate over Hong Kong's democracy and its future elections revolves around the interpretation of the city's Basic Law, specifically Article 45. Beijing has set rules for the selection of Hong Kong's chief executive that prioritize candidates trusted by the Chinese government, which has ignited protests and accusations that China is not allowing genuine democracy in the city. Pro-Beijing figures argue that the ultimate goal according to the Basic Law is \\"selection of the chief executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee.\\" These individuals claim that Beijing's rules do not break any promises. However, critics, such as the city's Democratic Party, contend that a genuinely democratic election would allow voters a choice of candidates from different political persuasions and see Beijing's interpretation as restrictive and a betrayal of previous promises made by Chinese leaders. As a result, disagreements surrounding the interpretation of Basic Law persist, with continuous protests calling for the Hong Kong and Chinese governments to listen to the voices of the people and provide a democratic electoral process."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He realized that to understand climate change issues he first needed to distinguish between the terms weather and climate. To that end, he labeled weather as term A. Then he labeled climate as term B. He found it easier to understand their differences in that way.  Hint: Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time.

Problem:Context_1 : Brancaster Manor is a saltmarsh owned by the National Trust near Brancaster, Norfolk covering 810 ha (2,000 acres). It was originally purchased by the Brancaster Memorial Trust in 1964, and transferred to the National Trust in 1967. It is leased to Brancaster Staithe Fishermen's Society. Context_2 : High Crag stands at the southern end of the High Stile ridge which divides the valleys of Ennerdale and Buttermere in the west of the English Lake District. It is often climbed as part of a popular ridge walk, from Black Sail youth hostel, or from Buttermere via Scarth Gap. Panoramas of the Great Gable and the Scafells are visible. Context_3 : A national trust is an organisation dedicated to preserving the cultural heritage of a particular geographic region. Although the focus of a national trust may vary by region, the principal role is to ensure the preservation of historically significant items, and to conserve areas of natural beauty. National trusts generally operate as private non-profit organizations. The first such trust organisation, The Trustees of Reservations, originated in 1890 as a regional group serving the state of Massachusetts, USA. The first national trust, the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty, was founded in England in 1895 and operates as a charitable organisation serving England, Wales and Northern Ireland (it is commonly known in the UK as the National Trust). Other national trusts have since been set up around the world. Context_4 : Moss Eccles Tarn is a tarn on Claife Heights, near Near Sawrey in the Lake District, Cumbria. It is currently owned by the National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty and known as an attractive tarn for fishing and walking. It is known for its association with Beatrix Potter – she owned the tarn and donated it to the National Trust after her death, and it served as inspiration for some of her stories. Context_5 : Malham Tarn is a glacial lake near the village of Malham in the Yorkshire Dales, England. The lake is one of only eight upland alkaline lakes in Europe. At an altitude of 377 m above sea level it is the highest marl lake in the United Kingdom. Its geology, flora and fauna have led to it being listed under a number of conservation designations. The site is currently owned by the National Trust, who lease part of the site to the Field Studies Council who offer residential and non-residential field courses there. The site was the inspiration for Charles Kingsley's 1863 novel, \\"The Water-Babies, A Fairy Tale for a Land Baby\\". Context_6 : The National Trust Company was incorporated on August 12, 1898 under the name of The National Trust Company of Ontario Limited. In 1899, with the opening of an office in Montreal, the name was changed to The National Trust Company, Limited. In 1984, National Trust amalgamated with The Victoria & Grey Trust Company and the company once again changed its name, this time to The National Victoria & Grey Trust Company. Because the name was deemed too cumbersome, however, it was subsequently changed to the National Trust Company on June 3, 1985. On August 14, 1997, Scotiabank purchased the National Trust Company. Context_7 : Buttermere is a lake in the English Lake District in North West England. The adjacent village of Buttermere takes its name from the lake. Historically in Cumberland, the lake is now within the county of Cumbria. It is owned by the National Trust, forming part of their Buttermere and Ennerdale property. Context_8 : Below is a list of the stately homes, historic houses, castles, abbeys, museums, estates, coastline and open country in the care of the National Trust in Wales, grouped into the unitary authority areas. Many areas of land owned by the trust, both open-access and closed to the public, are not listed here. This is a list of the more notable sites, generally defined as those having either an entry in the National Trust handbook, or a page on their website. There are many other areas of moorland and open country, agricultural holdings and coastline belonging to the National Trust, that are not listed here. Context_9 : National Trust Magazine is the members’ publication of National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty. With a readership of over 4 million (ABC 2,165,142) it currently has the highest magazine circulation in Britain. Three issues are sent out every year - spring, summer and autumn – and are delivered as part of the National Trust members’ mailout, which includes local newsletters and other information for Trust members. Context_10 : The National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC), (राष्ट्रिय प्रकृति संरक्षण कोष) previously known as King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation is a Nepalese non-governmental organization working in the field of nature conservation.It was established in 1982 as an autonomous non profit organization by legislative law of Nepal. NTNC's mission is to conserve nature and natural resources in Nepal while meeting the needs of the people in sustainable way. Geographically, the Trust activities have spread from the sub-tropical plains of Chitwan, Bardia and Kanchanpur in the lowlands to the Annapurna and Manaslu region of the high Himalayas, including the trans-Himalayan region of Upper Mustang and Manang. Currently, the projects of Trust are divided into three geographical areas - the lowland, the mid-hills (Kathmandu Valley) and the high mountains. The Trust’s activities in the lowlands are based in and around the Chitwan National Park, the Bardia National Park and the Shuklaphanta Wildlife Reserve located in the central, western and far-western development regions of Nepal, through the Biodiversity Conservation Center (BCC) in Chitwan, the Bardia Conservation Program (BCP) in Bardia and the Suklaphanta Conservation Program (SCP) in Kanchanpur. Similarly, the Annapurna Conservation Area Project (ACAP), the Manaslu Conservation Area Project (MCAP) and Gaurishankar Conservation Area Project (GCAP) are three protected areas managed by the Trust in the mountain region. The Central Zoo is the only project of the Trust in Kathmandu Valley. As a new initiative, the Trust has established an Energy and Climate Change Unit to address the emerging issues of climate change through mitigation and adaptation approach and renewable energy technologies. The Trust has also started work on urban environment conservation with the Bagmati River Conservation Project. fact_1 : High Crag stands at the southern end of the High Stile ridge which divides the valleys of Ennerdale and Buttermere in the west of the English Lake District. fact_2 :  It is owned by the National Trust, forming part of their Buttermere and Ennerdale property.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Without doubt.  Does it follow that \\"Impossible!\\"?","output":"To answer whether \\"Impossible!\\" follows the statement \\"Without doubt,\\" we must first examine the context and meaning of both phrases.  \\"Without doubt\\" is an expression that implies certainty or confidence in the statement preceding or following it. It means that the speaker strongly believes that something is true or that a certain event will occur. \\"Impossible!\\" typically refers to something that cannot happen or be done, either due to its inherent nature or given the current circumstances. It expresses disbelief in the mentioned situation or outcome. Now, let's assume that these two phrases are connected and examine whether it follows that \\"Impossible!\\" comes after \\"Without doubt.\\" 1. If the context refers to the certainty of the impossibility of something: Example: \\"Without doubt, it's impossible for humans to breathe underwater without any assistance.\\" In this case, \\"Impossible!\\" does follow the statement \\"Without doubt,\\" because the speaker is confident in their assertion that humans can't breathe underwater unaided. 2. If the context refers to opposing viewpoints: Example: Person A: \\"I believe, without doubt, that this project will succeed.\\" Person B: \\"Impossible! We don't have enough funding or resources.\\" Here, \\"Impossible!\\" does follow the statement \\"Without doubt,\\" but it represents a disagreement and contrasting views between two individuals. Person A is confident about the project's success, while Person B disputes this notion due to their belief in the lack of funding and resources. 3. If the context refers to the impossibility of having absolute certainty: Example: \\"Without doubt, every scientific theory is subject to change with new evidence. That being said, it's impossible to claim any theory as irrefutable truth.\\" In this case, \\"Impossible!\\" follows \\"Without doubt\\" because the main point revolves around the idea that absolute certainty cannot be achieved due to the ever-evolving nature of scientific knowledge.  Based on these examples, we can conclude that \\"Impossible!\\" can follow \\"Without doubt\\" depending on the context they are presented in. Sometimes the connection makes sense, as in example 1, where confidence in the impossibility of an event is being expressed. In other cases, like example 2, \\"Impossible!\\" serves to counter the certainty expressed in \\"Without doubt.\\" Finally, in example 3, both phrases work together to express the inherent uncertainty of certain subjects, like scientific theories."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Later, when Mrs Baring is short of a butler he offers his services and is so successful at his duties that he is taken on in a more permanent basis. He slowly begins to bond and court Joanna while doing his best to conceal his love of popular, modern music from Mrs Baring who is resolutely opposed to it and has forbidden her daughter to listen to it. Her financial problems continue to mount up and her phone is cut due to unpaid bills. Burns' friend and agent, Freddy, meanwhile has secured him an audition with Greenslade, a major popular record label, who are impressed with his performance. Convinced he is going to be a major star, they make plans to sign him up on a long-term contract. Burn's first demand of Greenslade is for money to pay for Mrs Baring's telephone to be restored. Mrs Baring is relieved by this gesture, but  believes the money came from one of her other friends rather than Burns.  Guess a valid title for it!

Donna Beegle looks over the complaint she filed with United Airlines. (Photo: Mike Benner, KGW staff)      TIGARD, Ore. -- When you watch 15-year-old Juliette playing on the swing in her living room, it is hard to believe she was responsible for grounding a commercial airline.      It happened while her family was headed home from Disney World. Her mom still cannot believe it.      \\"It's just not right,\\" said Donna Beegle.      Juliette was diagnosed with autism at 3 years old. She can get intensely frustrated because she cannot communicate well. After refusing to eat dinner on their layover in Houston, or any of the snacks mom Donna always packs just in case, Juliette started to wail and yell out.      “Really I saw it as a threat to the airline and the flight attendants to say, 'Well if we don't get this, this is what's going to happen.'” Fellow passenger Justin Alderman      \\"I knew, 'This kid needs to eat,' because I know her and I'm seeing the symptoms going, 'OK, I need to get her something.' So I'm offering her what I have and none of it works.\\"      Flight attendants brought her a cold sandwich, but her mom explained to the flight crew that Juliette has autism, and wants to only eat hot food. She says the flight attendant told her only first class passengers get hot food.      \\"Finally I got frustrated and I said, you know, 'We'll wait. She's going to get upset, start crying. She's going to have a meltdown and then you'll want to help her,'\\" Beegle said.      \\"She lashes out and scratches,\\" said Juliette's dad, Chuck Forbes.      Justin Alderman of Salem was 10 rows up and heard all the commotion.      \\"Really I saw it as a threat to the airline and the flight attendants to say, 'Well if we don't get this, this is what's going to happen,'\\" Alderman recounted.      The flight crew finally brought a hot meal from first class, and Juliette calmed down.      But shortly after, the pilot announced they were making an emergency landing in Salt Lake City to drop off an \\"unruly passenger.\\"      The family was escorted off the plane.      \\"I stood up and said, 'Is there anyone here that's afraid of my 15-year-old Juliette, who has autism?' And people were like, 'No, leave her alone.' I'm sorry. Passengers were awesome,\\" Beegle said.      But the perspective from some other passengers was different.      \\"The family may not like it and feel like it's embarrassing them,\\" Alderman said. \\"But ultimately I think the decision was made more for them than the passengers on board.\\"      \\"As a mom it ripped my heart out,\\" said Beegle. \\"I was shaking.\\"      United Airlines is defending its decision to make the emergency landing.      \\"After working to accommodate Dr. Beegle and her daughter during the flight, the crew made the best decision for the safety and comfort of all of our customers and elected to divert to Salt Lake City after the situation became disruptive,\\" said United spokeswoman Karen May. \\"We rebooked the customers on a different carrier and the flight continued to Portland.\\"      Beegle filed a complaint with United and the FAA.

(KOIN) — Donna Beegle, her husband and their son and daughter were headed back to Portland on Tuesday after spending a few days at DisneyWorld in Orlando.      They flew from Orlando to Houston, with a connecting flight from Houston to Portland on United Airlines Flight 1535. About an hour into the flight to Portland, she noticed a tell-tale sign from her daughter.      “She started getting a little upset and I started thinking, ‘You know what? She didn’t eat her dinner,” Donna Beegle told KOIN 6 News. “I know her, when she gets overhungry or overthirsty, she really struggles because she can’t tell us and she gets really frustrated.”      Juliette, a 15-year-old sophomore at Tigard High School, has autism.      Beegle said they’ve become very good at anticipating what Juliette needs and how she’ll react to certain things. She said her daughter is “extremely picky” about what she eats, and she asked if there was a hot meal she could buy from the first-class section of the flight.      At first, she was told no, she said, and then explained her daughter’s needs. “He said, ‘No, I can’t make an exception.'”      Beegle told KOIN 6 News she explained that if her daughter didn’t get a hot meal, she would “get to the meltdown point” and maybe scratch someone. Juliette soon got a first-class meal.      Emergency landing      Soon, she said, Juliette – sitting in a window seat – was calm and watching a video when a cabin announcement told passengers the plane was making an emergency landing in Salt Lake City due to a passenger “in the back of the plane who has behavior issues.”      Paramedics came on board and eventually made their way to where the Beegles were sitting. They asked if everything was fine, and the Beegles said yes.      “They could see Juliette was sitting there watching her show,” she said.      Video taken by passenger Chris Hall and provided to KOIN 6 News:      Beegle said the paramedics alerted them they may be asked to leave the plane. Soon, police arrived and told the family they had to leave.      “It was completely bizarre,” she told KOIN 6 News. She realized they were being asked to leave the plane “because of the fear of autism.”      Police told her the captain was not comfortable flying to Portland with Juliette on the plane, she said. That’s when Beegle said she stood up and asked if anyone on the plane felt threatened by the teen.      “The people were, like, ‘No, leave her alone.'”      She demanded the police officer take statements from the other passengers. “He said, ‘You have a lot of people on your side saying this was not an issue.'”      United Airlines statement      In a statement to KOIN 6 News, United Airlines spokeswoman Jennifer Dohm said, “After working to accommodate Dr. Beegle and her daughter during the flight, the crew made the best decision for the safety and comfort of all of our customers and elected to divert to Salt Lake City after the situation became disruptive. We rebooked the customers on a different carrier and the flight continued to Portland.”      The Beegles boarded a Delta flight from Salt Lake City to Portland.      Filing suit      “I get the ignorance,” Beegle said. “But it has to change.”      She decided to contact the media and she’s hired an attorney. “It’s not about the money, it’s about the training” people need, she said, and added 1 in 68 children face autism.      She’s filing a lawsuit “so no one else has to go through this.”      Donna Beegle said her daughter is a treasure. “Every day we learn things from her.”      This slideshow requires JavaScript. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"A family was removed from a United Airlines flight after their 15-year-old autistic daughter became agitated when there was no hot food available for her.

Context: I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me.  And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer.  At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved.  There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused. What now? I loved this man with every fibre of my being. We had a good life together, sex aside, and had built a family. We were happy. I did not want a divorce and neither did he.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Usain St Leo Bolt  (; born 21 August 1986) is a retired Jamaican sprinter and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres and 4 x 100 metres relay. His reign as Olympic Games champion in all of these events spans multiple Olympics. Due to his achievements and dominance in sprint competition, he is widely considered to be the greatest sprinter of all time. Performing for Jamaica in his first Caribbean regional event, Bolt clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the 400 metres in the 2001 CARIFTA Games, winning a silver medal. The 200 m also yielded a silver, as Bolt finished in 21.81 s.  He made his first appearance on the world stage at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Running in the 200 m event, he failed to qualify for the finals, but he still set a new personal best of 21.73 s. Bolt still did not take athletics or himself too seriously, however, and he took his mischievousness to new heights by hiding in the back of a van when he was supposed to be preparing for the 200 m finals at the CARIFTA Trials. He was detained by the police for his practical joke, and there was an outcry from the local community, which blamed coach McNeil for the incident. However, the controversy subsided, and both McNeil and Bolt went to the CARIFTA Games, where Bolt set championship records in the 200 m and 400 m with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He continued to set records with 20.61 s and 47.12 s finishes at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships.  Bolt is one of only nine athletes (along with Valerie Adams, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels, David Storl, and Kirani James) to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior level of an athletic event. Former Prime Minister P. J. Patterson recognised Bolt's talent and arranged for him to move to Kingston, along with Jermaine Gonzales, so he could train with the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) at the University of Technology, Jamaica. Did he have other career highlights?","output":"Yes, Usain Bolt, born on 21st August 1986, had numerous illustrious career highlights. One of the most decorated sprinters in history, Bolt holds the world record in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 x 100 metres relay stints. His reign as Olympic Games champion in these categories has spanned across multiple Olympics, validating his reputation as the greatest sprinter of all time. Bolt's prodigious talent was first evident during his initial Caribbean regional event when he clocked a personal best time of 48.28 s in the 400 metres track at the 2001 CARIFTA Games. He didn't just stop with a silver medal; he also secured silver in the 200 m category, finishing in 21.81 s. His first global appearance was at the 2001 IAAF World Youth Championships in Debrecen, Hungary. Despite not qualifying for the finals in the 200 m event, he indeed carved a new personal best of 21.73 s. Nevertheless, his relentless spirit and sheer speed propelled his journey forward, notably at the CARIFTA Games, where he set astounding championship records in the 200 m and 400 m races with times of 21.12 s and 47.33 s, respectively. He further established records at the Central American and Caribbean Junior Championships with finishes of 20.61 s and 47.12 s. Bolt's records don't stop at the regional level. He is also one of only nine athletes, including the likes of Valerie Adams, Veronica Campbell-Brown, Jacques Freitag, Yelena Isinbayeva, Jana Pittman, Dani Samuels, David Storl, and Kirani James, who were fortunate enough to win world championships at the youth, junior, and senior levels of an athletic event. In spite of his light-hearted and jovial demeanor, Bolt's extraordinary talent was revered professionally. Recognizing his exceptional abilities, former Prime Minister P. J. Patterson arranged for Bolt to move to Kingston with compatriot Jermaine Gonzales. There, he trained with the Jamaica Amateur Athletic Association (JAAA) at the University of Technology, Jamaica. This collective body of work and numerous recognitions, not only highlight his career but also cement Bolt's place as one of the greatest athletes to have ever graced the world of sprinting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Not long after his tenth birthday Peter was entrusted to take her to school. It was only two stops down the road , but the way his parents kept going on about it , you might have thought Peter was taking Kate to the North Pole . He was given instructions the night before. When he woke up , he had to listen to them over and over again. He was to keep hold of Kate's hand at all times , sit close to the front nearest the window , and tell the bus driver the name of his stop. Peter repeated all this back to his mother and set out for the bus stop with his sister. They held hands all the way. Actually he didn't mind this but simply hoped that none of his friends would see him holding a girl's hand. The bus came. They got on and sat close to the front. It was ridiculous sitting there holding hands and there were some boys from school there, so they let go of each other. Peter was feeling proud of himself. He could take care of his sister anywhere. If they were alone tighter on a mountain pass and came face to face with a pack of hungry wolves, he could know exactly what to do. Taking care and not to make sudden movement, he would move away with Kate until they had their backs to a large rock. That way the wolves would not be able to surround them. Then he takes from his pocket two important things--his hunting knife and a box of matches. He takes the knife from its sheath  and sets it down on the grass, ready in case the wolves attack. They're coming close now. They're so hungry and are watering and growling  . Kate is crying, but he cannot comfort her. He knows he has to concentrate on his plan. Right at their feet are some dry leaves and twigs. Quickly and skillfully, Peter gathers them into a small pile. The wolves are edging closer. He has to get this right. There's only one match left in the box. He bends down, cups his hand and lights the match. There's strong rush of wind. The flame flickers, but Peter holds it close to the pile and then first one leaf, then another, then the end of a twig catch fire, and soon the little pile is burning. He piles on more leaves and twigs and larger sticks. The wolves are backing off. Wild animals are terrified of fire. The flames are leaping higher and the wind is carrying the smoke right into their jaws. Now Peter takes holds of the hunting knife and ... Ridiculous! A daydream like this could make him miss his stop if he wasn't careful. The bus had come to a halt. The kids from his school were already getting off. Peter leaped to his feet and just managed to jump to the pavement as the bus was starting off again. It was more than fifty yards down the road when he realized he had forgotten something. Was it his backpack ? No. It was his sister. He had saved her from the wolves and left her sitting there. For a moment, he couldn't move.

Write a title for this article: (CNN) - Sarah Palin has been delivering campaign-style speeches in recent days – still leaving open whether she will actually run for the Republican presidential nomination. For now, she seems to want the best of all worlds: She teases a presidential run while still maintaining her millions of dollars in income from her paid speeches, books, reality TV shows and Fox News. She no doubt also loves all the attention. In her latest speech before the Tea Party Express in New Hampshire, she certainly hit all the major points the tea party movement wants to hear: smaller government, lower taxes, reduced federal regulations. But she spoke only in generalities without getting into any specifics as to how she would achieve those objectives. I heard a lot of politically popular clichés. She blasted President Obama for giving good speeches but never backing them up with substance. But at least on this day, she did exactly that herself – she gave a good speech but didn’t back it up with substance. She said the private sector always does everything better than the government can, and she was applauded. But I suspect those same people who clapped in approval don’t want the private sector to take over their Social Security and Medicare benefits. I also suspect they don’t want to privatize the United States military. Those are all government-run operations. Palin also avoided discussing certain sensitive subjects in her New Hampshire address. There was no mention of the social issues, including abortion rights for women or gay rights. Except for praising the men and women in the armed forces, there was no discussion of national security, including the ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It was a speech designed to deliver some red meat to the tea party movement, which is fine if you’re running for the presidential nomination and seeking votes. But as you can tell, I was hoping for more than simply railing against “the permanent political class” and “crony capitalism.” But I will say this: To her credit, she can deliver a good stump speech. And she doesn’t need a teleprompter. By the way, I have no idea whether she will run. I suppose this guessing game will continue for a few more weeks.

Write a title for this article: Some people thrive on data, and like to measure, quantify, classify and graph. For obvious reasons, these people tend to gravitate toward fields like programming and engineering--fields that require a lot of sitting in front of a computer and not getting much exercise. In other words, there's a lot of fat nerds out there. Fortunately, there's also the Fitbit. Last fall, San Francisco-based startup Fitbit launched its namesake product, the Fitbit Tracker. It's a small plastic gizmo containing a 3-D motion sensor, something like what's inside a Nintendo ( NTDOY.PK - news - people ) Wii controller. Clip it onto your clothing, and it logs your movements throughout the day. It may sound like just a fancy (and at 99, expensive) pedometer. But the high-tech Fitbit is much more. Because it follows your movements in three dimensions, it doesn't just count steps--it knows how much you've been exerting yourself, if you've been sitting, walking or running. It also knows when you did what, so it can tell the difference between someone who is constantly on his feet, vs. an otherwise sedentary person who takes one long walk at the end of the day. Fitbit even wants to track you when you're not moving at all. Strap the gadget into the included wrist band and wear it while you sleep; the tracker can tell when you wake up, or toss and turn, providing insight into the quality of your rest. Better yet, the Fitbit comes with a base station that plugs into your computer, and communicates wirelessly with the tracker. So all the information about your day's activities is automatically and seamlessly uploaded to Fitbit's secure servers, allowing you to log on to their Web site and view all kinds of graphs, data and details about your active habits. Fitbit also allows users to log their meals into the Fitbit Dashboard Web portal, so the result is a robust, one-stop control center to keep track of your diet, fitness and health. I've been using the Fitbit for several months now, and I'm impressed. It's made me much more aware of how active I am over the course of a day, and helped me get up out of my chair more often and for longer periods. Dare I say it? It's made me healthier. Fitness experts say you should take at least 10,000 steps in a given day. Most of us don't come even close to that. But the best thing about the Fitbit is being able to know exactly how close you came to a goal--and to turn achieving it into something of a game. I have definitely found myself walking more, skipping subway stops or taking an extra loop around the block, just because I knew it would add to my daily total, and perhaps put me over the 10,000 step mark. The ability to track your diet alongside your exercise is also particularly useful. If you're trying to lose weight, it's helpful to know how many calories you've taken in and how many you've expended; the Fitbit Dashboard does an excellent job showing if you're under or over your goals.","output":"Title: \\"Fitbit Tracker: The High-Tech Gadget Turning Data-Lovers into Fitness Enthusiasts\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In general, a person's diet may have some indirect effects on pollution in natural water sources, though the connection is not immediate or strong. If a person is dieting and they choose to consume more organic, locally produced foods, and reduce their consumption of processed and packaged products, this behavior could contribute to less pollution entering natural water sources. This is because organic farming practices use fewer synthetic fertilizers and pesticides and eco-friendly packaging generates less waste. Moreover, if multiple individuals adopt similar dieting habits and make conscious efforts to reduce their environmental impact, it could result in a collective reduction in pollution. However, the direct effect of a single individual's diet on the pollution entering water sources is minimal and would not notably improve the overall situation.

Maurice Robert \\"Mike\\" Gravel (; born May 13, 1930) is an American politician who was a Democratic United States Senator from Alaska from 1969 to 1981 and a candidate in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, by French-Canadian immigrant parents, Gravel served in the U.S. Army in West Germany, and he later graduated from the Columbia University School of General Studies. He moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming a real estate developer and entering politics. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966 and also became Speaker of the Alaska House. Gravel \\"decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place,\\" and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in August 1956, without funds or a job, looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for public office. Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role in his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the snow-clearing train on the Anchorage-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not to have to work the railroad again. Gravel joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, and continued a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life.  Gravel married Rita Jeannette Martin, who had been Anchorage's \\"Miss Fur Rendezvous\\" of 1958, on April 29, 1959. They had two children, Martin Anthony Gravel and Lynne Denise Gravel, born c. 1960 and 1962 respectively.  Meanwhile, he went to Washington, D.C. in 1957 to campaign for Alaskan statehood via the \\"Tennessee Plan\\": dressed as Paul Revere, he rode with a petition to the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Seeing Alaska as a wide-open place with no political establishment or entrenched interests, and using the slogan \\"Gravel, the Roadbed to Prosperity\\", he ran for the territorial legislature in 1958 but lost. He went on a national speaking tour concerning tax reform in 1959, sponsored by the Jaycees. He ran without avail for the City Council in Anchorage in 1960. During this time, he had become a successful real estate agent; after the 1960 election, he became a property developer in a mobile home park on the outskirts of Anchorage. A partner ran into financial difficulty, however, and the project went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Gravel was forced out in 1962.","output":"This text is about Maurice Robert \\"Mike\\" Gravel, an American politician who was a Democratic United States Senator from Alaska and a candidate in the 2008 U.S. presidential election."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Combine facts and answer this: Alexander Hood was an officer of what naval warfare force that has origins in the early 16th century?

Aim for foods high in protein, like eggs, tofu, yogurt, or peanut butter. Or choose nutrient-rich food options like oatmeal and fresh fruit. These foods will fuel your body through the day and give you the energy you need to stay awake and active. Caffeinated beverages can help you combat sleepiness and make you feel more wakeful and energetic. And drinking coffee or tea can bring plenty of health benefits, too. These naturally caffeinated beverages are chock full of antioxidants, and recent studies suggest that drinking coffee can even decrease your risk of developing depression.  Don't drink too much! Excessive caffeine consumption can cause anxiousness and irritability. Drinking too much coffee can also interfere with your ability to have a good night of sleep after you make it through the day.  Opt for coffee over energy drinks. An 8 oz. cup of coffee typically contains more caffeine than the same serving size of most energy drinks. Drinking enough water is important to maintain your body's natural functions, and dehydration can actually make you feel even more tired. The physical act of chewing keeps your body awake, and ice comes with the additional benefits of being refreshing and hydrating. Snacks high in protein and vitamins, like nuts or fresh fruit, can help give you an energy boost between meals when your body starts to drag. Even just a brief 15-20 minute nap can boost your energy levels and leave you feeling more alert, awake, and able to perform at work.  Don't nap for too long. Napping for more than 30 minutes can lead to increased grogginess after waking.  Remember that you may feel groggy for about 15 minutes after waking. It might be a good idea to drink coffee immediately after a nap. Your body needs most of its calories in the morning and afternoon. Give yourself the fuel you need when you need it most. Be sure to make healthy food choices. Overdoing it on calories or sugar at lunch can leave you feeling more tired in the afternoon.

Hisamasa became the head of the clan in 1542 after his father died , but unlike his father , he was never a strong leader . Losing domains against Rokkaku clan , he instead became a Rokkaku retainer . Hisamasa 's retainers had enough and after his son Azai Nagamasa won the Battle of Norada against a force at least twice the size of his led by Rokkaku Yoshikata to win back independence , they forced Hisamasa into retirement . Yet , this retirement was not complete and Hisamasa managed to hold some sway of the clan . This surfaced in 1570 after Oda Nobunaga who was allied with his son , Azai Nagamasa , attacked Asakura Yoshikage who had supported Hisamasa against enemies like the Rokkaku clan . Hating Nobunaga for his personality , Hisamasa demanded that the Azai clan pay back the support of Asakura clan and forced a war by breaking the alliance . It is thought that Nagamasa opposed him and believed that the alliance could somehow be mended over time since he refused to divorce his wife , Oichi , but he failed to gain enough support to overturn Hisamasa . On 1573 , Odani Castle was besieged by Nobunaga 's forces , and facing a loss Hisamasa committed seppuku .  - Early life and marriage. Azai Nagamasa was the son of Azai Hisamasa, from whom he inherited clan leadership in 1560. Hisamasa had been compelled to step down by many of his retainers in favor of his son, Nagamasa. Hisamasa retired, and would later commit suicide along with his son in August 1573. Nagamasa successfully battled both Rokkaku Yoshikata and Sait Tatsuoki between 1560 and 1564.

In 1549, he became allied with Hosokawa Harumoto against Miyoshi Chkei, and succeeded his father as head of the family in 1552. After a number of victories against the Miyoshi, the tides turned; Yoshikata and his Hosokawa allies in service of the shogun Ashikaga Yoshiteru began to experience a string of defeats. In 1558, the shogun reconciled his differences with the Miyoshi clan, putting an end to the conflict.  - Sait Tatsuoki succeeded his father at the age of 19. He was, however, an incapable ruler; unlike his father and grandfather.   - Japan (\\"Nippon\\" or \\"Nihon\\" ; formally \\"\\" or \\"Nihon-koku\\", means \\"State of Japan\\") is a sovereign island nation in Eastern Asia.

Although the term samurai is not explicitly used to define Hisamasa's status in the information given, it can be inferred from his role as a leader within the military-centric Azai clan. Hisamasa's notable activities, such as his interactions with the Rokkaku clan and the decision-making in warfare strategies, evidence his role as a samurai, as the samurai were typically engaged in warfare as a part of their service to their respective clans and leaders. Therefore, the relationship between 'Azai Hisamasa' and 'samurai' can be defined as Hisamasa belonging to the samurai class through his position in the Azai clan."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The rest is fees you pat them.\\" He told me anyway.  \\"This is why I have to give you the room you get.\\"  He went on. \\"Okay.\\"  I said and now wondered what he meant by that. I get to the room which is the first one next to the lobby.  It must have been a storage closet before. LOL.  No, really, I laughed out loud and said really?!  The room was just big enough to crush the queen size bed into it with a miscellaneous door on the side wall blocked by a long useless table.

I had to bang it to get a picture on the little 20 inch screen.  I'm surprised it wasn't black and white.  ...and Andy.  It's not because of Expedia that the room is as it is.

I told my partner I would go check it out by myself so he could stay and keep quality control of who comes in the venue. I walk in and in the first cubicle I could see lots and lots of blood on the floor and a pair of feet placed as if he was sitting down. I quickly go to the next cubicle asking at the same time if the person was OK obviously with no response. I look over and it was a horrible bloody mess. I quickly get on the radio and tell my partner to call police and ambulance and to put the place on lock down. I walk around to the from of the cubicle and kick open the door. The man had grabbed a straight razor and cut his arms extremely deep from the wrist downwards all the way to his elbow palms up. On both arms mind you. A good example of what it would look like would be the scene from the terminator 2 where Arnold cuts the skin off from his arm. The ambulance came and had to call another team to collect the body.

Background: Ciara Princess Harris was born in Austin, Texas, on October 25, 1985, the only child of Jackie and Carlton Clay Harris. An army brat, she grew up in Germany, New York, Utah, California, Arizona and Nevada. Ciara's parents are both African Americans. Ciara also has some Irish ancestry, from her mother's background. Context: On December 5, 2006, Ciara released her second studio album, Ciara: The Evolution. According to the singer, the title of the album is \\"about so much more than just my personal growth - it's about the evolution of music, the evolution of dance, the evolution of fashion.\\" The source of the album's creativity such as the sound and edge comes from Ciara in general. Ciara: The Evolution became Ciara's first number one album on the U.S. Billboard 200 and second on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums charts with sales of more than 338,000 becoming her highest first week of sales to date. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA in the United States, within only five weeks of its release, and has sold 1.3 million copies according to Nielsen SoundScan. It sold over two million copies worldwide.  The album's international lead single, \\"Get Up\\", which features Chamillionaire, reached number seven in the United States and gained a platinum accreditation. It reached number five in New Zealand. The song was used for the film Step Up (2006) and featured on the film's soundtrack. The album's US lead single, \\"Promise\\", reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and became her third number one single on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart. \\"Like a Boy\\" was released as the second international single which reached within the top twenty in the UK, Finland, France, Ireland, Sweden Switzerland, and also in the United States. The fourth and final single from the album, \\"Can't Leave 'em Alone\\", reached number 10 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart and number 40 on the Billboard Hot 100. The song became Ciara's fifth single to peak in the top in New Zealand, peaking at number 4. The song achieved moderate success in other international markets.  In support of the album, Ciara went on her first headlining tour in October 2006. The tour went to seventeen different clubs in cities throughout the United States. The tour was met with mixed to positive reviews; critics were divided regarding the pre-recorded backing tracks and remarked that Ciara was slightly under-prepared to host her own headlining tour, but ultimately praised her energetic choreography. In August 2007, she headlined the Screamfest '07 tour with fellow rapper, T.I.. Critics praised her performance for her gracious dancing and being able to command a sold out arena. Ciara, along with Chris Brown and Akon, was a support act for Rihanna's Good Girl Gone Bad Tour in the United Kingdom. She made a guest appearance on \\"So What\\" by Field Mob. The single went on to become a top 10 hit on the Billboard Hot 100. She also appeared on Tiffany Evans' single \\"Promise Ring\\". The song achieved little success on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart.  In addition to her music, Ciara made her acting debut in the MTV Films production All You've Got in May 2006. In the movie she played Becca Whiley, a teenager who is competing in a volleyball tournament. The movie received mixed to positive reviews; critics said the movie was predictable but still enjoyable.

Answer the following question: I have been preparing our house for the market and in doing so, I have gotten rid of a lot of stuff! I am definitely the hoarder in our house. My husband could live out of two bags, use about five kitchen items each year, and doesn’t gather anything for future use or hang on to much for sentimental value. (Which probably means the items he has hung on to mean a whole lot more!) I am always tucking something away here or stashing materials there…all in preparation for “some day.” It’s also part of the teacher in me. Do you know many teachers that don’t have a ton of stuff or utilize every bit of storage available? But, over the last several years, I’ve been fairly good about going through things every six months and weeding out a little here and a little there. Today I’ll be sharing six simple ways to declutter your home and why you should! GIVE THINGS AWAY It’s nice to make money, but sometimes you come across something that you really think someone else could use and you don’t want to throw it away. If it’s the perfect fit for that person, they may adopt the item and add their own wear and tear! Anyone that’s had children knows that kids go through things so fast and it’s nice to save a little money by taking hand-me-downs from a friend or relative. If the receiver decides they don’t want the item, let it be. They’ll either get rid of it on their own or decline the offer. If they choose the latter, maybe the rest of this list will help. PACK If you know you don’t want to purge an item from your house AND you know that you will use it in the future, but it’s not an everyday use item, pack it up. We have several containers of things in our garage that are full of items we use once or twice each year. I have added close to 100 boxes of things to simply declutter our home while it’s on the market. I took a look at everything and kept the essentials (well, maybe even more than the essentials), and packed up the rest. Question: What effect does the author probably believe that decluttering the house will have on it's market value? Options: - that it will improve the market value   - that it will have no impact   - the author has not given thought to market value   - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"The author probably believes that decluttering the house will have a positive impact on its market value. This can be inferred from the fact that the author mentions decluttering the home while it's on the market and packing up non-essential items to make the space appear clean and well-organized. A decluttered and organized home generally looks more spacious and attractive to potential buyers, which can improve its market value."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Senate Democrats passed a plan Wednesday to extend current tax rates for all but the top income earners — a largely political vote on a critical policy issue that will dominate much of the end-of-year legislative session.      The battle drilled down to whether to raise taxes for the rich – a resounding theme that has been central to President Barack Obama’s reelection campaign. Democrats want to extend tax rates for household income 250,000 and below for an additional year, while Republicans call for freezing all rates.      Text Size -      +      reset      The vote was 51-48 to pass the Democratic plan. Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Jim Webb (D-Va.) voted with the GOP to reject the proposal. The Republicans also got a vote on their plan to extend all the tax rates, which failed 45-54. The Democratic proposal, which had the White House’s backing, now heads to the Republican-led House, where it is dead on arrival.      (Also on POLITICO: House OKs Ron Paul's 'audit the Fed' bill)      “I’ve called on the House Republicans to drop their demands for another trillion-dollar giveaway for millionaires and billionaires so we can make sure the middle class families and small business have the financial security they need,” Obama said at a fundraiser at a House of Blues in New Orleans, La. “But so far, they don’t see it that way. Governor Romney doesn’t see it that way.”      In a rare move in this oft-gridlocked Senate, leaders agreed to pass the plans with a simple majority vote, instead of requiring the chamber to break a 60-vote procedural barrier that has blocked much of the action in the Senate. Ramping up the legislative drama, Vice President Joe Biden showed up to preside over the Senate and be available to cast a tie-breaking vote — which ultimately wasn’t needed.      Senate Republicans agreed to the simple-vote majority, believing that it would die in the House because of a constitutional issue requiring revenue measures to originate in the House, known on Capitol Hill as a “blue-slip” issue.      “I learned that in the eighth grade,” said Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), the minority whip.      Moreover, they said, even with passage of the bill, allowing Democrats to vote on the merits of the plan gives them complete ownership of supporting a tax increase during a tough economy. And they wouldn’t be able to blame Republicans for filibustering.      (Also on POLITICO: GOP push for stopgap resolution)      “This puts people on the record on the merits of the bill, no procedural questions, so everybody’s constituents will know where everybody stands,” Kyl added.      Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) said: “It’s about time they quit hiding behind a stacked procedural setup in the Senate and have to take a vote on something. This is a clear vote: They voted for tax increases.”      Still, there’s no denying that the vote gives Democrats new ammunition in the tax wars with the GOP, allowing Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to later seek a conference committee with the House Republicans, something he said he’d be inclined to do.      Speaking to reporters afterwards, Democrats mocked the GOP’s procedural concerns over the measure originating in the Senate. And they now claimed the upper hand ahead of the year-end fiscal fight where the two parties must resolve differences over the Bush tax cuts and automatic spending cuts or fall off what’s known as the “fiscal cliff.”      “With this vote, he cannot point fingers back at the Senate,” Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said of House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio). “He cannot hide behind technicalities. And he shouldn’t put blue slips before pay stubs.”      And in a riff on Mitt Romney’s infamous dog incident, Murray added that Boehner can “either pass this bill, which delivers certainty to middle-class taxpayers and by the way is a tremendous step towards addressing sequestration. Or he can step on the gas, head towards that fiscal cliff and strap the American people – just like a dog we know – to the roof of his car.” ||||| Senate Democrats on Wednesday narrowly passed President Obama’s plan that would extend Bush-era tax rates for family income up to 250,000 a year.      The surprising passage of the bill was a victory for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and the White House, though the highly contentious vote will undoubtedly be used by Republicans as political ammunition this election year. They ripped Democrats for seeking to raise taxes in an ailing economy.      ADVERTISEMENT      By a 51-48 tally, Democrats overcame two defections to win passage of the measure, which would also raise the top rate on capital gains and dividends, as well as continue several targeted tax provisions that Democrats say help the middle class.      Earlier in the afternoon, the Senate turned aside a Republican proposal, by a mostly party-line vote of 45-54, that would have extended all current rates on income, capital gains, dividends and the estate tax, also for a year. Two Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins (Maine) and Scott Brown (Mass.), voted against both plans, and Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) voted for the two proposals. Pryor is up for reelection in 2014.      The dramatic roll calls came as Vice President Biden presided over the tally. He was in the chamber in case his vote, as president of the Senate, was needed to break a tie.      Although the Republican bill was unlikely to pass the Senate and the Democratic bill faces grim prospects in the Republican-controlled House, leaders of both parties sought to send an election-year message on tax rates and display party unity.      In the second roll call, Senate Democrats lost the votes of the two members of their caucus who had already indicated they would vote no — retiring Sens. Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Jim Webb (D-Va.).      Lieberman said on the Senate floor that both the Republican and the Democratic plan amount to a punt at a time of trillion-dollar annual deficits. Webb, meanwhile, said that he would not support increasing taxes on ordinary income, but believed that rates for capital gains could go higher.      But Democrats were able to hang on to votes from other potential fence-sitters, including Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Ben Nelson (D-Neb.), who both voted against a similar proposal in 2010. Manchin is up for reelection this fall, while Nelson is retiring.      Nelson told reporters after the vote that it was a tough decision that wasn’t made any easier by the fact the vote is unlikely to go anywhere in the House.      “We vote on a lot of things that are DOA in the House. The House votes on a lot of things that are DOA in the Senate,” Nelson said. “So that’s not the test.”      Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) and Kay Hagan (D-N.C.), all of whom face potentially difficult reelection races in November or in 2014, also backed Obama’s proposal.      The votes came following a topsy-turvy morning of legislative maneuvering in which Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) consented to allowing straight up-or-down votes on the two tax plans. The Senate had been scheduled to hold a procedural vote on just the Democratic plan, which would have needed 60 votes to advance.      McConnell, speaking on the Senate floor, suggested his move was meant to smoke out vulnerable Democrats, and make them put their cards on the table. “The American people should know where we stand,” McConnell said. “Today they will.”      Reid has said for weeks that he could muster a majority for the tax plan. The passage of the bill came after Democrats bickered over whether to raise the 250,000 threshold to 1 million annually.      Obama refused to budge from his 250,000 mark, and congressional Democrats recently rallied behind their president, who is deadlocked in his reelection race with Mitt Romney.      With Wednesday’s vote, a Democratic aide said, the chamber had upped the pressure on the House, with President Obama now being able to single out Republicans — and not just Congress — for not passing tax relief for the middle class.      “Why don’t we pass this now, give real relief to the middle class, and have the other debate later?” Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said, referring to the question of whether to extend the tax rates to income levels between 250,000 and 1 million. Schumer has previously embraced the higher threshold.      Both Republicans and Democrats believe they have the upper hand on taxes, with 103 days to go before the election. Leaders of the respective parties are looking to win the message war this fall while also jockeying for leverage in advance of the post-election lame-duck session — when most of the substantive decisions on big-ticket tax and fiscal issues are expected to be made.      For starters, measures that raise revenues are, under the Constitution, supposed to start in the House, and McConnell objected on Wednesday to a request from Reid to fix that issue.      Democrats noted Wednesday that Republicans had allowed bills dealing with transportation and the Federal Aviation Administration to move forward, even though they could have been tripped up by the same problem.      Regardless, the House is expected to hold its own vote next week on a measure that, similar to the Senate Republican bill, would essentially extend all Bush-era rates for a year.      The House is expected to reject Obama’s plan while pushing for legislation to force a comprehensive revamp of the tax code in 2013.      “Here in the House, where tax legislation originates under the Constitution, we’re going to vote to stop the tax hike,” Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) said in a statement. “That much is clear.”      Either way, Republicans and Democrats are expected to continue their broadsides, with each side accusing the other of holding tax relief hostage for political gain.      “All sides agree on the need to extend the tax cuts for the middle class — this legislation reflects that consensus,” the Obama administration said in a policy statement.      GOP lawmakers, meanwhile, have accused Democrats of seeking a tax hike on small businesses, and said that the current sluggish economy should convince policymakers not to raise anybody’s taxes at the end of the year.      Republicans lambasted Democrats for leaving the estate tax out of their tax proposal, with the tax’s parameters scheduled to get much less generous at the end of the year.      Senate Democrats had been calling to reinstate 2009 estate tax levels, which have also been endorsed by Obama. But with some Democrats suggesting they prefer the current estate tax policy, party leaders dropped the proposal from their plan.      Sen. Orrin Hatch (Utah), the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, and other GOP lawmakers have said that the Democrats’ decision could ensnare many more family farms and small businesses.      But Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), citing polling on the issue, said that he thought Wednesday’s vote would be a boon to Democratic candidates in tough races, and that Republicans were on the wrong side of the issue.      “Just take the phrase: ‘The top 2 percent of wage earners pay their fair share,’” Durbin said. “We’ve tested it in every direction. We know where people stand on it. They’re wrong, and they’ve been wrong.”      — Updated at 9:08 p.m.             ||||| Democrats pushed a yearlong extension of tax cuts for all but the highest-earning Americans through the Senate on Wednesday, giving Democrats a significant political victory on a measure that is fated to go no further in Congress.

(Associated Press)      In this July 24, 2012, photo, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Ky., gestures during a news conference on Capitol Hill in Washington, following a political strategy session, as from back left,... (Associated Press)      Senators approved the Democratic bill by a near party-line 51-48 vote, with Vice President Joe Biden presiding over the chamber in case his vote was needed to break a tie. Minutes earlier, lawmakers voted 54-45 to kill a rival Republican package that would have included the best-off in the tax reductions.      The 250 billion Democratic measure would extend tax cuts in 2013 for millions of Americans that otherwise would expire in January. But it would deny those reductions to individuals making over 200,000 yearly and couples earning at least 250,000.      Passage of the Democratic measure put the Senate on record as backing a bill that closely follows the tax-cutting vision of President Barack Obama. It averted what would have been a significant embarrassment for Democrats and Obama, who has made tax fairness _ meaning tax increases on the rich _ an overarching theme of his re-election campaign.      The vote also serves as a counterpoint to the GOP-run House, which next week will approve tax cuts nearly identical to the 405 billion Republican plan the Senate rejected Wednesday.      \\"The question is, who are you fighting for,\\" Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said before the vote. \\"Are you fighting for the people who make a billion dollars a year? That's who the Republicans are fighting for, and they get so emotional about it. Or are you fighting for the middle class, the heart and soul of America.\\"      Republicans said the measure was all about Democratic posturing for the upcoming elections and would hurt the economy because boosting taxes on the wealthy will hinder them from hiring workers for their companies.      \\"Thank goodness it's not going anywhere because it would be bad for the economy, the single worst thing we could do to the country,\\" Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said.      With Senate control at stake in November's elections, Republicans were hoping that several Democrats seeking re-election would hurt their candidacies by having backed the Democratic package. The bill would dramatically boost the estate tax, which would be widely unpopular in farming, ranching and high cost-of-living states, and increase levies on dividends and capital gains, which are relied on by many elderly people.      \\"That's what today's votes are all about,\\" McConnell said in a thinly veiled warning to Democrats. \\"Showing the people who sent us here where we stand.\\"      The White House chimed in by reiterating its support for the Democratic plan.      \\"All sides agree on the need to extend the tax cuts for the middle class,\\" the White House wrote in a statement. \\"This legislation reflects that consensus and should not be held hostage while debating the merits of another tax cut for the wealthy.\\"      Under the Democratic measure, individuals earning over 200,000 and couples making at least 250,000 would see their top rates rise from 33 percent and 35 percent today to 36 percent and 39.6 percent in January.      Democrats argue that the well-off should contribute to efforts to contain federal deficits, while Republicans say many of those affected own businesses and would have a harder time hiring workers. The increase would affect 2.5 million households, or 2 percent of all 140.5 million tax returns, according to 2009 Internal Revenue Service statistics.      The Democratic bill would also boost the top tax rate paid by people who inherit estates to 55 percent, exempting the first 1 million in an estate's value. The GOP measure would maintain today's 35 percent top rate and would not tax the first 5.12 million of an estate's value.      In fresh figures released this week by Republicans, Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that the Democratic provision would affect 55,200 estates next year, compared with 3,600 who would face estate taxes under the GOP plan.      Democrats would impose top tax rates next year of 20 percent on dividends and capital gains, two sources of income enjoyed disproportionately by the wealthy. The GOP top rate would be 15 percent.      The GOP bill ignores some tax credits for low- and middle-income families that Democrats want to extend for college costs; for some low-income couples and large working families; and for families with children.      All were part of Obama's economic 2009 stimulus bill. Democrats say those tax breaks were meant to be permanent but Republicans say they were only a short-term response to the recession.      ___      Associated Press writer Jim Kuhnhenn contributed to this report. ||||| The Senate on Wednesday narrowly approved a plan to preserve tax cuts for the middle class while letting them expire for the wealthy, a powerful if largely symbolic victory for Democrats who have been pushing to raise taxes on the rich for more than a decade.      The measure is dead on arrival in the Republican-controlled House, where leaders are preparing to vote next week on their own plan to extend the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for households at every income level through 2013.      But Democratic lawmakers said the Senate’s 51-48 vote is a political breakthrough that strengthens their election-year argument that Republicans are holding tax cuts for the middle class hostage in order to maintain breaks worth 160,000 a year to the average millionaire.      “If House Republicans insist on blocking our middle-class tax cuts, that is a debate we are willing to have. That is a debate we welcome,” Sen. Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a speech on the Senate floor. For more than a decade, Republicans “have conflated tax cuts for the middle class and tax cuts for the very wealthy. This bill breaks that vice.”      Vice President Biden presided over the late-afternoon vote, though with only 99 senators present, there was never much chance that he would be called upon to break a tie. His appearance highlighted the importance of the issue for President Obama, who has made tax “fairness” a centerpiece of his reelection campaign against GOP challenger Mitt Romney.      Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) accused Democrats of playing politics with the nation’s tax code. Noting Biden’s presence, McConnell recalled that the last time the Bush tax cuts were set to expire, Biden asked McConnell to help the White House extend all of them, even breaks on income over 250,000 a year, to avoid harming a fragile economy.      “Today, the economy is growing slower than it was in December 2010,” McConnell said. “This is more about the election than it is the economy. And I’m sure a few arms have been twisted in order to get a result.”      Only two of 53 senators who caucus with Democrats voted against the measure. Sen. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) said he opposes any extension of the tax cuts, preferring that lawmakers take up far-reaching tax reform this year. Sen. Jim Webb (D-Va.) had the opposite complaint; aides said Webb “opposes raising taxes on ordinary earned income.”      But Sen. Kay Hagen (D-N.C.) flew back to Washington from a funeral to cast her vote to support the measure. And several Democrats in tight races, including Sen. Claire McCaskill (Mo.), voted yes despite Republican arguments that the bill would permit the tax rates on inheritances worth more than 1 million to shoot up to 55 percent, striking millions of family farms and small businesses.      On an earlier vote, the Senate rejected a GOP plan to extend all the Bush tax cuts, 45 to 54. Senators from both sides crossed party lines, with Republicans Scott Brown (Mass.) and Susan Collins (Me.) rejecting the extension and Democrat Mark Pryor (Ark.) supporting it.      The votes capped a surprising day that began with McConnell announcing that he would waive procedural hurdles and permit the Senate to hold an up-or-down vote on the measure, in exchange for an agreement by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) to call a vote on the Republican bill, as well.      McConnell acknowledged the unusual nature of his decision — Democratic aides could not recall another occasion when McConnell permitted a simple majority vote on a contentious issue. McConnell said his goal was to force vulnerable Democrats to support a plan to raise taxes less than four months before the Nov. 6 ballot.      “By setting these votes at a 50-vote threshold, nobody on the other side can hide behind a procedural vote while leaving their views on the actual bill itself a mystery to the people who sent them here,” McConnell said.      Moreover, McConnell said, the tax bill cannot advance because it is a Senate-originated tax measure. The Constitution requires all tax measures to originate in the House.      “The only reason we won’t block it today is that we know it doesn’t pass constitutional muster and won’t become law,” McConnell said. “What today’s votes are all about,” he said, is “showing the people who sent us here where we stand.”      The ideological stalemate between the House and Senate leaves the nation facing what Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke has called a “fiscal cliff” in January, when a payroll tax cut and other temporary tax breaks are set to expire, along with the Bush tax cuts. Factoring in automatic cuts set to hit the Pentagon and other federal agencies, the fiscal cliff threatens to siphon 600 billion out of the economy next year, potentially throwing the nation back into recession. |||||","output":"Senate Democrats passed a plan to extend current tax rates for all but the top income earners. The Democratic plan, which extends tax rates for household income 250,000 and below for an additional year, passed with a 51-48 vote and has the backing of the White House. The Republican-led House rejected the proposal. As it stands, the passage of the Democratic plan serves as a political victory for Democrats and President Obama, who has emphasized tax fairness in his re-election campaign."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The underlying virus-host interactions and cellular mechanisms that promote co-existence remain ill-defined, but physiological traits such as flight and longevity are proposed to drive these adaptations. Autophagy is a cellular homeostatic process that regulates ageing, metabolism, and intrinsic immune defense. We quantified basal and stimulated autophagic responses in black flying fox cells, and demonstrated that although black flying fox cells are susceptible to Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV) infection, viral replication is dampened in these bat cells. Black flying fox cells tolerated prolonged ABLV infection with less cell death relative to comparable human cells, suggesting post-entry mechanisms interference with virus replication. An elevated basal autophagic level was observed and autophagy was induced in response to high virus doses. Pharmacological stimulation of the autophagy pathway reduced virus replication, indicating autophagy acts as an anti-viral mechanism. Enhancement of basal and virus-induced autophagy in bat cells connects related reports that long-lived species possess homeostatic processes that dampen oxidative stress and macromolecule damage. Exemplifying the potential that evolved cellular homeostatic adaptations like autophagy may secondarily act as anti-viral mechanisms, enabling bats to serve as natural hosts to an assortment of pathogenic viruses. Furthermore, our data suggest autophagy-inducing drugs may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for combating lyssavirus infection. Viruses 2019, 11, 260 2 of 18 (EBOV) [9], and MARV [3,4,10], seroconverted, but did not develop pathology and only a minority of infected bats shed low level of virus in urine (NiV) [8] or high levels of virus orally (MARV) [4]. This combination of host-viral richness and apparent lack of clinical disease presentation after NiV, HeV, EBOV, or MARV infection raises the question how novel intrinsic traits or host adaptations might promote tolerance of virus infection in bats [11, 12] . As bats are the only volant mammals, flight has been proposed to contribute to the ability of bats to function as natural reservoirs [11] [12] [13] . The aerobic demands of flight experienced by bats is higher than the aerobic demands of other terrestrial mammals experienced during aerobic exertion [14] . Positive selection of genes involved in DNA-damage repair pathways [11] and reduced free-radical production [15] in bats suggest an evolved response to the deleterious effects of an increased generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from the high aerobic demands of flight. Cellular ageing occurs through a progressive accumulation of damaged organelles, misfolded and aggregated proteins, and dysregulation of cellular homeostatic processes [16, 17] . ROS can cause oxidative damage to macromolecules and DNA [18] , and ultimately contribute to cellular ageing. However, bats have a greater longevity [19] than what is typically projected in relation to their body size [20, 21] , and resistance to oxidative stress has been observed in long-lived bat species [22, 23] . Furthermore, the loss of DNA sensors in the PYHIN family [24] and decreased activity of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) [12] , may contribute to dampened inflammatory responses to the release of cytosolic DNA due to metabolic-related DNA damage or microbial infection [25] . In addition, enhanced protein homeostatic mechanisms, such as macroautophagy (hereafter referred to as autophagy), were observed in bat cells [26] . At the crossroads of DNA-damage, oxidative stress, and microbial infection [27, 28] , autophagy, is a proteostatic process involved in cellular homeostasis, longevity, and survival [29, 30] . Canonically regarded as a response to starvation, the autophagy pathway recycles long-lived proteins, misfolded proteins, and damaged organelles during times of nutrient depletion. However, there are also multiple examples of selective autophagic pathways that utilize specific protein receptors to traffic ubiquitinated target organelles and proteins into cytoplasmic double-membraned vesicles, termed autophagosomes [31] . In addition to cellular stressors such as DNA damage and ROS, pathogen-recognition receptors can activate distinct autophagic processes as part of an intrinsic immune response [32] [33] [34] . For example, \\"xenophagy\\" shuttles intracellular microbes to autolysosomes for lysis, whereas \\"aggrephagy\\" removes toxic protein aggregates [35, 36] . Aerobic demands, ROS, nutritional starvation, or virus infections are all physical stressors that challenge cellular homeostasis [37] . Virus exploitation of host cell transcriptional and translational machinery ensures successful replication, but can trigger the unfolded protein response [38] , and dysregulation of cellular homeostatic mechanisms [39] . Therefore, if bats have evolved mechanisms to dampen cellular damage caused by the by-products of heightened aerobic respiration through improved proteostatic mechanisms, then these same proteostatic mechanisms might also function as anti-viral defenses. We undertook a comparative study to examine host-pathogen interactions in bat versus human cells, focusing on the potential anti-viral or pro-survival mechanism of autophagy. For this study we chose to utilize Australian bat lyssavirus (ABLV), a neurotropic rabies-related virus that naturally infects black flying foxes (Pteropus alecto) [40, 41] , but is classified as a biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) pathogen. Pteropus species are also the natural reservoirs of several zoonotic viruses including HeV, NiV [2], and Menangle virus [42, 43] . Cell lines have been established from the black flying fox [44] , which with the publication of its reference genome [11] , has been promoted as a model bat species. Black flying fox cell lines have been used to investigate the interferon response [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] , as well as transcriptomic and proteomic responses after HeV infection [51] . We rescued a modified recombinant ABLV expressing a green fluorescent protein (rABLV-GFP) and used both rABLV-GFP and a wild-type ABLV (wt-ABLV) to examine the role of autophagy after virus infection. In black flying fox cells, the basal level of autophagy was significantly higher than the levels of autophagy quantified in the human cell line used for comparative purposes. We observed that ABLV infection activated the autophagy pathway   Title: Enhanced Autophagy Contributes to Reduced Viral Infection in Black Flying Fox Cells A:","output":"In this task, you are given a paragraph from a research paper along with a title.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: In what city did Page, Fatt, and Cook perform their last performance together?  In mid-2012, The Wiggles announced that Page, Fatt, and Cook would be retiring from touring with the group; Emma Watkins, the first female member of The Wiggles, replaced Page, Lachlan Gillespie replaced Fatt, and Simon Pryce, who was initially supposed to replace Page in August, replaced Cook.  Anthony Field remained in the group because he found it too difficult to give up and because he still had a passion for educating children.  According to Paul Field, his brother staying in the band \\"was a vital decision to placate American, British and Canadian business partners\\".  Page, Fatt, and Cook remained involved with the creative and production aspects of the group.  Fatt and Cook had been talking about quitting touring for many years; Cook announced his intention to retire first, citing a desire to spend more time with his family, and then Fatt announced his own retirement shortly thereafter.  Page, who was still struggling with his health issues and had stated that his interest was in working with the group's original line-up, was subsequently asked to extend his stay until the end of the year so he would leave alongside Cook and Fatt, to which he agreed.  Cook reported that the original members were confident that the new group would be accepted by the fans because they passed on their founding concepts of early childhood education to Watkins, Gillespie, and Pryce.  The new members, like Moran, who was not approached to return, were salaried employees.The group, for their farewell tour, visited 8 countries and 141 cities, for a total of almost 250 shows in over 200 days for 640,000 people.

It is a pleasure to report that it is possible to do both of these things without feeling deprived or overwhelmed. Just add these two little extras for help with weight-loss success. Add a Little Extra Exercise to Your Daily Routine A simple way to increase the level of exercise during your week is by adding a little more effort into your daily activities – the things you are going to do anyway. For example, we all have to do housework right? So, that is an easy one! Instead of taking your time and working at a leisurely pace, work faster. As you sweep and mop the kitchen floor, put some oomph into it. Work at a steady, brisk pace. Stretch your arms and use your muscles. This will definitely increase your heart rate, and burn more calories. When it’s time to clean the windows, reach up as high as you can – stretch to the top of the windows and be sure to get into the corners. Then, buff the glass to a high sheen, which will involve a little more elbow grease than normal. When you scrub out the tub and the shower, do it with energy and a song – make those tiles shine. Play fun music and dance when you sweep, mop or vacuum. Work for longer periods of time – 20 to 30 minutes of active cleaning is much better than 5 minutes here and 5 minutes there. It gives you more time to get your heart rate going and a better boost to your metabolism. These are things you can do to keep your house sparkling and build the new you. So, start throwing in an abundant amount of gusto for extra calorie burning and body shaping. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: Why does the author recommend sweeping and mopping at a brisk pace?

At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology. In response, treatment of the Paradise in literature, poetry and art shifted towards a self-consciously fictional Utopian representation, as exemplified by the writings of Thomas More (1478–1535).Albrecht Dürer was an avid student of exotic animals, and drew many sketches based on his visits to European zoos. Dürer visited 's-Hertogenbosch during Bosch's lifetime, and it is likely the two artists met, and that Bosch drew inspiration from the German's work.Attempts to find sources for the work in literature from the period have not been successful. Art historian Erwin Panofsky wrote in 1953 that, \\"In spite of all the ingenious, erudite and in part extremely useful research devoted to the task of \\"decoding Jerome Bosch\\", I cannot help feeling that the real secret of his magnificent nightmares and daydreams has still to be disclosed.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose father was of Polish Roman Catholic descent? from the following article ?  Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine.

Write an article based on this \\"Draw the polygon whose angles you need to sum. Choose one vertex. Draw a straight line from Point A to each other vertex in the polygon. Multiply the number of triangles you created by 180.\\"","output":"Title: Understanding Basic Geometry: How to Calculate the Sum of Internal Angles in a Polygon Introduction Geometry is a fundamental branch of mathematics that deals with shapes, sizes, angles, and dimensions of various objects. One of the key concepts in geometry is the polygon, a closed two-dimensional shape with straight sides. In this article, we will discuss a simple and straightforward method to calculate the sum of internal angles of any given polygon using a popular technique known as triangulation. We will first define what a polygon is, and then, step by step, we will guide you through the entire process of finding the sum of its angles. Defining the Polygon A polygon is a closed two-dimensional geometric figure with at least three straight sides and angles, which are formed when two sides meet at the vertices, or corners, of the shape. Some common examples of polygons include triangles (3 sides), quadrilaterals (4 sides), pentagons (5 sides), and hexagons (6 sides). Every polygon has a specific number of vertices, sides, and angles, and the sum of these internal angles can provide valuable information about the shape's properties. Triangulation Technique: A Step by Step Process To calculate the sum of internal angles of the polygon, we will follow the steps described in the task, which relies on the principle of triangulation. This method divides the polygon into a set of non-overlapping triangles, whose angles' sum is equal to the sum of the polygon's angles. Step 1: Draw the Polygon First and foremost, sketch the given polygon on a piece of paper or on any available drawing platform. It is essential to ensure that the polygon is drawn accurately, with all its sides connected and forming a closed shape. Step 2: Choose a Vertex Select one vertex within the polygon that will serve as a point of reference or the center of triangulation. This vertex is commonly referred to as Point A. make sure it is clearly marked. Step 3: Draw Straight Lines From Point A, draw straight lines to each of the other vertices in the polygon, excluding the vertices that are directly adjacent to Point A as they already form a triangle with it. These lines essentially create multiple non-overlapping triangles within the context of the polygon. Step 4: Count the Number of Triangles Once all the triangles have been created, count the total number of triangles formed within the polygon. This number will be directly correlated to the number of sides (n) in the polygon, with the number of triangles being equal to n-2. Step 5: Multiply by 180 Since the sum of angles in every triangle is always equal to 180 degrees, multiply the number of triangles obtained in the previous step by 180. The resulting value represents the sum of the internal angles of the polygon. Final Thoughts In conclusion, finding the sum of internal angles in a polygon is a straightforward process that relies on the principle of triangulation. By following the mentioned steps of drawing the polygon, choosing a vertex, making straight lines to other vertices, counting the triangles, and multiplying by 180, one can easily acquire the desired sum. This knowledge opens up a world of possibilities when exploring the properties of various polygons in geometry. It serves as a foundation for understanding various geometric concepts and shapes and is vital for anyone studying geometry, architecture, or any field that deals with shapes and measurements."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Victory Tour of 1984 headlined the Jacksons and showcased Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. It was the last tour he did with his brothers. Following controversy over the concert's ticket sales, Jackson donated his share of the proceeds, an estimated 3 to 5 million, to charity. His charitable work continued with the release of \\"We Are the World\\" (1985), co-written with Lionel Richie, which raised money for the poor in the US and Africa. It earned 63 million, and became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with 20 million copies sold. It won four Grammys for 1985, including Song of the Year for Jackson and Richie as its writers. The project's creators received two special American Music Awards honors: one for the creation of the song and another for the USA for Africa idea. Jackson, Jones, and promoter Ken Kragan received special awards for their roles in the song's creation.Jackson collaborated with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s, and learned that McCartney was making 40 million a year from owning the rights to other artists' songs. By 1983, Jackson had begun buying publishing rights to others' songs, but he was careful with his acquisitions, only bidding on a few of the dozens that were offered to him. Jackson's early acquisitions of music catalogs and song copyrights such as the Sly Stone collection included \\"Everyday People\\" (1968), Len Barry's \\"1-2-3\\" (1965), and Dion DiMucci's \\"The Wanderer\\" (1961) and \\"Runaround Sue\\" (1961). In 1984 Robert Holmes à Court announced he was selling the ATV Music Publishing catalog comprising the publishing rights to nearly 4000 songs, including most of the Beatles' material. In 1981, McCartney had been offered the catalog for £20 million (40 million). Jackson submitted a bid of 46 million on November 20, 1984.

The given premise states that if his theory were true, Edmund Hillary's ascent of Mount Everest would have been motivated by a desire to test new oxygen tanks, and Joshua Slocum would have circumnavigated the world to rack up frequent-sailing miles. It appears that the premise is suggesting that the motivations behind these historical accomplishments are misconstrued or misrepresented in the given theory. Sir Edmund Hillary, a New Zealand mountaineer, along with Tenzing Norgay, a Sherpa-climber from Nepal, became the first climbers to successfully scale Mount Everest, which was on May 29, 1953. While Hillary may have had multiple reasons for attempting the climb, testing new oxygen tanks is not widely known as his primary motivation. Hillary was known for his passion for adventure and mountaineering. As part of the ninth British Mount Everest expedition, it was a collaborative effort to reach the summit of the highest mountain peak in the world, driven by personal ambition, a sense of adventure, and a desire for exploration. Joshua Slocum was the first person to sail single-handedly around the world, completing his voyage between 1895 and 1898. His journey was an ambitious undertaking, driven by the same sense of adventure and exploration that inspired Hillary. Slocum's decision to embark on this journey was essentially to demonstrate his skill as a seaman and to document the experience in his book, \\"Sailing Alone Around the World.\\" While one could argue that accruing \\"frequent-sailing miles\\" in the modern sense did not exist during Slocum's time, the essence of the premise seems to trivialize his accomplishments rather than focusing on the actual motivations and true groundbreaking nature of his voyage. The premise essentially attempts to frame these historical accomplishments based on superficial or trivial motivations. In doing so, the premise tries to make the underlying theory seem ridiculous. However, we must also consider if this is a fair representation of the true motivations behind these events, or if the premise has taken the theorist's statements out of context for the sake of discrediting them. Assuming that the premise accurately represents the theory in question, it can be said that the hypothesis \\"His theory is a ridiculous one and should not be taken seriously\\" holds some merit. The premise seems to trivialize both Slocum's and Hillary's accomplishments, attributing inconsequential reasons to these significant events. It discredits the adventurous spirit and exploratory nature that drove both Hillary and Slocum, ignoring the deeper meaning behind their journeys. However, if the premise misrepresents the true intentions behind the theory, then the hypothesis would be flawed and inaccurate. It is essential to keep an open mind and critically evaluate the information being presented before reaching a conclusion on the validity of the hypothesis. In conclusion, if the premise accurately portrays the theory in question, one could agree that the hypothesis \\"His theory is a ridiculous one and should not be taken seriously\\" is true. However, if the premise misrepresents the theory or takes it out of context, then the hypothesis would need to be reevaluated in light of the entire context and accurate information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Drumdruan Upper School was created a few years ago by Scottish actress Tilda Swinton, star of many a Hollywood blockbuster and forever in my mind the terrifying Witch in the Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe. The school extends a Steiner education beyond the age of 14, and takes students through to their University years. The Observer has published a fascinating and detailed account of some of the recipe that makes this a special place and, above all, has bowled over the traditionally conservative schools inspectorate: That is not what happened: the inspectors sat in the classes and watched the students. And if you watch the students at Drumduan, you soon notice they are confident, articulate, highly motivated and respectful. These are, in fact, the words used by the inspectors in their subsequent report. You might even believe the students at Drumduan wanted to be there. The inspectors clearly felt so, but it was when they had retired to an office to confer that Krzysztof, a master of the spontaneous gesture, delivered the coup de grace. He sang to them. Music is something of a hallmark at Drumduan, where children participate in regular workshops – often on instruments like a wheelie bin – and start each day singing in four-part harmonies. “We were rehearsing in another room, and I said: ‘This song is terrific, we have to show these inspectors,’” Krzysztof recalls. “So we burst into their office – they were a bit alarmed – and I said: ‘I’m sorry, we’ve just got to sing this song to you.’” The song was “Media Vita”, a medieval score of haunting beauty that reduced the inspectors to tears, according to Krzysztof.

As Style.com’s Nicole Phelps explained back in February about the Rodarte Fall/Winter 2010 collection, “[T]hey became interested in the troubled border town of Ciudad JuÃ¡rez; the hazy, dreamlike quality of the landscape there; and the maquiladora workers going to the factory in the middle of the night.” For serious.      And:      The show ended with a quartet of ethereal, unraveling, rather beautiful white dresses that alternately called to mind quinceaÃ±era parties, corpse brides, and, if you wanted to look at it through a really dark prism, the ghosts of the victims of JuÃ¡rez’s drug wars.      The names of the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte cosmetics that were to go on sale this fall-blush, lip gloss, eyeshadows and nail polish, and so on-included “factory,” “JuÃ¡rez,” “Ghost town,” “del Norte” and “quinceaÃ±era.”      Maybe it was overreacting, to be appalled by this news? Maybe the Mulleavys and their colleagues were not really really intending to glamorize the violence and bloodshed and horror of life in that sad and dangerous town. Oh yes, well then, take a gander at the models-and the makeup.      All hell started breaking loose, a lot of bloggers wrote about it and then, around the 16th of June, MÂ·AÂ·C and Rodarte issued these statements! That are crazy!      Just thinking about the number of people who have to have been involved in this product development, who have to have known about it, is disturbing. Did any of them speak up, as this product was being designed, packaged, prepared for market? Did anyone figure out to say, this stuff we are making here, that you put on your FACE, you know, it looks like blood. It suggests carnage, blood, in the desert, blood of abducted, raped, strangled women? Does it suggest that to you, a little bit?      Apparently, no.      MÂ·AÂ·C Cosmetics Statement:      We understand that product names in the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte collection have offended some of our consumers and fans. This was never our intent and we are very sorry. We are listening carefully to the comments posted and are grateful to those of you who have brought your concerns to the forefront of our attention. MÂ·AÂ·C will give a portion of the proceeds from the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte collection to help those in need in Juarez. We are diligently investigating the best way to do this. Please be assured that we will keep you posted on the details regarding our efforts.      Rodarte Company Statement:      Our makeup collaboration with MÂ·AÂ·C developed from inspirations on a road trip that we took in Texas last year, from El Paso to Marfa. The ethereal nature of this landscape influenced the creative development and desert palette of the collection. We are truly saddened about injustice in Juarez and it is a very important issue to us. The MÂ·AÂ·C collaboration was intended as a celebration of the beauty of the landscape and people in the areas that we traveled.      Okay, yes! Fine. We made our makeup look like blood because it is a celebration of the beauty. So, now that’s cleared up, right?      No! OMG, people were still mad!! So on or about July 19th, MÂ·AÂ·C announced that they were going to change the names of this stuff, that you put on your face, and also “donate 100,000 to an organization that helps women in Juarez.”      And then everyone calmed down-oh wait! No sorry, still no! Fury still raging unabated for entitled materialist horrorshow! Finally, on Friday, MÂ·AÂ·C issued another a press release explaining that now, all profits from the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte collection will go to “a newly created initiative to raise awareness and provide on-the-ground support to the women and girls in Juarez.”      Evidently they went clear to Mexico in order to try to recover a shred or two of dignity; even the tone of this press release grows humbler:      …MÂ·AÂ·C and Rodarte are deeply sorry that this makeup collection was so offensive to the people of Mexico and concerned global citizens.      This announcement follows a meeting last evening in Mexico City with MÂ·AÂ·C executives and Mexican government officials, including CONAVIM (ComisiÃ³n Nacional Para Prevenir y Erradicar la Violencia Contra las Mujeres/National Commission to Prevent and Eradicate Violence Against Women.)      During the meeting, held at the Mexican Ministry of Foreign Affairs, this collective group committed to working together on the overall direction of the new initiative to help the women and girls of Juarez and to raise global awareness of their plight. MÂ·AÂ·C executives reiterated their deep regret and reinforced that it was never MÂ·AÂ·C’s or Rodarte’s intent to minimize the suffering of the women and girls of Ciudad Juarez.      So, if the strategy of giving 100% of their profits to charity also fails to repair their shattered image, one is forced to wonder whether MÂ·AÂ·C and Rodarte are planning to step in and do something about Mexican police corruption, next. After that, if necessary, maybe they can turn their attention to the crooked elections, and finally the drug cartels.      The cliché view of fashion insiders as shallow and uninformed remains completely undisturbed by this fiasco. The disconnect between the actual facts on the ground in JuÃ¡rez and these surreal press releases and the reactions from the fashion press they spawned could not be more eye-crossing.      Nobody at Rodarte seems to have objected to anything about the Style.com review of their show back in February, which directly referenced JuÃ¡rez; there was no outcry from the fashion press at that time, that I could find. It’s only when MÂ·AÂ·C started passing out the press releases to a larger public that a multitude of hackles went up. Indeed, the objections of quite a number of “concerned global citizens” have been met with outright mockery on the New York magazine fashion blog The Cut and elsewhere.      This is a pity. In times past there have been very cultivated, well-informed men and women in charge of the schmattas. I’d go so far as to say that the ideal of the fashion world used to represent a union of taste and intelligence; and really, is is possible to have one without the other? Where is the Cecil Beaton of today? The Christian Dior, the Diana Vreeland?      And is it remotely possible that the Mulleavy sisters were trying to make a Guernica-like statement with their art? It is possible. Except… they’ve responded to the criticism by backpedaling furiously, which says something about the authenticity or seriousness of the original statement. So maybe it’s as simple as it looks: for Rodarte to exploit the catastrophe in JuÃ¡rez in order to sell dresses and makeup demonstrates the dehumanizing effects of a debased, pathologically materialist society that has evidently gone clean off the rails. It would be easy to make that observation and dismiss the whole affair.      It’s worth asking, though: what is really going on when violence and horror are appropriated in order to create a consumer product? Because quite often the makers of newpapers, books and films are involved in creating consumer products based on real horror, just as these raggers tried (and failed) to do.      To take this comparison to an extreme, let’s consider the novel 2666, by the late Roberto BolaÃ±o. This book, like the MÂ·AÂ·C Rodarte makeup, is both a comment on the JuÃ¡rez femicides and a consumer product.      The Part About the Crimes, the fourth section of 2666, is something like a catalogue of the femicides, deliberately dry, without poetry. It’s more or less a list of bodies, with details of their height, their hair color, their clothes, written with a police-procedural air. It is punishing to read, the longest part of a long book, written in deliberately ugly, dull prose; this, from a man capable of the utmost inventiveness, wit and penetration. So what’s the difference between selling eyeshadow “inspired by” these terrible events, and writing a novel about them?      I submit that the difference is one of vanity. Rodarte was posing alongside the victims of JuÃ¡rez, in a way, asking you to be shocked and titillated by the real live goth corpses, the disturbing juxtaposition of horror and beauty. But nothing was meant to change in JuÃ¡rez or anywhere else as the result of this aestheticized rubbernecking. BolaÃ±o, on the other hand, wasn’t asking anything at all (aside from asking that you read his book.)      2666 isn’t a call to arms. It offers nothing in the way of judgments, let alone solutions. There’s no self-aggrandizement, no style; the author of 2666 has erased himself right out of the picture, leaving just a mirror of the human condition for you to look in. This is a matter of telling the truth, a deliberate avoidance of the “sensational.” Where Rodarte attemped to steal the terrible emotions evoked by the fact that hundreds, maybe thousands of girls have been abducted, raped and murdered in JuÃ¡rez, and trivialize (and then, “monetize”) those emotions by turning them into eyeshadow, BolaÃ±o asks that you stop being horrified, and just look at the truth; nothing more. What happens afterward is left for us to determine.

Write an article with the title: \\"A Flower Arrangement Inspired by Frida Kahlo\\" Article:","output":"Title: A Flower Arrangement Inspired by Frida Kahlo Introduction: (Step 1: Introduce the subject and provide context about Frida Kahlo and her art) Frida Kahlo, an iconic Mexican artist, is known for her powerful and evocative paintings that have been celebrated worldwide. Her art has been a source of inspiration for many people, capturing the essence of Mexican culture with its bold colors and intricate detailing. In this article, we will explore a flower arrangement inspired by the artistic genius of Frida Kahlo and guide you through creating a floral masterpiece that embodies her vibrant spirit.  Background on Frida Kahlo: (Step 2: Provide more information about Frida Kahlo's life and art) Born in 1907 in Mexico City, Frida Kahlo's artistic journey was heavily influenced by her life experiences and heritage. Her work often portrayed the intense emotions she felt, as well as her love for Mexican traditions. Through her paintings and self-portraits, Kahlo showcased her unique perspective on life, love, pain, and identity, which resonates with viewers even decades after her passing. Choosing the Flowers: (Step 3: Explain how to select the right flowers and colors inspired by Kahlo's art) To create a floral arrangement that reflects Frida Kahlo's artistry, start by selecting flowers with vibrant hues and intricate details. Mexican marigolds, calla lilies, and hibiscus are popular choices for Mexican-inspired arrangements. Additionally, you can incorporate other flowers like dahlias, sunflowers, roses, and orchids to add depth and variety. Pay particular attention to color composition, striving for visually appealing combinations and contrasts. You may want to reference a specific Kahlo painting to guide your color choices. Arrangement Design: (Step 4: Describe the design process of the flower arrangement) Frida Kahlo often used symmetry in her paintings, adding an aesthetically pleasing balance to her compositions. To achieve a similar effect in your arrangement, consider creating a balanced layout with flowers of similar shapes and sizes on both sides. Incorporate various textures by including flowers with unique foliage, like ferns, eucalyptus, and ruscus. You can also add artistic elements such as ribbons or small tokens, like miniature picture frames, to represent her signature self-portraits. Container Selection: (Step 5: Choose a suitable container for the flower arrangement) To fully capture the essence of Frida Kahlo's art, select a container that complements the floral design and reflects Mexican culture. Traditional Mexican pottery, like Talavera vases or urns, can add an authentic touch to your arrangement. Alternatively, you can use a simple container and decorate it with bright, patterned fabrics or ribbons. Finishing Touches: (Step 6: Finalize the arrangement with additional details) To complete your Frida Kahlo-inspired flower arrangement, add the finishing touches that pay homage to the artist's signature style. Consider incorporating a bold eyebrow design made from thin, flexible branches or small flowers, as seen in her self-portraits. You can also attach a small, framed print of a Kahlo painting to the arrangement for an added touch of creativity. Conclusion: (Step 7: Conclude the article by summarizing the key points) By following these steps, you can create a stunning flower arrangement that captures the essence of Frida Kahlo's art and celebrates her unique contributions to the world of art. This floral masterpiece can serve as an eye-catching centerpiece for an event or simply as a vibrant reminder of the rich and passionate spirit of the iconic Mexican artist. So, gather your materials, unleash your creativity, and let Frida Kahlo's spirit guide you in crafting a floral tribute to her incredible artistic legacy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The squirrels are very ingenious however but this feeder requires more work to get a little seed. The squirrels lose interest after awhile. Answer:","output":"The impact of the review on the decision-making process greatly depends on several factors. The review suggests both positive and negative aspects of the product, making it a balanced review that provides valuable information for potential buyers. The review increases the chances of purchasing the product to some extent as it indicates that the feeder under review has a large capacity. For potential buyers, especially those who want to feed numerous birds or refill the feeder less frequently, this feature could be seen as highly beneficial. A large capacity feeder can hold more seeds, which is practical for attracting a variety of birds and keeping them fed for longer periods. On the other hand, the review could also decrease the probability of purchasing the product as it points out that the feeder is somewhat squirrel resistant. This could be viewed in two ways: a positive feature for those who want to deter squirrels from accessing the bird seed, as it requires the squirrels to work harder and often they lose interest. Thus, it may save bird seed in the long run and keep it specifically for the birds.  Conversely, if a potential buyer does not have a squirrel problem or enjoys feeding squirrels, this might be seen as a disadvantage. They may prefer a feeder that's easy access for all creatures.  Therefore, it's essential to consider your own needs, preferences, and circumstances when interpretating and applying the information given in the review. The review is balanced and provides useful insight into the product’s operation and its ability to deter squirrels, along with its overall capacity, allowing you to make a more informed decision about whether the product would suit your requirements or not."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The current Member of Parliament (MP) for Norwich South is Clive Lewis, who is a member of the Labour Party. He has held this position since May 2015. Clive Lewis has not served as the Home Secretary in the UK government. However, the former Home Secretary to which you may have been referring could be Charles Clarke. Charles Clarke, also a member of the Labour Party, served as the Home Secretary in the United Kingdom between December 2004 and May 2006 under the Prime Minister at the time, Tony Blair. Charles Clarke was the MP for Norwich South from 1997 until 2010 when he lost his seat to the Liberal Democrat candidate Simon Wright, who then held the position until 2015. As a Home Secretary, Charles Clarke was responsible for overseeing significant and sometimes controversial policy developments pertaining to national security, crime reduction, and anti-terrorism. Some of the most notable policy initiatives during his tenure include the relaxation of licensing laws, expansion of community policing, and the unsuccessful attempt to increase the detention period of terrorism suspects without charge from 14 to 90 days. In conclusion, the former Home Secretary who was an MP for Norwich South is Charles Clarke, who held the position from 1997 to 2010.

Article: A 13-year-old American has made a cheap machine that can help blind people read. The blind can read by using _ - a system of small bumps   that the blind touch to read the letters. The machine that makes these small bumps usually costs at least 2,000. It is called Braille writer. The American schoolboy, Shubham Banerjee, made a new Braille writer from a Lego tool that lets people create robots. Banerjee has called his new machine the Braigo - a combination   of the words Braille and Lego. It costs just  350. It works by changing electronic text into Braille and then printing it using a computer or mobile machine. Banerjee designed   his Braigo last year for a school science exhibition. Since then, he has caught the interest of Silicon Valley in the USA. The big technology company Intel spent money on Banerjee's machine last November, but they did not say how much money they put in.

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Last year, Dr. Kiran Sagar, a cardiologist in Wisconsin, was fired two months after presenting strong data showing that cardiologists in the hospital she worked at misread a substantial number of heart tests. Similarly, a nurse from Columbia Hospital Corp. of America (HCA) was let go after complaining that a doctor was performing unnecessary cardiac procedures, even after an internal investigation found the nurse's claim to be substantiated. And a few weeks ago, the CBS News program \\"60 Minutes\\" reported on ER doctors fired for not meeting quotas on the percentage of patients they admitted to the hospital. These recent patterns of firings send yet another strong message to every doctor and nurse who has ever considered speaking up about dangerous and fraudulent medical care: Speak up and risk destroying your career. The culture of health care needs to change. Medical mistakes cause too many needless harm or deaths, yet few people see the problem in this context because we rarely have an open and honest conversation about the quality of health care in America. When we do, it is often behind closed doors. This is a challenge that a new generation of doctors is working to change through initiatives ranging from more transparent bedside care to public reporting of hospital performance. Doctors and nurses increasingly feel disconnected from policymakers and even their own hospitals, some of which have transformed into giant corporations. Despite concerns from the Federal Trade Commission that costs will go up for consumers, hospital mega-mergers are on the rise. This past year saw a large number of hospital mergers and acquisitions in health care. While some hospital executives have commendably used a hospital chain's large size to standardize best practices, others have fallen into the age-old management trap of detaching themselves from the front lines and becoming dangerously out of touch with their own staff. I talk to doctors and nurses around the country every week. One trend that seems clear is that more doctors and nurses are feeling frustrated. A recent national study by Mayo Clinic researchers shows that doctor burnout rate is now up to a staggering 46%. A new phenomenon, quite different from when my father practiced medicine, is that doctors and nurses now say they feel like they are tenants working for their landlord: the hospital management. Often, doctors and nurses know how to make care better and safer but feel stripped of the power to make necessary changes. This worker-management disconnect (even antagonism) in any industry is dangerous. In medicine this workplace atmosphere, complicated by perverse economic incentives and weak systems of accountability, contributes to a hospital culture marked by a lack of a sense of communal ownership in the overall delivery of care. What results is a poorer quality of care, more overtreatment, more fraud, more medical mistakes, and more patients falling through the cracks. According to a 2009 CBS-New York Times poll, 77% of Americans say they are satisfied with the quality of their health care. But what makes people think the health care they're receiving is good? Very little. A Harvard study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported an alarming fact: 18% of patients were actually harmed by medical care. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that up to 30% of health care procedures, tests and other services do not improve health outcomes. For instance, if you had a medical condition, would you go to a hospital that has performed more than 1,000 unnecessary procedures? Probably not. As much as one-third of all health care expenditures may be going to waste, fraud and unnecessary medical care. This problem is high on the agenda for the American Board of Internal Medicine. Other physician groups have joined the \\"Choosing Wisely\\" Campaign to address unnecessary care in American medicine. The Institute of Medicine is calling attention to the problem, and many medical researchers are speaking openly about it. But more needs to be done. Rather than reinforce a closed-door culture in American medicine, hospitals should use their new large size to encourage external and independent peer reviews and create a culture of transparency. Patients should be encouraged to keep a copy of their medical records, not inconvenienced with burdensome processes and extra charges to obtain them. A hospital's front-line health care workers are their work engine, and these people should be encouraged to voice their safety concerns to their managers. Mega-hospitals need to stay true to their mission and not fall into the large corporate pitfalls that can erode the standing of any business. A workplace culture that punishes those who speak up about problems by depriving them of their career livelihood is part of the problem itself. As a surgeon, I sometimes see patients after they have blindly walked into the hands of dangerous, expensive and avoidable care. If we are serious about improving health care quality and lowering costs, we need to address the issue of accountability. Our hospitals must be more accountable to patients and doctors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Marty Makary. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The culture of healthcare needs to change to improve patient safety and reduce medical mistakes. Recent patterns of firing doctors and nurses who raise concerns about dangerous and fraudulent medical care are reinforcing the closed-door culture, preventing transparency and ultimately contributing to more needless harm or deaths. Hospital mega-mergers are on the rise, which can lead to executives becoming dangerously detached from their staff. Doctors and nurses often feel disconnected from policymakers and even their own hospitals. They feel like tenants working for their landlords, the hospital management, rather than empowered individuals. As a result, they are often aware of how to make care better and safer but lack the authority to do so. This workplace disconnect leads to poorer quality of care, overtreatment, fraud, and more medical mistakes. To address this issue, hospitals should encourage external and independent peer reviews, create an environment of transparency, allow patients to keep copies of their medical records, and empower frontline healthcare workers to voice their concerns. Furthermore, mega-hospitals should focus on their mission and avoid the pitfalls of large corporations. Improving healthcare quality and lowering costs require addressing accountability. Hospitals must become more accountable to patients and doctors. By fostering a culture of transparency and empowering healthcare workers, we can make significant strides in reducing medical errors and improving patient safety."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Is turn used to mean the same thing in the next two sentences? Turn your face to the wall. The people turned against the President when he stole the election.","output":"No, the word \\"turn\\" is not used to mean the same thing in these two sentences. In both cases, the word \\"turn\\" is used as a verb, but its context and implications differ. In the first sentence, \\"Turn your face to the wall,\\" the word \\"turn\\" is used in a physical sense, indicating a change in direction or orientation of your face. In this context, it means to rotate your head so that your face is now pointing towards the wall, possibly moving from one position to another. This usage implies a change in the spatial arrangement of your face relative to the wall, and the action is straightforward and literal. In the second sentence, \\"The people turned against the President when he stole the election,\\" the word \\"turn\\" is used in a more metaphorical and abstract sense. Here, \\"turn\\" indicates a change in the people's attitude, loyalty, support, or opinion towards the President. The action of turning against the President implies that the people's perspective or stance has shifted from being in favor or supportive of the President to being against him, due to his actions of stealing the election. This usage is more figurative and denotes a psychological or emotional change rather than a physical one. In conclusion, although the word \\"turn\\" is used as a verb in both sentences, its meaning changes depending on the context. In the first sentence, it refers to a physical rotation or movement, while in the second sentence, it represents a change in attitude, loyalty, or opinion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Heating liquids: Heating liquids does not directly increase the amount of ultraviolet light. 2. Clouds: Clouds may partially block UV radiation, so their presence generally does not increase the amount of ultraviolet light. 3. Smog: Smog is a form of air pollution, which can absorb or scatter some UV radiation. However, smog itself does not directly increase the amount of ultraviolet light. 4. Emissions: Emissions result in air pollution, which can deplete the ozone layer through reactions with certain chemicals such as CFCs. While emissions contribute to ozone depletion, they do not directly increase the amount of ultraviolet light. 5. Less ozone: As stated in the question, less ozone means more ultraviolet light due to the reduced protective layer in the Earth's atmosphere. 6. Gravity: Gravity is not directly related to the amount of ultraviolet light. 7. Sun's heat: The sun emits UV radiation as part of its electromagnetic spectrum, but the sun's heat in isolation is not directly responsible for an increase in ultraviolet light. 8.

What is the reason of British occupation in India? What was the actual intention of the British to invade India? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. They are both asking for the reasons and intentions behind the British occupation and invasion of India. Let me provide an answer to these questions. The primary reasons for the British occupation in India are rooted in trade, economic interests, and asserting political power. Step 1: Identify the origin of British involvement in India - The British East India Company was established in 1600, with the main objective of carrying out trade with the Indian subcontinent, primarily in textiles, spices, and other exotic goods. Step 2: Understand how the Company's role in India evolved - Over time, the British East India Company gained territorial control in India and developed political power after winning a series of battles, notably the Battle of Plassey (1757) and the Battle of Buxar (1764). This enabled them to establish their foothold in the country. Step 3: Analyze the motivations behind the occupation  - There were several reasons for the British interest in occupying India, including: 1. Economic gains: India possessed vast resources and a large consumer market that provided the British with lucrative trade opportunities. 2. Geopolitical power: The British wanted to protect their trade routes to Asia, secure their foothold in India, and prevent other European powers from gaining influence in the region. 3. Cultural superiority and civilizing mission: The British believed they had the moral responsibility to bring their culture, language, and institutions to India, assuming that they would be improving the lives of the Indian population. In summary, while both questions inquire about the same topic, the British occupation in India can be attributed to a combination of economic interests, geopolitical power, and a perceived cultural superiority."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Fact 1: Molecules of tRNA bring amino acids to the ribosome in the correct sequence.

Rihanna has two brothers, Rorrey and Rajad Fenty, and two half-sisters and a half-brother from her father's side, each born to different mothers from his previous relationships. She grew up in a three-bedroom bungalow in Bridgetown and sold clothes with her father in a stall on the street. Context: Early in her career, Rihanna made clear her interest in fashion and desire to work in the clothing design industry. In November 2011, Rihanna announced her first fashion venture with Armani. In February 2013, Rihanna presented her first women's spring fashion collection at London Fashion Week for British street fashion brand River Island, collaborating with her personal stylist Adam Selman. They published two more collections for the brand, a summer edition released on 25 May 2013 and an autumn edition released on 10 September 2013. The fourth and last collection for River Island, the winter edition was released on 7 November 2013. Rihanna went on to collaborate with numerous fashion house's including Dior, Stance and Manolo Blahnik. In March 2015, it was announced that Rihanna had been chosen as the new face of Dior; this makes her the first black woman to be the face of Dior.  In December 2014, it was confirmed that Rihanna would become the creative director of the fashion sportswear Puma, overseeing the brand's women's line which will include collaborations in apparel and footwear. In the fall of 2015, Rihanna released her first trainer with Puma, and the sneaker sold out online with three hours of its pre-sale launch. Over the next two years, Rihanna released various other footwear in different colorways and styles, which were all met positively by both critics and buyers. 2016 saw Rihanna debut her first clothing line in collaboration with Puma at New York Fashion Week; the collection was met with rave reviews from fashion critics. In the spring of that year, Rihanna debuted her second collection at Paris Fashion Week and was met with critical acclaim. Vogue magazine praised the collection and Rihanna, stating \\"Sometimes when a famous person tries his or her hand at another discipline, the results can be uneven. And yet there are those special cases when making the switch leads to a good surprise. Judging by the collection she showed today, we can add Rihanna to that list.\\" In Autumn 2017, Rihanna x Puma returned to New York, for the debut of their autumn collection, like previous lines the collection was met with positive reviews. Vogue Magazine stated \\"Fenty x Puma has kept one step ahead, so to speak, thanks in part to shoe designs that think outside the box--Rihanna is the first woman to have won Footwear News's coveted Shoe of the Year award, after all.\\"  Rihanna has become a fashion icon. On 2 June 2014, Rihanna received the Fashion Icon Award at the 2014 Council of Fashion Designers of America Fashion Awards at the Lincoln Center's Alice Tully Hall. Regarding this, she said, \\"Fashion has always been my defense mechanism\\". Mexican singer Becky G told Latina magazine that Rihanna is one of her style icons. Question: Has she done anything particular with her fashion? Answer:","output":"Yes, Rihanna has done several things with her fashion. She has worked with famous brands like Armani and River Island, creating her own clothing collections. She also became the creative director of Puma's fashion sportswear, where she designed shoes and clothes that received positive reviews. Rihanna even won an award for her shoe designs and was named a Fashion Icon in 2014. She is known for her unique and stylish fashion choices, inspiring others like singer Becky G."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Steptoes have retired their horse - because the horse is lame, after having to pull the cart (and Harold) home from York, after the horse walked into the back of a removal van which then drove off - and plan to buy a new one with Albert's life savings of £80, putting £9 away for \\"emergencies\\". Harold sends Albert home and returns several hours later drunk and introduces Hercules the Second, a short sighted racing greyhound. Harold reveals to Albert that he purchased this from local gangster and loan shark Frankie Barrow for the £80 plus a further £200 owing on top. Furthermore, he plans to pay a small fortune to keep it fed on egg and steak.   They eventually have to sell all of their possessions to have one final bet on their dog at the races to try to pay off the money they owe. When their dog loses, they just about lose hope when Albert brings up that he had saved £1,000 in a life insurance policy. Harold then schemes to get the money from his father by faking his death. They find an old mannequin among their collection of junk and fit it around Albert's body.

States look at corporate plates to help with deficits By Katharine Lackey, USA TODAY Michael Coburn of Allen, Texas, has been a RE/Max agent for 23 years, so when a license plate with the company's red, white and blue balloon logo became available at the end of last year, he bought one for himself that reads MRREMX and one for his wife, Debra, MSREMX. \\"It's a really good marketing strategy,\\" he says, adding that a buyer chose him as a Realtor after seeing his plate. \\"Everybody likes to show pride in their company, and it gets you business.\\" Facing another year of budget cuts, some cash-strapped states are looking at corporate logo license plates as a way to add dollars to their coffers. Texas became the first to sell corporate license plates last November, says Kim Drummond, spokeswoman for My Plates, which produces the plates for the state. Legislators in Illinois and Florida have proposed similar programs, and Virginia is looking at a program of special plates for business fleets registered in the state. Drummond says three companies will join RE/Max in making corporate logo plates available in Texas on Wednesday: Ford; Mighty Fine Burgers, an Austin-based eatery; and Vestas, a wind energy company. Since its inception, My Plates has sold more than 28,000 license plates. Through Nov. 3, sales of the plates had raised about 2.1 million for the state's general revenue fund, Drummond says. At least 35% of the sales goes to the general revenue fund, she says. Prices range from 55 for a plate with a background design and a random combination of letters and numbers to 595 for a 10-year plate with a background design and any combination of six letters and/or numbers, Drummond says. \\"Everybody is very clear that the idea is to help the state with its deficit,\\" she says. That's what representatives in Illinois and Florida had in mind when they made proposals that stalled this year. Florida state Sen. Mike Fasano, a Republican, introduced legislation in March that would have created a corporate license plate program and provided drivers who purchased the plates at least a 50% reduction in their annual plate fee, with the corporations footing the bill, Fasano says. The bill died in conference committee, he says. He is considering whether to reintroduce it in the next legislative session. \\"At a time when people are struggling, it would be a great opportunity for (drivers) to have a choice of having a corporate logo and, at the same time, save a significant amount every year,\\" Fasano says. Florida state Sen. Lee Constantine, a Republican, says he voted against the bill, as he does nearly all license plate bills, because it's \\"ridiculous\\" in Florida. He says there are already too many specialty plates in the state. A similar bill introduced in February by Illinois state Rep. Joseph Lyons, a Democrat, also would have provided a discount for vehicle owners who purchased corporate plates, but the bill died in committee, Lyons says. He plans to make the bill a higher priority this session. \\"In an environment where every state is looking to put something back into its coffers, everything is on the playing field,\\" he says. \\"Let's listen to any idea that might bring some revenue to the state.\\" In Texas, companies must pay 5,000 in fees per design, and 10% of the plates' proceeds can either go to a charity or, in Ford's case, toward licensing its brand name, Drummond says. For RE/Max plates, 10% of proceeds goes toward the Children's Miracle Network, says Charles El-Moussa, chief operating officer and general counsel at RE/Max of Texas. For Mighty Fine Burgers, the corporate logo license plate is a chance for customers to show their loyalty, says Allison Dreiband, public relations specialist for the company. In return, customers who get the plates will receive 100 worth of burger bucks for every year they have the plates on their cars, she says. •Virginia. Republican Gov. Bob McDonnell's Commission on Government Reform and Restructuring recommended allowing the state Department of Motor Vehicles to offer special plates with company logos for business fleets within the state or registered there, according to the commission's Oct. 15 report. The commission plans to issue an additional report Dec. 1. More than 350 businesses have fleets in the state for a total of 130,000 vehicles that would be eligible, says Melanie Stokes, Virginia DMV spokeswoman. Corporations would be charged a one-time fee ranging from 4,000 to 4,500, depending on the size of the fleet, bringing potential revenue of more than 1 million. •Nebraska. In 2009, the Legislature passed a bill to allow non-profit organizations to apply for specialty license plates through the state DMV. The program, which will enter its first year Jan. 1, requires companies to provide 500 prepaid applications — a total of 35,000 at 70 per plate — to be considered, says Dusty Vaughan, legal counsel for the Nebraska Legislature's Transportation Committee. In 2009, the state raised about 600,000 through the sale of its Huskers plate. You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Analyzing the possible answers: We have five options to consider - vacuum tube, television, computer, cathode ray, and oscilloscope. 3. Eliminating irrelevant options:     a. Vacuum tube: A vacuum tube is an electronic component that controls electric current, and it is found within devices like televisions and computers, but it is not a device that measures things itself.        b. Television: A television is a device that displays moving images, but it is primarily a consumer device for entertainment and media, not meant for measurement purposes.        c. Computer: A computer is an electronic device that can process data and calculations, but it itself is not typically viewed as a measurement device. Although computers can be used to analyze measurements, they are not primarily designed for this purpose.        d. Cathode ray: A cathode ray is not a device but rather a stream of electrons emitted by a cathode in a vacuum tube, which is used in various devices such as televisions and oscilloscopes. It is a component, not a measuring device. 4. Identifying the correct answer: This leaves us with the oscilloscope. An oscilloscope is a device that is used to measure and analyze electrical signals, particularly their voltage and time properties. It uses a cathode ray tube for displaying the waveform of electrical signals, which aligns with the description given in the question.

You are presented with the question \\"What breathes with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults.\\" and the following answer choices:  - Salmon.  - Frogs.  - parasites  - Whales.  - Mice.  - a fish  - air  - tortoises  Now knowing that most amphibians breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults and all frogs are amphibians, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","output":"Frogs.  Frogs, as a type of amphibian, undergo a unique process during their life cycle that causes them to transition from breathing with gills as larvae to breathing with lungs as adults. The development of frogs begins with eggs that are laid in water, which hatch into larvae commonly known as tadpoles.  Tadpoles are aquatic creatures that possess gills to help them extract oxygen from the water, which enables them to survive in their underwater environment. As tadpoles begin to grow and mature, they undergo a metamorphosis process that entails various physiological transformations. One significant aspect of this metamorphosis is the transition from gills to lungs for the purpose of respiration. During metamorphosis, the gills of a tadpole begin to disappear, and the development of lungs commences. Once transformation is complete, the lungs become fully functional, allowing adult frogs to breathe air from the atmosphere. This adaptation is crucial for the survival of adult frogs, as their habitat typically includes both aquatic and terrestrial environments. In addition to frogs, other amphibians such as salamanders and newts also experience similar transitions in their life cycle, allowing them to breathe with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults. This particular characteristic sets amphibians apart from other groups of animals, such as reptiles, birds, and mammals, which typically rely on one mode of respiration throughout their entire lives. Returning to the provided answer choices, we can eliminate salmon, as they are fish and primarily rely on gills for oxygen exchange in both their juvenile and adult stages. Parasites vary in their respiratory systems depending on the species, but they generally do not follow the same pattern as amphibians (gills as larvae and lungs as adults). Whales, mice, and tortoises are all vertebrates that belong to different animal groups (mammals, reptiles) and do not possess gills at any stage of their development. The provided answer \\"a fish\\" is too vague and does not take into account the unique characteristics of amphibians. And finally, air is not an appropriate answer, as it is not an organism. Based on the information provided and the process of elimination, the best answer to the question \\"What breathes with gills as larvae and with lungs as adults.\\" is frogs, as they are representative of the amphibian group that undergoes this unique respiratory transition throughout their life cycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Who has more abnormal cells in their body?  Jason recently learned that he has cancer. After hearing this news, he convinced his wife, Charlotte, to get checked out. After running several tests, the doctors determined Charlotte has no cancer, but she does have high blood pressure. Relieved at this news, Jason was now focused on battling his cancer and fighting as hard as he could to survive.  Hint: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation. Answer:","output":"Jason has more abnormal cells in his body. The paragraph states that Jason has cancer, which is a disease characterized by abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably due to mutations. In contrast, Charlotte does not have cancer, but she has high blood pressure. Therefore, Jason has more abnormal cells than Charlotte."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After his failed attempt at flirting with the pretty girl, Bill returned to the booth where Teddy was sitting. Frustrated and fueled by the alcohol they have consumed, the two friends started to engage in a lively conversation. They discussed how they believed some pretty girls to be stuck up. With each word, their voices grew louder, drawing the attention of patrons in the bar. Teddy, trying to support his friend, chimed in with stories of his own. They both shared stories of unsuccessful attempts at talking to pretty girls in the past and how they felt judged and dismissed by these women. As the night went on, their conversation evolved from bemoaning the stuck-up nature of pretty girls to discussing their own insecurities and past heartbreaks. They touched upon how societal expectations and the pressure to find a partner affected their self-esteem and approach to dating. The exploration of their own vulnerabilities revealed different layers to their relationship, allowing them to grow closer as friends. However, unbeknownst to them, the pretty girl who Bill had tried to flirt with earlier was sitting at a nearby table, overhearing their entire conversation. She couldn't help but feel a pang of guilt at having been the catalyst for such negative discussion. Although she had been caught off-guard by Bill's drunken state, she now understood that his actions were likely a result of his own anxieties and pressure to impress her.

Caught off-guard, Bill and Teddy listened intently as she explained her perspective on their conversation. They discovered that judging others based on appearances or a single interaction can lead to misunderstandings and unnecessary animosity. Ultimately, the pretty girl suggested they start fresh and get to know each other without any preconceived notions about who they might be. The three of them exchanged numbers, with the hopes of meeting up again on a night when Bill wouldn't be too drunk to communicate effectively. This chance encounter between Bill, Teddy, and the pretty girl taught them valuable lessons about assumptions, empathy, and the importance of open communication in relationships.

Toward a More Secure Retirement As one who has long been involved with retirement plans as a consultant to large employers, I have seen 401(k)’s morph from their intended role as supplements to traditional pension plans to become the primary retirement vehicle for most American workers. Your reference to the need for 401(k) improvements and new savings accounts with shared risks overlooks the more pressing need for a retirement plan that will provide guaranteed lifelong income that keeps pace with inflation. Such a retirement plan has existed for over 70 years: Social Security. As 401(k)’s have tanked and private pensions vanished, Social Security remains the only reliable plan for future retirees and their families. Federal dollars will be much better spent enhancing Social Security, especially for lower-income Americans, than subsidizing new forms of individual savings that have proved ineffective. William J. Arnone New York, Jan. 26, 2009 Your editorial portrays the “grim reality” facing retirees: an uncertain financial market, inadequate savings and employer contributions, shift of all risks to workers (investment, longevity) and so on. And the solutions are unsatisfactorily focused on patching up existing arrangements. Fortunately, a superb answer is available: Simply expand Social Security to provide a benefit to replace 70 percent of average pay rather than the current 41 percent. Consider: It’s already set up as a national plan, does not depend on anyone’s investment acumen, avoids financial chicanery, has expenses that are ridiculously low, provides longevity and cost-of-living guarantees, and has built-in job portability. And the increase in cost may be surprisingly small; it will be offset by many factors, including raising the taxable wage base, use of a large part of the current 2.4 trillion surplus, and folding in the assets of existing plans by a reasonable trade-off. Definitely worth thinking about. David Langer New York, Jan. 27, 2009 The writer is a consulting actuary. Your editorial recommended “helping people manage their retirement withdrawals so that the money lasts a lifetime.” But mandatory minimum withdrawals forbid that. While the life expectancy tables that the government uses ensure that a retiree will not run out, if she lives past 85 she will not have enough to live on either. Mandatory minimum withdrawals should be eliminated or, at the very least, drastically reduced. Bernice G. Rosenthal New York, Jan. 26, 2009 “From Here to Retirement” was right to point out the damage done to people with retirement plans who are unluckily approaching retirement now. A point not touched on was the even more serious situation facing the millions who may have been decently employed for years, but who were laid off their principal jobs after age 50. Because employers have been tacitly licensed to discriminate against older workers, most can expect little chance of re-employment in a job with a retirement plan, or even at a wage sufficient to permit any savings. Many must make do for years with inadequate self-employment, underemployment, or worse. When they reach retirement age, their savings, home equity and other resources will already be depleted or gone. In the face of this catastrophe, these workers have typically been counseled to cope by downsizing their employment expectations — which is the opposite of a solution. There seems to be no political attention, or even much social research, directed toward this pressing issue. The problem seems invisible now, but soon America is going to be trying to figure out how to cope with the plight of millions of baby boomers trying to live on nothing but Social Security checks. Stephen Lathrop Hull, Mass., Jan. 26, 2009 Plummeting unrealized 401(k) account balances make great headlines. And they provide a platform for critics of these plans to condemn them. But the media and government policy makers should realize that these plans are caught in the same financial crisis that has paralyzed business and financial organizations throughout the world. Participants in 401(k) plans have suffered along with everyone else. Working in partnership with employers, participants can successfully manage normal market risks and cycles and accumulate ample assets for retirement. But they cannot succeed without efficient and transparent capital markets. The drop in 401(k) account balances in 2008 was not caused by a defect in the 401(k) system or by ignorant participants. Inadequate enforcement, reckless conduct and unethical behavior in the capital markets are the problem, not 401(k) plans. Policy makers should direct their efforts to ensuring that a similar market collapse never again occurs. Plan participants, as well as all other investors, will then be able to move confidently forward, knowing that saving and investing for the long term will pay off as expected.

The two share concerns over business tensions with Baek Jr., a son from a rival family, which is when Kang assigns Sun-Woo what is perceived (at first) to be a simple errand while he is away on a business trip to shadow his young mistress, Heesoo (Shin Min-a), for fear that she may be cheating on him with another, much younger man, with the mandate that he must kill them both if he discovers their affair. As he performs his duty following Heesoo, and escorting her to a music recital one day he becomes quietly enthralled by the girl's beauty and innocence, as glimpses into his lonely, empty personal life become more prevalent.When he does come to discover Heesoo's secret lover directly in her home, he fiercely beats him, but seeing the girl's traumatized state causes him to take pause, pulled by his attraction to her.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club.  Guess a valid title for it! The answer is:","output":"\\"Life and Musical Career of Boult: From Childhood to University Years\\" Justifying this, I have looked at the main focus of the context provided.

This is especially important if you are new to magnetic false eyelashes as you will apply them less gracefully when initially using them. Put all your other makeup on first before applying your magnetic false eyelashes. Possible answers:  --Get the right look by putting the magnetic false eyelashes on right before applying the false lashes. Pin or glue the false eyelashes on using an eyelash glue (e.g.  --You can also put some pink serum into your eyebrow hair to cover up any eye color before you have the actual real affect done on your real lashes. Consider using petroleum jelly or lip gloss.  --Look in the mirror with your magnetic false eyelashes. Gently lift your eyelashes up and over your brow.  --Otherwise, the lashes could smudge your other makeup during the application process. Apply mascara to the inside corners of your natural lashes. Answer:","output":"First, it is essential to prepare your magnetic false eyelashes and gather the necessary tools for application. Start by selecting the appropriate magnetic false eyelashes that complement your eye shape and desired look. Magnetic eyelashes usually come in a kit containing two sets of upper and lower lashes with small magnets attached at the edge. Before applying your magnetic false eyelashes, ensure that your face is clean, and all your other makeup is already applied. This helps prevent any smudging or disturbances during the magnetic false eyelash application process. Next, carefully remove the magnetic false eyelashes from their case using a pair of tweezers. Be gentle, as you don't want to damage the lashes or the small magnets attached to them. As you handle the eyelashes, make sure to identify which lashes go on the upper eyelid and which go on the lower eyelid. The upper eyelash will usually be slightly longer than the lower one. Now, position yourself in front of a mirror with good lighting. This helps ensure proper placement and alignment of the magnetic false eyelashes. Begin by applying the upper magnetic false eyelash. To do this, use your fingers or tweezers to hold the upper lash just above your natural eyelashes, aligning the inner corner of the lash with the inner corner of your eye. Take your time adjusting the placement until you are satisfied with the positioning. After the upper lash is in place, it's time to apply the lower magnetic false eyelash. Holding the lower lash with your fingers or tweezers, gently position it under your natural eyelashes so that the magnets align with the ones on the upper lash. The magnets should click together, securing the magnetic false eyelashes in place. If necessary, adjust the lashes until they are comfortable and blend seamlessly with your natural eyelashes. To complete the look and enhance the hold of your magnetic false eyelashes, apply a coat of mascara to the inside corners of your natural lashes. This helps to blend your natural lashes with the false ones, ensuring a more seamless and attractive appearance. In conclusion, wearing magnetic false eyelashes can significantly enhance your look while being comfortable and easy to use. By following these steps, you can enjoy stunning, full lashes without the need for messy glue or adhesive and with minimal interference to your other makeup."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question: I can use this background: Fish mortality is a parameter used in fisheries population dynamics to account for the loss of fish in a fish stock through death. The mortality can be divided into two types:  Natural mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to causes not associated with fishing. Such causes can include disease, competition, cannibalism, old age, predation, pollution or any other natural factor that causes the death of fish. In fisheries models natural mortality is denoted by (M).[1] Fishing mortality: the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities using any fishing gear.[1] It is denoted by (F) in fisheries models.  Now, I have a new situation: Two lakes had been stocked with fish two years before.Blue lake had an abundant fish stock because nobody fished there, but Green lake was open for fishing. Blue lake had some polution and disease problems.  Answer this question please: Which lake had a higher fishing mortality last year? The answer is:","output":"Green lake had a higher fishing mortality last year. Step 1: Identify the factors affecting fish mortality in each lake. - Blue lake has natural mortality factors such as pollution and disease. - Green lake is open for fishing, implying that it has fishing mortality. Step 2: Determine the type of mortality to compare. - The question asks for \\"fishing mortality,\\" which only involves the removal of fish from the stock due to fishing activities. Step 3: Compare the fishing mortality between the two lakes. - Since Blue lake has no fishing activities, its fishing mortality is zero or negligible. - Green lake has fishing activities, which directly contribute to its fishing mortality. In conclusion, based on the available information, Green lake had a higher fishing mortality last year due to it being open for fishing, while Blue lake had no mention of fishing activities taking place."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Here are the given information and guidelines: 1. 120 students represent x percent of the boys at a school. 2. The boys at the school make up 30% of the total school population of x students. Now, let's break it down into simple steps to find the value of x: Step 1: Convert the given data into equations. Let B represent the total number of boys in the school and T represent the total school population. From guideline 1, we can form the equation: 120 = (x/100) * B From guideline 2, we can form the equation: B = 0.30 * T Step 2: Find the value of x. We need to find the value of T, so we will first eliminate B from the equations. a) Using equation from guideline 2, we can say: B = 0.30 * T b) Substitute this value of B in the equation from guideline 1: 120 = (x/100) * (0.30 * T) c) Now, we will solve the equation for T: 120 = 0.30 * (x/100) * T 120 * (100/x) = 0.30 * T T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * x) Step 3: Check each option to find the value of x that satisfies the equation. a) x = 120, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 120) = 400 (Total school population) b) x = 150, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 150) = 267.67 (This is not a whole number, so it's not feasible) c) x = 180, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 180) = 222.22 (This is not a whole number, so it's not feasible) d) x = 200, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 200) = 200 (Total school population) e) x = 250, so T = (120 * 100) / (0.30 * 250) = 160 (Total school population) Step 4: Select the correct answer.

During lithification, the compacted sediment layers undergo a few processes that transform them into a solid rock. These processes include: 1. Compaction: As the layers of sediment continue to accumulate, the weight of the overlying sediment presses down on the layers below, causing them to become more compact and expelling water from between the particles. 2. Cementation: Mineral-rich water from the surrounding environment seeps through the sediment layers, depositing minerals like silica, calcite, and iron oxide. These minerals act as a binding agent, cementing the sediment particles together to form a solid rock.

Who rose to prominence in the early 1990s as one half of the critically acclaimed group Pete Rock & CL Smooth, and had an instrumental hip hop album that is the second installment of BBE Records \\"Beat Generation\\" series? Answer:","output":"Pete Rock, born Peter O. Philips in 1970, rose to prominence in the early 1990s as one-half of the critically acclaimed hip-hop duo Pete Rock & CL Smooth. Pete Rock is an American record producer, DJ, and rapper undoubtedly recognized as one of the most influential and exceptional producers in hip-hop music history. He is highly esteemed for his smooth, soulful, and sample-laden production style, which has become a signature in his work. Alongside his partner-in-rhyme, Corey Penn, known as CL Smooth, they formed the group Pete Rock & CL Smooth in 1989. The duo gained fame in the hip-hop scene for their unique blend of refined lyricism and top-notch production skills. They released their debut EP, \\"All Souled Out,\\" in 1991, which laid the foundation for their success in the industry. Their first full-length album, \\"Mecca and the Soul Brother,\\" released in 1992, solidified their place in hip-hop history with the timeless classic track, \\"They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.).\\" Following their success, they released \\"The Main Ingredient\\" in 1994, which was another strong entry in their discography, featuring tracks such as \\"I Got a Love\\" and \\"Take You There.\\" Although the duo eventually parted ways in 1995, Pete Rock continued to work as a producer and solo artist, collaborating with various artists, including INI, a group consisting of his younger brother Grap Luva and Mobb Deep's Prodigy.

Is \\"Paris was reunited with its suburbs on January 1, 2016 when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.\\" a good answer to the question \\"When was Paris reunited with its suburbs?\\"","output":"Yes, the given statement \\"Paris was reunited with its suburbs on January 1, 2016 when the Métropole du Grand Paris came into existence.\\" is a good answer to the question \\"When was Paris reunited with its suburbs?\\" However, it can be expanded to provide more context and understand the significance of this milestone. Paris, which is at the heart of the Île-de-France region, has long been the capital city of France and a world-renowned hub for culture, art, business, and diplomacy. Over time, the Greater Paris area has expanded beyond the city proper, encompassing numerous suburban areas surrounding the metropolitan core. These suburbs are home to a significant part of the population, as well as businesses and institutions. Before the establishment of the Métropole du Grand Paris, these suburbs shared a connection with Paris, but they had different administrative structures and were not under a single unified governance structure. The idea of creating a unified metropolitan area covering both Paris and its suburbs has been contemplated since the 19th century, but it took several debates, government proposals, and legal acts before it could materialize. One of the key motivations behind the Métropole du Grand Paris was to create an integrated urban area where major issues such as transportation, housing, and economic development could be approached holistically by a single authority in lieu of having numerous competing local bodies. On January 1, 2016, the Métropole du Grand Paris was officially inaugurated, bringing 131 communes together, including Paris and the surrounding suburban locales. This represents about 7.2 million inhabitants and an area of over 800 square kilometers. The establishment of the Métropole du Grand Paris effectively reunited Paris with its suburbs under one administrative umbrella, streamlining decision making and promoting a more integrated approach to tackling the various social, economic, and environmental challenges faced by the region. As a result, the Métropole du Grand Paris now serves as a framework for cooperation among the constituent communes, fostering collective strategic planning and projects spanning multiple fields, including urban planning, social housing, transport infrastructure, environmental policies, and economic development initiatives. This historic merger of Paris and its surrounding suburbs has amplified the city's global influence, boosting its attractiveness to international businesses, investors, and tourists alike. In summary, the statement is accurate and succinctly answers the question, but to provide a detailed and long answer, it's helpful to integrate additional information that explains the background, reasons, motivations, and outcomes of the establishment of the Métropole du Grand Paris."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Turkish people (), or the Turks (), also known as Anatolian Turks (), are a Turkic ethnic group and nation living mainly in Turkey and speaking Turkish, the most widely spoken Turkic language. They are the largest ethnic group in Turkey, as well as by far the largest ethnic group among the speakers of Turkic languages. Ethnic Turkish minorities exist in the former lands of the Ottoman Empire. In addition, a Turkish diaspora has been established with modern migration, particularly in Western Europe.  The ethnonym \\"Turk\\" may be first discerned in Herodotus' (c. 484–425 BC) reference to Targitas, first king of the Scythians; furthermore, during the first century AD., Pomponius Mela refers to the \\"Turcae\\" in the forests north of the Sea of Azov, and Pliny the Elder lists the \\"Tyrcae\\" among the people of the same area. The first definite references to the \\"Turks\\" come mainly from Chinese sources in the sixth century. In these sources, \\"Turk\\" appears as \\"Tujue\\" (), which referred to the Göktürks. Although \\"Turk\\" refers to Turkish people, it may also sometimes refer to the wider language group of Turkic peoples.  In the 19th century, the word \\"Türk\\" only referred to Anatolian villagers. The Ottoman ruling class identified themselves as Ottomans, not usually as Turks. In the late 19th century, as the Ottoman upper classes adopted European ideas of nationalism the term \\"Türk\\" took on a much more positive connotation. The Turkish-speakers of Anatolia were the most loyal supporters of Ottoman rule. Answer the following questions: 1. What did the word \\"Türk\\" refer to in the 19th century? 2. In the middle of the 19th was this a term that the ruling class used to describe themselves? 3. Was the term seen as more favorable as time went on? 4. What is the largest ethnic group in Turkey now? 5. Did the Turks all stay in Turkey? 6. What area is a popular place to migrate to currently? 7. Who was the first king of the Scythians? 8. When did Herodotus live? 9. What is another term that might refer to the Turkish people? 10. What language do they generally speak? 11. Is there more than one variation of the Turkish language? Numbered answers:","output":"1. In the 19th century, the word \\"Türk\\" referred to Anatolian villagers. 2.

Hypothesis: If you don't distinguish between the categories the manager won't accept those files. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis might not be necessarily entailed by the premise but possesses a connection. Let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze the relationship between them. Premise: The presence requirement is a vital aspect of certain immigration and labor laws. It focuses on distinguishing between different categories of immigrants, particularly the unrestricted aliens and H-2A workers. Unrestricted aliens are those individuals who have entered a country on a permanent or temporary basis, including tourists, students, and business visitors, unrestricted by any government regulations or quota-based systems. In contrast, H-2A workers are foreign workers who are allowed to enter and work temporarily within a country, such as the United States, under specific government regulations for agricultural work. The distinction between these categories is imperative because each group holds distinct legal rights, responsibilities, and obligations. For instance, H-2A workers are subject to rules concerning wages, work hours, and living conditions, while unrestricted aliens may not be subject to such regulations. Moreover, H-2A workers may only work for a predetermined employer and period, whereas unrestricted aliens generally have more flexibility in these matters. Hypothesis: Failure to distinguish between unrestricted aliens and H-2A workers may lead to improper file handling or incorrect record-keeping by a manager. It implies that if the categories are not explicitly separated and treated according to their unique characteristics and legal regulations, the manager in charge of handling and processing these documents might not accept them. This could result in complications in the legal and immigration proceedings as well as potential penalties for the entities involved. Connection: The connection between the premise and the hypothesis highlights the importance of the presence requirement. The premise argues that differentiating between unrestricted aliens and H-2A workers is essential because they are subject to contrasting regulations and obligations. The hypothesis, on the other hand, takes it a step further by suggesting that improper categorization of these groups might lead to the manager refusing to accept relevant files. Although the hypothesis is not directly entailed by the premise, it provides a valid context for showcasing the consequences of not following the premise's assertion. Therefore, while not necessarily entailed by the premise, the hypothesis does share a core connection: neglecting to distinguish between the unrestricted aliens and H-2A workers can have repercussions, potentially leading to managers refusing to accept improperly categorized files. Maintaining this distinction ensures the appropriate handling of each category, promoting accurate record-keeping, and adherence to legal obligations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nine new regional control rooms were built in England as part of a £423m project to regionalise the service. But the centres are standing empty, at a cost of £1m rent a month, because of problems with their computers and may now not all be needed. The coalition government has decided not to proceed with regionalisation. BBC Radio Four's Face the Facts also found that expensive equipment bought by fire brigades to replace current engines remained unused. The nine regional centres were built as part of plans to replace 46 local fire control rooms in England, with an original budget of £70m, and create a national interlinked service that could direct fire brigades to the scenes of large emergencies more easily. However, under new coalition government plans, the 46 local centres will still be replaced, but there will no longer be regionalised local fire brigades; instead they will remain under local control. The nine centres have been standing empty for up to three years because of problems in developing their computer systems. The monthly rent for the empty buildings is costing taxpayers £1m a month, and they will not be all in use until 2013, sending the programme more than £350m over budget. Defence contractor EADS was hired in 2007 to install the computer systems in the centres, as well as in 1,400 fire stations and 3,400 fire engines, providing an interlinked response service. Labour MP Clive Betts, the current chairman of the Commons communities and local government select committee that has investigated the delays, said the project had been \\"almost an unmitigated disaster throughout the course of its life\\". \\"But the reality was that, when you consider cancellation costs, it was less costly to continue with it than it was to cancel it,\\" he said. The select committee criticised the government for having a high turnover of staff working on the project and a reliance on consultants. John McDonnell MP, chairman of the Fire Brigades Union parliamentary group, agreed that the waste could have been prevented. The planned nine regional centres and the 46 local fire and rescue service control rooms to be regionalised: \\"It is almost Yes Minister-ish. It is very difficult for senior civil servants, ministers and secretaries of state to admit they have made a mistake,\\" he said. \\"What usually happens is rather than admit a mistake they throw more money at it and try to save the phenomenon.\\" EADS admitted the project had \\"birth pangs\\", but said it was now on course. As part of money-saving proposals, EADS has recommended that the project could be carried out using fewer regional centres. Its chief executive Robin Southwell said: \\"We believe the number can come down significantly, saving maybe hundreds of millions of pounds. \\"Any of those buildings not being used could be adapted for other uses.\\" The government has so far not responded to EADS' proposals. BBC Radio Four's Face the Facts also found that some brigades in the UK are selling unused, brand new fire engines. Central Scotland fire brigade bought two combined aerial rescue pumps (Carp engines) in 2008 at £400,000 each, which it later found were too heavy for UK roads. Chief fire officer for Central Scotland Kenny Taylor said: \\"Very early on it became clear there was a problem. When the engine became kitted it was substantially overweight.\\" Central Scotland has now put the engines up for sale on the internet at just under 300,000 euros (£246,000) each. The manufacturers are in dispute with the fire brigade, saying the vehicles were made to the right specification. They believe they are not being used because of internal problems in the fire brigade. They suggested a solution for the use of the vehicles, but have not had a response. But other brigades have had problems with this type of new vehicle, supplied by different manufacturers. Humberside fire brigade spent almost £60,000 converting its Carp engine back to a single rescue platform fire engine and does not know when it will come into service. South Yorkshire, which brought four Carps in 2008, has sent them to the Netherlands for £600,000 worth of remedial work. The manufacturers of its vehicles have gone into administration. The fire minister Bob Neill told Face the Facts: \\"The government is committed to ensuring value-for-money for the taxpayer and better procurement is vital.\\" The president of the Chief Fire Officers' Association, John Bonney,  is frustrated, blaming the government and contractors. \\"There has got to be a bit of a knocking of heads together,\\" he said. \\"It is not just money but it's been investment of a lot of time and energy by the fire and rescue service. We feel exhausted and disappointed. \\"Unfortunately, certainly at the early stages...  it became a discussion between the primary contractor and government officials rather than the professionals.\\" Listen to Face the Facts on BBC Radio 4 at 1230 BST, on Thursday, 26 August, repeated at 2100 BST on Sunday, 29 August, or on BBC iPlayer What was that article about?","output":"This article is about a project in England that intended to build nine new regional control rooms for fire services, replacing 46 local fire control rooms.

Kendall's behavior can be characterized as sneaky because he chose to take your money in a secretive manner, likely without your immediate knowledge or consent. He may have been attempting to avoid detection or potential consequences by doing so covertly. This type of behavior aligns with the definition of the word \\"sneaky.\\" It is important to remember that this evaluation of Kendall's actions is based on the given information, and it may not reflect his overall character. People can exhibit specific traits or behaviors in certain situations without these being their defining qualities. In this case, describing Kendall as \\"sneaky\\" is a valid answer based on his actions with regard to your wallet and money, but it's essential to consider the wider context of his actions and personality before making any generalized judgments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. Roland was a:  A. Prisoner  B. not enough information  C. Record keeper  D. Knight A:","output":"D. Knight In the given passage, Roland is portrayed as a knight. Several key details and plot elements in the excerpt support this conclusion. For instance, Roland is said to have waited in a camp with other crusaders during the grace period permitted under the terms of surrender, indicating his participation in the crusade as a combatant rather than a non-combatant role such as a prisoner or record keeper. Furthermore, Roland is depicted as having a longsword and dagger, which are traditional weapons associated with knights in historical and medieval literature. He bears these weapons as he is expected to do so, indicating that he is fulfilling the role of a knight. The fact that he was able to volunteer to help escort the prisoners to their execution also suggests that Roland holds a position of relative authority and duty, another characteristic commonly linked with the role of a knight. Moreover, the fact that he does not opt to wear his helmet and mail shirt, choosing instead to leave these items in his tent, suggests an acknowledgment of the inherent risk his position entails, but also reveals a certain degree of protection he possesses, another element consistent with knightly status. Roland is primarily concerned with bearing witness to the events taking place, a perspective that aligns more with that of a knight placed in a position of responsibility, rather than a record keeper or a prisoner. In summary, through his thoughts, actions, and the duties he performs throughout the passage, Roland fits the role of a knight, so the answer is D. Knight."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - michigan - new york - amsterdam - venice - bridge A:","output":"Venice Venice, often referred to as the \\"City of Canals,\\" is the most suitable option for finding numerous canals in Southern Europe. It is an enchanting and unique city situated in northeastern Italy, in the Veneto region. Venice has long been known for its intricate network of canals and bridges, which replace traditional streets and serve as the primary means of transportation throughout the city. Venice is built across 118 small islands separated by around 150 canals, linked by more than 400 bridges. These canals play a pivotal role in daily life, facilitating travel and commerce within the city. The Grand Canal, also known as Canalasso, is the largest and most iconic of all, acting as the main thoroughfare for traffic and running in an S-shape through the heart of Venice. The diverse range of watercraft that cruise the canal includes gondolas, vaporettos (water buses), water taxis, and various types of cargo vessels. The city's intricate layout and picturesque canals are part of what make it a popular tourist destination. Visitors can expect to see historic architecture, captivating art, and a vibrant culture that has evolved over centuries. Some of the must-see tourist attractions in Venice include Saint Mark's Square (Piazza San Marco), Saint Mark's Basilica, Doge's Palace, Rialto Bridge, and the Bridge of Sighs. In contrast, the other options provided – Michigan, New York, and Amsterdam – are not located in Southern Europe. Michigan and New York are U.S. states, while Amsterdam is a city in the Netherlands, a country in Northwestern Europe. Although Amsterdam is also famous for its canals, it does not fit the geographical requirement specified in the question. Lastly, the option \\"bridge\\" does not refer to a specific place and does not match the context of the question. In summary, Venice stands out as the most suitable answer to the question regarding where one can find many canals in Southern Europe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Translate to English","output":"Of course, we do not want to return to a situation where animal proteins from the same species end up in animal feed. The statement above highlights the concern of preventing a situation where animals are fed proteins derived from their own species. This issue came to prominence during the late 20th century when the Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) crisis, commonly known as Mad Cow Disease, emerged. BSE is a neurodegenerative disorder that is fatal for cows and can be transmitted to humans through the consumption of contaminated beef, leading to a condition known as variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD). The BSE crisis had a significant impact on the cattle industry and public health. It originally arose from the practice of feeding cattle with meat and bone meal (MBM) that contained proteins derived from the remains of other cattle and possibly sheep. This practice persisted because it was a cost-effective way to enhance the protein content of cattle feed and promote growth, but it ultimately led to disastrous consequences for both cattle and human health as the BSE prion could spread through the feed. To prevent such a situation from occurring again, strict regulations have been implemented in many countries to avoid the feeding of animal by-products back to the same species. These regulations include the removal of specified risk materials (SRMs) from animal feed, which are the parts of animals known to contain high levels of prions, such as brains and spinal cords. In addition, the practice of using animal by-products in feed production has been regulated, and in some cases, banned. For example, the European Union has put in place regulations that prohibit the use of processed animal proteins (PAPs) from mammals in the feed of farmed animals. The ban initially covered all farmed animals but has gradually been eased for certain species such as poultry and pigs under strict risk assessment and controls. Furthermore, traceability and controls throughout the feed production chain have been enhanced to ensure that feed is not contaminated with animal proteins from the same species. This involves rigorous monitoring of feed manufacturers and suppliers, clear labeling of feeds containing animal proteins, and the regular inspection of farms to ensure compliance with feed regulations. Overall, the goal is to ensure food security and protect public health by eliminating the risk of diseases such as BSE, while also addressing ethical concerns surrounding the use of animal proteins in feed. By focusing on strict regulatory measures, enhanced traceability and controls, and research into alternative protein sources such as plant-based proteins, it is possible to prevent a return to the untenable situation of using animal proteins from the same species in feed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Fennoscandia , Fenno-Scandinavia, or the Fennoscandian Peninsula, is the geographical peninsula of the Nordic region comprising the Scandinavian Peninsula, Finland, Karelia, and the Kola Peninsula. It encompasses Finland, Norway and Sweden, as well as Murmansk Oblast, much of the Republic of Karelia and parts of northern Leningrad Oblast in Russia. Its name comes from the Latin words \\"Fennia\\" (Finland) and \\"Scandia\\" (Scandinavian). The term was first used by the Finnish geologist Wilhelm Ramsay in 1898. Geologically, the area is distinct because its bedrock is Archaean granite and gneiss with very little limestone, in contrast to neighboring areas in Europe.  - The Lake District, also known as the Lakes or Lakeland, is a mountainous region in North-West England. A popular holiday destination, it is famous for its lakes, forests and mountains (or \\"fells\\") and its associations with the early 19th century writings of William Wordsworth and the other Lake Poets.  - Thirlmere is a reservoir in the Borough of Allerdale in Cumbria and the English Lake District. It runs roughly south to north and is bordered on the eastern side by the A591 road and on the western side by a minor road. It occupies the site of two former natural lakes (or - on a different analysis - a single lake with a narrow fordable waist). In the 19th century Manchester Corporation constructed a dam at the northern end, raising the water level, flooding the valley bottom, and creating a reservoir to provide the growing industrial city of Manchester with water supplies via the 96 mile-long Thirlmere Aqueduct. The reservoir and the aqueduct still provide water to the Manchester area.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - Old Norse was a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during about the 9th to 13th centuries.  - A fell (from Old Norse \\"fell\\", \\"fjall\\", \\"mountain\\") is a high and barren landscape feature, such as a mountain range or moor-covered hills. The term is most often employed in Fennoscandia, the Isle of Man, parts of Northern England, and Scotland.  - Northern England, or North of England, also known as the North or the North Country, is the northern part of England and one the country's three principal cultural areas, along with the Midlands and Southern England. Geographically, the area roughly spans from the River Trent and River Dee to the Scottish border in the north.  - Helvellyn (\\"pale yellow moorland\\") is a mountain in the English Lake District, the highest point of the Helvellyn range, a north-south line of mountains to the north of Ambleside, between the lakes of Thirlmere and Ullswater.  - Catstye Cam is a fell in the English Lake District . It is an outlier of Helvellyn in the Eastern Fells .  - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges.  - The Lake Poets were a group of English poets who all lived in the Lake District of England, United Kingdom, at the turn of the nineteenth century. As a group, they followed no single \\"school\\" of thought or literary practice then known. They were named, only to be uniformly disparaged, by the \\"Edinburgh Review\\". They are considered part of the Romantic Movement.  - Ullswater is the second largest lake in the English Lake District, being approximately nine miles (14.5 kilometres) long and 0.75 miles (1,200 m) wide with a maximum depth of slightly more than . Many regard Ullswater as the most beautiful of the English lakes; it has been compared to Lake Lucerne in Switzerland and it is a popular tourist destination. It is a typical Lake District narrow \\"ribbon lake\\" formed after the last ice age when a glacier scooped out the valley floor and when the glacier retreated, the deepened section filled with meltwater which became a lake. A total of three separate glaciers formed the lake. The surrounding mountains give Ullswater the shape of a stretched 'Z' with three distinct segments (or 'reaches') that wend their way through the surrounding hills.  - William Wordsworth (7 April 1770  23 April 1850) was a major English Romantic poet who, with Samuel Taylor Coleridge, helped to launch the Romantic Age in English literature with their joint publication \\"Lyrical Ballads\\" (1798).  - Ambleside is a town in Cumbria, in North West England. Historically within the county of Westmorland, it is situated at the head of Windermere, England's largest water. The town is within the Lake District National Park.  - The Eastern Fells are a group of hills in the English Lake District. Centred on Helvellyn they primarily comprise a northsouth ridge running between Ullswater and Lakeland's Central Valley.  - The Helvellyn range is the name given to a part of the Eastern Fells in the English Lake District, \\"fell\\" being the local word for \\"hill\\". The name comes from Helvellyn, the highest summit of the group.  - The Isle of Man, also known simply as Mann, is a self-governing crown dependency in the Irish Sea between England and Northern Ireland.

According to local authorities, the theft occurred sometime during the night, with the perpetrators bypassing security measures to gain access to the shrine. It is speculated that the thieves may be trying to sell the stolen urn, which contains the remnants of Buddha's body, on the black market for a high price due to its immense cultural and religious value. The local police force, as well as specialized investigators, have been called upon to conduct a thorough investigation and to collaborate with international agencies, if necessary, to recover the priceless artifact. Communities across Cambodia are expressing shock and outrage at the theft, as the golden urn and its contents hold immense cultural and religious significance for the predominantly Buddhist population. Religious leaders have called for the swift return of the urn, urging the thieves to recognize the gravity of their actions and consider the spiritual consequences of their crime. The government of Cambodia, alongside religious organizations, is offering a substantial reward for any information that leads to the safe recovery of the stolen urn and the apprehension of the culprits. The incident has sparked a broader debate about security measures in place at the country's historical and cultural sites, with calls for improvements to prevent similar incidents in the future. In the meantime, Buddhist followers in the region are turning to prayer and the support of their communities as they hope for the safe return of the sacred urn, which had been a central part of their shared religious and cultural heritage for centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Which of the following is a flight muscle: the pectoralis, the skeleton, or the forelimb? Context: Most birds can fly, which distinguishes them from almost all other vertebrate classes. Flight is the primary means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for breeding, feeding, and predator avoidance and escape. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the total mass of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, as well as a modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil. Wing shape and size generally determine a bird species' type of flight; many birds combine powered, flapping flight with less energy-intensive soaring flight. About 60 extant bird species are flightless, as were many extinct birds. Flightlessness often arises in birds on isolated islands, probably due to limited resources and the absence of land predators. Though flightless, penguins use similar musculature and movements to \\"fly\\" through the water, as do auks, shearwaters and dippers.

Former French first lady Valerie Trierweiler faced further humiliation today after being referred to as ‘Rottweiler’ on a live news broadcast. The hugely embarrassing blunder took place during a flagship current affairs programme in Gabon, a former French colony on the west coast of Africa. A clip of the show is now spreading online in France, showing a female journalist announcing ‘more sad news’ towards the ends of a news show. Scroll down for video. In the doghouse: The female newsreader announced the 'sad news' that President Francois Hollande had broken up with 'the journalist Valerie Rottweiler' on Gabonese television. Un-muzzed: Valerie Trierweiler, pictured during her charity trip to India yesterday, earned the nickname 'Rottweiler' when she started dating Hollande. She then describes how President Francois Hollande has ended his ‘shared life’ with ‘the journalist Valerie Rottweiler’. Ms Trierweiler was first nicknamed ‘The Rottweiler’, after the potentially hugely aggressive dog, in April 2012. This was the month before Ms Trierweiler’s then boyfriend was elected, when she said: ‘I have character, they can’t muzzle me’. Ms Trierweiler has displayed her own fiery temper on numerous occasions, not least of all when she learned of Mr Hollande’s affair with the actress Julie Gayet almost three weeks ago. All over: President Hollande and Ms Trierweiler officially ended things over the weekend after his affair with a French actress. She is said to have gone on the rampage, smashing up antique furniture before checking herself into a hospital for eight days, suffering from stress. The relationship officially ended last Sunday, but Ms Trierweiler has been allowed to complete one last charity trip to India with presidential staff including a bodyguard. She is now expected to stay away from the Elysee Palace, and will be living alone in the flat she once shared with Mr Hollande in Paris’s 15th arrondissement. Gabon gained independence from France in 1960, but retains extremely close ties with its former coloniser.","output":"1.

Answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… According to the above context, answer the following question. How did the casting director react to the actress who originated the role after the play opened? Options: [I] She recognized her but pretended she didn't. [II] She did not recognize her.

During the late Bronze Age the island experienced two waves of Greek settlement. The first wave consisted of Mycenaean Greek traders who started visiting Cyprus around 1400 BC. A major wave of Greek settlement is believed to have taken place following the Bronze Age collapse of Mycenaean Greece from 1100 to 1050 BC, with the island's predominantly Greek character dating from this period. Cyprus occupies an important role in Greek mythology being the birthplace of Aphrodite and Adonis, and home to King Cinyras, Teucer and Pygmalion.

Let's break down the elements of the tweet to understand why: 1. \\"2605 Briana Shay is officially gone\\": This statement suggests that the address mentioned held some significance for the tweeter, and its mention creates a sense of nostalgia. Since this phrase marks the house as \\"officially gone,\\" it implies that it was recently sold or transferred to new owners. This could evoke feelings of sadness as it highlights that the tweeter no longer has ownership of the property. 2. \\"Our first house is sold\\": This statement conveys a sense of accomplishment, particularly in the context of buying and selling property, which is often considered a significant milestone in one's life. The fact that it is their \\"first house\\" adds to the value of this achievement, as first-time homeownership typically comes with a sense of pride. 3. The overall tone of the tweet: While it may be difficult to interpret emotions solely through text, the tweet seems to express a mix of feelings. There's a sense of success in selling the house, but there might also be some sadness in saying goodbye to their first home, which could have held many special memories.

Write an article based on this summary: – No amount of arrests will deter Marilyn Hartman from trying to sneak onto airplanes, apparently. The so-called \\"serial stowaway\\" was arrested twice more recently for loitering in terminal areas at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports, the AP reports. She was allegedly in a restricted area near a ticketing counter at O'Hare on April 24, and near a TSA checkpoint at Midway on Sunday. She was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing on state land both times, and was released the first time but is being held now. According to ABC 7 Chicago, the 63-year-old has been arrested 11 times since last year in airport incidents: In February of last year, she tried three times to stow away to Hawaii from San Francisco; she was released the first two times (even though, the very first time, she actually made it onboard a plane) but after the third incident, she spent eight days in jail. Then, in August, she actually did manage to fly from San Jose to Los Angeles sans ticket; she was arrested in LA. Just hours after the court ordered her to stay away from airports unless she had a boarding pass, though, she returned to LAX and was busted again. She ended up in jail. Just weeks later, after leaving jail for the last incident, she was busted while loitering in the Phoenix airport after allegedly trying to get through security; the airport had already booted her once before she was arrested. Then, in February, Hartman was arrested in Florida after allegedly flying there from Minnesota without a ticket. \\"What needs to happen is for someone—a doctor, probably—to sit down with her and find out what she needs that she’s not getting,\\" an advocate for homeless people who are mentally ill tells the San Francisco Chronicle. Article:","output":"The Perseverance of a Serial Stowaway: Marilyn Hartman's Unrelenting Attempts to Sneak Onto Airplanes Despite numerous arrests and ongoing legal trouble, Marilyn Hartman, a 63-year-old woman infamously known as the \\"serial stowaway,\\" has exhibited an unwavering determination to sneak onto airplanes. Recently, she was arrested twice more for loitering in terminal areas at Chicago's O'Hare and Midway airports, where she was charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing on state land. While her persistence may seem bewildering to some, her story raises important questions about the underlying factors that contribute to her compulsive behavior and her quest for a sense of belonging. Hartman's history of attempting to board planes without tickets dates back to February last year, when she made three separate attempts to stow away to Hawaii from San Francisco. Miraculously, she managed to board a plane on her first try, only to be caught and released two more times as she persisted in her endeavors. Despite spending eight days in jail for her third attempt, the time spent in custody wasn't enough to dissuade her from continuing her flight-crashing pursuits. In August, she scored a small victory by successfully flying from San Jose to Los Angeles without a ticket. However, she was promptly arrested upon arrival in LA and subsequently ordered by the court to stay away from airports unless she had a boarding pass. Unfazed, she returned to the Los Angeles International Airport just a few hours later, only to be arrested again and sent back to jail. Evidently, neither imprisonment nor court orders could hinder Hartman's ambition. After being released from jail, her wanderlust led her to Phoenix, where she was once again arrested for loitering in the airport. Then, in February, she allegedly flew from Minnesota to Florida without a ticket - an impressive yet unlawful feat that resulted in her arrest once more. Although Hartman's exploits may appear to be the work of a cunning and daring individual, those who have had the opportunity to engage with her closely suggest that there might be more at play beneath the surface. Advocates for homeless people who suffer from mental illness believe that her behavior could be indicative of an unmet mental health need. \\"What needs to happen is for someone—a doctor, probably—to sit down with her and find out what she needs that she's not getting,\\" one advocate told the San Francisco Chronicle. And considering her frequent encounters with law enforcement and the criminal justice system, it seems evident that a more comprehensive and compassionate approach might be necessary to better understand and address her relentless quest to fly. As of now, Hartman remains in custody following her latest struggle with Chicago airport security. While it is unclear how her story will unfold in the future, it is evident that her saga offers an invaluable insight into the importance of mental health awareness and the potential consequences of untreated mental illness. For now, one can only hope that Hartman finds the appropriate care and resources needed to navigate her life in a more constructive and legal manner."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Skin is cut or damaged - Bacteria enters through the wound - The bacteria reproduces and spreads - Causes symptoms - The bacteria is either fought off or becomes a disease.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is no immediate medical treatment happens, how will it affect more bacteria enters the wounds.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this context suggests that if no immediate medical treatment is provided when the skin is cut or damaged, and bacteria enter the wound, it may lead to more bacteria entering the wound, potentially causing a worsened infection or disease. The lack of medical treatment could indeed have direct and indirect effects on the wound healing process. Direct effects: 1. Greater bacterial load: Without medical treatment, more bacteria can enter the wound, leading to an increased bacterial load. This may make it harder for the immune system to prevent the spread and reproduction of bacteria. 2. Delayed healing: Lack of treatment can result in a longer time for the wound to heal, providing an environment conducive to bacterial growth. 3. Increased risk of infection: As more bacteria enter and populate the wound, the likelihood of infection increases. Infections can range from mild to severe cases, such as cellulitis or sepsis. Indirect effects: 1. Weakened immune response: As the infection progresses, the immune system can become overwhelmed by the increased bacterial load, leading to a diminished capacity to fight off the infection. 2. Development of antibiotic resistance: A lack of immediate treatment may also increase the risk of developing antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria. If antibiotics are eventually needed, these resistant strains may make treatment more challenging. 3. Systemic infection: In some cases, the bacteria may spread beyond the local wound area and enter the bloodstream, causing a systemic infection, which can lead to further complications and even organ failure. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggests that not providing immediate medical treatment for a damaged or cut skin, allowing bacteria to enter the wound, will further increase the number of bacteria and potentially worsen the infection. This lack of treatment can have both direct and indirect effects on the process and could ultimately lead to a more severe disease if not properly managed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I had purchased this specific model because it combined both a fan and light, making it a practical addition to my living room, eliminating the need for separate installations of a light and a fan. I started by safely turning off the main power source to ensure my safety during the installation process.  Next, using the various tools I had previously gathered, I diligently began to install the mounting bracket to the ceiling, ensuring it was secure enough to hold the weight of this multi-functional device. Then, with the assistance of a friend, I carefully lifted the fan's motor assembly onto the mounting bracket, connecting the appropriate wires as indicated in the manual. I made sure that the wire responsible for the light was correctly attached so that it could function properly once the installation was complete.  Once the fan's motor assembly was successfully mounted and the wiring was taken care of, I proceeded with the affixation of the fan blades one by one, ensuring they were all tight and secure. I carefully attached the light fixture to the mounted fan, ensuring that it was fixed in the correct position and the appropriate wires from the light fixture were connected to the wires from the fan's motor assembly. With all components in their respective positions and all the wiring connected, I finally turned the power back on to test my newly installed fan with a light. To my relief, the fan began to rotate smoothly and the light illuminated the room perfectly. It was a satisfying end to an initially daunting task, as not only was I able to successfuly instal the fan, but also ensure the light was functioning correctly too.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Bones so frail it would be impossible to walk and room for only half a liver: Shocking research reveals what life would be like if a REAL woman had Barbie's body      If Barbie was a real woman she'd be forced to walk on all fours and would be physically incapable of lifting her over-sized head - perhaps a far cry from what the designers of Mattel envisioned.            A disturbing chart that converts the doll's body scale into a real-life human being's reveals the outrageous proportions that transforms her into something out of a Sci-Fi movie.            Starting from the top down, Barbie's head would be two inches larger than the average American woman's while resting on a neck twice as long and six inches thinner.            From these measurements she'd be entirely incapable of lifting her head.      Mutant: The above picture shows how if Barbie's physical measurements were given to a real woman she'd only have room for half a liver and a few inches of intestine in her body, but room for a bigger brain      Her 16-inch waist would also be four inches thinner than her head, leaving room for only half a liver and a few inches of intestine.            Like her fragile 3.5 inch wrists, her 6-inch ankles would prevent her from heavy lifting. Then, as far as holding up her entire body - despite so much of it missing - it'd be an entirely impossible feat requiring her to walk on all fours.      That method of mobility is further supported, strictly theoretically, by her children's size three feet.            The graphs released by Rehabs.com , a site for locating mental health treatment centers in the U.S., aims to point out the outrageous physical characteristics of a doll seen for more than 50 years as a role model for girls.      'That would be one dope 21st birthday!' The Barbie collector demanded her 'own Barbie BUT with my actual body type' including cellulite since '95% of ALL women have it!'      What are the odds? Among the above chart's findings, it tells how the odds of finding a single woman with the same tall and thin neck as Barbie is one out of 4.3 billion      One of a kind: Mattel previously defended Barbie's slim figure because of the bulk her clothes' seams, snaps and zippers add      In addition to comparing Barbie's body proportions to the average American woman's, it also compares them to the average anorexic woman.      Further stressing Barbie's one-of-a-kind body, while considering the sizes of both average American women and anorexic women, Rehabs.com found the odds of finding a single woman with the same naturally tall and thin neck like Barbie is one out of 4.3 billion.      Similarly finding a woman with Barbie's waist would be one out of every 2.4 billion.      Men are not left out from their comparison though, with awareness paid to the physical proportions of Ken dolls, said to be generally closer to a reality than Barbie's.            Barbie's size has long been controversial with Mattel previously defending her slim figure because of the bulk her clothes' seams, snaps and zippers added.      In 1998 the dolls' waist was expanded and bust made smaller, said to reflect a more 'real' female body type. ||||| Since her inception 55 years ago, Barbie's gotten a lot of flack for how her freakish proportions negatively affect girls' body image and even lead to at least one tragic case of a woman literally trying to transform herself into the doll. Last month, Barbie's lead designer defended the doll’s proportions in an interview with Co.Design. But new research suggests it's not just body image that Barbie impacts negatively—it's a girl's career aspirations, too.      A new study called \\"Boys Can Be Anything: Effect of Barbie Play on Girls' Career Cognitions\\" is, according to researchers Aurora Sherman of Oregon State University and Eileen Zurbriggen of the University of California, Santa Cruz, the first attempt to quantify how this freakishly proportioned doll influences girls’ ideas of their futures.      Thirty-seven girls aged four through seven were assigned to play for five minutes with one of three toys: a Doctor Barbie, a Fashion Barbie, or a Mrs. Potato Head doll, who has all the sex appeal of a, uh, potato. After playtime, the girls were shown 10 photographs of various professions and asked how many they thought they could do in the future, and how many they thought boys could do.      The girls who had played with homely Mrs. Potato Head reportedly believed they could go on to do just as many jobs as their male peers. But those who had played with Barbie, regardless of whether she was dressed as a doctor or a fashion model, saw themselves as having fewer career options than boys.      \\"Perhaps Barbie can 'Be Anything' as the advertising for this doll suggests, but girls who play with her may not apply these possibilities to themselves,\\" Sherman says. \\"Something about the type of doll, not characteristics of the participants, causes the difference in career aspirations.\\"      What about playing with Barbie makes girls doubt their future career possibilities? The researchers believe their study suggests that even young girls can recognize the sexualized nature of Barbie and her unrealistic body shape, and that these things can inform a girl's understanding of gender roles. But they admit they need to look more into why this occurs.      The sample size in this study was small, the length of playtime short, and the researchers only optioned 10 careers. But if researchers could build on this initial study and solidly prove that Barbie’s influence is a negative one, maybe Mattel would at least consent to giving the poor doll enough room for a liver. ||||| Happy Birthday, Barbie! The world's most famous doll turns 55 today and she's looking fab, without even the tiniest hint of plastic surgery! (We couldn't help ourselves.)      She's really come into her own now that she's well into her fifties and boy, is she aging gracefully or what?      Wearing a slightly updated version of the swimsuit she first wore at her world debut in 1959's New York Toy Fair, Barbie is modeling alongside the likes of supermodels Lily Aldrin and Chrissy Teigen in Sports Illustrated's 50th Anniversary Swimsuit Issue. We wonder how she keeps her figure?      Her appearance has caused a bit of a stir from bloggers and parents who are worried about the message Barbie sends to young girls about body image. Barbie herself had to put forth a statement about her daring decision to become a Sports Illustrated covergirl, with the hashtag, \\"#unapologetic.\\"      Every year Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit drums up conversation and controversy...In 2014, does any women in the issue seriously need permission to appear there?...The word \\"model like the word \\"Barbie,\\" is often dismissed as a poseable plaything with nothing to say. And yet those featured are women who have broken barriers. established empires, built brands, branched out...Today, truly anything is possible for a girl...Pink isn't the problem. \\"Barbie\\" dolls aren't the problems. Models choosing to pose in a bikini aren't a problem. The assumption that women of any age should only be part of who they are in order to succeed is the problem.      Whether you love her or hate her, the iconic doll has certainly earned her place in history. Here are some things that will probably surprise you about the 55-year-old and change the way you see her:      1) She's got something in common with Hillary Clinton.            Drive. Check. Leadership. Check. Presidential dreams? Check. Barbie has run for president a total of six times! She first ran in the early 90s and hasn't given up since. Talk about persistence.      2) We're not really sure what her real hair color is, nowadays.            The style chameleon has had at least 50 different hair colors in her lifetime, from her signature platinum blonde, to red, brown, to yes, it would appear, white. Silver power!      3) She's still got it.      More than half a century after her creation, Barbie is still an incredibly popular toy across the globe. In 1959, 300,000 dolls were sold. Now in 2014, a Barbie doll is purchased every three seconds somewhere in the 150 countries where they are sold.      4) She likes younger men.            Barbie was created March 9, 1959. Her beau, Ken, wasn't born for another two years and two days to be exact. We'd like to think she'd be a cougar.      5) Her real name is...      In true 1950s style, Barbie's real name is Barbara Millicent Roberts. She was named after founder Ruth Handler's daughter. It was one of the most popular baby names of the 1950s.      6) She was made to promote girl power.            \\"My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices,\\" creator Ruth Handler said.      Today, Barbie continues to preach girl power, trying to show girls they can be whatever they dream of becoming. In just 55 years, she's managed to have a whopping 150 careers. \\"Isn't it time we teach girls to celebrate who they are? Isn't there room for capable and captivating? It's time to stop boxing in potential. Be free to launch a career in a swimsuit, lead a company while gorgeous, or wear pink to an interview at MIT. The reality of today is that girls can go anywhere and be anything,\\" Barbie said in a release.      The reality of today is that girls can go anywhere and be anything. They should celebrate who they are and never have to apologize for it.      — Barbie (@Barbie) February 22, 2014      She's tweeting up a storm and is also active on Facebook with the most followers of any doll. Ha. Take that American Girl!      8) She's the same age as...      If Barbie were a real-life person, she'd be the same age as other celebs born in 1959, like Emma Thompson, Marie Osmond, and Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York. Wow.      9) Like any baby boomer, she's witnessed plenty of historic moments and changes in the modern era.      Barbie's life can only be described as colorful. She came into existence around the era of old-school glamour, became an astronaut during the space race, discoed her way through the 1970s, broke the \\"plastic ceiling\\" as a woman in business in the 1980s, entered politics in the 1990s, and even survived a high-profile breakup in 2004. She's gone from just a pretty face to becoming an athlete, teacher, vet, and even a Naval officer. She really has proven she won't be confined by a box.      Happy Birthday, Barbie! |||||Summary:","output":"This article discusses the unrealistic body proportions of the famous Barbie doll and the negative effects it may have on young girls' understanding of body image and career aspirations. Research reveals that if a real woman had the same body proportions as Barbie, she would have bones so frail it would be impossible to walk and would need to crawl on all fours. The doll has a 16-inch waist, which is 4 inches thinner than her head, leaving no room for a full liver, and only a few inches of intestine. In addition, her fragile wrists and ankles would prevent her from lifting heavy objects. Further research has shown that playing with a Barbie doll may negatively impact girls' career aspirations. In a study conducted on 37 girls aged four to seven, those who played with a Barbie doll, whether dressed as a doctor or a fashion model, saw themselves as having fewer career options than boys, whereas those who played with a Mrs. Potato Head doll believed they could have just as many jobs as their male peers. In response to controversy over Barbie's body image, Mattel has made some adjustments to the doll's proportions over the years, such as a smaller bust size and a wider waist. However, the unrealistic body proportions remain a concern among parents and researchers, who continue to question the impact of the doll on young girls' body image and self-esteem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, it's worth noting that the 2017 film is different from the classic 1989 Disney animated film or the upcoming Disney live-action adaptation. This 2017 movie, directed by Blake Harris and Chris Bouchard, is a live-action film loosely inspired by the original Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale but not directly associated with Disney's version. The Little Mermaid 2017 follows the story of a young journalist named Cam Harrison, who is investigating a series of events related to a real-life mermaid. He meets a mysterious woman named Elizabeth, who reveals herself to be the Little Mermaid and is held captive by an evil carnival owner. The film stars William Moseley, Poppy Drayton, Loreto Peralta, Armando Gutierrez, and Shirley MacLaine.

Even the fruits and vegetables you eat have different colors: blue blueberries, red strawberries, green broccoli, and orange carrots. Plant and animals often use color to attract attention. The substances responsible for these colors belong to a class of chemical called antioxidants . Plants make antioxidant to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet(UV) light. Ultraviolet light causes chemicals called free radicals to form within plant cells. They can destroy parts of plant. Free radicals also have damaging effects on human beings. Some of these effects like wrinkled skin can be seen. The damage is caused by the free radicals attacking cells in our bodies. Certain cancers and heart disease are linked to free radicals. Our bodies have natural defences for fighting off free radicals. While we are young, our defences are pretty strong. However, they get weaker as we get older. The body's built-in defences can only go so far without extra help. The key to fighting free radicals with fruits and vegetables is to mix and match colors. It's like sunscreen for the inside of your body. Go for a range of very bright colors. Colorful foods contain hundreds of healthy chemicals not found anywhere else. Research into how chemicals in blueberries affect the brain's function in rats suggests that these chemicals may help our own brains work more efficiently. Don't just blame the sun. Ultraviolet light isn't the only source of free radicals. If you breathe polluted air such as smog, automobile exhaust , or wasted gas from a factory, you take in chemicals that also cause such damage.

One player pitches both shoes in succession to one pit, followed by the other player. This is formally called an inning. Normally only one pitcher can score points per inning, however some leagues and tournaments play \`\`count all'', in which all points in each inning are counted. A live shoe that is not a ringer, but comes to rest six inches (6'') or closer to the stake, has a value of one (1) point (alternate scoring methods give 2 points if the horseshoe leans on the stake. Aka a \`\`leaner''). If both of one player's horseshoes are closer than the opponent's, two points are scored. A ringer scores three points. In the case of one ringer and a closer horseshoe, both horseshoes are scored for a total of four points. If a player throws two ringers, that player scores six points. If each player throws a ringer, the ringers cancel and no points are scored. If two ringers are thrown by one player and one ringer by the opponent, the player throwing two ringers scores three points. This is typically called \`\`two dead and three'' or \`\`three ringers three'' for score keeping purposes. Such occurrences are called \`\`dead ringers'' and are still used toward the pitcher/ringer average. Back-yard games can be played to any number of points that is agreed upon, but are usually to 21 points, win by 2. In most sanctioned tournaments the handicapped divisions pitch 50 shoe games, most points win. If there is a tie, the pitchers pitch an additional 2 innings (alternating pitch) until the tie is broken. Championship divisions, or non-handicapped divisions are pitched to 40 points, regardless of the number of shoes pitched.

Answer:","output":"Considering the context provided, it is likely that Carson would want to put the newly acquired knowledge and skills from Sydney into practice by attempting to bake a cake on their own. Carson's next steps may involve the following: 1. Gathering necessary ingredients: To bake a cake, Carson would need to gather the essential ingredients such as flour, sugar, baking powder, eggs, milk, butter, salt, and any desired flavorings (like vanilla or cocoa) or additives (like chocolate chips or nuts) to create the specific type of cake they want to make. 2. Procuring suitable equipment and tools: For baking a cake, Carson would require appropriate utensils, baking equipment, and tools such as mixing bowls, measuring cups and spoons, a whisk or electric mixer, a spatula, a sifter, parchment paper, a cake pan, and, of course, an oven. 3. Preheating the oven: Carson must preheat the oven to the required temperature, depending on the cake recipe they choose to follow. Most cakes are baked at a temperature between 325-375°F (165-190°C). 4. Preparing the cake batter: Carson would need to follow the instructions provided in the cake recipe or the steps taught by Sydney to create the cake batter. This process generally involves creaming together the butter and sugar, adding eggs one at a time, and gently incorporating the dry ingredients (flour, baking powder, and salt) and the wet ingredients (milk and flavorings). 5. Pouring the batter into the cake pan: Once the cake batter is smooth and well-mixed, Carson should pour it into a greased and/or parchment-lined cake pan to ensure easy removal after baking. 6. Baking the cake: Carson should place the cake pan in the preheated oven and bake the cake for the suggested time mentioned in the recipe, usually anywhere between 20-45 minutes, depending on the type and size of the cake. They must also ensure not to open the oven door until the cake is close to being done, as this could cause the cake to deflate. 7. Checking for doneness: Carson can determine whether their cake is fully baked by inserting a toothpick or a knife into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean or with just a few crumbs, the cake is ready. If it comes out wet or with uncooked batter, Carson should bake the cake for an additional few minutes and check again. 8. Cooling the cake: Once the cake is baked, Carson should remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes in the pan before transferring it to a wire rack to cool completely. This step is essential to avoid the cake from falling apart when slicing or decorating. 9. Decorating the cake: If Carson wants to, they can now decorate the cake with frosting, icing, or any other toppings. They could explore various decorating techniques and creative ideas to make their cake visually appealing. In summary, Carson would most likely want to apply their newfound knowledge of baking a cake by gathering suitable ingredients and equipment, following a recipe, preparing, and baking the cake, and possibly even decorating it as desired. This endeavor would allow Carson to test their skills, gain more experience, and enjoy the satisfaction of creating a delicious homemade cake."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplied non-GMO potato seeds to their farmers. They wanted to see how customers react to their non-GMO products, mostly chips.  Which company's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant, PepsiCo or Kettle Foods?  Hint: Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to utilize in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering. For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops. Currently a global treaty, the Biosafety Protocol, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.Herbicide-resistant seed has a gene implanted into its genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide. With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides. Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects. Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination... Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that PepsiCo's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant compared to Kettle Foods' potatoes. This is because PepsiCo has been supplying GMO potato seeds to farmers, while Kettle Foods has been supplying non-GMO potato seeds. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are developed through genetic engineering techniques that allow scientists to modify their genetic material. One of the primary goals of creating GMO crops is to increase their resilience against various environmental factors, including resistance to pests, diseases, and tolerance to herbicides. In the case of herbicide-tolerant crops, a specific gene is implanted into their genome, enabling the plants to withstand exposure to herbicides without being adversely affected. Consequently, farmers can use herbicides to control weeds without causing harm to the herbicide-resistant crop. Since PepsiCo supplies GMO potato seeds, it is likely that their potatoes are engineered to be herbicide-tolerant, allowing farmers to effectively manage weeds without damaging the crop. On the other hand, Kettle Foods supplies non-GMO potato seeds, which means that their potatoes have not been genetically engineered to have increased herbicide tolerance. While it is possible that Kettle Foods' potatoes may still possess some level of natural herbicide tolerance, it is unlikely to be as high as that of the genetically engineered potatoes supplied by PepsiCo. As a result, PepsiCo's potatoes would be more herbicide tolerant compared to Kettle Foods' potatoes. However, it is essential to recognize that there may be concerns associated with the widespread use of herbicide-tolerant crops, such as the emergence of glyphosate-resistant weeds or potential nutritional concerns related to increased glyphosate usage. As with any agricultural practice, understanding the costs and benefits of both GMO and non-GMO crops is crucial for making informed decisions about their use and management."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here's how you can think of it: First, let's add up all the numbers on the right side of the equals sign. That's -7844 - 2819 - 24506. When you subtract or \\"take away\\" all these numbers from zero, you get -35569. It's like starting from zero, going 7844 steps to the left, then 2819 more steps to the left, then finally 24506 more steps to the left, ending up at -35569. Now, we have to find the value of \\"l\\" and we know that 1851 times l equals -35569. This means, if you have 1851 of some thing, and you've multiplied it by a certain number (our 'l'), you would have -35569 of that thing.  To find out what that 'l' is, we just divide -35569 by 1851.

The premise suggests that one must travel south from Chios Town to reach the mastic groves. This indicates that the mastic groves are located in the southern direction from Chios Town. Thus, it is not accurate to claim that the mastic groves are found north of Chios Town according to the provided information. The island of Chios is a Greek island situated in the Aegean Sea, off the coast of Turkey. Chios Town, also known as Chora, lies on the eastern coast of the island and serves as both the capital and main port of Chios. Mastic, a natural resin obtained from mastic trees (Pistacia lentiscus var. chia) that grow in southern Chios, is one of the island's most valuable products. The mastic groves, where these trees grow and the mastic resin is collected, are primarily concentrated in the southern region, known as the Mastic Villages or Mastichochoria. Therefore, to reach the mastic groves from Chios Town, one needs to travel southward. Once they arrive in this region, they can visit some of the well-known Mastic Villages like Pyrgi and Mesta, which are famous for their unique architecture, history, and the cultivation of mastic trees and production of mastic products. These villages are renowned for the well-preserved medieval castles and the distinct geometric patterns that decorate the exteriors of the houses, known as \\"xysta.\\" In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The mastic groves are found north of Chios Town\\" is not accurate.

The album was recorded in three weeks with producer Flemming Rasmussen at the Sweet Silence Studios in Copenhagen, Denmark. The artwork, based on a concept by the band, depicts an electric chair being struck by lightning flowing from the band logo. The title was taken from a passage in Stephen King's novel The Stand. Although rooted in the thrash metal genre, the album showcased the band's musical growth and lyrical sophistication. This was partly because bassist Cliff Burton introduced the basics of music theory to the rest of the band and had more input in the songwriting. Instead of relying strictly on fast tempos as on its debut Kill 'Em All, Metallica broadened its approach by employing acoustic guitars, extended instrumentals, and more complex harmonies. The overall recording costs were paid by Metallica's European label Music for Nations because Megaforce was unable to cover it. It was the last album to feature songwriting contributions from former lead guitarist Dave Mustaine, and the first to feature contributions from his replacement, Kirk Hammett. Ride the Lightning received positive response from music critics, who saw it as a more ambitious effort than its predecessor. Metallica promoted the album on the Bang That Head That Doesn't Bang European tour in late 1984, and on its North American leg in the first half of 1985.

Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates.  and a hint : Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year.  Please answer this question : Which student knew more about tectonic plate pull?

During the 1960 Summer Olympics, Wilma Rudolph became a world renowned star along with which former National Basketball Association player who played for the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks? Answer:","output":"During the 1960 Summer Olympics held in Rome, Italy, Wilma Rudolph became a world-renowned star not only for her incredible performance but also due to her inspiring personal story. She overcame childhood illnesses such as polio and ultimately became an outstanding athlete, winning three gold medals in track and field events at these Olympics. She was nicknamed \\"The Tornado\\" or \\"La Gazzella\\" because of her sheer speed and grace on the track. Her achievements in Rome made her the first American woman to win three gold medals in a single Olympiad. As for the former National Basketball Association (NBA) player who shared the world stage alongside Wilma Rudolph during the 1960 Summer Olympics and later played for the Cincinnati Royals and Milwaukee Bucks, his name is Oscar Robertson, also known as \\"The Big O.\\" A legendary professional basketball player, Robertson is considered one of the all-time greatest players in the history of the sport. In the 1960 Olympic Games, he was a member of the United States men's basketball team, which won the gold medal, defeating the Brazilian team in the final match. Oscar Robertson was a versatile player who excelled at scoring, rebounding, and playmaking. Born in 1938 in Charlotte, Tennessee, he had an exceptional career in high school and college basketball before joining the NBA. While playing college basketball at the University of Cincinnati, he led his team to two Final Four appearances and became a three-time First Team All-American. Later, he was selected as a territorial pick in the 1960 NBA Draft by the Cincinnati Royals and played for them from 1960 to 1970. During his decade-long tenure with the Cincinnati Royals, Robertson made a lasting impact, earning an All-Star selection in each season and obtaining the Most Valuable Player (MVP) award in 1964. Known for his exceptional all-around skills, he became the first player in NBA history to average a triple-double across an entire season, doing so during the 1961-1962 season. His final years in the NBA were spent with the Milwaukee Bucks from 1970 to 1974, where he played alongside another NBA legend, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. Together, they helped lead the Bucks to their first and only NBA championship in 1971. After retiring from basketball, Oscar Robertson became an influential advocate for NBA players, serving as the president of the NBA Players Association. He acted as a key figure in a lawsuit against the league that ultimately resulted in the abolition of the \\"reserve clause,\\" allowing for increased player mobility and the establishment of free agency in the NBA. In recognition of his numerous accomplishments and contributions to the game, Robertson was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1980, solidifying his status as one of the sport's greatest legends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

PUBLISHED:. 20:57 EST, 9 December 2012. |. UPDATED:. 12:17 EST, 10 December 2012. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was willing to travel to Portugal to see first hand how the 'depenalisation' of drugs has worked in practice. Ministers are to examine Portugese laws to ‘depenalise’ drugs after a damning report said the government’s current strategy is not working. Home Office minister Jeremy Browne said he was ready to visit Portugal to see first hand how the removal of criminal penalties for people caught with small amounts of drugs could help tackle the problem in the UK. He insisted the government was ‘open to new ways of thinking’ after the Commons home affairs select committee asked for a royal commission to examine. whether possession of drugs – even heroin and crack – should cease to be. a criminal offence. The committee said it was 'impressed' by the Portugese system and 'alternative strategies should now be considered'. Mr Browne said today: 'There are interesting new ideas. The report says we should look more carefully at the model that’s happened in Portugal. 'I’m certainly happy to go to Portugal as the report recommends and see what they’re doing there. So we should be open to new ideas and fresh thinking but we should also acknowledge that we’ve made a lot of progress in the last five or ten years.' Mental health campaigners warned the link between cannabis and mental health should not be ignored. But the committee said was clear from other countries that the British approach was not working, and alternative strategies - such as those developed in Portugal - should now be considered. 'We were impressed by what we saw of the Portuguese depenalised system. It had clearly reduced public concern about drug use in that country, and was supported by all political parties and the police,' it said. 'Although it is not certain that the Portuguese experience could be replicated in the UK, given societal differences, we believe this is a model that merits significantly closer consideration.' Ministers should, it said, open discussions with the United Nations Commission on Drugs on new ways tackle what it called the 'global drugs dilemma' - including 'the possibility of legalisation and regulation'. Legalise it: Some say a legalisation of drugs would prevent a black market and benefit Britain whilst anti-drugs charities say it will flood the country with drugs. However Mr Browne said so-called legal highs now posed a 'mutating threat' after an 'explosion' in their use in recent years. 'We have a growing problem with the. drugs that are legal, so called legal highs and we have a diminishing. problem with drugs that are illegal like heroin and crack cocaine. So I. don’t think that it automatically follows that making drugs legal. reduces harm.' Mr Browne was forced to repeatedly deny the report would be shelved, as a senior Tory appeared to back a major. shift in drugs law by suggesting legal bans should be. replaced by education for users. On Twitter, Michael Fabricant, who is a Tory party vice-chairman, wrote: ‘Have often said: Prohibition in US didn’t work. Created crime & black market. Home Affairs Committee is right to ask if drug prohibition works. ‘If we spent the money on educating people that drugs are dangerous instead of attempting & failing to ban them, I suspect more effective.’ The committee’s conclusions were undermined however by detailed minutes of its meetings that showed three of its five Tory members voted against the recommendation to call for a royal commission. Drug support: Tory vice-chairman Michael Fabricant, pictured at a 2008 protest, said money is better spent on education about the dangers of drugs than enforcing bans. The panel also split evenly on whether cannabis should be given a lower classification. That recommendation was included on the casting vote of the chairman, Labour MP Keith Vaz. The report sparked fury among drugs campaigners – and ministers immediately ruled out major changes to the law. Mary Brett, of the charity Cannabis Skunk Sense, said: ‘A royal commission would cost the earth, and we do not need it to tell us what we already know: legalisation would open the floodgates and drug use would increase. It will also do nothing to help Colombia.’ Marjorie Wallace, of Sane, a mental health charity, said: ‘If the report is to be responsible, it must take account of the specific damage that cannabis can do to the developing brain. ‘Not only because recent studies have shown it inducing irreversible cognitive deterioration but in around 10 per cent of cases triggering severe psychotic illness.’ The MPs took evidence from comedian and former heroin addict Russell Brand, who said drug bans didn’t work, and Sir Richard Branson who said the sale of drugs should be permitted and taxed. They visited Colombia to see the effects of the drugs trade, and met the country’s president. The report said the MPs ‘recognise and sympathise with the immense suffering and slaying of innocent people which tragically has taken place over the years in Colombia and other Latin American countries, as a result of the murderous rivalry between drug gangs.’ The MPs called for cannabis to be reclassified as a Class C drug from Class B. The report also claims the lack of a ban on cigarettes and alcohol can send a ‘confusing message’ to drug users. A Government spokesman said: ‘We have no intention of downgrading or declassifying cannabis. A royal commission on drugs is simply not necessary.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

The couple also spent the festive period apart. James decamped to the £4.5 million family manor house in Bucklebury, Berkshire, for Christmas with mum Carole, a former air hostess, dad Michael and sister Pippa and – later – Kate, William and six-month-old Prince George. Meanwhile Donna returned to Newcastle to spend Christmas with her family before heading to Goa and Kerala in India for some  New Year sunshine with Freya, her ten-year-old daughter with her  ex-partner – the 53-year-old casino-owning multi-millionaire environmentalist Damian Aspinall. A source close to James told The Mail on Sunday last night: ‘People were saying they’ve split because they haven’t been photographed for a while but they are still together and everything’s good.’ And a friend of Donna’s – who is soon to launch her own jewellery range – added, ‘They will have been together for a year soon. They are as happy as ever and have laughed at reports their relationship is over.’ As well at being regulars at various London members’ clubs last year, the pair were also spotted out clubbing with James’ sister Pippa and Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie. Last September, Donna told The Mail on Sunday’s You magazine: ‘James is wonderful .  .  . And yes, there is also the bonus that he  brings something I have always searched for and will always need in my life... cake.’ Meanwhile, another picture of James has just been made public – as a photograph of him as a teenage at Marlborough College has been posted on Facebook by his old school pal James Simison. Rumours: The couple were pictured together publicly in September (left) and November (right), but spent Christmas apart triggering rumours of a split. A friend of Donna's, however, said they laughed off the notion. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

The Buccaneers stayed home this week for a rematch against their division rivals the Atlanta Falcons. With the convincing victory, Tampa Bay clinched the NFC South division title, maintained a perfect 5-0 division record, and scored their first kickoff return touchdown in franchise history. Tampa Bay's defense recorded the first points of the game, as Ronde Barber intercepted Chris Redman's pass on the third play of the game and returned it 29 yards for a touchdown. Atlanta got on the board next with kicker Morten Andersen making a 33-yard field goal. On the ensuing kickoff, Micheal Spurlock made team history by becoming the first Buccaneer player to return a kickoff for a touchdown. It was the first kickoff return touchdown for Tampa Bay in 32 seasons, 498 games, and 1,865 attempts. After the Buccaneer defense forced a Falcons punt, Jeff Garcia commandeered a long, clock-eating 10-minute drive ending in a 33-yard field goal by Matt Bryant to make the score 17-3. With just over five minutes remaining in the first half, Tampa bay recovered an Atlanta fumble, and Earnest Graham scored a 1-yard TD run. Graham became the first player in club history to score a touchdown in six consecutive games. With a 24-3 lead, Tampa Bay performed a pooch kickoff, and Atlanta muffed the return, while Kalvin Pearson recovered. Tampa Bay drove to the 24-yard line, but DeAngelo Hall intercepted a pass intended for Joey Galloway at the Atlanta 11-yard line. The Buccaneers would immediately regain possession as Greg White forced and recovered a fumble on the next play. Matt Bryant then easily converted a 28-yard field goal to take a 27-3 lead into halftime. Tampa Bay would receive the second half's opening kickoff, but was forced to punt after a 7-minute drive. On Atlanta's third play, Jermaine Phillips intercepted a pass intended for Jerious Norwood which set Tampa Bay up at the Atlanta 23-yard line. Matt Bryant then scored the half's first points with a 34-yard field goal to make the score 30-3. In the fourth quarter, punter Josh Bidwell successfully pinned Atlanta at their own 6-yard line. The resulting poor field position eventually led to Tampa Bay taking over near midfieldied Michael Bennett carried six times all the way to the Atlanta 1-yard line, from which Anthony Becht scored the game's final points off a 1-yard TD catch. Statistically, Tampa Bay's defense dominated Atlanta. The Falcons managed only 133 yards of total offense, committed five turnovers, and were 0-for-9 on third down conversions. The Falcons crossed midfield only once, and Tampa Bay's time of possession was 43 minutes. On the following Wednesday, the kickoff return touchdown earned Spurlock the NFC Special Teams Player of the Week award. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Since the 1990s, Portugal's public consumption-based economic development model has been slowly changing to a system that is focused on exports, private investment and the development of the high-tech sector. Consequently, business services have overtaken more traditional industries such as textiles, clothing, footwear and cork (Portugal is the world's leading cork producer), wood products and beverages.\\"?

Justification: This question tests the student's ability to comprehend the main idea of the passage, which is the transformation of Portugal's economy since the 1990s from a public consumption-based model to a focus on exports, private investment, and high-tech sector development, leading to the rise of business services in importance.

We want to find the value of \\"g\\" that makes our equation equal to 0. Our equation is: 0 = -40*g - 6*g - 460 Now, let's combine the \\"g\\" parts. Since we have -40 times \\"g\\" and -6 times \\"g\\", we can add those together. -40 plus -6 is -46. So it looks like this now: 0 = -46*g - 460 Next, we want to get \\"g\\" by itself. To do that, let's first add 460 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 460 = -46*g - 460 + 460 That gives us: 460 = -46*g Now, we need to get \\"g\\" by itself. Here, -46 is multiplied by \\"g\\". To find \\"g\\", we should divide both sides by -46: 460 / -46 = (-46*g) / -46 That gives us: g = -10 There you have it! The value of \\"g\\" that makes this equation true is -10.

Sir Edward William Elgar, 1st Baronet  (; 2 June 1857 – 23 February 1934) was an English composer, many of whose works have entered the British and international classical concert repertoire. Among his best-known compositions are orchestral works including the Enigma Variations, the Pomp and Circumstance Marches, concertos for violin and cello, and two symphonies. He also composed choral works, including The Dream of Gerontius, chamber music and songs. He was appointed Master of the King's Musick in 1924. Although Elgar is often regarded as a typically English composer, most of his musical influences were not from England but from continental Europe. He felt himself to be an outsider, not only musically, but socially. In musical circles dominated by academics, he was a self-taught composer; in Protestant Britain, his Roman Catholicism was regarded with suspicion in some quarters; and in the class-conscious society of Victorian and Edwardian Britain, he was acutely sensitive about his humble origins even after he achieved recognition. He nevertheless married the daughter of a senior British army officer. She inspired him both musically and socially, but he struggled to achieve success until his forties, when after a series of moderately successful works his Enigma Variations (1899) became immediately popular in Britain and overseas. He followed the Variations with a choral work, The Dream of Gerontius (1900), based on a Roman Catholic text that caused some disquiet in the Anglican establishment in Britain, but it became, and has remained, a core repertory work in Britain and elsewhere. His later full-length religious choral works were well received but have not entered the regular repertory. In his fifties, Elgar composed a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took many years to achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras.

He noticed that people have different skin colors. To learn more about the science behind skin colors he categorized the skin colors into two broad groups, case D and case L. Case D is represented by darker skin and case L is represented by lighter skin.  and a hint : The epidermis also contains melanocytes , which are cells that produce melanin. Melanin is the brownish pigment that gives skin much of its color. Everyone has about the same number of melanocytes, but the melanocytes of people with darker skin produce more melanin. The amount of melanin produced is determined by heredity and exposure to UV light, which increases melanin output. Exposure to UV light also stimulates the skin to produce vitamin D . Because melanin blocks UV light from penetrating the skin, people with darker skin may be at greater risk of vitamin D deficiency.

Here is a news article: Ice breaks away from a frozen coastline near the Norwegian Arctic town of Longyearbyen April 23, 2007.      500 MILES FROM THE NORTH POLE The minimum summertime volume of Arctic sea ice fell to a record low last year, researchers said in a study to be published shortly, suggesting that thinning of the ice had outweighed a recovery in area.      The study estimated that last year broke the previous, 2007 record for the minimum volume of ice, which is calculated from a combination of sea ice area and thickness.      The research adds to a picture of rapid climate change at the top of the world that could see the Arctic Ocean ice-free within decades, spurring new oil exploration opportunities but possibly also disrupted weather patterns far afield and a faster rise in sea levels.      The authors developed a model predicting thickness across the Arctic Ocean based on actual observations of winds, air and ocean temperatures.      \\"The real worrisome fact is downward trend over the last 32 years,\\" said Axel Schweiger, lead author of the paper, referring to a satellite record of changes in the Arctic.      He was emailing Reuters at the Greenpeace icebreaker Arctic Sunrise, in the Arctic Ocean between the Norwegian island of Svalbard and the North Pole.      \\"(It fell) by a large enough margin to establish a statistically significant new record,\\" said the authors in their paper titled \\"Uncertainty in modeled Arctic sea ice volume.\\"      The researchers at the University of Washington in Seattle checked the model results against real readings of ice thickness using limited submarine and satellite data.      The approach has some detractors because it is focused is on modeling rather than direct observations of thickness, and therefore contains some uncertainty.      Sea ice area is easier to measure by satellite than ice thickness, and so has not needed a modeling approach.      Ice thickness is just as important or more so in helping understand what is happening in the far north. Some experts argue that part of the reason the ice area has dramatically fallen in recent years is because it has been thinning for decades.      The authors said their Pan-arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System (PIOMAS) in general agreed well with actual observations, although \\"modeling error\\" was possible.      The Arctic sea ice area fell below 4.6 million sq km last week with two weeks of the melt season still to go, compared with the record low of 4.13 million sq km in 2007.      By comparison, the minimum ice extent in the early 1970s was about 7 million square km. Ice melts every year during the summer and reaches a minimum extent in mid-September.      Most experts now agree that the Arctic Ocean will be ice-free in late summer at some point this century but disagree about exactly when.      While sea ice itself does not raise sea levels when it melts, a warmer Arctic could speed up melting of the Greenland ice sheet, which is freshwater ice trapped over land and contains enough water to raise world sea levels by 7 meters. ||||| Some researchers believe that the actual volume of sea ice in the Arctic has already fallen to a record minimum this summer. The extent of the Arctic covered by sea ice this summer has also continued to decline – a trend seen since 1979 when the first satellite measurements were collected.      Although satellites are good at measuring the surface area of ocean that is covered by the floating sea ice, it is not so easy to assess ice volume, which requires accurate measurements of ice thickness over wide regions.      Satellites have produced clear evidence that the sea-ice extent – the area covered by at least 15 per cent of ice – has fallen consistently and significantly each summer over the past 30 years. Since 1979, sea ice extent in summer has fallen by around 30 per cent, according to satellite data.      Walt Meier, of the US National Snow and Ice Data Centre in Boulder, Colorado, said that at the moment the Arctic sea ice is on track to be second or third lowest in terms of sea-ice extent, although there is still about another week or so until the summer melt period finally comes to an end.      \\"A lot still depends on the weather. If a warm front comes through, there could still be some rapid melting. But at present we think it could be close to or as low as the 2007 record minimum,\\" Dr Meier said.      The sea ice in the Arctic goes through annual cycles of melting in summer and reforming each winter. However, as average temperatures in the the Arctic region have increased in recent decades – faster than in most other regions of the world – summer sea ice has disappeared faster than predicted, and winter ice has not reformed as readily as it once did.      In 2007, there was a \\"perfect storm\\" of driving winds that piled the sea ice up against the Greenland coastline and high pressure that removed cloud cover at the height of summer season to create idea conditions for the melting of the sea ice. This year the sea ice is more dispersed, but in terms of total surface area covered by ice, it probably ranks close or equal to 2007, Dr Meier said.      The last four summers have experienced the four lowest minima since satellite readings were first gathered and eight of the ten lowest summers have occurred in the past decade, he said. At the same time, there has been a marked decrease in thick \\"multi-year\\" sea ice that is older than five years, and an increase in the proportion of thinner, younger ice which is more likely to melt away completely in summer.      Scientists at the University of Washington in Seattle estimated that the actual volume of sea in the Arctic is already at an all-time low, lower even than in 2007 because then the ice that was left was older, multi-year ice several metres thick. However, estimating ice volume is notoriously difficult. ||||| The total volume of Arctic sea ice shrank last fall to the smallest amount ever observed during the age of satellites, according to a new study that used a ultra-sophisticated computer modeling program that incorporates ocean observations, submarine data, and space-age monitoring.      But that 2010 record -- discussed in a research paper still in press and reported around the world by a Reuter’s dispatch from a Greenpeace icebreaker -- may be already threatened by this year's polar meltdown.      New estimates by the same team of scientists at the Polar Science Center of the University of Washington appear to show ice volume is now plunging faster than it did at the same time last year when the record was set.      As of July 31, the last time numbers were crunched and posted online, the volume of sea ice appeared to be about 2,135 cubic miles -- more than 50 percent lower than the average volume and 62 percent lower than the maximum volume of ice that covered the Arctic back in 1979, the scientists said here.      “Sea ice volume is an important climate indicator,” the group explains here. “It depends on both ice thickness and extent and therefore more directly tied to climate forcing than extent alone. However, Arctic sea ice volume cannot currently be observed continuously. Observations from satellites, Navy submarines, moorings, and field measurements are all limited in space and time.”      The melt season for Arctic sea ice climaxes each September or October, and many people closely track the satellite generated reports and analysis of sea ice extent by the National Snow and Ice Data Center.      But another way of gauging the health of sea ice focuses on trying to estimate the actual amount of ice out there -- both the footprint of the floes on the surface, plus the fabled seventh-eighths hidden underneath in the sea. It’s an exceedingly difficult task.      To be published in the Journal of Geophysical Research, “Uncertainty in Modeled Arctic Sea Ice Volume” is a highly technical discussion of how the scientists at the Polar Science Center calculate, monitor and reality check the ongoing volume of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean using their Pan-arctic Ice Ocean Modeling and Assimilation System. The system uses complicated climate models for ice, ocean and air along with observations to conjure an estimate of what’s really happening on and below the surface to the Arctic floes in real time.      The trend lines of these “anomalies” in volume seem to be literally dropping off their scales for this time of year in both 2010 and 2011, according to the most current chart. This year has dropped further.      “Given all the uncertainties and margins for error, it’s tough to declare a single year a “record,” said lead author Axel Schweiger and four co-authors in their paper. “However, the 2010 September ice volume anomaly did in fact exceed the previous 2007 minimum by a large enough margin to declare it a new record.”      With a cinematic dateline of “500 MILES FROM THE NORTH POLE,” news of their conclusion was posted around the world this week after a Reuters reporter filed a story from the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise as it steamed through Far North waters. (Check out the Arctic Sunrise webcam.)      “The research adds to a picture of rapid climate change at the top of the world that could see the Arctic Ocean ice-free within decades, spurring new oil exploration opportunities but possibly also disrupted weather patterns far afield and a faster rise in sea levels,” wrote reporter Gerard Wynn.      \\"The real worrisome fact is downward trend over the last 32 years,\\" Schweiger told Wynn in an email.      In a story filed last week (dateline: OFF SVALBARD), Wynn interviewed NSIDC director Mark Serreze and reported that the extent of Arctic Sea ice had already reached the third lowest level in the satellite record with several weeks left before the annual slush cup ends.      \\"We just dropped below 4.6 million square kilometres and that's what we had in 2010 (at the minimum),” Serreze told Wynn in this story. “We're continuing the overall pattern of loss, and there's still a couple of weeks to go in the melt season.      “Will we break the record in 2007? I don't think so but we're going to be close.\\"      Contact Doug O'Harra at doug(at)alaskadispatch.com. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Okay little buddy, I'll try to make it as simple as I can for you! So, this article is talking about how the amount of ice in the Arctic Ocean is getting smaller and smaller each year. Last year, it reached the smallest amount ever. This is not good for our planet because it can cause problems for the animals that live there, make the weather change in other places, and it can even make the water in the ocean go up higher. The scientists who study this are worried because they see the ice is not only getting smaller in size, but also getting thinner. That's why they are trying their best to measure and understand what's happening up there in the Arctic."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer this question: what is the fluid-filled space behind the oval window??","output":"The fluid-filled space behind the oval window is called the scala vestibuli, which is a part of the cochlea in the inner ear. The cochlea is a snail-shaped, bony structure and consists of three key parts: the scala vestibuli, scala media, and scala tympani. These three chambers run the entire length of the cochlea and are filled with different fluids that play a crucial role in the hearing process. The scala vestibuli is the upper chamber, and it is filled with a fluid called perilymph. The oval window, also called the fenestra ovalis, is a membrane-covered opening separating the middle ear from the scala vestibuli. When sound waves vibrate the eardrum, the ossicles (the malleus, incus, and stapes) of the middle ear amplify the vibrations and transfer them to the oval window. The stapes bone interacts directly with the oval window, leading to the vibration of the membrane. Perilymph fluid in the scala vestibuli conducts these vibrations and facilitates the movement of the fluid contained in the middle chamber, the scala media. The scala media is filled with a different fluid called endolymph and houses the spiral organ of Corti. The organ of Corti consists of specialized hair cells that move corresponding to the vibrations and generate electrical signals that are then transmitted to the cochlear nerve. The third chamber, the scala tympani, is also filled with perilymph. It is located below the scala media, and the fluid vibrations eventually pass to this chamber before dissipating as they reach the round window – another membrane-covered opening in the cochlear partition that separates the scala tympani from the middle ear cavity. In summary, the fluid-filled space behind the oval window is the scala vestibuli, which plays a pivotal role in transferring sound vibrations from the oval window to other cochlear chambers, ultimately leading to the transformation of these mechanical vibrations into electrical signals that are sent to the brain and interpreted as sound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tommy returns with his friend Allen Hawes, hoping to cremate Jason's body and stop his hallucinations. At the cemetery, they dig up Jason's corpse, but seeing it causes Tommy to snap, and he stabs Jason's body with a metal fence post. As he turns his back on Jason, two lightning bolts strike the post and revive the now-undead killer. Tommy tries to light the gasoline in which he has soaked Jason, but a sudden downpour prevents it. When Hawes tries to attack Jason with a shovel, the shovel breaks on impact and his heart is punched out. Tommy makes his way to the sheriff's office, when he panics and attempts to grab weapons, it gets him put into a jail cell. His warning that Jason has returned goes unheeded by Sheriff Garris, who is aware of Tommy's mental problems and thinks he is imagining Jason. On the road, camp counselors Darren and Lizbeth get lost looking for the camp and run into Jason. After they fail trying to frighten Jason off the road, he impales them both with the metal rod that resurrected him. The next morning, Garris' daughter Megan and her friends Sissy, Cort and Lizbeth's sister Paula ask him to search for Darren and Lizbeth. Tommy warns them about Jason, but as he is now considered an urban legend they ignore the warnings, though Megan finds herself attracted to him.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of decreasing wave sizes would have a direct impact on the erosion process by the ocean.  When wave sizes decrease, the energy contained in the waves is reduced. This will affect multiple steps of the erosion process, as follows: 1. With smaller waves, there would be less force to wash onto beaches. This would directly impact the first step, \\"Water from the ocean washes onto beaches in waves,\\" by decreasing the amount of water and sediment brought to the shore.  2. Due to less forceful waves, the amount of sediment carried from the ocean would also decrease. This directly affects the second step, \\"The waves contain sediment from the ocean,\\" as the sediment concentration in the waves would be reduced. 3. Smaller waves would have a weaker impact on the rocks and sand on the beach. This directly impacts the third step, \\"The water and particles in it hit rocks and sand on the beach,\\" reducing the wear on the rocks and decreasing the amount of material loosened and added to the coastal sediment. 4. Another step directly impacted would be the fifth, \\"Tiny parts of the rocks on the shore come off the larger rocks,\\" where smaller waves would be less effective in dislodging rock fragments. 5. The sixth step, \\"The waves pick up sand and small rocks from the beach,\\" would also be directly impacted, as smaller waves would have reduced capacity to transport loose material back into the ocean.  Overall, the perturbation of smaller wave sizes would directly impact multiple steps of the erosion process, resulting in less erosion by the ocean. The lesser energy contained in the smaller waves would reduce the efficiency of sediment transportation and the wear on rocks and sand on the beach.

Since it was a Saturday night, everything else was empty for miles. The parking lot was filled with sports cars, hybrids, and shiny suburban tanks. The door facing the parking lot was open, spilling out muted lights and the din of yuppie chatter. It cast a somewhat foreboding aura over the entrance. The first thing I noticed as I approached was the beefy refrigerator in a rented tux blocking the doorway. The second thing was the surveillance camera perched on the wall above his head. I had stopped home and changed first, so I was sure I was dressed mostly appropriately for some rich faux-hipster art party - charcoal gray pinstripe jacket over a TV on the Radio t-shirt, skinny cuffed jeans, Docs, and a black fedora. I certainly didn't look any worse than the other idiots I saw filing in and out of the door. I even had an invitation.

They initially wondered if the doorman knew who they were and had a reason to keep them out, but then they noticed the doorman's earpiece and the surveillance camera perched above. They suspected that someone behind the camera, possibly involved in the event's organization, was instructing the doorman to specifically keep them out. The act of flipping off the camera was the narrator's way of expressing their resentment and defiance towards the person making that decision, as well as possibly drawing attention to the fact that they knew they were being monitored. They later learned that Dylan Maxwell, an individual who was monitoring the cameras, was indeed responsible for their exclusion and was laughing at their predicament.

Addison brought their stuff back home.  Given the question \\"How would Addison feel after?\\", is \\"like a lonely person\\" a valid answer? A:","output":"Yes, \\"like a lonely person\\" could be a valid answer to the question \\"How would Addison feel after?\\", especially when we consider the various situations that could pertain to Addison's feelings after finishing their freshman year of college and returning home. However, it's crucial to remember that everyone's experience and emotional processing differs significantly from one another. Therefore, this answer is situational and largely dependent on Addison's subjective experiences and emotional responses.  Let's examine the potential circumstances that might result in Addison feeling \\"like a lonely person.\\"  1. Transitioning between Different Environments: After experiencing a year of university life, which is usually filled with social interactions, diverse experiences, and the development of a newfound independence, returning home might be a stark contrast, and Addison could possibly feel isolated or lonely. 2. Missing the Campus Life: If they thoroughly appreciated the social aspect of college life, which might have included making new friends, participating in societies or clubs, and attending numerous social events, being back home can induce a sense of loneliness. 3. Changing Friend Circles: The relationships formed during freshman year may alter the relational dynamics Addison had before leaving for college. If their old friends moved on or changed significantly (or if Addison themselves changed), this could result in a sense of loneliness. 4. Lack of Active Engagement: At university, Addison is likely to be engaged in many activities, be it academic or extracurricular. However, back home, especially if it's during a break, they might not have as much to engage themselves, leading to feelings of loneliness and isolation. 5. Adjusting to the Home Environment: After a year of being independent and managing their own time and activities, moving back home might involve adjusting to family routines and expectations, which could be quite challenging and may result in feelings of loneliness. However, it's equally probable that Addison might feel relieved, relaxed, or happy after they finish their freshman year and return home. Therefore, the answer is largely dependent on the individual's subjective emotional experience.  In conclusion, although we cannot definitely confirm that \\"like a lonely person\\" would be Addison's exact response, it can be considered a valid hypothetical response to your question considering the outlined situational factors. Yet, it's crucial to emphasize that there could be a multitude of other possible feelings associated with the given situation due to the subjective nature of emotions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who does Thespis suggests goes down to earth in disguise to mingle and judge for themselves what people think of them?  Scene: A Ruined Temple on the Summit of Mount Olympus On Mount Olympus, the elderly deities complain of feeling old and lament their waning influence on Earth.  Mercury complains that the older gods are lazy and leave all their duties to him, while he gets no credit for all his drudgery.  Jupiter says that matters have reached a crisis, but he is unsure what can be done about it.  Just then, the gods see a swarm of mortals ascending the mountain and withdraw to observe them from a distance. Thespis's acting company enters for a picnic celebrating the marriage of two of its members, Sparkeion and Nicemis.  The actors, being cheap, have failed to contribute substantial food items to the picnic.  Sparkeion flirts with his former fiancée, Daphne, which annoys Nicemis.  In retaliation, Nicemis flirts with her old suitor, Thespis, but he declines to flirt back.  Thespis explains to his troupe that a successful manager must be aloof from those he manages, or he will lose his authority. Jupiter, Mars and Apollo enter.  All of the actors flee in terror, except for Thespis.  Jupiter asks Thespis whether he is impressed with the father of the gods.  Thespis replies that the gods are unimpressive and suggests that they go down to earth in disguise to \\"mingle\\" and judge for themselves what people think of them.  They agree to invest the actors with their powers, as they take a merry holiday below on Earth.  Thespis agrees that he and his company will keep things running on Mount Olympus during the gods' absence.  Each actor takes the place of one of the gods, with Thespis himself replacing Jupiter.  Mercury stays behind to offer any advice the actors may need. Answer:","output":"In the scene described, Thespis suggests that Jupiter, Mars, and Apollo go down to earth in disguise to mingle and judge for themselves what people think of them. The gods agree and decide to invest the actors with their powers while taking a holiday on Earth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These best friends since kindergarten share a love for summer and beach activities especially building sandcastles. The two kids spend the afternoon meticulously constructing their beach creations. They start by gathering wet sand near the water's edge, taking turns using their pink and yellow plastic shovels to fill up their matching pails. They chatter away excitedly discussing their design strategies; Emma wants a large castle fit for a queen while Lily prefers a complex design with numerous tall towers and a moat surrounding her fortress. They spend the next few hours deeply engrossed in their labor of love. The sandy blanket spread out in front of them is transformed into a landscape filled with grand castles, with each structure more elaborate than the last. Their determination and focus are unwavering, even as they simultaneously discuss their favorite books and cartoon characters. They agonize over the finest details, from the window placement to the criss-cross patterns on their castle walls, recreating images from fairy tales and princess stories they love so much. As the afternoon sun begins to wane and the sky paints a picture of pink and oranges, they integrate elements from the beach into their castle. Shimmering pebbles become walkways, shells turn into decorations adorning castle walls, and seaweed transforms into the greenery hanging from their stony parapets. Satisfied with their creative endeavors, they take a step back to admire their hard work. With a sense of accomplishment, they giggle, exchanging high-fives and compliments. They start creating stories, imagining themselves as princesses living in these spectacular sandcastles, battling sea monsters, hosting grand balls and leading their imaginary kingdoms with wisdom and kindness. As the day comes to an end, they sit beside their creations watching the tide begin to roll in. There's a momentary pang of sadness as they watch the sea begin to claim their sand masterpieces. However, the feeling quickly subsides when Lily suggests they can build an even bigger castle tomorrow. Their parents call them for dinner. They run laughing towards the picnic blanket laid out a little way from the water, leaving behind the swept-away remnants of their day's work. They promise each other to wake up early the next day and take on the challenge of building a more magnificent sandcastle. This ends their day at the beach, but the memory of joy and camaraderie they'd shared while building their sand castles keeps a warm smile on their faces, promising more beautiful days of friendship, creativity, and beachside adventures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In the years following its release, many reviewers considered To Kill a Mockingbird a novel primarily concerned with race relations. Claudia Durst Johnson considers it \\"reasonable to believe\\" that the novel was shaped by two events involving racial issues in Alabama: Rosa Parks' refusal to yield her seat on a city bus to a white person, which sparked the 1955 Montgomery Bus Boycott, and the 1956 riots at the University of Alabama after Autherine Lucy and Polly Myers were admitted (Myers eventually withdrew her application and Lucy was expelled, but reinstated in 1980). In writing about the historical context of the novel's construction, two other literary scholars remark: \\"To Kill a Mockingbird was written and published amidst the most significant and conflict-ridden social change in the South since the Civil War and Reconstruction.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Thompson was born into a middle-class family in Louisville, Kentucky, the first of three sons of Virginia Ray Davison (1908, Springfield, Kentucky - March 20, 1998, Louisville), who worked as head librarian at the Louisville Free Public Library and Jack Robert Thompson (September 4, 1893, Horse Cave, Kentucky - July 3, 1952, Louisville), a public insurance adjuster and World War I veteran. His parents were introduced to each other by a friend from Jack's fraternity at the University of Kentucky in September 1934, and married on November 2, 1935. Thompson's first name came from a purported ancestor on his mother's side, the Scottish surgeon John Hunter. The book for which Thompson gained most of his fame had its genesis during the research for Strange Rumblings in Aztlan, an expose for Rolling Stone on the 1970 killing of the Mexican-American television journalist Ruben Salazar. Salazar had been shot in the head at close range with a tear gas canister fired by officers of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department during the National Chicano Moratorium March against the Vietnam War. One of Thompson's sources for the story was Oscar Zeta Acosta, a prominent Mexican-American activist and attorney. Finding it difficult to talk in the racially tense atmosphere of Los Angeles, Thompson and Acosta decided to travel to Las Vegas, and take advantage of an assignment by Sports Illustrated to write a 250-word photograph caption on the Mint 400 motorcycle race held there.  What was to be a short caption quickly grew into something else entirely. Thompson first submitted to Sports Illustrated a manuscript of 2,500 words, which was, as he later wrote, \\"aggressively rejected.\\" Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner was said to have liked \\"the first 20 or so jangled pages enough to take it seriously on its own terms and tentatively scheduled it for publication -- which gave me the push I needed to keep working on it\\", Thompson later wrote.  The result of the trip to Las Vegas became the 1972 book Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which first appeared in the November 1971 issues of Rolling Stone as a two-part series. It is written as a first-person account by a journalist named Raoul Duke on a trip to Las Vegas with Dr. Gonzo, his \\"300-pound Samoan attorney\\", to cover a narcotics officers' convention and the \\"fabulous Mint 400\\". During the trip, Duke and his companion (always referred to as \\"my attorney\\") become sidetracked by a search for the American Dream, with \\"two bags of grass, seventy-five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high-powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, and a whole galaxy of multi-colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers ... and also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of Budweiser, a pint of raw ether, and two dozen amyls.\\"  Coming to terms with the failure of the 1960s countercultural movement is a major theme of the novel, and the book was greeted with considerable critical acclaim, including being heralded by The New York Times as \\"by far the best book yet written on the decade of dope\\". \\"The Vegas Book\\", as Thompson referred to it, was a mainstream success and introduced his Gonzo journalism techniques to a wide public. Did it get good reviews?","output":"Yes, the book called \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\" got good reviews. People really liked it. The New York Times even said it was the best book written about the time when lots of people used drugs, like in the 1960s.

This means whenever beta is true, alpha must also be true, but alpha being true does not necessarily mean that beta is true. Furthermore, since gamma is a necessary and sufficient condition for beta, we can express this relationship as gamma Leftrightarrow beta. This equivalence means that gamma being true guarantees beta is true and vice versa. Given these relationships, we can infer that if gamma (which is equivalent to beta) is true, then alpha must also be true, leading to gamma Rightarrow alpha. However, alpha being true does not guarantee that gamma is true, as alpha is not a sufficient condition for beta (and by extension, gamma). From the definitions of sufficient and necessary conditions, this scenario indicates that gamma is a sufficient condition for alpha because if gamma is true, then alpha is guaranteed to be true.

Therefore, the domain of ( f(x) ) is ( (-1, 3) ). 2. Now substitute ( a = 2 ) into ( f(x) ): [ f(x) = log_2(1 + x) + log_2(3 - x) = log_2left[(1 + x)(3 - x)right] = log_2left[-(x - 1)^2 + 4right] ]    Since the logarithm is an increasing function, the function ( f(x) ) reaches its maximum when the argument (-(x - 1)^2 + 4) is maximized.

Assuming that an employee either always lies or always tells the truth, find how many employees are there in the enterprise.","output":"1. Let there be ( n ) people in the enterprise. Each employee makes two claims:    - (i) Less than 12 employees have a more difficult job.    - (ii) At least 30 employees take a higher salary. 2. We need to determine the number of employees ( n ) such that the conditions hold true for either all truth-tellers or all liars. 3. **Claim:** In the top 30 people for salary, they are all liars.    - **Proof:** Assume that there is a truth-teller in that group. Then they say \\"at least 30 people have a higher salary than me,\\" which implies that there are 30 people above them in salary. This is a contradiction because we assumed that this is at most 29. Therefore, the claim is proven. 4. Consequently, the bottom ( n-30 ) people for salary are all truth-tellers because they truthfully say that at least 30 people have a higher salary. 5. Since the top 30 people in salary all lie about (i), we must have that there are at least 12 people above the employee that works the most difficult job in the top 30 salary. This means that there are at least 12 people outside of the top 30 salary, so there are at least ( 30 + 12 = 42 ) people in total. 6. Since the bottom ( n-30 ) people all tell the truth about (i), the lowest difficulty worker in that group must have at most 11 people above them, so there are at most 12 people in this group. Thus, there are at most ( 30 + 12 = 42 ) people in total. 7. Therefore, ( 42 ge n ge 42 ), which implies ( n = 42 ). 8. **Construction:**    - Consider the following leaderboard for salary and difficulty:      - Salary (highest to lowest): ( E_{42}, E_{41}, E_{40}, dots, E_1 ).      - Difficulty (highest to lowest): ( E_1, E_2, E_3, dots, E_{41}, E_{42} ).    - ( E_i ) is a truth-teller for ( i = 1, 2, dots, 12 ), and a liar for ( i = 13, 14, 15, dots, 42 ). 9. Verification:    - For ( i = 1, 2, dots, 12 ):      - ( E_i ) tells the truth about (i) because only ( i-1 < 12 ) people work a more difficult job.      - They tell the truth about (ii) because ( 42-i ge 30 ) people have a higher salary.    - For ( i = 13, 14, dots, 42 ):      - ( E_i ) lies about (i) because there are ( i-1 ge 12 ) people that work a more difficult job.      - They lie about (ii) because there are ( 42-i < 30 ) people that have a higher salary.

According to the problem, for every digit (a_i) (except for the first and last digits), the following condition must be satisfied:    [    a_i < frac{a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}}{2}    ]    Multiplying both sides by 2 to clear the fraction, we get:    [    2a_i < a_{i-1} + a_{i+1}    ]    Rearranging the inequality, we obtain:    [    a_i - a_{i+1} < a_{i-1} - a_i    ]    This implies that the differences ( b_i = a_i - a_{i+1} ) are decreasing. 3. **Constraints on (a_i) and Number of Digits:**      To maximize the number while respecting the condition for ( b_i ), we recognize that having many positive differences would lead to an infeasible number sum, i.e., the sum of differences must be less than 10 for (b_i) values. 4. **Sum of Positive Differences:**    Consider consecutive positive values for ( b_i ):    [    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 > 9    ]    This would overshoot our digit constraints. Hence, examining this sum condition, we find that we can have at most 7 valid decreasing steps along with 8 total digits. 5. **Constructing the Number:**    By aiming to construct the largest possible number under these constraints, the first digit should ideally be 9. The differences ( b_i ) should be as small as possible initially and increase later. 6. **Difference Sequence and Resulting Number:**    Following an orderly and feasible increasing sequence of differences:    [    3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3    ]    Constructing the number from these differences:    [    begin{align*}    a_1 &= 9    a_2 &= 9 - 3 = 6    a_3 &= 6 - 2 = 4     a_4 &= 4 - 1 = 3    a_5 &= 3 - 0 = 3     a_6 &= 3 - (-1) = 4     a_7 &= 4 - (-2) = 6     a_8 &= 6 - (-3) = 9    end{align*}    ]    Thus, we obtain the number 96433469.

At the start of the game they split these hundred marbles into two piles.

The first player unable to remove any marbles loses. Alice makes the first move of the game. Determine all initial pile sizes for which Bianca has a winning strategy.","output":"To determine all initial pile sizes for which Bianca has a winning strategy, we need to analyze the game and identify the losing positions for Alice. A losing position is one where any move leaves the opponent in a winning position.  1. **Understanding the Game Dynamics:**    - Alice and Bianca start with 100 marbles split into two piles, say (a) and (b) such that (a + b = 100).    - A move consists of choosing a pile and removing a positive integer number of marbles not larger than half the number of marbles in that pile. 2. **Characterizing Losing Positions:**    - A position ((a, b)) is losing if any move from this position leaves the opponent in a winning position.    - The key insight is that ((a, b)) is a losing position if (frac{a+1}{b+1}) is a power of 2 (including fractions less than 1). 3. **Proof of Characterization:**    - From a losing position ((a, b)), any move will change (a+1) or (b+1) by a factor of less than 2. This means that the ratio (frac{a+1}{b+1}) will no longer be a power of 2, thus moving to a winning position.    - Conversely, from a winning position, one can always make a move to round off to the nearest power of 2, thus forcing the opponent into a losing position. 4. **Identifying Losing Positions for (a + b = 100):**    - We need to find pairs ((a, b)) such that (frac{a+1}{b+1}) is a power of 2.    - Let's check the possible pairs:      - For ((50, 50)): (frac{50+1}{50+1} = 1), which is (2^0).      - For ((67, 33)): (frac{67+1}{33+1} = frac{68}{34} = 2), which is (2^1).      - For ((33, 67)): (frac{33+1}{67+1} = frac{34}{68} = frac{1}{2}), which is (2^{-1}).      - For ((95, 5)): (frac{95+1}{5+1} = frac{96}{6} = 16), which is (2^4).      - For ((5, 95)): (frac{5+1}{95+1} = frac{6}{96} = frac{1}{16}), which is (2^{-4}).

Multiply both sides of the equation by 200 to clear the fraction:    [    200x_n = x_{n-1} + 198x_n + x_{n+1}    ] 3. Simplify the equation by subtracting 198x_n from both sides:    [    2x_n = x_{n-1} + x_{n+1}    ] 4. Rearrange the equation to isolate the terms involving x_n:    [    x_n - x_{n-1} = x_{n+1} - x_n    ] 5. This implies that the difference between consecutive terms is constant, so the sequence {x_n} is an arithmetic progression with common difference d (where d neq 0 according to the problem’s conditions). 6.

Is it possible to identify the heaviest and lightest coin in 13 weighings? Given that we need to determine both the heaviest and lightest coin among ten coins, we will detail the steps necessary to achieve this using a balance scale within 13 weighings. 1. **Initial Strategy:**    - Observe that a balance scale comparison results in three possible outcomes: the left side being heavier, the right side being heavier, or both sides being equal. Each weighing thus gives us log_2 3 approx 1.58496 bits of information. 2. **Total Information Needed:**    - To unambiguously identify the heaviest and lightest coins among 10 coins, we need to sort them partially to identify the lightest and heaviest.    - The information required to fully sort 10 coins is log_2(10!) bits. Calculating:      [      log_2(10!) = log_2(3628800) approx 12.29 text{ bits}      ]    - Since each weighing provides approximately 1.58496 bits of information, we need approximately:      [      frac{12.29}{1.58496} approx 7.75      ]      weighings to fully sort. However, partial sorting is sufficient if our goal is only to identify the heaviest and lightest coins, which usually requires fewer weighings. 3. **Splitting the Coins:**    - We can use a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the number of coins. Let's split the coins into two groups of 5 coins each. 4. **Pairwise Comparisons:**    - Weighing the five coins against each other will allow us to rank them partially.    - First, weighings required to find some bounds:      1. Compare (1,2), (3,4), and then the remaining coin with the lighter coin from (1,2) to form initial pairs and bounds.      2. Continue pairwise comparisons to narrow down the candidates for the heaviest and lightest coins. 5. **Sequential Comparisons:**    - After the initial partition, further sequential comparisons can determine the exact heaviest and lightest. 6. **Illustrative Follow-up Weighings:**    - Compare (1 vs 2), (3 vs 4), (5 vs 6), (1 vs 3), (5 vs 7) and so forth until every coin has been weighed accordingly.    - Generally, each comparison helps discard non-heaviest and non-lightest coins progressively. 7. **Counting the Weighings:**    - By setting up pairwise comparisons and evaluating outcomes sequentially, the total number of weighings required typically follows a pattern where:      - ( n - 1 ) weighings can provide a relatively stronger ranking order. 8. **Conclusion:**    - Using this method with careful pairwise comparison and binary division, we can ensure that both the heaviest and lightest coins are identified within the provided 13 weighings. Therefore, it is indeed possible to determine the heaviest and lightest coin out of 10 coins using exactly 13 weighings.

Prove that it is not possible to make more than binom{n}{3} such switches before reaching a position in which no further switches are possible.","output":"1. **Assumption and Simplification**: Assume without loss of generality (WLOG) that h_k = k for each student. This simplifies the problem as we can now consider the students' heights as consecutive integers starting from 1 to n. 2. **Claim about the Final Arrangement**: We claim that the arrangement where no further switches are possible is when the students are in descending order of their heights, i.e., n, n-1, n-2, dots, 1. This is because, in this arrangement, no student k has another student k-2 or less standing directly in front of them. 3. **Proof of the Claim**: To prove this, consider any arrangement other than the descending order. There will always exist at least one student k such that the student directly in front of k has height k-2 or less, allowing a switch. This process can continue until the descending order is achieved. 4. **Counting the Maximum Number of Switches**:    - **Switching Strategy**: Start with the student of height n and switch them to the front until no more switches are possible. This can be done n-2 times (since n can switch places with n-2, n-3, dots, 1).    - **Generalizing for Any Student k**: A student of height k can be switched k-2 times until they reach the position immediately behind the student with height k-1.    - **Total Switches for All Students**: Each student k can initiate switches for all taller students k+1, k+2, dots, n. Each of these taller students can be switched k-2 times. 5. **Mathematical Formulation**:    - Define x = n-k+2. The total number of switches is given by the sum:    [    sum_{x=2}^{n-1} (n-x)(x-1) = sum_{x=1}^{n} (n-x)(x-1)    ]    - Simplifying the sum:    [    sum_{x=1}^{n} x(n+1) - sum_{x=1}^{n} n - sum_{x=1}^{n} x^2 = frac{n(n+1)^2}{2} - n^2 - frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}    ]    - Further simplification leads to:    [    frac{3n(n^2+1)}{6} - frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} = frac{n(n^2-3n+2)}{6} = frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} = binom{n}{3}    ] 6. **Conclusion**: The maximum number of switches that can be made before reaching a position where no further switches are possible is binom{n}{3}.

Notice that ( x^4 - 1 ) can be factored using the difference of squares:    [    x^4 - 1 = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 1)    ] 4. Further factor ( x^2 - 1 ):    [    x^2 - 1 = (x-1)(x+1)    ] 5. Substitute the factored expressions back into the equation:    [    2y^2 = (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1)    ] 6. Since ( 2y^2 ) is an even number, ( (x-1)(x+1)(x^2+1) ) must also be even. This implies that ( x ) must be an odd integer (because the product of an even number of even factors, but not all factors even, would be odd, contradicting the evenness on both sides). Consequently, if ( x ) is odd, let:    [    x = 2x' + 1    ]    for some integer ( x' ). 7. Substitute ( x = 2x' + 1 ) into the factors:    [    x-1 = (2x' + 1) - 1 = 2x'    ]    [    x+1 = (2x' + 1) + 1 = 2x' + 2    ]    [    x^2+1 = (2x'+1)^2 + 1 = 4x'^2 + 4x' + 2    ] 8.

For ( y^2 ) to be an integer, all three factors ( x' ), ( x' + 1 ), and ( 2x'^2 + 2x' + 1 ) must be perfect squares since if they weren't, some prime factor would have to appear with an odd exponent in one of them, violating the integer square property. 12. The only pairs of consecutive integers that are both perfect squares are 0 and 1. Hence, we need:    [    x' = 0 text{ or } x' + 1 = 1 implies x' = 0    ] 13.

We know that 25% of the drink is orange juice, and the total amount of the drink is 300 ounces.

Now, let's calculate the amount of watermelon juice. Since the total drink is 300 ounces, and we have the amounts of the other two juices, we can find the amount of watermelon juice by subtracting the amounts of orange and grape juices from the total: Amount of watermelon juice = Total drink - Amount of orange juice - Amount of grape juice Amount of watermelon juice = 300 ounces - 75 ounces - 105 ounces Amount of watermelon juice = 120 ounces Now, to find the percentage of the drink that is watermelon juice (W%), we divide the amount of watermelon juice by the total amount of the drink and multiply by 100: W% = (Amount of watermelon juice / Total drink) * 100 W% = (120 ounces / 300 ounces) * 100 W% = 0.4 * 100 W% = 40% Therefore, boxed{40%}  of the drink is watermelon juice."},{"instruction":"The ratio of (w) to (x) is (5:2), the ratio of (y) to (z) is (3:2), and the ratio of (z) to (x) is (1:4).

Prove that these parts cannot be equal figures.","output":"1. **Initial Setup**:     Let us consider a scalene triangle (ABC). We need to prove that the triangle cannot be divided into two equal parts. For simplicity, assume that the triangle is divided by a line segment (AD), intersecting side (BC) at point (D), resulting in two smaller triangles, (ABD) and (ADC). 2. **Case Analysis (Angle Equality)**:    Suppose the triangles (ABD) and (ADC) are equal in area and share a common vertex (A).    - **Case 1**: ( angle B = angle C )      - For ( angle B ) to be equal to ( angle C ), triangle (ABC) must be isosceles with (AB = AC). However, since (ABC) is a scalene triangle by hypothesis, this assumption leads to a contradiction. Hence, ( angle B neq angle C). 3. **Isosceles Triangle Condition**:        Suppose an isosceles triangle (ADC) is formed with (AD = DC).    - **Case 2**: ( angle CAD = angle ADB )      - If (AD) divides ( angle BAC ) such that ( angle CAD = angle ADB ), it implies that (AD = DC) because ( C widehat{A} = D widehat{A}). This means triangle (ADC) would be isosceles. Since (ADC) is given to be part of a scalene triangle (ABC), this again leads to a contradiction.        - **Case 3**: ( angle ABD = angle ADC )      - If ( angle ABD = angle ADC ), then (AB = AC), implying that (ABC) is not scalene, which again contradicts the given condition.  4. **Conclusion**:    In all possible cases where triangles (ABD) and (ADC) are assumed to be of equal area, we end up contradicting the initial condition that triangle (ABC) is scalene. Therefore, it is impossible for a scalene triangle to be divided into two equal triangles by a single line segment. Thus, it is proved that the two parts cannot be equal triangular figures when divided by a line segment in a scalene triangle.

Let f′(x)=0, then by the problem statement, we have ln x=2ax-1 with two solutions x_{1}, x_{2}. This is equivalent to saying that the function g(x)=ln x+1-2ax has exactly two zeros, which implies that the unique extremum of g'(x) in (0,+infty) is not equal to 0. Next, we compute the derivative of g(x), which is g'(x)= dfrac {1}{x}-2a= dfrac {1-2ax}{x}. 1. When aleqslant 0, we have g′(x) > 0, so f′(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, g(x)=f′(x) has at most one zero, which does not align with the problem statement, so this case should be discarded. 2. When a > 0, let g′(x)=0, and we find x= dfrac {1}{2a}. - For xin(0, dfrac {1}{2a}), g′(x) > 0, so the function g(x) is monotonically increasing. - For xin( dfrac {1}{2a},+infty), g′(x) < 0, so the function g(x) is monotonically decreasing. Thus, x= dfrac {1}{2a} is the maximum point of the function g(x), and g( dfrac {1}{2a}) > 0, which implies ln dfrac {1}{2a}+1-1=-ln (2a) > 0. Consequently, ln (2a) < 0, and so 0 < 2a < 1, or equivalently, 0 < a < dfrac {1}{2}. Hence, when 0 < a < dfrac {1}{2}, g(x)=0 has two roots, x_{1}, x_{2}, and x_{1} < dfrac {1}{2a} < x_{2}. Also, g(1)=1-2a > 0, which means x_{1} < 1 < dfrac {1}{2a} < x_{2}. Thus, the function f(x) is decreasing on the interval (0,x_{1}), increasing on (x_{1},x_{2}), and decreasing on (x_{2},+infty). Consequently, f(x_{1}) < f(1)=-a < 0, and f(x_{2}) > f(1)=-a > - dfrac {1}{2}. Therefore, the correct choice is boxed{D}. To solve this problem, we first find the derivative of the function and set it to zero. Then, we analyze the number of solutions to the resulting equation using the properties of the natural logarithm function.

This problem tests the ability to use derivatives to study function extremes and requires both reasoning and computational skills, making it a challenging question."},{"instruction":"Wendy bought some new chairs and 4 new tables for her house.

To maintain the same expenditure, the person will have to reduce his consumption to Y kg of sugar. The new expenditure will be: New Expenditure = New Price per kg * New Quantity New Expenditure = Rs. 7.50 * Y Since the person wants no increase in his expenditure on sugar, we can equate the initial expenditure to the new expenditure: Rs. 6 * X = Rs. 7.50 * Y Now, we need to find the value of Y in terms of X: Y = (Rs. 6 * X) / Rs. 7.50 Y = (6/7.5) * X Y = (4/5) * X Y = 0.8 * X This means the person will have to reduce his consumption to 80% of the initial consumption to maintain the same expenditure.

This implies that f(-x - 1) = -f(x - 1).  Also, since f(x) is even, we have f(-x) = f(x), which leads to f(-x - 1) = f(x + 1). From these equalities, we can deduce that f(x + 1) = -f(x - 1). Now let's consider the periodicity derived from this property. We can write: f((x - 1) + 4) = -f((x - 1) + 2) = f(x - 1). From this, we find that f(x + 4) = f(x), showing that the function f(x) has a period of 4. Given that f(x) is even before the shift and f(x - 1) is odd after the shift, for all x in mathbb{R}, we can assert that f(-1) = f(1) = f(3) = 0.

Since f(x) is periodic with a period of 4, we can pair up terms in the sequence that would result in zeros when summed; for instance, f(1) + f(3) = 0.

Now that we have f(2) = -1 and f(1) = f(3) = 0, the sum reduces to: 501 cdot (0 - 1 + 0 + 1) + 0 - 1 = -1.

To understand the change in the surface area of the pyramid with base ( L_{1} ) and apex moving along ( L_{2} ), we utilize symmetry about the perpendicular bisector planes of the edges ( A_{2} B_{2} ) and ( A_{2} D_{2} ). 3. Focus on the section where the apex ( M ) traverses between points ( E ) and ( F ), where ( E ) is the midpoint of ( A_{2} D_{2} ) and ( F ) is the midpoint of ( A_{2} B_{2} ). It's sufficient to restrict our analysis to the segment ( A_{2} F ); by swapping ( a ) and ( b ), the results for segment ( A_{2} E ) can be derived. 4. The base ( L_{1} ) remains constant, as do the lateral faces ( M A_{1} B_{1} ) and ( M C_{1} D_{1} ). Their areas remain constant since ( M ) moves parallel to ( A_{1} B_{1} ) and ( C_{1} D_{1} ). 5. Consider the varying areas of faces ( M A_{1} D_{1} ) and ( M B_{1} C_{1} ).

The combined area of these faces, ignoring the constant base ( L_{1} ), is: [ 2 times left( b times (A_{1} M + M B_{1}) right) ] where both faces meet at a right angle at ( A_{1} ) and ( B_{1} ), respectively. 7. Let ( A_{1} M + M B_{1} = A M + M B_{1} ). Considering the reflection of ( A_{1} ) across ( A_{2} B_{2} ) we get: [ A_{1} M + M B_{1} = A M + M B_{1} geqq A B_{1} = A F + F B_{1} = A_{1} F + F B_{1} ] Equality holds if ( M ) is precisely at ( F ). 8. If ( M ) is at any other point ( M' ) on ( A_{2} M ) segment with ( M neq F ) and ( A_{2} M < A_{2} F ), applying the triangle inequality: [ A_{1} M + M B_{1} < A M' + M' B_{1} = A_{1} M' + M' B_{1} ] Thus, the area increases as ( M ) moves from ( F ) towards ( A_{2} ). 9. To identify the absolute minimum area, compare values at points ( E ) and ( F ): [ begin{array}{ll} text{At } F: & ac + sqrt{a^2 b^2 + a^2 c^2} + sqrt{a^2 b^2 + 4b^2 c^2}  text{At } E: & bc + sqrt{a^2 b^2 + b^2 c^2} + sqrt{a^2 b^2 + 4a^2 c^2} end{array} ] The comparison requires further work, potentially using assumptions like ( a > b ). 10.

The discriminant Delta of the quadratic expression is given by: Delta = (m-1)^2 - 4(m+1)(3m-3) For the inequality to hold true for all x, Delta < 0.

Consider the polynomial ( P(x) = x^p + px^k + px^l + 1 ) where ( p ) is a prime number, ( p geq 5 ), and ( k > l ) with ( k, l in {1, 2, ldots, p-1} ). 2. To determine the irreducibility of ( P(x) ) in ( mathbb{Z}[x] ), we first apply the Rational Root Theorem. According to this theorem, if ( P(x) ) has a rational root, it must be an integer that divides the constant term, which is 1. Therefore, the possible rational roots are ( x = 1 ) and ( x = -1 ). 3. **Case 1: ( x = 1 )**    [    P(1) = 1^p + p cdot 1^k + p cdot 1^l + 1 = 1 + p + p + 1 = 2 + 2p    ]    Since ( p geq 5 ), ( 2 + 2p ) is clearly not zero.

Thus,    [    P(-1) = -1 + p(-1)^k + p(-1)^l + 1 = p(-1)^k + p(-1)^l    ]    For ( P(-1) ) to be zero, we need:    [    p(-1)^k + p(-1)^l = 0 implies (-1)^k + (-1)^l = 0    ]    This implies that ( (-1)^k ) and ( (-1)^l ) must be of opposite signs, i.e., ( k ) and ( l ) must have opposite parities (one is even and the other is odd). 5. We need to count the number of pairs ( (k, l) ) such that ( k ) and ( l ) have opposite parities. There are ( frac{p-1}{2} ) even numbers and ( frac{p-1}{2} ) odd numbers in the set ( {1, 2, ldots, p-1} ). 6.

Since ( k > l ), we need to consider the order of selection. For each pair ( (k, l) ) where ( k ) and ( l ) have opposite parities, there are two possible orders: ( (k, l) ) and ( (l, k) ).

Bobby started with 12 gallons of gasoline and ended with 2 gallons. This means he used 12 - 2 = 10 gallons of gasoline for all his trips. Since his truck consumes gasoline at a rate of 2 miles per gallon, the total distance he drove is 10 gallons * 2 miles/gallon = 20 miles. Now let's break down the trips he made: 1. He drove to a place (let's call it the supermarket) and back home. 2. He drove 6 miles to his farm but turned around after 2 miles, so he drove 2 + 2 = 4 miles before returning home. 3. He then drove back to the farm, which is 6 miles away. So the total distance for the trips to the farm is 4 miles (first attempt) + 6 miles (second attempt) = 10 miles. Since the total distance driven is 20 miles and the trips to the farm account for 10 miles, the remaining 10 miles must be the distance for the trip to the supermarket and back home. Let's call the distance from his home to the supermarket \\"D\\". Therefore, the distance to the supermarket and back home is 2D.

If it is Heads (F_4), FIF has occurred.    - P(A mid F_1 I_2 F_3) = 0, because FIF occurs at this point.    - P(A mid F_1 I_2 I_3) = P(A), similar to the case P(A mid I_1) as the situation restarts after the third toss. 4. **Apply the Law of Total Probability**:    The law of total probability allows us to combine these conditional probabilities:    [    P(A) = frac{1}{2} cdot P(A) + frac{1}{8} cdot 1 + frac{1}{8} cdot frac{1}{2} cdot P(A) + frac{1}{8} cdot 0 + frac{1}{8} cdot P(A)    ] 5. **Combine the Probabilities**:    Simplify the equation:    [    P(A) = frac{1}{2}P(A) + frac{1}{8} + frac{1}{16}P(A) + 0 + frac{1}{8}P(A)    ]    Combine like terms:    [    P(A) = left(frac{1}{2} + frac{1}{16} + frac{1}{8}right)P(A) + frac{1}{8}    ]    [    P(A) = frac{1}{2}P(A) + frac{1}{16}P(A) + frac{1}{8}P(A) + frac{1}{8}    ]    [    P(A) = left(frac{8}{16} + frac{1}{16} + frac{2}{16}right)P(A) + frac{1}{8}    ]    [    P(A) = left(frac{11}{16}right)P(A) + frac{1}{8}    ]    [    P(A) - frac{11}{16}P(A) = frac{1}{8}    ]    Factor out P(A):    [    left(1 - frac{11}{16}right)P(A) = frac{1}{8}    ]    Simplify:    [    left(frac{16}{16} - frac{11}{16}right)P(A) = frac{1}{8}    ]    [    left(frac{5}{16}right)P(A) = frac{1}{8}    ]    Solve for P(A):    [    P(A) = frac{1/8}{5/16} = frac{1}{8} cdot frac{16}{5} = frac{2}{5}    ] **Conclusion**: The probability that FFF will occur before FIF is  [ boxed{frac{2}{5}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the inverse proportion function y=frac{k}{x} passes through the point left(1,4right), which of the following statements is correct?

The number of redistributions (rakulachivaniya) is 7. 2. **After the First Redistribution**:    After the first redistribution, each peasant, except the one being stripped of half or more of their sheep, has a number of sheep that is an even number. To see why, note that the sheep are redistributed by taking equally from the peasant who is being \\"rakulached\\" and distributing them to others.    - Let the total number of sheep be T = 128.    - If peasant P is selected, and P has sheep S_P geq frac{T}{2}, then other peasants share equally from S_P. 3. **Observing Parity**:    Observe that during any redistribution, the resulting number of sheep each peasant has will always be even. Initially, the total number of sheep is even, and as each redistribution affects the parity among the remaining peasants, they maintain an even count. 4. **Iterating Over Multiple Redistributions**:    Since each redistribution results in even numbers, after the second redistribution, each of these even numbers is redistributed again.

Let's go through the detailed steps on how this example works.  1. **Establish Initial Conditions:**     Let (N = 2) and (M = 1008). We need to investigate whether adding (1008) multiple times to (2) will result in numbers maintaining the same digit sum properties. 2. **Understand the Modulo Operation:**     Notice that (M) is a multiple of (16) because (1008 div 16 = 63), which is an integer. Therefore, all the numbers resulting from adding (M) to (N) multiple times will have a decimal representation such that the sum of digits is ( equiv N pmod{16}). 3. **Sum Conservation in Modulo Operation:**     Since (N = 2), we must show if ((2 + k cdot 1008) ,text{mod}, 16) ever yields a digit sum adding the same as (N):     [     (2 + k cdot 1008) mod 16 implies 2 mod 16 = 2.     ] 4. **Possibilities for Sum of Digits:**     The numbers that we will generate are congruent to (2 mod 16). These numbers need to be explored for their digit sums. We need the digit sums to add up (2 mod 9) since the digit sum property remains true under modulo (9) for checking these sums against the base (N). 5. **Arithmetic and Powers of 10 Modulo 16:**     Consider digits' positions and place values in base 10:     [     begin{align*}     10^0 &equiv 1 mod 16,      10^1 &equiv 10 mod 16,      10^2 &equiv 4 mod 16,      10^3 &equiv 8 mod 16,      10^4 &equiv 1 mod 16, quad text{(repeats every 4 digits cycle)}.     end{align*}     ]     For resulting numbers in form (2 + k cdot 1008 ), potential sums are derived from combinations of place values. 6. **Determine if (2) Can Be Derived Differently:**     - Single digit derived sum (2) happens for number (2).      - (10 + 8 - 16 rightarrow 2) gives us another number (1010), which repeats every cycle due to modulo (16) behavior. Finally, since the viable digit sums retaining modulo condition are limited and do not fit broad ranges, hence recalculating while our scope remains within the digit modulus boundaries only yields repeating sequences of 2 and modular constraints concrete the conclusion not adding further variety besides (N) itself unaltered. **Conclusion:** Petya will not necessarily get other numbers with the same digit sum properties as (N = 2) beyond (N) or its exact computed cyclic repeat within digit sum invariance.

Since the man gained ( p ) on one flat and lost ( p ) on the other, the overall effect is not simply breaking even due to the nature of percentage gains and losses on different bases. The value gained on the first flat is ( 512456 times p ), and the value lost on the second flat is also ( 512456 times p ). However, when calculating the overall gain or loss, we need to consider that a percentage loss is more impactful than the same percentage gain.

The overall loss is given as 4.000000000000007. The equation for the overall transaction, taking into account the gain on the first flat and the loss on the second flat, is: [ 512456 + 512456 times p - (512456 - 512456 times p) = 512456 times (1 + p) - 512456 times (1 - p) = 512456 times 2 times p ] This should equal the overall loss of 4.000000000000007: [ 512456 times 2 times p = 4.000000000000007 ] Now we solve for ( p ): [ 1024912 times p = 4.000000000000007 ] [ p = frac{4.000000000000007}{1024912} ] [ p approx 3.9025 times 10^{-6} ] To express ( p ) as a percentage, we multiply by 100: [ p approx 3.9025 times 10^{-6} times 100 ] [ p approx 0.00039025% ] So the percentage gain and loss on the flats is approximately boxed{0.00039025%} ."},{"instruction":"Among all possible triangles (ABC) such that (BC = 2 sqrt[4]{3}) and (angle BAC = frac{pi}{3}), find the one with the maximum area.

Total original price = 300 (book) + 1200 (laptop) + 600 (smartphone) = 2100 Total new price = 420 (book) + 1080 (laptop) + 630 (smartphone) = 2130 The overall change in price = Total new price - Total original price Overall change in price = 2130 - 2100 = 30 The overall percentage change = (Overall change in price / Total original price) * 100 Overall percentage change = (30 / 2100) * 100 = 0.014285714 * 100 ≈ 1.43% So, the overall percentage increase for all three items combined is approximately boxed{1.43%} ."},{"instruction":"The values of a function g(x) are given in the table below. begin{tabular}{|c||c|c|c|c|c|} hline x & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5  hline g(x) & 4 & 3 & 1 & 5 & 2  hline end{tabular} If g^{1} exists, then what is g^{1}(g^{1}(g^{1}(3)))?","output":"First, identify g(2) = 3, so g^{-1}(3) = 2.

His savings at the end of a month are Rs. 1000, and his monthly salary is Rs. 5000. What percentage of his salary does Rohan spend on entertainment?","output":"Let's denote the percentage of Rohan's salary that he spends on entertainment as E%. From the information given, we know that Rohan spends: - 40% on food - 20% on house rent - 10% on conveyance - E% on entertainment His savings are what's left after all these expenses, which is Rs. 1000. The total percentage of his salary that is accounted for by expenses other than entertainment is 40% + 20% + 10% = 70%. Since his savings are Rs. 1000, this means that 100% - 70% = 30% of his salary is what he saves. Now, let's calculate 30% of his monthly salary: 30% of Rs. 5000 = (30/100) * 5000 = Rs. 1500 However, we know that his actual savings are Rs. 1000, not Rs. 1500. This means that the difference must be what he spends on entertainment. So, the amount spent on entertainment is Rs. 1500 (what should be saved) - Rs. 1000 (actual savings) = Rs. 500. Now, to find the percentage of his salary that he spends on entertainment, we calculate: E% of Rs. 5000 = Rs. 500 E% = (Rs. 500 / Rs. 5000) * 100% E% = (1/10) * 100% E% = 10% Therefore, Rohan spends boxed{10%}  of his salary on entertainment."},{"instruction":"f ( x = 5 ), what is the value of ( 3x + 4 )?","output":"1.

This can happen in two scenarios:    - x > 2: This is when x is to the right of 2 on the number line.    - x < -2: This is when x is to the left of -2 on the number line. 2. **Formulating the Conditions**: From the above explanation, we can write the conditions as:    - x > 2 or x < -2 3. **Comparing with the Given Options**:    - Option A: -2 < x < 2 does not satisfy the condition as it lies between -2 and 2, where the absolute value of x is not greater than 2.    - Option B: -4 < x leqslant -2 partially satisfies the condition for x < -2, but it does not cover x > 2.    - Option C: x > -2 includes values that do not satisfy |x| > 2 when x is between -2 and 2.    - Option D: x > 2 perfectly matches one part of the condition, but we need to remember that the full condition is x > 2 or x < -2. However, among the given options, only Option D directly corresponds to a part of the full condition. 4. **Conclusion**: Since we are looking for a sufficient and necessary condition within the given options, and considering the options provided, Option D (x > 2) is the closest match to a part of the full condition. However, it's important to note that the complete condition is x > 2 or x < -2.

( P_2 ) lies on the line perpendicular to ( P_1 P_3 ) through ( P_3 ). 2. The sequence ( P_4, P_5, P_6, ldots ) is defined inductively such that ( P_{n+1} ) is the foot of the perpendicular from ( P_n ) to the line ( P_{n-1} P_{n-2} ). 3. We must show that the sequence ({P_n}) converges to a point ( P ), and we must determine the locus of ( P ) as ( P_2 ) varies. 4. Consider any three consecutive points ( P_n, P_{n+1}, P_{n+2} ). Note that the triangle ( P_{n} P_{n+1} P_{n+2} ) lies inside the triangle ( P_{n-1} P_{n} P_{n+1} ).      5. Each subsequent triangle is nested within the previous one, and the size of the triangles shrinks to zero. Because each triangle is a closed set, there must be exactly one point ( P ) that is in the intersection of all these triangles. Hence, the sequence ( {P_n} ) converges to this point ( P ). 6. Because all the triangles ( P_{n} P_{n+1} P_{n+2} ) are similar (even if their vertices may not correspond in the same order), it implies that ( P ) must lie in a position relative to these triangles such that we can obtain one triangle from another by rotation and expansion about ( P ). 7. Consider the triangle ( P_1 P_2 P_3 ). The triangle ( P_5 P_4 P_6 ) should be similar to ( P_1 P_2 P_3 ), with ( P_4 P_5 ) parallel to ( P_1 P_2 ). Thus, the transformation involving rotation to achieve this must be through (pi), and consequently, ( P ) must lie on the line ( P_1 P_5 ). 8. Similarly, ( P_3 P_4 P_5 ) must be obtained from ( P_1 P_2 P_3 ) by rotation about ( P ) through an angle of ( pi/2 ) and expansion. This transformation implies that we rotate ( P_1 P_5 ) into a perpendicular line through ( P_3 ). 9. Since ( P_1 P ) is perpendicular to ( P_3 P ), ( P ) must lie on the circle with diameter ( P_1 P_3 ). 10. However, not all points on this circle are necessarily points of the locus. To find the exact location of ( P ), consider the geometry of the triangle forms:     [     P_3 P_5 = P_3 P_4 cos(alpha) = P_3 P_1 sin(alpha) cos(beta) = frac{1}{2} P_3 P_1 sin(2 alpha)     ]     Here, (alpha) and (beta) are specific angles determined by the configuration of points. 11.

However, when we try to form a triangle with a base of 2cm and the other two sides being 5cm each, this configuration does not satisfy the triangle inequality theorem. The theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the remaining side.

Therefore, this configuration is discarded. 2. **Second Configuration: Base is 5cm**    - In this case, the two equal sides are 2cm each. This configuration satisfies the triangle inequality theorem: 5cm < 2cm + 2cm does not hold, which is correct because the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the third side, and here, 2cm + 2cm > 5cm.

In some years, Richard will be twice as old as Scott. David was 9 years old 5 years ago. How many years older is David than Scott?","output":"Let's start by figuring out David's current age. If David was 9 years old 5 years ago, then David is now 9 + 5 = 14 years old. Now, let's denote Scott's current age as S and Richard's current age as R. We know that Richard is 6 years older than David, so we can write: R = D + 6 R = 14 + 6 R = 20 So, Richard is currently 20 years old. We are also told that in some years, Richard will be twice as old as Scott. Let's denote the number of years in the future when this will happen as Y. At that time, Richard will be R + Y years old, and Scott will be S + Y years old. The equation for this scenario is: R + Y = 2(S + Y) Now we can substitute the value of R we found earlier: 20 + Y = 2(S + Y) Let's solve for Y in terms of S: 20 + Y = 2S + 2Y 20 = 2S + Y Y = 20 - 2S Since we don't have enough information to determine the exact value of Y or S, we can't solve for Scott's age directly. However, we are asked to find out how many years older David is than Scott. We can denote the difference in their ages as D - S. Since David is currently 14 years old, we can write: D - S = 14 - S We know that David is older than Scott, so S must be less than 14. The exact age difference depends on the value of S, which we cannot determine with the given information. However, we can say that David is boxed{14}  - S years older than Scott, where S is Scott's current age, which is less than 14."},{"instruction":"Alice's brother baked 4 dozen cookies.

What is the ratio of the number of fish he gave his cat to the number he gave his dog?","output":"First, let's find out how many fish Keanu bought in total. Since he spent 240 and each fish cost 4, we can divide the total amount spent by the cost per fish: Total fish bought = Total amount spent / Cost per fish Total fish bought = 240 / 4 Total fish bought = 60 fish Now we know Keanu bought 60 fish in total. He gave his dog 40 fish. To find out how many fish he gave his cat, we subtract the number of fish given to the dog from the total number of fish: Fish for the cat = Total fish bought - Fish for the dog Fish for the cat = 60 fish - 40 fish Fish for the cat = 20 fish Now we can find the ratio of the number of fish given to the cat to the number given to the dog: Ratio (Cat:Dog) = Number of fish for the cat / Number of fish for the dog Ratio (Cat:Dog) = 20 fish / 40 fish Ratio (Cat:Dog) = 1/2 or 1:2 So the ratio of the number of fish Keanu gave his cat to the number he gave his dog is boxed{1:2} ."},{"instruction":"Given an arithmetic sequence {a_{n}} with the sum of its first n terms denoted as S_{n}, if S_{5}, S_{4}, and S_{6} form an arithmetic sequence, then the common ratio of the sequence {a_{n}}, denoted as q, is equal to (   ).

Each such graph can be seen as a cycle of two vertices connected by two edges. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for all graphs with fewer than ( m ) edges, where ( m ) is arbitrary.    1. Consider an arbitrary graph ( G ) where each vertex has an even degree and the number of edges is ( m ).    2. Start from any vertex in ( G ) and proceed along the edges without traversing any edge more than once, until you return to a previously visited vertex. Because each vertex has an even degree, you can continue this process until you form at least one cycle ( C ).    3. Remove all the edges that are part of cycle ( C ). The remaining graph ( G' ) will again be a graph where each vertex has an even degree, and now with fewer edges than ( G ).    4. By the induction hypothesis, ( G' ) can be decomposed into disjoint cycles.    5.

For a small graph, check manually for vertex pairings and possible cycles. 2. **Inductive Step**: Assume the statement is true for all graphs with fewer than ( m ) edges, where ( m ) is arbitrary.    1. Consider an arbitrary graph ( G ) where the number of vertices with odd degree is ( 2n ) and the number of edges is (m).    2. Select a vertex with odd degree and start a traversal, visiting each vertex exactly once till you hit another vertex with odd degree or form a cycle.        - **Case 1**: You form a cycle. Remove this cycle to form a new graph ( G' ) with fewer edges, maintaining the property of vertices with odd degree. By the induction hypothesis, decompose ( G' ) into ( n-1 ) paths and cycles.           - **Case 2**: You end up forming a path between two odd-degree vertices. Remove this path to form ( G' ) where the count of odd-degree vertices is reduced by 2. Again, apply the induction hypothesis to ( G' ). 3. In either case, the graph ( G ) is decomposed into disjoint cycles and ( n ) paths connecting pairs of vertices with odd degrees. **Conclusion**: Hence, the graph ( G ) can be decomposed into a union of disjoint cycles and ( n ) non-intersecting paths.
