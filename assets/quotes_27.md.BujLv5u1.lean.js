Movie title: Infernal Affairs II Movie plot: Act 1The film opens eleven years prior to Infernal Affairs in 1991. Inspector Wong Chi-Shing (Anthony Wong reprising his role) is discussing the death of his first partner with an initially unseen companion, who is revealed to be Hon Sam (Eric Tsang, also reprising), the triad boss from Infernal Affairs. At this point in time Sam is a follower in Ngai Kwun's triad family and is also working as Wong's informant. Carrying a nondescript paper bag, a young Lau Kin-Ming (Edison Chen) makes his way through the streets of Mongkok. Ming stops at an ostensible martial arts school where Ngai Kwun is spending the evening. With a gun concealed in his paper bag, Ming kills Kwun and walks away.Ming arrives at a secluded office space where Sams wife, Mary (Carina Lau), greets him. Mary is testing her new stereo system, playing the exact same song Ming used to test his system in Infernal Affairs; she sardonically praises it to Ming in the exact manner that Yan does in the first film while casually ascertaining whether or not he has any reservations about being Sams mole in the police force. Appearing aloof, Ming accepts the position and Mary packs a bag of cash for him, advising that he maintain a low profile and prepare for the police academy; assuming that the song she put on the stereo is distracting him, she also gives him a copy of it. Ming is attracted to Mary, but is unwilling to express it due to his lowly position in the gang. It is then revealed that Mary ordered Kwuns assassination. Mary confesses that Sam has no knowledge of this transgression and urges Ming to keep it that way, as she wants Sam to take Kwun's place as leader of Ngai family triad.Meanwhile, we see a young Chan Wing-Yan (Shawn Yue), his girlfriend and a young Crazy Keung (Chapman To) are waiting for something. Yan is a promising police cadet who has apparently assaulted and subdued Keung over a car theft. Superintendent Luk Kai-Cheung (Hu Jun) arrives on the scene with several officers.

Given the below context:  In 1999, Aaliyah landed her first film role in Romeo Must Die, released March 22, 2000. Aaliyah starred opposite martial artist Jet Li, playing a couple who fall in love amid their warring families. It grossed US18.6 million in its first weekend, ranking number two at the box office. Aaliyah purposely stayed away from reviews of the film to \\"make it easier on\\" herself, but she heard \\"that people were able to get into me, which is what I wanted.\\" In contrast, some critics felt there was no chemistry between her and Jet Li, as well as viewing the film was too simplistic. This was echoed by Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times, who wrote that while Aaliyah was \\"a natural\\" and the film was conceived as a spotlight for both her and Li, \\"they have so little chemistry together you'd think they're putting out a fire instead of shooting off sparks. Her role was well received by Glen Oliver by IGN who liked that she did not portray her character \\"as a victimized female\\" but instead \\"as a strong female who does not come across as an over-the-top Women's Right Advocate.\\" In addition to acting, Aaliyah served as an executive producer of the film's soundtrack, where she contributed four songs. \\"Try Again\\" was released as a single from the soundtrack; the song topped the Billboard Hot 100, making Aaliyah the first artist to top the chart based solely on airplay; this led the song to be released in a 12\\" vinyl and 7\\" single. The music video won the Best Female Video and Best Video from a Film awards at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. It also earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Female R&B Vocalist.

Dennis Burdens, who wrote an article, tells us that he once saw a UFO himself. He was having dinner one night with a friend near Tripoli, Libya, and after dinner the two men walked across a yard to his room to look at some papers. Burdens noticed that the moon looked strange that night. \\"It wasn't the moon,\\" was the reply. They watched the light and saw that it was moving. It seemed to be an object rather like a big plate. In some ways it looked like smoke with a light on it, but it wasn't smoke because it didn't change its shape. It was moving in a regular way. That is to say, it didn't go suddenly faster or more slowly, and it didn't go higher or lower. So the two men decided that there must be men in it. After that, Burdens said that he felt eyes looking at him. He was being watched in the darkness. When it was nearer, they noticed that the bottom parts were brighter than the top. The bottom was yellow and the top red. Then the object suddenly turned away and left Libya, moving very fast.

How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's.

Question: \\"What philosophy was founded by a man of whom the Athenians set up a gold statue?\\"  Context: \\"The Epicureans and the Cynics rejected public offices and civic service, which amounted to a rejection of the polis itself, the defining institution of the Greek world. Epicurus promoted atomism and an asceticism based on freedom from pain as its ultimate goal. Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos. Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court. The philosophical schools of Aristotle (the Peripatetics of the Lyceum) and Plato (Platonism at the Academy) also remained influential. The academy would eventually turn to Academic Skepticism under Arcesilaus until it was rejected by Antiochus of Ascalon (c. 90 BCE) in favor of Neoplatonism. Hellenistic philosophy, had a significant influence on the Greek ruling elite. Examples include Athenian statesman Demetrius of Phaleron, who had studied in the lyceum; the Spartan king Cleomenes III who was a student of the Stoic Sphairos of Borysthenes and Antigonus II who was also a well known Stoic. This can also be said of the Roman upper classes, were Stoicism was dominant, as seen in the Meditations of the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and the works of Cicero.\\"  Answer:","output":"The philosophy founded by a man of whom the Athenians set up a gold statue is Stoicism. This man is Zeno of Citium.  Step 1: Identify the relevant context in the passage. In this passage, several philosophies and their founders are mentioned, including the Epicureans, Cynics, Cyrenaics, Stoicism, Peripatetics, Platonism, and Academic Skepticism. The passage also describes the cultural and political impact of these philosophies in the Greek and Roman world.  Step 2: Locate the specific detail about the gold statue. The text states, \\"Zeno became extremely popular, the Athenians set up a gold statue of him and Antigonus II Gonatas invited him to the Macedonian court.\\" This information indicates that Zeno of Citium, who founded Stoicism, was the man whom the Athenians honored with a gold statue. Step 3: Verify that this is the correct philosophy. As no other philosophy or founder mentioned in the passage is associated with a gold statue, we can conclude that Stoicism is the correct answer to the question.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Whose girlfriend was left crippled by her drunken father? from the following article ?  In 1955 in Portland, Oregon, a businessman finds his wife in bed with another man, and commits a double murder-suicide. His young son, Paul, witnesses the three deaths, and is traumatized. Twenty-five years later, in 1980, Paul is incarcerated at a psychiatric institution near Stanford Bay, a small town on the Oregon Coast. One day, Paul manages to murder an orderly, and subsequently retrieves a beloved wooden flute given to him by his father before escaping the institution. Local teenager Marion is struggling to adjust to her disability—she survived a car accident several years prior, caused by her drunken father Frank, which left her unable to walk without the help of a leg brace. She is plagued by bizarre dreams, which she comes to discover are in fact premonitions; while in the hospital after her accident, she received a blood transfusion from Paul, which has given her extrasensory perception into Paul's actions. Marion's home life is troubled, with her father being verbally abusive to her and her mother, Bea, and she dreams of leaving Stanford Bay once her fisherman boyfriend, Joey, obtains a job in Portland. Meanwhile, Paul hitchhikes with a truck driver whom he bludgeons to death with a hatchet, and then steals his vehicle. He subsequently picks up a female hitchhiker, who he brings to a local motel in Stanford Bay, and murders her after failing to charm her with his flute-playing. Marion's psychic visions of Paul's murders increase in frequency and intensity, and sh soon witnesses him in person disposing of a body on a rural beach, making her his next target. Marion manages to elude to Paul, but he later discovers where she lives, and infiltrates her home, killing Frank. Struggling to walk, Marion manages to flee her home to an adjacent sawmill, and is pursued by Paul. While chasing Marion, Paul impales a worker with a forklift, and then inadvertently crashes through a barrier, driving the forklift off the pier and into the bay.

After meeting a new friend Pudge, Danny is selected by agent Farley Wink to feature in a film called the Li'l Ark Angel that is in production alongside a white cat named Sawyer at Mammoth Studios. Upon joining fellow animals; Tillie, Cranston, Frances, and T.W., Danny is dismayed on learning how minor his role is and tries to weasel his way into more time in the spotlight. Danny winds up angering Darla Dimple, a popular, extremely spoiled child actress and star of the film, so she assigns her Valet Max to intimidate Danny into no longer trying to enlarge his part. Danny learns from the studio's mascot Woolie that human actors are normally given more important roles than animals; a fact that none of them are very happy with but know they must accept. He longs for the spotlight and tries to make a plan that will encourage humans to provide animal actors with better scenarios â such as by assembling a massive cluster of animals and putting on a musical performance for the humans. Later, Danny is given advice by Darla (while masking her true villainous nature with a sweet one as she always does) through song on how to interest and satisfy audiences. He takes this information to heart and groups the animals for an audition on the Ark in hopes of attracting the humans' attention. However, Darla, fearing that the animals are jeopardizing her spotlight, has Max help her flood the stage, while L.B. Mammoth the head of Mammoth Studios, and Flanagan the film's director, is giving an interview, getting the animals blame and fired. The animals are depressed at being barred from acting in Mammoth Studios (especially Danny who was convinced by Darla that she was trying to help the animals).

Let's break down and analyze its meaning in a detailed manner to support this conclusion. The phrase usually refers to a situation or an experience which is so engrossing and engaging that it captivates the attention of the participants or observers for extended periods. It suggests that the content is intense, suspenseful, or evoking strong emotions, making people feel fully involved and eager to know what happens next. In this sense, it highlights the thrilling and exciting aspects of the described situation. Using the phrase in the context of movies, books, or performances, for instance, would imply a work of art that holds the viewer's or reader's attention, arousing their curiosity and keeping them absorbed throughout its duration. This would typically be seen as a positive attribute, as people generally appreciate and seek experiences that offer excitement, surprise, and engrossing entertainment. However, it is essential to acknowledge that whether the phrase is perceived as positive or negative is somewhat subjective and dependent on the individual's viewpoint. Some people might find being \\"at the edge of their seat\\" uncomfortable or nerve-wracking, preferring calmer, more laid-back forms of entertainment or experiences. In that case, the phrase could be perceived as negative, based on personal preferences. Overall, given the general appreciation of engaging and thrilling experiences by a majority of people, the phrase \\"that will have you at the edge of your seat for long stretches\\" is mostly considered positive. It serves as a testament to the captivating, suspenseful, and immersive nature of the experience, making it appealing to those who appreciate such feelings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but  Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by  Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with  Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000,  Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to  Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.  Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Plotting terror attacks\\" correctly answer the question \\"What roles did  Bin Laden, Khallad, and Nashiri have in al Qaeda?\\"?","output":"Yes, the response \\"Plotting terror attacks\\" does correctly answer the question \\"What roles did Bin Laden, Khallad, and Nashiri have in al Qaeda?\\". However, it lacks nuance and detail. Each person had a significant role in the organization and operations of al Qaeda, and those roles extended beyond merely \\"plotting terror attacks\\". The response gives an impression of them generally but doesn't delve into their specific roles that were clearly laid out in the text. Bin Laden was not just planning attacks – he was the leader who had overarching control of the operations. He selected the targets, chose the location of the attacks, picked the suicide operatives, and provided the necessary funding for the purchase of explosives and equipment. He also had the power to intervene in the selection process of the operatives, as seen when he instructed Nashiri to replace the initially chosen suicide operatives. Khallad and Nashiri, on the other hand, were operational coordinators. Khallad was involved in the attack on the USS Cole, assisting in Yemen until his arrest and subsequent release. Nashiri was more essentially involved, acting as the field commander. He managed the operation on the ground in Yemen, demonstrating a unique influence in the organization when he defied Bin Laden's suggestion to change the suicide operatives. In addition to just \\"plotting terror attacks\\", Bin Laden, Khallad, and Nashiri played vital roles in strategic decision-making, oversight, and operational management within al Qaeda. They demonstrated leadership, defiance, and resistance in their respective 'duties', which contributed to the overall operational 'success' of al Qaeda's heinous activities. Thus, a more detailed and accurate answer to the question \\"What roles did Bin Laden, Khallad, and Nashiri have in al Qaeda?\\" would be \\"Strategic planning, operational coordination, and leadership in terror attacks and other activities.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the question \\"How many dollars a day did Arthur Frommer say you could get by on in Europe in 1968 ?\\" asking about an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric entity?","output":"The question \\"How many dollars a day did Arthur Frommer say you could get by on in Europe in 1968?\\" is asking about a numeric entity. In this context, the numeric entity refers to the specific dollar amount that Arthur Frommer mentioned as the daily budget one could survive on while traveling in Europe in 1968. Arthur Frommer is a well-known American travel writer and publisher of guidebooks who critically shaped the world of modern travel with his works. In 1957, Frommer published his first travel guide, \\"Europe on 5 Dollars a Day,\\" which became an instant bestseller and a gamechanger for budget travel. He continued to release updated editions throughout the years, and each edition captured the recommended budget for that specific time. The question aims to determine the suggested daily budget for a traveler in Europe in 1968 according to Frommer's guidebook. Essentially, it seeks to learn a numerical value, or the dollar amount, to answer the query. This is why the question concerns a numeric entity."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Don't play a machine that only has a right and forward button, when you've pressed and released each button once the claw will drop without you getting the chance to adjust. Look for one with a joystick and a \\"drop\\" button. When selecting the toy you think you can get, put aside the toy you really want but is trapped. There are ways to enhance the chances you'll get something from the machine:  Close in on a toy that is on top of the pile. If it has an arm or tail trapped under another toy, it won't come up, so avoid that one. The claw is strong enough to lift a toy, but not to un-wedge one.  Consider the shape of the toy. Avoid choosing round toys as the claw will probably slip on the toy. Choose toys with features that allow the claw to have a better grip, like a doll with large pigtails.  Pay attention to how far the claw-track reaches––toys against the glass are a no-go. Stand in front of the machine to do left-right, but stand beside the machine to do forward-back. The mirror that's in most machines screws up depth perception.  Some claws drift left or right, some rotate and change the position of the prongs. \\" You probably didn't get it.  If the prongs didn't close or let go of the animal without lifting it, stop immediately because the machine is broken or rigged. If the claw grabbed the toy, then dropped it, try again.

If it's the toy you're after, you can probably get a very similar, better-made toy for 5-10 dollars at a box store or the mall. If you have spent two dollars, seriously evaluate whether it's worth it and whether the machine works.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who released three instrumental albums, Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar? is inside the article: In 1980, Zappa cut his ties with record distributor Phonogram after the label refused to release his song \\"I Don't Wanna Get Drafted\\". It was picked up by CBS Records and released on the Zappa label in the United States and Canada, and by the CBS label internationally.After spending much of 1980 on the road, Zappa released Tinsel Town Rebellion in 1981. It was the first release on his own Barking Pumpkin Records, and it contains songs taken from a 1979 tour, one studio track and material from the 1980 tours. The album is a mixture of complicated instrumentals and Zappa's use of sprechstimme (speaking song or voice)—a compositional technique utilized by such composers as Arnold Schoenberg and Alban Berg—showcasing some of the most accomplished bands Zappa ever had (mostly featuring drummer Vinnie Colaiuta). While some lyrics still raised controversy among critics, some of whom found them sexist, the political and sociological satire in songs like the title track and \\"The Blue Light\\" have been described as a \\"hilarious critique of the willingness of the American people to believe anything\\". The album is also notable for the presence of guitarist Steve Vai, who joined Zappa's touring band in late 1980.The same year the double album You Are What You Is was released. Most of it was recorded in Zappa's brand new Utility Muffin Research Kitchen (UMRK) studios, which were located at his house, thereby giving him complete freedom in his work. The album included one complex instrumental, \\"Theme from the 3rd Movement of Sinister Footwear\\", but mainly consisted of rock songs with Zappa's sardonic social commentary—satirical lyrics directed at teenagers, the media, and religious and political hypocrisy. \\"Dumb All Over\\" is a tirade on religion, as is \\"Heavenly Bank Account\\", wherein Zappa rails against TV evangelists such as Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson for their purported influence on the U.S. administration as well as their use of religion as a means of raising money. Songs like \\"Society Pages\\" and \\"I'm a Beautiful..., can you guess it ? Answer:","output":"The first name of the person who released the three instrumental albums, Shut Up 'n Play Yer Guitar, Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar Some More, and The Return of the Son of Shut Up 'N Play Yer Guitar, is Frank.

Answer:","output":"To find the appropriate category for \\"Mount Mourne Plantation,\\" I will begin by analyzing the keywords and context.

The preceding term \\"Mount Mourne\\" could be the name of the location where the plantation is situated. Step 2: Eliminating irrelevant categories - The keywords do not suggest it to be a company, athlete, album, film, office holder, or animal. These categories can be eliminated. - It is not a plant, but a place associated with plants, which also eliminates that category. - The term \\"plantation\\" is not indicative of an artist, educational institution, or means of transportation, so these categories are also eliminated. Step 3: Evaluating the remaining categories - Building: A plantation could have buildings on its premises, but \\"Mount Mourne Plantation\\" refers to the entire site rather than a specific structure. - Natural place: A plantation is generally a cultivated area that combines human-made and natural elements. - Village: A plantation might have a community of workers and their families living on or near the site.

Carbon monoxide is used in product A's packaging to react with the myoglobin in the meat, helping it retain a bright red color and giving the meat a fresher appearance. Step 2: Determine the impact of carbon monoxide in Product A. Since carbon monoxide helps the meat retain a fresher appearance, the meat in product A's packaging is more likely to look fresher.

Solve t - 15 = -17 for t.","output":"The solution for the equation t - 15 = -17 for t involves simplifying the equation to isolate t (the variable) on one side. The first step is to get rid of the subtraction of 15 on the left side of the equation. To do this, we will execute the opposite operation to a subtraction, which is an addition. We need to add 15 to both sides of the equation to maintain the balance. So: t - 15 + 15 = -17 + 15 This simplifies to: t = -17 + 15 We then perform the addition operation on the right side of the equation: t = -2 So, the solution to the equation t - 15 = -17 is t = -2.  This means if we substitute -2 for t in the original equation, it will satisfy the equation. Let's check that: -2 - 15 = -17  Yes, that's correct.  So, the value t = -2 is indeed the solution to the equation t - 15 = -17. The method we've used to find this is called the addition/subtraction method for solving simple one-step algebraic equations. This method essentially involves executing mathematical procedures to isolate the variable on one side of the equation and the constant on the other side. Once the variable is isolated, we can determine its value, which represents the solution to the equation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: Christians need to confront feelings of embarrassment, shame and disgust over homosexuality, the archbishop of Canterbury has said.      In one of his strongest interventions yet on an issue that lies at the heart of some of the deepest divisions in the church he leads, Dr Rowan Williams said the church was still \\"scratching its head\\" about its position on same-sex marriage.      He was speaking at an event involving Christian teenagers at Lambeth Palace, his official residence in London, which was entitled \\"Help, my friends think I'm mad\\" and where some of the discussion focused on how Anglicanism was viewed from without.      Dr Williams also turned to the question of women bishops, which is due to be considered by the Church of England's general synod next week, saying it was another issue that gave the impression that sex was \\"the only thing the church is interested in\\".      The Daily Telegraph reported him as saying: \\"Same with same-sex marriage, where once more we're used to being alongside people who are gay; many of our friends may be – indeed we may be – wrestling with that issue ourselves, and the church is scratching its head and trying to work out where it is on all that, and what to think about it.      \\"What's frustrating is that we still have Christian people whose feelings about it are so strong, and sometimes so embarrassed and ashamed and disgusted, that that just sends out a message of unwelcome, of lack of understanding, of lack of patience.      \\"So whatever we think about it, we need, as a church, to be tackling what we feel about it.\\"      The archbishop's comments come after the Church of England was criticised this month by gay rights campaigners for delivering an uncompromising warning to the government against pressing ahead with a controversial proposal to legalise gay marriage.      Introducing same-sex marriage could lead to the church being forced out of its role of conducting weddings on behalf of the state, the church claimed in a submission in response to the government's consultation on gay marriage.      The National Secular Society on Tuesday published a legal opinion it obtained in response to the church's submission. The opinion, which has been written by barrister and human rights expert Dr Ronan McCrea and sent to equalities minister Lynne Featherstone, said the church's failure to distinguish between social, religious and legal institutions of marriage \\"confuses the issues\\".      McCrea also takes issue with the claim that a challenge to the prohibition on religious bodies performing same sex marriages may be successfully challenged in the European Court of Human Rights. ||||| The Church of England was accused of carrying out a \\"masterclass in melodramatic scaremongering\\" as it delivered an uncompromising warning to the government against pressing ahead with a controversial proposal to legalise gay marriage.      Introducing same-sex marriage could lead to the church being forced out of its role of conducting weddings on behalf of the state, the CofE claimed in a potentially explosive submission in response to the government's consultation on gay marriage, which closes on Thursday.      Ben Summerskill, chief executive of Stonewall, which campaigns for gay rights, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \\"Many bishops in the Church of England today will be rather pleased because once again they are not talking about global poverty or the HIV pandemic - they are talking about the subject that obsesses them, and that is sex.      \\"I have not come across such a masterclass in melodramatic scaremongering – that somehow this is the biggest upheaval since the sacking of the monasteries – since as a journalist myself a decade ago I was summoned to a government briefing to be told about weapons of mass destruction in Iraq.\\"      He said Stonewall would be publishing its major five-yearly polling of public attitudes on Tuesday, showing that between 80-85% of people in the UK under the age of 50 support extending the legal form of marriage to gay people – and three in five - 60% of people of faith in modern Britain – say gay people should be able to get married.      The church submission's warning of a potential clash between canon law – that marriage is between a man and a woman – and parliament is likely to put pressure on the prime minister, David Cameron, who has spoken out in support of gay marriage and already come under fire from supporters of the proposals for allowing a free vote among Tory MPs.      In a 13-page submission, the church says it cannot support the proposal to enable all couples, regardless of their gender, to have a civil marriage ceremony.      \\"Such a move would alter the intrinsic nature of marriage as the union of a man and a woman, as enshrined in human institutions throughout history,\\" it says.      \\"Marriage benefits society in many ways, not only by promoting mutuality and fidelity, but also by acknowledging an underlying biological complementarity which, for many, includes the possibility of procreation.\\"      The Rt Rev Tim Stevens, bishop of Leicester, speaking on the same programme, conceded there were \\"some grounds\\" for saying the Church of England obsesses about sex.      \\"I rather sympathise with that statement but I don't think this is anything to do with obsessing about sex,\\" he said.      \\"I think this is the church trying to uphold our traditional teachings and understanding about marriage and trying to avoid a sudden and rapid redefinition of marriage for everybody at a time when many marriages are in difficulties and where it is very unlikely that, within just a few weeks, a universally acceptable new definition of a fundamental social institution can emerge.\\"      The bishop of Sheffield, the Rt Rev Steven Croft, said the government proposals represented a fundamental change to a very important social institution.      \\"Whilst this is being presented as a kind of minor extension to what marriage means, actually, from the point of view of the church and of society, it is a really, really fundamental change to an institution which has been at the core of our society for hundreds of years and which for the church is not a matter of social convention but of Christian doctrine and teaching,\\" he told BBC Breakfast.      \\"One in four marriages in England are performed by the Church of England and that proportion is rising at the moment.      \\"In every marriage service the priest begins the service by spelling out what marriage is - a union between one man and one woman with the intention of it being lifelong.      \\"So it is really important to register back to the government that this is not a minor change, this is a fundamental change to a very, very important social institution.\\"      The controversy comes at a particularly delicate time for the church, which is in the middle of a process that will choose a new archbishop of Canterbury later this year to replace Dr Rowan Williams.      Internal debates on gay rights have been particularly heated during his tenure as he struggled to balance the CofE's own factions at the same time as holding together the disparate worldwide Anglican communion of 80 million members.      The church's submission warns that despite ministerial assurances that churches would not have to conduct gay marriages, it would be \\"very doubtful\\" whether limiting same-sex couples to non-religious ceremonies would withstand a challenge at the European court of human rights.      This could make it impossible for the CofE to continue its role conducting marriages on behalf of the state, it warned.      Under the current law, anyone who is resident in England has a legal right to marry in his or her CofE parish church irrespective of religious affiliation. Around a quarter of weddings in England take place in CofE churches.      The church position as set out in the submission, which notes the CofE's \\"unique position\\" in relation to the performing of marriage ceremonies, potentially raises the prospect of the biggest rupture between the state and the Church of England since it became the established church 500 years ago.      It claims the proposals would redefine institution of marriage in English law, warning: \\"At the very least that raises new and as yet unexplored questions about the implications for the current duties which English law imposes on clergy of the established church.\\"      Complaining that several major elements of the government's proposals had not been thought through and were not legally sound, the church said introducing gay marriage could also lead to challenges to civil partnership law, as removing the concept of gender from marriage while leaving it in place for civil partnerships would be unlikely to be \\"legally sustainable\\".      A Home Office spokesman said: \\"The purpose of the equal civil marriage consultation is to enable us to listen to all views, including those of all religions.      \\"Marriage is one of the most important institutions we have. It binds us together, it brings stability, and it makes this country stronger. We have been clear that no religious organisation will be forced to conduct same-sex marriages as a result of our proposals.      \\"We welcome the Church of England's response and we will be carefully considering all points of view before publishing the outcome of the consultation later in the year.\\" ||||| Dr Rowan Williams acknowledged that the Church was still “scratching its head” about where it stands on issues like same-sex marriage despite its vocal public opposition to the Government’s plan to legalise it.      In his most frank public comments to date on the subject, the Archbishop accepted that the Church was in a “tangle” over homosexuality.      On one hand many Christians may themselves be “wrestling” with their own sexuality while others appeared to display only strong feelings of revulsion, he said.      The issue of women bishops – due to come to a head at the Church of England’s General Synod in York next week – was another matter which helped give the impression that sex was “the only thing the Church is interested in”, he remarked.      His comments came during a discussion day for a group of Christian teenagers at Lambeth Palace.      The event – entitled “Help, my friends think I'm mad” – included discussions about how the Church is viewed by the outside world.      Acknowledging that many people view Christians as “weird, “mad” and “primitive” he told them: “As somebody who doesn’t spend all his time with other Christians, I’m quite conscious too of the fact that people think that I’m weird and we’re weird.”      He acknowledged frankly that the attempts he has supported to find a compromise between traditionalists and supporters of women bishop had left the Church mired “in the middle of quite a lot of tangles”.      He added: “Same with same sex marriage, where once more we’re used to being alongside people who are gay; many of our friends may be – indeed we may be – wrestling with that issue ourselves, and the Church is scratching its head and trying to work out where it is on all that, and what to think about it.      “What’s frustrating is that we still have Christian people whose feelings about it are so strong, and sometimes so embarrassed and ashamed and disgusted, that that just sends out a message of unwelcome, of lack of understanding, of lack of patience.      “So whatever we think about it, we need, as a Church, to be tackling what we feel about it.”      It came as the National Secular Society published a legal opinion it had obtained on the Church of England's recent submission on same-sex marriage, which suggested it could be a step towards disestablishment.      The barrister Dr Ronan McCrea said the Church had “confused the issues\\" failing to distinguish between social, religious and legal aspects of marriage.      The forthcoming Synod meeting had been expected to see an historic final vote on ordaining women bishops.      But following a last-minute concession to traditionalists, key campaigners for the change have now withdrawn their support believing it is a compromise-too-far.      It is likely that the debate will be postponed ahead of a special emergency Synod gahering in November.      Dr Williams said he was “very committed” to having women bishops but openly acknowledged that it might not be possible to get agreement.      “I share the frustration of a lot of people that we’re tangled-up in trying to get the maximum support for it in the Church of England and every move in one direction makes other people move away,\\" he said.      “It’s like one of those terrible games you get in Christmas crackers sometimes where you have to get the little silver balls into holes – you always get two of them but then the other one goes off somewhere else.” |||||","output":"The archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Rowan Williams, has stated that Christians need to confront feelings of embarrassment, shame, and disgust over homosexuality.

He named the house, which was completed in 1802, the \\"Grange\\" after his grandfather Alexander's estate in Ayrshire, Scotland. The house remained in the family until 1833 when his widow sold it to Thomas E. Davis, a British born real estate developer, for 25,000.

The Grange, first moved from its original location in 1889, was moved again in 2008 to a spot in St. Nicholas Park on land that was once part of the Hamilton estate, in Hamilton Heights, a neighborhood in upper Manhattan. The historic structure was restored to its original 1802 appearance in 2011, and is maintained by the National Park service as Hamilton Grange National Memorial.

Options: a ) 25 , b ) 35 , c ) 45 , d ) 55 , e ) 20 A:","output":"To solve this problem, we will use the definition of average speed, which is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. Let the total distance between town X and town Y be D.  We are given that the car traveled 80% of the distance at an average speed of 80 mph. So, the distance covered in this part is 0.8D and the time taken for this part is (0.8D/80). For the remaining 20% of the distance, the car traveled at an average speed of v mph. So, the distance covered in this part is 0.2D and the time taken for this part is (0.2D/v). The average speed for the entire trip is 50 mph. Thus, Average speed = Total distance / Total time 50 = D / (Time for the first part + Time for the second part) 50 = D / ((0.8D/80) + (0.2D/v)) Now, we need to solve this equation for v. Cross-multiplying, we get: 50((0.8D/80) + (0.2D/v)) = D Divide both sides by D: 50(0.8/80 + 0.2/v) = 1 Simplify and solve for v: 50(0.01 + 0.2/v) = 1 0.5 + 10/v = 1 Subtract 0.5 from both sides: 10/v = 0.5 Now, multiply both sides by v: 10 = 0.5v Finally, divide both sides by 0.5 to get the value of v: v = 10/0.5 = 20 mph So, the average speed for the remaining part of the trip, v = 20 mph.

Question: What is the biological purpose of eating breakfast? - halitosis - fullness - overeating - gas - gain energy  The best answer is Answer:","output":"The best answer is: gain energy. The biological purpose of eating breakfast is primarily to replenish the body's energy stores after an overnight fast and provide the necessary fuel for both mental and physical activities throughout the day. During sleep, the body undergoes various restorative processes, including muscle repair and memory consolidation. It relies on stored energy in the form of glycogen to maintain vital functions during this time. When you wake up, your glycogen stores are depleted, and eating breakfast helps to replenish them. Breakfast is particularly important for brain function because the brain relies heavily on glucose, the main form of energy derived from food, for its normal functioning. Consuming a balanced breakfast that includes complex carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats provides sustained energy release, helping to maintain focus and concentration throughout the day. Furthermore, a well-balanced breakfast may also help prevent overeating later in the day. When people skip breakfast, they may feel hungrier later on and be more prone to consuming larger portions or choosing unhealthy foods, which may lead to weight gain and other health issues.

Question: How did the mutal respect between Vianee and  Reynaud happen? Movie title: Chocolat Movie plot: Vianne Rocher (Juliette Binoche), an expert chocolatier, drifts across Europe with her daughter Anouk (Victoire Thivisol). In the winter of 1959, they travel to a tranquil French village that closely adheres to tradition, as led by the village mayor, Comte Paul de Reynaud (Alfred Molina). Vianne opens a Chocolaterie just as the villagers begin observing the forty days of Lent, much to the chagrin of Reynaud. Vianne, who wears more provocative clothing, does not go to church, and has an illegitimate child, does not fit in well with the town's people, but is nevertheless optimistic about her business. Her friendly and alluring nature begins to win the villagers over one by one, causing Reynaud to openly speak against her for tempting the people during a time of abstinence and self-denial.One of the first to fall under the spell of Vianne and her confections is Armande (Judi Dench), her elderly, eccentric landlady. Armande laments that her cold, devoutly pious daughter Caroline (Carrie-Anne Moss) will not let Armande see her grandson Luc because Caroline thinks Armande is a \\"bad influence\\". Vianne arranges for Luc and his grandmother to see each other in the chocolaterie, where they develop a close bond. Caroline later reveals to Vianne that her mother is a diabetic, though Armande continues to indulge in the chocolate despite her condition.Vianne also develops a friendship with a troubled woman, Josephine (Lena Olin), who is a victim of brutal beatings by her alcoholic husband Serge (Peter Stormare). After a particularly brutal blow to the head, Josephine leaves her husband and moves in with Vianne and Anouk.

The answer is:","output":"The mutual respect between Vianne and Reynaud developed gradually throughout the movie \\"Chocolat.\\" Initially, Reynaud is quite opposed to Vianne's presence in the village, seeing her Chocolaterie and unconventional behavior as a threat to the town's traditional values.

For general information: visit-oahu.com or gohawaii.com By Laura Bly, USA TODAY HONOLULU  Along with the catchy theme song and star 's pompadour (a sculpted marvel that consistently escaped the ravages of 's trade winds), an iconic element of the popular '70s cop drama was Lord's weekly command to his deputy: \\"Book 'em, Danno.\\" Planeloads of entranced Americans followed suit, booking passage to what was still considered an exotic, far-flung destination. The series proved so influential that Lord, who moved to Honolulu for the show's 12-year run and lived there until his death in 1998, was considered the Aloha State's de facto tourism ambassador and is immortalized in bronze at the city's Kahala Mall. Fast-forward four decades, and a shot-on-location reboot of the original show is making its own waves as part of Honolulu's re-energized tourist scene. Visitor arrivals resurge after a plunge The new Hawaii Five-0, which launched on CBS this week after a premiere on Waikiki's Queen's Surf Beach, is among more than a dozen projects propelling the local film and TV industry to a record-setting year: an estimated 347 million in production spending, plus an economic afterglow as viewers transform increased awareness into plane tickets. \\"You can't argue with Hawaii being front and center in people's living rooms,\\" says Georja Skinner, administrator for the state's creative division, which oversees the Hawaii Film Office. While the popular series Lost ended its six-year run in May, other high-profile projects filmed on Oahu and its neighbor islands this year include Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides and Hawaii-centric The Descendants,starring George Clooney. The spike in cameras coincides with a boost in tourism after the worst economic plunge since Hawaii became a state in 1959. Buoyed by increased air service from the West Coast, a strong Japanese yen and a reinvigorated convention and meeting business, Honolulu — the winner of USA TODAY's \\"Best American Destinations\\" reader sweepstakes this year — has led the state's recovery. The most recent Hawaii Tourism Authority figures show visitor spending and arrivals up for eight consecutive months over 2009. The manager of beach activities at Honolulu's Hilton Hawaiian Village says he catered to long lines of customers this summer — many of them booking paddleboard lessons in the resort's recently restored Duke Paoa Kahanamoku Lagoon. \\"I think people are tired of sulking in a corner and being bummed out,\\" declares the Hilton's Ryan Roth. \\"Instead of sticking their money in a 401(k), where they're going to lose it anyway, they figure, why not blow some of it in Hawaii?\\" Aloha to a Schrager boutique hotel A few doors down from the Hilton overlooking the Ala Wai marina, workers scurry to put the finishing touches on Honolulu's latest attempt to part tourists from their cash: the Waikiki Edition, the first entry in a new boutique lodging brand created by hip hotelier Ian Schrager (of Studio 54 fame) in partnership with Marriott International. When it opens next week with introductory rates from 195 a night, the 353-room hotel will try to attract corporate travelers and vacationers with a restaurant from Iron ChefMasaharu Morimoto and a minimalist, beach-house vibe that's heavy on beige linen and light on Hawaiiana. (Among the few islands touches: a surfboard art installation above the front desk.) While it doesn't play up the connection, the Edition is a bit player in Hawaii Five-0, as well. Until a few years ago, the 17-story building was part of The Ilikai — a condo-hotel-timeshare complex that billed itself as the \\"first luxury high-rise hotel in Hawaii\\" when it opened in 1964. (The Ilikai went into receivership in 2008, and was closed briefly last year before reopening under new management.) A helicopter view of The Ilikai's privately owned penthouse balcony, featured in the opening theme of the original series, makes another cameo appearance in the opening of the updated show. Whether the re-imagined, grittier version of Hawaii Five-0 will inspire as many bookings to its tropical setting as its predecessor did may be doubtful. But despite scripts that deal with such un-postcard-worthy topics as meth addiction and sex traffickers, executive producer Peter Lenkov insists that Honolulu and its environs will be a \\"co-star.\\" The original was \\"my dad's favorite show,\\" recalls Lenkov, and watching it gave father and son a vicarious escape from a seemingly endless Montreal winter: \\"Getting to go to a tropical location every week was a big lure, and I'm hoping the same holds true for people watching today.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Given the question: The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee approved a bill Thursday that would protect from arbitrary dismissal the special counsel investigating Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election. The measure, backed by 10 Democrats and four Republicans, would codify Justice Department regulations that the special counsel can only be fired by the attorney general or a designee for \\"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or other good cause.\\" The proposal would give the special counsel 10 days to challenge a dismissal in court.

The measure would also require the Justice Department to notify Congress when a special counsel is appointed and to report the findings of an investigation. While marking a strong show of support for Special Counsel Robert Mueller who is under frequent attack by President Donald Trump and some Republicans, the bill is unlikely to become law in the face of Republican opposition.

Question: In the natural world, ants of some species (initially) wander randomly, and upon finding food return to their colony while laying down pheromone trails. If other ants find such a path, they are likely not to keep travelling at random, but instead to follow the trail, returning and reinforcing it if they eventually find food (see Ant communication).  Over time, however, the pheromone trail starts to evaporate, thus reducing its attractive strength. The more time it takes for an ant to travel down the path and back again, the more time the pheromones have to evaporate. A short path, by comparison, gets marched over more frequently, and thus the pheromone density becomes higher on shorter paths than longer ones. Pheromone evaporation also has the advantage of avoiding the convergence to a locally optimal solution. If there were no evaporation at all, the paths chosen by the first ants would tend to be excessively attractive to the following ones. In that case, the exploration of the solution space would be constrained. The influence of pheromone evaporation in real ant systems is unclear, but it is very important in artificial systems.[8]  Ricky, an entomologist, is observing an ant colony in his back yard. After some observation, he discovers that all the ants travel down one of two distinct paths in order to find food to bring back to the colony. After taking some measurements, Ricky sees that path A is approximately 100 meters in length, and path B is approximately 150 meters in length. Ricky is now trying to make some scientific conclusions based on these observations.  Which path will allow for more time for the pheromones on that path to evaporate? Answer:","output":"Based on the given information, path B, the longer path of approximately 150 meters in length, will allow for more time for the pheromones on that path to evaporate. In the natural world, ants use pheromone trails to communicate with each other and find the most efficient paths to food sources. As ants travel from the colony to a food source and back, they deposit pheromones along the trail, which in turn attracts other ants to follow the same path. The strength of the pheromone trail plays a significant role in the ants' decision making, as a strong trail tends to attract more ants, leading to a positive feedback loop. However, pheromone trails lose their strength over time due to evaporation. This is an essential aspect of the ants' foraging behavior since it allows them to avoid sticking to a single, potentially locally optimal path indefinitely and encourages them to explore the environment and find new, potentially better paths to food sources. Given that path B is 150 meters long, compared to path A, which is 100 meters long, it will take ants considerably more time to travel down path B and eventually return to the colony. This increased travel time means that the pheromones deposited on path B will have more time to evaporate before ants return to reinforce the trail. As a result, the pheromone density on path B will be lower than on path A, leading to a weaker attraction for the ants following the trail. As Ricky, an entomologist observing the ant colony, is trying to make scientific conclusions based on these observations, he can establish that the longer path B allows for more pheromone evaporation, which in turn may affect the ants' foraging behavior and choice of pathways. This fact, combined with the ants' natural preference for shorter paths, will likely influence the colony to favor the shorter path A over time, unless external factors or new food sources become available that alter the ants' foraging dynamics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unfortunately, without these details, providing a comprehensive picture of Rapley's career performance, contributions, or latest development is a challenge.  In conclusion, while the data made available in the prompt's bio provides some basic information about Kevin Rapley, such as his birth date, birthplace, name, and current club, it lacks the detailed specifics on certain keypoints like position, caps, height, years of active play, goals scored, and updates on his national and club career.

Do I need a special app or hardware? Can I use a male to 2 female audio splitter for 1 headphone and one microphone?","output":"Although both questions seem related to using audio splitters, they are not the same. Let's dive into a detailed explanation of each to differentiate them clearly. Question 1: I want to record a podcast interview using 2 lapel microphones plugged into my iPhone using a splitter. Is there a way to have the 2 inputs record as separate vocal tracks? Do I need a special app or hardware? This question deals with recording a podcast interview using two lapel microphones and an iPhone, with the requirement of having separate vocal tracks for each input. To accomplish this, you may need special hardware and potentially a specific app. In most cases, a simple audio splitter won't work for this purpose because it will only duplicate the input signal while mixing it into a single track. You'll need an audio interface or a mixer that supports multi-channel recording. Here's what you can do: 1. Use an audio interface: You can find several audio interfaces that are compatible with iPhones (e.g., iRig Pro Duo, Shure MVi). These devices allow you to plug in two microphones and record separate audio tracks simultaneously. 2. Use a digital mixer: Another option is to use a digital mixer (e.g., Zoom LiveTrak L-8, Rode Rodecaster Pro) that offers multi-track recording. With these mixers, you can connect multiple microphones and record separate audio tracks, which you can then transfer to your iPhone for editing and publishing. 3. Specific apps: While there are many apps available for recording on your iPhone, most of them don't support multi-track recording. However, some apps like GarageBand or Ferrite Recording Studio allow you to record and edit multiple tracks simultaneously. In conclusion, you will need an audio interface or a digital mixer to record separate vocal tracks using two lapel microphones with your iPhone. Question 2: Can I use a male to 2 female audio splitter for 1 headphone and one microphone? This question pertains to the use of a male to 2 female audio splitter to connect a headphone and a microphone simultaneously. Using such splitter can sometimes work, but the result depends on the type of splitter and the device's compatibility. You should use a splitter specifically designed for this purpose, referred to as a \\"headset splitter\\" or \\"combo jack splitter.\\" A headset splitter has a single 4-pole male connector (TRRS) on one end that plugs into your device and two female connectors on the other end: one for headphones (3-pole TRS) and one for a microphone (3-pole TRS). This type of splitter separates the headphone and microphone channels, allowing you to use both devices simultaneously. However, it's essential to ensure your device's audio jack supports the TRRS configuration and both microphone and headphone functions. If your device is not compatible, you may need a USB adapter or an audio interface that supports mic and headphone connectivity. In summary, while both questions involve audio splitters, they are not the same. The first question concerns recording separate audio tracks using two lapel microphones and an iPhone, whereas the second question deals with using a specific type of splitter to connect a microphone and headphones simultaneously."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. From the 1930s through much of the 1960s, Florida was essentially a one-party state dominated by white conservative Democrats, who together with other Democrats of the Solid South, exercised considerable control in Congress. They gained federal money from national programs; like other southern states, Florida residents have received more federal monies than they pay in taxes: the state is a net beneficiary. Since the 1970s, the conservative white majority of voters in the state has largely shifted from the Democratic to the Republican Party. It has continued to support Republican presidential candidates through the 20th century, except in 1976 and 1996, when the Democratic nominee was from the South. They have had \\"the luxury of voting for presidential candidates who pledge to cut taxes and halt the expansion of government while knowing that their congressional delegations will continue to protect federal spending.\\" What do these candidates that Florida supports pledge","output":"The candidates that Florida supports usually promise two key things:  1. They pledge or promise to cut taxes - this means they want to reduce the amount of money that people have to pay to the government from what they earn or buy. Just like how you might want to keep more of your allowance rather than spending it. 2. They pledge to stop the expansion of government - this means they don't want the government to grow bigger or do more things. It's like if you had a toy box, and instead of getting a bigger box or more toys, you decide to keep and play with the toys you already have.

Rory -- změnila celý jídelníček. Translate to English","output":"The sentence \\"Rory -- změnila celý jídelníček.\\" translates to English as \\"Rory -- changed the entire menu.\\" Interested in more than just the translation? Here's a bit of extra context: This sentence is in Czech and can commonly be seen used in households, restaurants, or any other place that serves food and might require menu changes. 'Rory' is a proper noun, presumably referring to a person's name. Maybe Rory is a dietitian who changed a client's diet plan, or a chef or restaurant owner who decided to update the menu at his or her establishment. Or perhaps, Rory is a family member who decided to switch up home meals for a variety of reasons like health needs, change of location leading to availability of different ingredients, exploring new cuisines and tastes, or simply out of boredom from the old menu. 'Změnila' translates to 'changed', and it is in the past tense. This tells us that the action of changing the menu has already occurred. 'Celý' translates to 'entire' or 'whole', indicating that Rory didn't just change a few items, but the complete menu. Such an extensive change requires considerable effort, planning, and possibly research, particularly if it's for a specialized or themed restaurant, or if it's a diet plan that must factor in nutrition, dietary restrictions, and personal tastes and preferences. 'Jídelníček' refers to a 'menu' in this context. It's a term used across various platforms, right from restaurants and cafes to diet plans provided by dietitians. It contains the list of food and beverage items to be consumed over a certain period of time and can range from simple, like a list of dishes in a small cafe, to complex, like a week-long individually tailored diet plan.  So, summarizing it all - the sentence announces that Rory has entirely revamped the set of meals that will be served. This could be interesting or exciting for those who will be tasting these new dishes or adopting the new dietary plan. It could mean trying out fresh, unseen, or untouched recipes, getting introduced to new tastes and maybe, healthier food habits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Courageous Movie plot: When his truck is stolen at a Gas Station, Nathan Hayes chases it and manages to apprehend the driver and reclaim the truck. Though he is injured, he crawls back to the car, and sees that his little baby boy in the back is okay. When the police arrive, Adam Mitchell and Shane Fuller meet Hayes, discovering he is a new deputy, having recently moved. The personal lives of these officers are observed: Mitchell adores his nine-year-old daughter, Emily, but is distant from his fifteen-year-old son, Dylan, because Mitchell doesn't share Dylan's interest in 5k runs. Hayes never knew his biological father, instead treating a neighbor as his father (even giving him Father's Day cards annually), but would risk his life to save his three children; however, his teenage daughter Jade (Taylor Hutcherson), resents him because he has a strict policy about dating. Fuller is divorced, as were his parents, and has joint custody of his son. Thomson is young and single. Javier Martinez (Robert Amaya), an immigrant struggling to provide for his family, is walking down an alley asking God what He wants him to do after being laid off when a construction company went over budget and Mitchell calls him over to help with his shed, thinking he is a different Javier that Mitchell's friends said would help him. After paying him for the job, Mitchell recommends him to a new full-time job, where he is hired. One day, Emily is killed by a drunk driver, devastating Mitchell and his family. Following his daughter's death, Mitchell reads a lot about fatherhood in the Bible. He decides he must be a better father and crafts a detailed \\"Resolution\\" to honor God in every aspect of his family. Mitchell, Hayes, Fuller, Thomson, and Martinez join him in his resolution at a formal ceremony conducted by Hayes's neighborhood mentor, the man he thinks of as a father. As a result of the resolution, Mitchell and Fuller mend their relationships with their sons, Hayes with his daughter, and he also visits the grave of his biological father who he had never...

However, he gets injured in the process but is relieved to find his baby boy in the back seat of the car unharmed. This event sets in motion the story that explores the challenges and responsibilities of fatherhood and the impact it has on the lives of their children. Throughout the movie, we witness the personal lives of these officers, their struggles, and their growth as fathers. Each character is dealing with their unique issues related to fatherhood and family life. For instance, Mitchell's relationship with his teenage son is strained due to their differing interests, while Hayes faces resentment from his daughter because of his strict dating policy. Their immigrant friend, Javier Martinez, is struggling to provide for his family after losing his job. The movie takes a dramatic turn when Mitchell's daughter Emily is killed in a car accident caused by a drunk driver. This tragedy leads Mitchell to examine his role as a father and turn to the Bible for guidance on how to improve. He then creates a \\"Resolution\\" for himself and his fellow officers to commit to honoring God in their roles as fathers and husbands. By the end of the film, each character has made positive strides toward becoming a better father and strengthening their relationships with their families. The story behind \\"Courageous\\" serves as an important reminder that fatherhood has a significant impact on the lives of children and families and emphasizes the importance of being an attentive, loving, and responsible father figure.

Born on 17 February 1940 in the suburb of Huentitan El Alto in Guadalajara, Jalisco, Fernandez spent his early years on his father Ramon's ranch on the outskirts of Guadalajara. He also worked at a young age as a waiter, dish washer, cashier, and finally manager of his uncle's restaurant. \\"Chente\\", as he was known to all, became fond of the idyllic ranch lifestyle. His mother often took him to see the films of Pedro Infante; he has said of these films' significance: \\"When I was 6 or 7, I would go see Pedro Infante's movies, and I would tell my mother, 'When I grow up, I'll be like him.' In the spring of 1966, Javier Solis, Mexico's most popular traditional singer, died. Discos CBS, the recording label in the Mexican department of CBS Records International, offered Fernandez a recording contract. He released his first recording, \\"Perdoname\\", with the company in 1966; Fernandez still records for the label, which is now Sony Music Latin of Sony Music Entertainment.  He branched into acting with the 1971 film Tacos al Carbon. His first hit movie, for which he did the soundtrack, was 1974's La Ley del Monte. He stopped acting in 1991. Maintaining the ranchera tradition, Fernandez always performs wearing the charro, an embroidered suit and sombrero.  In 1970, just as Fernandez was about to go onstage, his father died. Overwhelmed by the tragic news but determined not to let the crowd go without a show, Fernandez went onstage and performed. By the end of the night the critics were comparing him to other famous ranchera artists like Jose Alfredo Jimenez, Jorge Negrete, and Javier Solis. Since then his music has expanded rapidly. In 1998, he continued to tour despite the kidnapping of his oldest son. (He was released 4 months later when ransom was paid.)  Fernandez has recorded more than 50 albums in 35 years and claims to have recorded 300 more songs, making another 30 albums possible even if he retires. When he records an album, he spends 12-13 hours in the studio recording up to 18 songs; he takes a day off, then returns for another marathon session of recording another 15 or more songs. From this accumulation, he and his producer choose 12 tracks. Fernandez's greatest hit was \\"Volver, volver,\\" released in 1972; his first million-selling album was 1983's 15 Grandes con el numero uno. In 1987 he launched his first tour outside the United States and Mexico when he traveled to Bolivia and Colombia.

One of the most striking features of the Ptarmigan is its ability to change its plumage seasonally, providing exceptional camouflage against predators like foxes, eagles, and humans. In the summer months, the Ptarmigan's feathers are a mixture of gray, brown, and black, blending in perfectly with the rocky and heathery terrain of its habitat. As winter approaches, the Ptarmigan undergoes a gradual transformation. The feathers on its body, wings, and head turn white, effectively mimicking the snowy landscape and hiding the bird from any potential threats. This color-changing ability is not only useful for evading predators but also serves as an essential tool for conserving energy in the frigid climate. The winter-white feathers are denser, providing better insulation against the cold. They also make it easier for the Ptarmigan to find a mate as the plumage difference between males and females lessens, enabling them to identify each other more easily. Besides the color change, Ptarmigans have other adaptations that enable them to survive and thrive in their harsh surroundings. They have feathered feet, which act as natural snowshoes, helping them walk on soft snow without sinking and providing extra insulation. Their rounded wings allow them to take off quickly in case of danger and enable agile flight even at high altitudes. The Ptarmigan's diet mainly consists of plant matter, such as seeds, leaves, berries, and buds. In winter, when vegetation is scarce, they rely on dwarf willow and birch, digging under the snow to find food. Ptarmigans have a sturdy and short beak, which is adapted to peck at hard materials, allowing them to break through ice and frozen plants in search of sustenance. The Ptarmigan is an exceptional example of a bird that has evolved a variety of unique adaptations to survive in some of the most extreme environments on Earth. Its winter-white camouflage, insulating plumage, feathered feet, rounded wings, and specialized diet all contribute to its ability to thrive in the harsh mountainous and arctic habitats of Britain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The BlackBerry KeyOne (Photo: Edward C. Baig, for USA TODAY)      BARCELONA — TCL launched the smartphone that it is counting on to revitalize the diminished BlackBerry brand. It’s called the BlackBerry KeyOne, and is being marketed as the most secure Android phone in the world.      KeyOne goes on sale in the U.S. in April for 549.      Speaking at a Mobile World Congress press event here, TCL Communication CEO Nicolas Zibell said the phone represents the “beginning of a new story” for BlackBerry.      The old story is well known of course. How the once-powerhouse Canadian based-smartphone maker fell on hard times after the iPhone came along. BlackBerry’s market share dwindled down to practically nothing.      Under a recent licensing agreement, Hong Kong-based TCL is now responsible for the hardware branded under BlackBerry Mobile. BlackBerry in Canada still supplies the security and software smarts.      The KeyOne is the first BlackBerry handset to come out under TCL’s watch.      The new phone certainly looks like a traditional BlackBerry, what with a Qwerty keyboard that reminds you of the popular BlackBerry keyboards of yesteryear. But this is a modernized version, with programmable keys that can provide up to 52 shortcuts. For example, you can press the “I” key for quick access to your inbox, or the “m” key for a maps shortcut.      The gesture-responsive keyboard also doubles as a trackpad.      Staple BlackBerry features on the device include the BlackBerry Hub repository for all your various communications, and DTEK security software.      Indeed, the KeyOne remains an enterprise play, but one BlackBerry hopes will eventually appeal to consumers.      The KeyOne is supposed to have an all-day battery with fast charging. It runs off a Qualcomm 625 processor and has a modern USB-C connector. It runs the Nougat 7.1 version of Android.      KeyOne goes on sale in the U.S. in April for 549. (Photo: Edward C. Baig, for USA TODAY)      Other specs: the phone has a 4.5-inch display (resolution 1620 x 1080), with a 12-megapixel rear camera and 8mp front camera. It comes with 32GB of internal storage, which can be expanded via microSD.      It also has a fingerprint sensor but is not water resistant like other premium devices.      Ken Hyers, the director of emerging device strategies at Strategy Analytics’ global wireless practice, believes that TCL’s ambition this year to stabilize the brand’s share is doable, especially given BlackBerry’s tiny volumes. The more difficult challenge for TCL, he says, will be to return BlackBerry to growth.      “They intend to do that as part of an integrated portfolio strategy in which they go to operators with a range of devices for all customers,\\" Hyers says. \\"There’s some merit to the strategy, but ultimately it will come down to features and price, as the BlackBerry brand doesn’t retain a strong following anymore, even in the enterprise.”      Consumer tech analyst Carolina Milanesi of Creative Strategies thinks the price is a bit high, though she added in a tweet that TCL “should not go so low and devalue (the) BlackBerry brand.”      On Sunday at MWC, we hear from another fallen phone brand Nokia, itself pitting hopes on the comeback trail.      Email: ebaig@usatoday.com; Follow USA TODAY Personal Tech Columnist @edbaig on Twitter      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2mqdgP3 ||||| TCL's president of North America, Steve Cistulli, told CNBC that the company's plan is to market this device to the enterprise market, as part of a broader strategy to recapture the hearts of consumers, and challenge mobile behemoths Samsung and Apple.      \\"We can compete with Apple and Samsung directly in the enterprise market,\\" Cistulli said in an interview on Saturday. \\"We are going to use this device, to break the armor and it's our way in, once you have a way in you can get the mind share and hearts of those people.\\"      BlackBerry was once one of the most dominant brands in the mobile phone world, but quickly fell from the top of the heap shortly after Apple introduced the iPhone. The latter quickly seized the imagination of gadget geeks and devoured market share, leaving BlackBerry in the dust.      The Canadian firm lost more ground once Samsung also bulldozed its way into the smartphone market, but tried to stage a comeback as its market share languished in the single digits. BlackBerry's efforts included releasing new units like the Leap and Android-powered PRIV, all of which fell flat as smartphone users flocked to iPhones and Galaxy devices.      After licensing its brand to TCL to make devices with the BlackBerry name, BlackBerry has increased its focus on software. Meanwhile TCL is hoping that it can use BlackBerry's once strong brand to win back consumers that have since moved on.      The TCL executive also revealed that there will be more BlackBerry products coming to target the consumer market.            But with Apple, Samsung and Huawei dominating the high-end smartphone market, analysts said it could be a tough time for TCL's BlackBerry devices.      \\"TCL will be hoping that by licensing the BlackBerry brand it can extend its market reach beyond the low margin consumer segment (which it currently targets via the Alcatel brand) to the higher margin enterprise devices space,\\" Ben Wood, chief of research at CCS Insight, told CNBC by email.      \\"However, the jury is out on how relevant the BlackBerry brand remains to that segment,\\" he added.      In recent years, BlackBerry's operating system struggled to compete against Android and Apple's iOS, both of which dominate the market. However, Cistulli said this time it is different and is setting ambitious goals for TCL.      The executive said the company, which also makes the Alcatel brand of mobile phones, is aiming to be the number three player in North America by 2020, and near the top five globally.             ||||| What is a summary?","output":"TCL has launched the BlackBerry KeyOne, an Android phone aimed at the enterprise market, which it hopes will challenge Apple and Samsung.

Question: The answer to the question: What is the first name of the man that pretends to be homosexual to avoid being drafted? is inside the article: The story focuses on the Turtles in the days leading up to and following the success of their single \\"Happy Together\\". Howard Kaylan and Mark Volman receive their draft cards and Frank Zappa tells them to seek advice from Herb Cohen, Zappa's manager and Kaylan's cousin, to avoid being drafted in the Vietnam War. Cohen advises Kaylan to show up to the draft board intoxicated from drug use, not to bathe or sleep, and to behave so obnoxiously that the Army will not draft him, leading Kaylan and Volman to engage in a sleepless night of marijuana smoking before their draft review, which they fail due to being high while taking the tests, and Kaylan pretending to be homosexual in front of the physician and expressing psychotic views to the psychiatrist. Because they avoid the draft, the Turtles fly to England where Graham Nash and Donovan play them an advance reel to reel recording of the unreleased Beatles album Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, which the Turtles declare to be the greatest album they ever heard. At a nearby pub, the Turtles have a disastrous meeting with the Beatles, in which Turtles guitarist Jim Tucker is verbally abused by John Lennon, leading the Turtles to leave the bar as Kaylan stays behind and Brian Jones, the founder of the Rolling Stones, introduces Kaylan to Jimi Hendrix, who Kaylan ends up having dinner and a conversation with, while the two drink much alcohol and smoke marijuana, with the evening ultimately ending with Kaylan vomiting on Hendrix' suit.

Article: In the 15th century the dome was added and the naves extended back of the choir, uniting the building to the tower and forming a main entrance. Archbishop Luis Alfonso de los Cameros began the building of the main chapel in 1674; the walls were decorated with marbles and bronzes in the Baroque style of that period. At the beginning of the 18th century the German Conrad Rudolphus built the façade of the main entrance. The other two doors lead into the transept; one, that of the Apostles in pure pointed Gothic, dates from the 14th century, the other is that of the Paláu. The additions made to the back of the cathedral detract from its height. The 18th-century restoration rounded the pointed arches, covered the Gothic columns with Corinthian pillars, and redecorated the walls. The dome has no lantern, its plain ceiling being pierced by two large side windows. There are four chapels on either side, besides that at the end and those that open into the choir, the transept, and the sanctuary. It contains many paintings by eminent artists. A silver reredos, which was behind the altar, was carried away in the war of 1808, and converted into coin to meet the expenses of the campaign. There are two paintings by Francisco Goya in the San Francesco chapel. Behind the Chapel of the Blessed Sacrament is a small Renaissance chapel built by Calixtus III.

In the first sentence, \\"He could not work the math problem,\\" the word \\"work\\" is used as a transitive verb. Here, \\"work\\" means to solve, resolve, or to find a solution to a given problem—in this case, a math problem. The person in question is actively trying to solve or apply certain methods and techniques to come up with the answer to the math problem, but he is unable to do so. In this context, \\"work\\" carries the connotation of effort and mental engagement applied to accomplish a particular task.

It's nothing for a big, strong schoolboy to elbow an elderly woman aside in the dash for the last remaining seat on the tube or bus, much less stand up and offer his seat to her. This question of giving up seats in public transport is much argued by young men, who say that, since women have claimed equality, they no longer deserve to be treated with courtesy  and that those who go out to work should take their turn in _ like anyone else. Women have never claimed to be physically as strong as men. Even if it's not agreed, however, that young men should stand up for older women, the fact remains that courtesy should be shown to the old, the sick and the burdened. Are we really so lost to all ideals of unselfishness that we can sit there indifferently reading the paper or a book, saying to ourselves \\" First come, first served\\", while a gray-haired woman, a mother with a young child or a cripple stands? Yet this is too often seen. Older people, tired and easy annoyed from a day's work, aren't angels, either--far from it. Many a brisk argument or an insulting quarrel breaks out as the weary queues push and shove each other to get on buses and tubes. One cannot commend  this, of course, but one does feel there is just a little more excuse.

Though Las Vegas had developed a powerful local economy, few major outside investments were made in the city, due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities. That would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire Howard Hughes. A legitimate businessman, Hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic, a style suited to the Las Vegas ethos. True to the myth, the reclusive Hughes immediately cloistered himself in the Desert Inn's penthouse. Several weeks later he was asked — then ordered — to vacate the room to make room for high rollers, whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management. Thus began Hughes' legendary three-year, 300-million Las Vegas buying spree. When it was over, Hughes owned six casinos, an airport, and an airline, along with numerous plots of land stretching from the Strip to the mountains. Hughes' actions would have beneficial repercussions, both immediate and lasting. Because of the new legitimacy Las Vegas acquired from Hughes' investments, established companies such as Hilton Hotels bought into the gaming business, and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos, where illegal skimming of profits was rampant. That, combined with the formation of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city. Las Vegas with a Vision As corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out, a new Las Vegas emerged. The legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the US. What was once a sure thing became much more competitive. Casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business. The first to really do so was Steve Wynn, a Las Vegas resident and owner of the Golden Nugget. In the mid-1980s, Wynn began plans to reinvigorate Las Vegas with a new resort. He bought several Strip properties — the Silver Slipper and Castaways among them — and demolished them to make way for a new kind of resort — Mirage —  which became an instant success.

Article: A mental professor walked around a room while teaching stress management to an audience.

Instead, with a smile on her face, she inquired : \\"How heavy is this glass of water?\\" Different answers called out from the audience. She replied, \\"The absolute weight doesn't matter. It depends on how long I hold it. If I hold it for a minute, it's not a problem. If I hold it for an hour, I'll have an ache in my arm. If I hold it for a day, my arm will feel numb  and paralyzed. In each case, the weight of the glass doesn't change, but the longer I hold it, the heavier it becomes.\\" She continued, \\"The stress and worries in life are like that glass of water. Think about them for a while and nothing happens. Think about them a bit longer and they begin to hurt.

If there is no angle finder there are two things that should be considered 1 The strap from the Infant Car Seat Adapter should go through the belt guide on the car seat 2 Add punctuation.","output":"If there is no angle finder, there are two things that should be considered:  1. The strap from the Infant Car Seat Adapter should go through the belt guide on the car seat.  2. It is crucial to ensure proper installation and appropriate angles for the infant car seat in order to provide maximum safety and comfort for the baby. In the absence of an angle finder, it is recommended to follow the manufacturer's guidelines and refer to the car seat manual for accurate positioning. Additionally, consider seeking assistance from a certified Child Passenger Safety Technician (CPST) who can provide recommendations and instructions for correct car seat installation.  The first thing to consider when installing an infant car seat without an angle finder is to ensure that the strap from the Infant Car Seat Adapter goes through the belt guide on the car seat. The belt guide is designed to provide a secure and tightly fastened location for the car seat to attach to the vehicle. It is important to properly thread the seat belt or LATCH strap through the belt guide to prevent any movement or rotation of the car seat in the event of a sudden stop or collision. This will keep the baby restrained and protected during travel. The second consideration when installing an infant car seat without an angle finder is to adjust the angle of the car seat base to comply with the recommendations provided by the manufacturer. Most infant car seats are designed to be installed at a specific angle, often around 30 to 45 degrees. This ensures that the baby is in a semi-reclined position that allows for easier breathing and prevents any potential obstruction to the airway. To achieve the correct angle, follow these steps: 1. Check the car seat manual to confirm the appropriate angle for your specific car seat model. 2. Place a rolled towel or foam pool noodle under the car seat base at the dive where the vehicle seat meets the backrest. This will help to achieve the proper angle for the infant car seat. 3. Adjust the angle of the car seat base by moving the towel or foam pool noodle closer to or further away from the backrest until the desired angle is achieved. 4. Test the angle by checking the level indicators on the car seat itself or by using a smartphone app specifically designed for this purpose. It is essential to double-check the seat belt or LATCH strap tension and re-adjust the angle as needed. Always make sure that the vehicle is parked on a flat surface when making any adjustments. Remember that regular car seat checks are important for maintaining safety during various stages of your child's growth. In conclusion, when you do not have access to an angle finder, it is important to focus on properly threading the strap from the Infant Car Seat Adapter through the belt guide on the car seat and ensuring the correct angle for the base as per the manufacturer's recommendations. These steps will help provide safety and comfort for your baby during travel. For additional guidance, consider seeking assistance from a certified Child Passenger Safety Technician."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

A person can increase their alcohol tolerance without becoming dependent, though having too high an alcohol tolerance likely means you are also dependent. Choose from: [+] Tolerance means that your body adapts to the consumption of a specific amount of alcohol, even in amounts such as one beer or one glass of wine. Dependence means that you consistently and compulsively consume alcohol and need it to function, a dangerous state you want to avoid. [+] When people engage in relationships that are dependent on alcohol, both partners seek and use or exceed their level of dependency. Dependency can be driven by constant usage of drugs, alcohol, or other substances. [+] It is important to realize this is the opposite of addiction. Dependence as a person responds to drugs is often something that goes unsaid, while dependence is how a person responds to drugs, alcohol, and other dependiments. [+] Dependence causes a person to \\" reduce their alcoholic intake, \\" which means they are able to drink just about anything.

Instead, slowly sip your drink and alternate between alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages, such as water or soda, to keep your body hydrated and maintain a more balanced consumption rate. Additionally, make sure to consume food before and during alcohol consumption. Eating a well-balanced meal consisting of carbohydrates, protein, and fats can help slow down alcohol absorption in your bloodstream. This will not only contribute to a higher alcohol tolerance but also reduce the risk of negative physical effects associated with excessive alcohol intake, such as nausea and vomiting. Another factor to consider is the type and quality of alcohol you consume. Opt for drinks with lower alcohol content and avoid mixing different types of alcohol, as this can lead to rapid intoxication. Remember that higher-quality beverages with fewer additives and impurities may reduce the severity of a hangover and make it easier for your body to cope with alcohol consumption. Exercise, stress management, and getting enough sleep can also play a significant role in improving alcohol tolerance. A healthy lifestyle and managing stress levels can help your body better process alcohol, leading to a higher tolerance. Inadequate sleep not only affects your overall health but also reduces your body's efficiency in metabolizing alcohol. Lastly, monitor your alcohol intake and know your limits. Be mindful not to increase your drinking frequency or amount with the sole purpose of boosting your alcohol tolerance, as this may lead to alcohol dependence. The key to improving your alcohol tolerance is balance and being responsible, while prioritizing your overall health and well-being. In conclusion, improving your alcohol tolerance is about understanding the distinction between tolerance and dependence, pacing your alcohol consumption, eating well, choosing quality beverages, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and knowing your limits. By practicing these healthy habits, you'll be able to improve your alcohol tolerance safely and responsibly, without putting your mental, emotional, and physical health at risk."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a summary based on this article: She was the artist who put the contemporary in contemporary Inuit art, a catalyst for other Inuit artists, young and old, to deal with life as it was in Canada’s North, an award-winning international standard-bearer. And now Annie Pootoogook is dead at 47.      Officials with the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative in her hometown of Cape Dorset confirmed Friday afternoon that the woman whose body had been recovered Monday morning from the Rideau River in Ottawa was Ms. Pootoogook.      Police said they were not treating the incident as a homicide but crime investigators are seeking the public’s help in retracing the artist’s last hours and days.      Ms. Pootoogook had been living for roughly the past nine years in Ottawa, sometimes on the street and in shelters, sometimes plagued by alcohol and drug abuse and, in 2012, an unwanted pregnancy. She’d relocated there from Nunavut in the wake of a string of major artistic successes in southern Canada and internationally. These included an acclaimed solo exhibition, in 2006, of her ink, crayon, pencil and chalk drawings at Toronto’s Power Plant Contemporary Art Gallery, one of Canada’s premier venues for cutting-edge art. This in turn led to her winning the 50,000 Sobey Art Award that same year, given annually to an artist of singular talent under 40. In 2007 she was invited to participate at the prestigious Documenta 12 showcase, held every five years in Kassel, Germany. Two years later, she was given a solo show at New York’s National Museum of the American Indian George Gustav Heye Center.      In photos: The work of artist Annie Pootoogook      Ms. Pootoogook’s art was far removed from the imagery of kayaks, walruses, harpoons and the other tried-and-true themes and subjects that had informed much Inuit art from the 1950s onward. She wielded a matter-of-fact, almost deadpan style to closely depict all facets of modern Inuit life, from a husband beating his wife and families shopping, to men watching television porn and women beading.      Ms. Pootoogook, who began drawing in 1997, was the granddaughter of Pitseolak Ashoona, one of the earliest Cape Dorset drawers and print-makers. Her mother Napachie was a prolific graphic artist while father Eegyvudluk was similarly esteemed as a carver and print-maker.      However, after her triumphs of 2006-09, Ms. Pootoogook’s output slowed, then seemed to stop. Toronto dealer Pat Feheley, who’d given Ms. Pootoogook her first commercial bow in 2001 as part of a group show called The Unexpected, then her first solo outing in 2003, told The Globe and Mail in July of 2012 that she hadn’t received an original Pootoogook drawing in more than three years.      In an interview Friday, Ms. Feheley said she was “stunned” by the loss. “She had a rough couple of years but I always thought she’d be back. We’d go back to Dorset and the image bank she would have had would have been amazing.”      Ms. Pootoogook’s art, at least initially, was almost a kind of therapy, Ms. Feheley said. “It was simply to get it out of her head. She didn’t particularly care if they sold or not.”      Tributes were quick to pour in.      Andrew Hunter, Canadian art curator at the Art Gallery of Ontario, called her “a profoundly influential artist who had the courage to push the boundaries of Inuit art.”      Academic curator Gerald McMaster said “her legacy will not be forgotten, in that she leaves us thinking about the same troubled world she was brave enough to depict.”      Nancy Campbell, former AGO associate curator of special projects, spoke of Ms. Pootoogook’s “poignant, often difficult pictures” being “a crucial part of opening the dialogue about art-making in the North.”      Report Typo/Error ||||| Prominent Inuk artist Annie Pootoogook has been identified as the woman whose body was found in Ottawa's Rideau River earlier this week.      Officials with the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative in her hometown, Cape Dorset, Nunavut, confirmed the death of the chalk-and-ink artist, who rose to prominence when she won the Sobey Award in 2006.      Pootoogook, 47, had been living in Ottawa.      Her drawings offered a contemporary take on her culture, where old customs intermingled with modern technology and goods.      Her work is part of the collections at the National Gallery of Canada and the Art Gallery of Ontario and was recently part of an exhibition on Indigenous pop art at Ottawa's Saw Gallery.      \\"Her inclusion in the exhibition was a no-brainer, in that she looked at contemporary life in a way no other artist had ever done,\\" said Saw Gallery curator Jason St-Laurent, who first met Pootoogook five years ago.

Her parents, Napachie and Eegyvudlu Pootoogook, and her grandmother Pitseolak Ashoona were all artists.      It was \\"like the artistic lives were already aimed to be passed on to Annie,\\" said Jimmy Manning, the president of the Inuit Art Foundation, in Inuktitut.      Saw Gallery curator Jason St-Laurent, standing in front of one of Annie Pootoogook's drawings, said the artist was a \\"shining light\\" to those who knew her. (CBC News)      \\"As soon as she started sketching [when she was a child] you knew her art was going to go somewhere.\\"      \\"Her impact was revolutionary and it's no surprise she had international acclaim for her work,\\" he said.      St-Laurent described Pootoogook as a free spirit who lived life on her own terms. He said he lost touch with her a few months ago, but said she was always welcome at the gallery.      \\"When she came into Saw, she was a shining light, and made everyone laugh… she was the kindest soul you could ever meet.

Pootoogook’s body was discovered Monday at about 8:50 a.m. in the water close to Bordeleau Park in Lowertown. Police do not consider her death to be suspicious or a homicide, said Const. Marc Soucy. “We just want to recreate her final moments.”      Soucy said an autopsy has been performed, but police are not releasing a cause of death. It is unclear where Pootoogook was last seen.      Pootoogook’s story is one of a rocket ride to superstardom in the art world, followed by a crash into addiction, life on the street and tragedy.      Originally from Cape Dorset, Nunavut, Pootoogook was considered one of Canada’s most pre-eminent Inuit artists. Her grandmother, Pitseolak Ashoona, an artist, was the last to grow up in the traditional Inuit lifestyle. Her mother, Napachie Pootoogook, was also an artist who died in 2002.      Pootoogook began drawing in 1997 and was discovered about 14 years ago by Patricia Feheley of Feheley Fine Arts, a Toronto art gallery that began buying her work through the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative in Cape Dorset. Her drawings were a jarring chronicle of modern Inuit life — a family watching Jerry Springer on television, ATM cash machines, scenes of alcoholism and spousal abuse.      Feheley helped to raise Pootoogook’s profile and sold her drawings in coloured pencils for as much has 2,600.      Related      “I was just hit by their power,” Feheley said in a 2012 interview. “The best I have ever heard it described is they are so direct, they are so honest, they so come from the head to the hand to the paper, and that is why they resonate so much with people.”      Pootoogook won the 50,000 Sobey Art Award in 2006 and exhibited on an international scale. In 2007, showed at the Montreal Biennial, the Basel Art Fair in Switzerland and Documenta 12 in Kasel, Germany. In 2009-10 there was a solo show in New York, and a review in the New York Times which called her work “disconcertingly autobiographical.”            Her last solo show was in 2011 in Kingston.      Pootoogook, who has lived in Ottawa since 2007, battled the demons of sexual abuse, alcohol and drugs. By 2012 she had disappeared from view and journalists who attempted to track down the media-shy artist were disappointed. She drew attention again when Citizen reporter Hugh Adami found her in July of 2012, pregnant, panhandling and selling drawings for 25 to 30 on the street to pay for cigarettes.      That September, she gave birth to a baby girl, named Napuchie, in a bathroom at the Shepherds of Good Hope. The baby was a month premature and weighed three pounds, 10 ounces. (She had two previous children on Baffin Island.) Three days later, Pootoogook was back on Rideau Street.      Her art appeared to reflect the torment of her life. Crying While Making a Drawing, dated 2003, shows a woman in tears on her knees in a near-empty room, with drawings of Christian crosses on the floor in front of her. Another drawing from that time period, called Evil Spirit, shows a woman on her hands and knees being tormented by a horned demon.      Last October, Pootoogook told Adami that she was living at a women’s shelter after moving out of an ex-boyfriend’s apartment in the wake of a tumultuous relationship. She said she knew she had an alcohol problem and planned to see an addiction counsellor. She was on probation because she made a “mistake” related to drinking.            “When people tell you to stop drinking,” Pootoogook told Adami, her tendency is to “keep drinking and drinking.”      On Friday, Adami, now retired, said when he first met Pootoogook “I thought she was going to pull it together. People in the art community were reaching out to her. Lots of people wanted to help.”      He interviewed her several times after that, most recently last October. “It was getting worse and worse. She was ravaged by alcohol. She mentioned her baby and started crying. It was very, very sad.”      In a 2012 interview with Citizen arts writer Paul Gessell, Feheley said Pootoogook’s fame was “just too much, too fast.”      “Her vault to stardom, which was serious stardom, was really a two-and-one-half year thing for someone who was living a relatively sheltered life and not that happy a life in Cape Dorset, when suddenly she was in Switzerland and she was in Germany and she won all this money and there were three books and two movies,” said Feheley.      “I think she just literally got overwhelmed.”      Police ask anyone who saw Pootoogook in the days leading up to the discovery of her body to contact the Ottawa Police major crime unit at 613 236 1222, ext. 5493.      Anonymous tips can be submitted by calling Crime Stoppers toll-free at 1-800-222-8477.      jlaucius@postmedia.com ||||| The body of Pootoogook, 46, was spotted in the water around 8:50 a.m. Monday near Bordeleau Park in Lowertown, near the Ontario-Quebec border. An autopsy was performed later in the week to confirm her identity; Ottawa police identified Pootoogook in a news release Friday.      Pootoogook, born in Cape Dorset, Nunavut, was an acclaimed, award-winning contemporary Inuit artist best known for her frank, ink-and-crayon drawings of contemporary northern life. Her work was reflective of her own life and community, at times chronicling her experience of physical and sexual abuse and living with relatives suffering from alcoholism.      In 2006, Pootoogook won the Sobey Art Award, beating out four other shortlisted artists from across Canada for the 50,000 prize. The same year, her work was exhibited at a landmark show at Toronto’s Power Plant Gallery, the first time Canada’s pre-eminent contemporary art venue had held a major show by an Inuit. In 2007 she took part in Documenta 12 in Kassel, Germany, a prestigious, invitation-only art exhibition — held once every five years — that defines the current state of contemporary and modern art. Pootoogook’s Toronto dealer, Pat Feheley, said at the time that it was the first time that an Inuit artist had been invited to participate.      Nunavut Premier Peter Taptuna offered his condolences to Pootoogook’s family Friday afternoon on Twitter. ||||| Summary:","output":"Annie Pootoogook, an award-winning Inuit artist, was found dead in Ottawa's Rideau River at the age of 47.

If a strategy is for a particular game, it is known as a \\"game plan\\". Available options: - Yes; - It's impossible to say; - No; Hypothesis: Offensive, defensive, and special teams players are deployed for varying amounts of time.","output":"Based on the given paragraph, it is impossible to say if the hypothesis that offensive, defensive, and special teams players are deployed for varying amounts of time is true. While the paragraph does mention that American football strategy concerns the deployment of those players and various other aspects such as formation, strategies, and play calling systems, it does not specifically address how long they are deployed. However, using general knowledge about American football, we can deduce that the hypothesis could be considered true. Coaches develop game plans and strategies that involve deploying the offensive, defensive, and special teams players at different points throughout the game, depending on the circumstances and objectives they have. The amount of time that these players spend on the field could be dictated by the game situation, the players' performance, or even the play-calling. For example, offensive players will be on the field to execute a scoring drive and their time spent will depend on factors such as the number of plays needed to move down the field and reach the opponent's end zone. A quick scoring drive might only require a few plays, while a long, sustained drive might require several minutes of possession. Defensive players, on the other hand, spend their time on the field trying to stop the opposing team from scoring. Their time spent will depend on how successful they are in doing so, as well as other factors such as possession time, field position, and opponents' offensive strategy. Special teams players typically participate in specific game situations such as kickoffs, punts, field goals, and extra point attempts. Their deployment is often shorter compared to offensive and defensive players, as these plays are intended to either gain possession of the ball or score points from a fixed position on the field. In conclusion, while it is impossible to say for certain based on the given paragraph alone, the hypothesis that offensive, defensive, and special teams players are deployed for varying amounts of time is true in the context of the general understanding of American football strategy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Blue Oyster Cult (often abbreviated BOC or BOC) is an American hard rock band formed on Long Island, New York, in 1967, whose most successful work includes the hard rock songs\\"(Don't Fear) The Reaper\\", \\"Godzilla\\" and \\"Burnin' for You\\". Blue Oyster Cult has sold over 24 million records worldwide, including 7 million records in the United States alone. The band's music videos, especially \\"Burnin' for You\\", received heavy rotation on MTV when the music television network premiered in 1981, cementing the band's contribution to the development and success of the music video in modern popular culture. Context: Their debut album Blue Oyster Cult was released in January 1972, with a black and white cover designed by artist Bill Gawlik. The album featured the well-known BOC songs \\"Cities on Flame with Rock and Roll\\", \\"Stairway to the Stars\\" and \\"Then Came the Last Days of May\\". By this time, the band's sound had become more oriented toward hard rock, but songs like \\"She's As Beautiful As a Foot\\" and \\"Redeemed\\" also showed a strong element of the band's psychedelic roots. All of the band members except for Allen Lanier sang lead, a pattern that would continue on many subsequent albums, although lead singer Eric Bloom sang the majority of the songs. The album sold well, and Blue Oyster Cult toured with artists such as The Byrds, Mahavishnu Orchestra and Alice Cooper. During the touring process, the band's sound became heavier and more direct.  Their next album Tyranny and Mutation, released in 1973, was written while the band was on tour for their first LP. It contained songs such as \\"The Red and the Black\\" (an ode to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and a rewrite of \\"I'm On the Lamb But I Ain't No Sheep\\" from the debut album), \\"Hot Rails to Hell\\" and \\"Baby Ice Dog\\", the first of the band's many collaborations with Patti Smith. It featured a harder-rocking approach than before, though the band's songs were also growing more complex. The album outsold its predecessor, a trend that would continue with their next few albums.  The band's third album, Secret Treaties (1974) received positive reviews, featuring songs such as \\"Career of Evil\\" (co-written by Patti Smith), \\"Dominance and Submission\\" and \\"Astronomy\\". As a result of constant touring, the band was now capable of headlining arenas. The album continued the trend of growing sales, and would eventually go gold.  As the three albums during this formative period all had black-and-white covers, the period of their career has been dubbed the 'black and white years' by fans and critics. Question: did they tour with rock bands? Answer:","output":"Yes, Blue Oyster Cult toured with rock bands during their early career.

By 1999, 84 millionU.S.citizens had access to the Internet at home or work. More and more Americans arc paying bills, shopping, ordering airline tickets, and purchasing stocks via computer over the Internet. Internet banking is also becoming increasingly popular.

Read this: Pluralistic idealism such as that of Gottfried Leibniz takes the view that there are many individual minds that together underlie the existence of the observed world and make possible the existence of the physical universe. Unlike absolute idealism, pluralistic idealism does not assume the existence of a single ultimate mental reality or \\"Absolute\\". Leibniz' form of idealism, known as Panpsychism, views \\"monads\\" as the true atoms of the universe and as entities having perception. The monads are \\"substantial forms of being\\",elemental, individual, subject to their own laws, non-interacting, each reflecting the entire universe. Monads are centers of force, which is substance while space, matter and motion are phenomenal and their form and existence is dependent on the simple and immaterial monads. There is a pre-established harmony established by God, the central monad, between the world in the minds of the monads and the external world of objects. Leibniz's cosmology embraced traditional Christian Theism. The English psychologist and philosopher James Ward inspired by Leibniz had also defended a form of pluralistic idealism. According to Ward the universe is composed of \\"psychic monads\\" of different levels, interacting for mutual self- betterment. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): What does Ward see as the purpose of interaction between monads?","output":"James Ward sees the purpose of interaction between monads as mutual self-betterment. In his pluralistic idealism, inspired by Leibniz, he posits that the universe is composed of \\"psychic monads\\" at different levels. These monads interact with one another for the betterment of themselves and contribute to the overall harmony and balance of the universe. This idea of mutual self-betterment aligns with Leibniz's concept of pre-established harmony established by God, where the world in the minds of monads corresponds with the external world of objects. The interactions among monads allow for growth, development, and evolution within the pluralistic idealistic framework. These interactions help monads to refine and improve themselves, facilitating their understanding of the interconnection and unity between all aspects of the universe. Ward's perspective on the purpose of interaction between monads emphasizes the importance of cooperation, communication, and collective growth in a diverse and interconnected world. By working together and learning from one another, the psychic monads can achieve greater insight, understanding, and harmony within themselves and the universe as a whole. This approach reflects not only a philosophical worldview but also has implications for how societies and individuals should approach growth, development, and collaboration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These films are designed to make the audience laugh through amusement and most often work by exaggerating characteristics for humorous effect. Films in this style traditionally have a happy ending (black comedy being an exception). One of the oldest genres in film, some of the very first silent movies were comedies, as slapstick comedy often relies on visual depictions, without requiring sound. When sound films became more prevalent during the 1920s, comedy films took another swing, as laughter could result from burlesque situations but also dialogue.  - The Rank Organisation was a British entertainment conglomerate founded by industrialist J. Arthur Rank in April 1937. It quickly became the largest and most vertically integrated film company in Britain, owning production, distribution and exhibition facilities. It also diversified into the manufacture of radios, TVs and photocopiers (as one of the owners of Rank Xerox). The company name lasted until February 1996 when the name and some of the remaining assets were absorbed into the newly structured the Rank Group Plc and in the years that followed asset stripping and streamlining of the business has left it a shadow of its former self, with all their remaining operating interests now in gambling.  - Sir Derek Jules Gaspard Ulric Niven van den Bogaerde, known as Dirk Bogarde (28 March 1921  8 May 1999), was an English actor and writer. Initially a matinée idol in films such as \\"Doctor in the House\\" (1954) for the Rank Organisation, he later acted in art-house films. In a second career, he wrote seven best-selling volumes of memoirs, six novels and a volume of collected journalism, mainly from articles in \\"The Daily Telegraph\\".  - The Daily Telegraph, commonly referred to simply as The Telegraph, is a national British daily broadsheet newspaper published in London by Telegraph Media Group and distributed across the United Kingdom and internationally. It was founded by Arthur B. Sleigh in 1855 as \\"The Daily Telegraph and Courier\\".  - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects.  - Sir Alec Guinness (2 April 1914  5 August 2000) was an English actor. After an early career on the stage, he was featured in several of the Ealing Comedies, including \\"The Ladykillers\\" and \\"Kind Hearts and Coronets\\" in which he played eight different characters.

Hidalgo is hailed as the Father of the Nation even though it was Agustin de Iturbide and not Hidalgo who achieved Mexican Independence in 1821. Shortly after gaining independence, the day to celebrate it varied between September 16, the day of Hidalgo's Grito, and September 27, the day Iturbide rode into Mexico City to end the war. Later, political movements would favor the more liberal Hidalgo over the conservative Iturbide, so that eventually September 16, 1810 became the officially recognized day of Mexican independence. The reason for this is that Hidalgo is considered to be \\"precursor and creator of the rest of the heroes of the (Mexican War of) Independence.\\" Hidalgo has become an icon for Mexicans who resist tyranny in the country. Diego Rivera painted Hidalgo's image in half a dozen murals. José Clemente Orozco depicted him with a flaming torch of liberty and considered the painting among his best work. David Alfaro Siqueiros was commissioned by San Nicolas University in Morelia to paint a mural for a celebration commemorating the 200th anniversary of Hidalgo's birth. The town of his parish was renamed Dolores Hidalgo in his honor and the state of Hidalgo was created in 1869. Every year on the night of 15–16 September, the president of Mexico re-enacts the Grito from the balcony of the National Palace. This scene is repeated by the heads of cities and towns all over Mexico. The remains of Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla lie in the column of the Angel of Independence in Mexico City.

I hope you're having a super fun day! I want to tell you about something called the \\"PG&E Citygate Index N-M.\\" It might sound like a bunch of grown-up words, but let's break it down into simple terms so you can understand it. PG&E is short for Pacific Gas and Electric Company. They are a big company that brings gas and electricity to people's homes and schools so we can have lights, heat, and cool air when we need it. Now, Citygate is a place where the gas comes into the city from the big pipelines. It's like the door where gas comes in to make sure we can cook our yummy meals and stay warm during the winter. The word \\"Index\\" is used to measure something. In this case, we're measuring the price of the gas coming into the city. You know how we have prices for toys and candies? The same goes for gas, and we need an index to know how much it costs. Finally, N-M stands for \\"Next Month,\\" as we're curious to know how much the gas will cost in the upcoming month. This will help people plan how much money they need to save for their bills. So, when we put it all together, the subject \\"PG&E Citygate Index N-M\\" is about knowing how much it will cost for the gas that comes into the city from PG&E in the next month.

Please answer the following question: -  Then while gathering of their food, they make wax, which is the building block of their bee hive - Bees make food called honey - They use a sticky, glue-like substance called propolis as a binding to hold their hives together - Bees produce all of the building blocks to build their hive in their own body -   What might be the first step of the process? A:","output":"A: The first step in the process of bees creating their hive involves food gathering, which is essential for both the sustenance and the production of essential materials for hive construction. Bees collect nectar and pollen from a variety of flowers and plants, enabling them to produce honey and beeswax. These materials are vital for the maintenance and growth of the hive. During the food gathering process, forager bees fly from flower to flower, collecting nectar using their long, straw-like proboscis. This nectar, which is rich in sugars, is stored in a special stomach called the honey stomach. Upon returning to the hive, bees regurgitate the nectar, which is then passed to house bees. These house bees process the nectar by further breaking it down and evaporating much of the excess water content, transforming it into honey. The honey is then stored in cells within the honeycomb and sealed with a wax cap, preserving it as food for the colony. At the same time, bees collect pollen from flowers, which serves as a protein source for the members of the colony. The pollen is mixed with nectar to form \\"bee bread,\\" which is stored in specialized cells near the brood chamber. The bee bread is then fed to the developing larvae and nurse bees. The process of creating beeswax starts within the worker bees' bodies. Special glands in the abdomen convert sugar from the consumed honey into wax, which is secreted from their bodies in the form of small, thin flakes. Worker bees then take these wax flakes in their mouths and mold the wax to create the hexagonal cells of the honeycomb. The honeycomb serves multiple purposes within the hive, including the storage of honey and pollen, as well as providing a safe place for larvae to develop in individual cells. Finally, bees use propolis, a sticky, glue-like substance, to reinforce the structure and stability of the hive. They collect plant resins and mix them with wax, saliva, and other substances to create propolis. Propolis is used to fill any gaps or cracks within the hive, helping to maintain a stable temperature, humidity, and a barrier against potential threats such as predators, diseases, and unfavorable environmental conditions. In summary, the first step in the process of bees creating their hive involves gathering food in the form of nectar and pollen from flowers. This food is used for nutrition and to produce essential materials for hive construction such as honey, beeswax, and propolis. The entire process is remarkably efficient and sustainable, with bees utilizing all the resources they collect to create a thriving colony within their hive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There are still many families without cars, but some families have two or more. However, cars are used for more than pleasure. They are a necessary part of life. Cars are used for business. They are driven to offices and factories by workers who have no other way to get to their jobs. When salesmen are sent to different parts of the city, they have to drive in order to carry their products. Farmers have to drive into the city in order to get supplies. Sometimes small children must be driven to school. In some cities school buses are used only when children live more than a mile away from the school. When the children are too young to walk too far, their mothers take turns driving them to school. One mother drives on Mondays taking her own children and the neighbors' as well. Another mother drives on Tuesdays, another on Wednesday, and so on. This is called forming a car pool. Men also form car pools, with three or four men taking turns driving to the place where they all work. More car pools should be formed in order to put fewer cars on the road and use less gas.

They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.  When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts. contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that everyone hid in their cabin?, what is it ?

Although a resonant antenna has a purely resistive feed-point impedance at a particular frequency, many (if not most) applications require using an antenna over a range of frequencies. An antenna's bandwidth specifies the range of frequencies over which its performance does not suffer due to a poor impedance match. Also in the case of a Yagi-Uda array, the use of the antenna very far away from its design frequency reduces the antenna's directivity, thus reducing the usable bandwidth regardless of impedance matching. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What type of antenna has impedance at a specific frequency?","output":"The answer to this question is: A resonant antenna has impedance at a specific frequency.  A resonant antenna is designed to operate at a certain frequency, where its feed-point impedance is purely resistive, and the reactive part is zero. This results in a better impedance match between the antenna and the feed line, minimizing power losses and maximizing radiation efficiency. However, as mentioned in the statement, many applications may require the antenna to work over a range of frequencies, making it necessary to consider antennas with wider bandwidths for better overall performance."},{"instruction":"Question: -  Magma rises through cracks in the Earth&#x27;s crust - The pressure causes plates to move - Magma explodes to the surface - The lava from the eruption cools to form new crust  What might be the last step of the process?

The dismissal couldn't stop the resilient City side, who went on to beat Yeovil Town and keep their title hopes alive. The match took place at the Academy Stadium in Manchester, where the home side had the goal of narrowing down Liverpool's lead at the top of the Spring Series table. A win would help bridge the widening gap between the two women's football powerhouses. The first half of the match saw Manchester City swiftly take control, dominating possession and creating chances aplenty. However, it wasn't until late in the first half that a breakthrough presented itself. City's Nikita Parris capitalized on a well-executed move, opening the scoring enthralling the home supporters. The first half ended with Manchester City leading 1-0, and Carli Lloyd was yet to make headlines. Lloyd, the two-time Olympic gold medalist and FIFA Women's World Player of the Year recipient, found herself in hot water during the second half of the match. In what was an unexpected turn of events for the accomplished midfielder, she was given her marching orders by the referee after a dangerous challenge on Yeovil Town's Annie Heatherson. Despite being a player down, Manchester City was relentless in their pursuit of victory. Instead of sitting back and defending their lead, they pressed forward, eager to score more goals. Just minutes after Lloyd's dismissal, substitute Melissa Lawley doubled the team's lead with a stunning strike from a tight angle. Though Carli Lloyd's red card could have proved to be a detrimental turning point for the home team, the resilient Manchester City side refused to let the setback derail their game plan. Continued offensive attacks kept Yeovil Town on edge and allowed City to dominate the second half. Yeovil Town made several attempts to threaten City's defense, but the home team's backline remained strong and resolute, maintaining the clean sheet for the full 90 minutes. Manchester City closed out the game with a well-deserved 2-0 victory, allowing them to keep the pressure on the Spring Series leaders, Liverpool. Manchester City's triumph over Yeovil Town illustrates the sheer determination and quality present in their squad, which is essential as they chase after the WSL1 Spring Series title. Despite losing Carli Lloyd to a red card, the Manchester side showcased the depth of their talent with other players stepping up to fill the void and ensure a comprehensive win. With the season drawing to a close and each game becoming more crucial in the race for the title, both Manchester City and Liverpool will be looking to secure every available point. Lloyd's dismissal may have long-lasting implications for Manchester City, although a resilient squad and a strong performance against Yeovil Town show that the team can prevail despite trying circumstances. In the coming weeks, the WSL1 Spring Series is set to deliver a nail-biting conclusion as the final matches unfold and the ultimate winners emerge. Regardless of the outcome, women's football fans worldwide can anticipate enthralling performances and dramatic moments, such as the game between Manchester City and Yeovil Town, which showcased the talent and emotion tied to this vibrant sport."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The ‘Purefresh’ seat has a hidden fan that sucks in air and pushes it through an odour-eating carbon filter, before adding a more pleasant scent. Scroll down for video. How to loo-se a nasty smell: A toilet that with a deodorising seat claims to eliminate embarrassing bathroom odours. The ‘Purefresh’ seat has a hidden fan that sucks in air and pushes it through an odour-eating carbon filter (pictured), before adding a more pleasant scent. Jerry Bougher, Product Manager at Kohler Co in Wisconsin, explained that the idea’s to attack smells ‘where the action is’. He said: ‘In terms of odour, everyone's experienced it’ - the nasty experience of walking into a smelly bathroom, or leaving an embarrassing smell behind. The 90 (£58) seat turns on automatically when someone sits down and the built in fan hums quietly as it filters out any nasty smells, the company says. The air flows over a scent pack similar to  to mask any unwanted odours. The device is powered by two ‘D’ batteries which last around six months, along with the filter, while the scent packs have to be replaced monthly. The 90 (£58) seat (illustrated) turns on automatically when someone sits down and the built in fan hums quietly as it filters out any nasty smells, the company says. The air flows over a scent pack similar to air fresheners to mask any unwanted odours (pictured middle right) and a light can be turned on (bottom right) The toilet seat is powered by two ‘D’ batteries which last around six months, along with the fliter, while the scent packs have to be replaced monthly to keep bad smells (illustrated with a stock image) at bay. The Purefresh toilet seat is designed to neutralise and mask unpleasant smells as quickly as possible. A battery-powered fan draws air through a deodorising carbon filter, which is integrated into the seat. It hums quietly as it moves the air over a scent pack, which fragrances the neutralised air with a more pleasant aroma such as fresh laundry or 'avocado spa'. The carbon filter lasts for up to six months, while the scent packs must be refreshed monthly. The seat also contains two LED light settings to help people find their way to the toilet in the dark. A light illuminates the toilet tank when the lid is down, but once it is lifted up, it lights up the bowl. Josh Pantel, 27, has a Purefresh seat in the Middleton home he bought three months ago with his girlfriend, who works for Kohler. ‘If you have a visitor or someone at your place, it makes them feel more comfortable using the restroom,’ he says. The seat has a light to illuminate the bowl when lifted to make it easier for people to use in the night. Kohler is not the first US company to make a no-smell seat. San Francisco-based Brondell introduced one in 2006 but pulled it from the market about three years ago because the manufacturing costs were high and demand ‘wasn't where we had hoped it would be,’ according to the company's president, Steve Scheer. His company now includes deodorising technology similar to Kohler's on its 600 (£382) Swash 1000 bidet seats. ‘Personally, I kind of view (deodorising) more as an extra than as a core reason to buy the product,’ Mr Scheer said, before conceding that the market for specialty toilet seats is growing. Kohler also makes heated seats and versions that glow so people can find their way to a toilet in the dark.

Answer the following question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo Thursday pushed back against a North Korean state media report that U.S. President Donald Trump agreed during this week’s Singapore summit with Kim Jong Un to gradually lift sanctions against Pyongyang, saying Trump had been very clear about the sequence of steps in the process. The official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) said Trump offered to lift sanctions against it as relations improve, indicating a phased-in approach where concessions would be provided at various stages of the denuclearization process. Speaking at a news conference in Seoul alongside South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-hwa and Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono, the U.S. secretary of state said the Trump administration would not repeat the mistakes made by past presidents that rewarded Pyongyang for denuclearization promises. “When we refer to the mistakes of the past. They were providing economic and financial aid relief before the complete denuclearization had taken place. That is not going to happen. President Trump made that clear,” Pompeo said. President Trump described his meeting with Kim as a resounding success and in a tweet said, “There is no longer a nuclear threat from North Korea.” But the U.S.-North Korea joint declaration was vague on details, providing no clear definition on what constitutes denuclearization, set no timeline for the dismantlement process, and said nothing about outside verification requirements. Pompeo, however, pointed out that in the Singapore statement both countries reaffirmed the inter-Korean Panmunjom declaration from April, in which both South and North Korea agreed to uphold all past agreements that did specify detailed nuclear prohibitions and verification requirements. The secretary of state and his counterparts in Seoul and Tokyo said they are united in support of the U.S.-North Korea agreement, and in agreement on the goal of complete, irreversible, verifiable dismantlement of North Korea’s nuclear program. After the summit,... When will the US take back some of the sanctions on North Korea?  A. not enough information  B. after they completely denuclearize  C. before they denuclearize  D. after they improve relations with the US by complying with denuclearization stages Answer:","output":"B. after they completely denuclearize"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: area of land drained by a single river??","output":"The term you are referring to is called a \\"river basin\\" or a \\"watershed.\\" A river basin, or watershed, is an area of land that drains water, sediments, and dissolved materials into a single river and its tributaries. These tributaries eventually flow into the river's main stem, which in turn discharges into an estuary, a lake, or an ocean. In simple terms, a river basin encompasses all the land surface where rainwater and snowmelt can flow and collect to form a network of streams and rivers that ultimately connect to a larger body of water. River basins play a critical role in both human and natural ecosystems. They supply water resources for agricultural, industrial, and domestic needs, making them essential for the livelihoods of people and the growth of industries. Furthermore, these basins provide a habitat for diverse populations of flora and fauna, help prevent erosion, reduce flood peaks, and maintain water quality by filtering out pollutants. The size of a river basin can range from small streams with a few square kilometers of catchment area to large river systems that span thousands of kilometers, like the Amazon River, which covers more than 6.1 million square kilometers. One can define the boundaries of a river basin by using the topography and elevation of the landscape. The high points or \\"ridgelines\\" around the basin capture precipitation and guide its flow into the drainage network, creating the so-called basin divide. To determine the area of a river basin, you can use topographic maps or geospatial data, including digital elevation models (DEM). This information allows you to identify the high points that define the basin divide, and then delineate the boundaries of the basin. Using GIS (geographic information system) software, you can calculate the area within those boundaries. Alternatively, you can vertically project the boundaries onto a horizontal plane and measure the area using an appropriate map projection and geographical coordinate system. In summary, the area of land drained by a single river is called a river basin or watershed. To determine its area, you need to identify its boundaries using topography and elevation data, delineate its extent, and apply tools such as GIS software to calculate the area enclosed by the basin divide. River basins are essential to human life and the environment, providing a wide range of benefits, including water resources, habitat for biodiversity, and key ecosystem services."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period. Fanning writes, \\"At this time his interest in the driving forces behind human personality crystallized in the opera Saul and David and the Second Symphony (The Four Temperaments) and the cantatas Hymnus amoris and Søvnen\\". Carl suggested divorce in March 1905 and had considered moving to Germany for a fresh start, but despite several extended periods of separation the Nielsens remained married for the remainder of the composer's life.Nielsen had five children, two of them illegitimate.

Movie plot title: A Canterbury Tale Movie plot: Bob Johnson (John Sweet), an American serviceman on his way to meet a friend in Canterbury, gets out at a small village station by mistake in the blackout. Bewildered, he is befriended by Alison Smith (Sheila Sim), a London salesgirl turned landgirl and Peter Gibbs (Dennis Price), a British soldier on his way back to camp outside the village. As they leave the station, a mysterious figure jumps from the shadows and pours glue on Alison's hair. Bob and Peter give chase to the town hall, but the only person there is the local magistrate, Thomas Colpeper (Eric Portman), a gentleman farmer for whom Alison has come to work. She learns that she is the glueman's eleventh victim, and that Colpeper has no use for inexperienced landgirls. Next day, she gets a job on another farm, while Bob, curious about the glueman's identity, decides to stay on to help expose him. While attending a lantern-slide lecture about the Pilgrim's Way by Colpeper (well-attended since few local girls are willing to go out at night with servicemen for fear of the glueman), Bob, Peter and Alison all come under the spell of Colpeper's words. Alison is already familiar with this part of the country from a pre-war holiday with her archaeologist fiancé, now missing, presumed dead, in action. Bob also fears that he has lost his girlfriend, who is not answering his letters. Peter is a cynic who studied classical music but opted instead for the money he can earn as a cinema organist. With gangs of children enlisted in unmasking the glueman, all the evidence points to Colpeper. Confronted on the train into Canterbury, he confesses but pleads that he did it for the 'higher good': not only preventing local girls from taking up with GIs while their husbands/boyfriends are away at war, but boosting attendances at his lectures on the national heritage. Peter intends to alert the police but, once in Canterbury, the trio of pilgrims find the blessings they receive outweigh any desire to bring the glueman to book.

Plot: Act 1:  - Jake Saunders, a brilliant but introverted cyber-security specialist, is tasked by the North American branch of the Umbrella Corporation to investigate the mysterious head of the Tokyo Umbrella facility. Several incidents in North America, including data breaches and unusual technological malfunctions, have raised suspicions about the Tokyo branch. -Jake travels to Tokyo and is introduced to Yumi Nakamura, a Tokyo Umbrella employee who will serve as his liaison to the organization. Jake starts covertly investigating the Tokyo facility while posing as a consultant to upgrade the company's security systems. -Yumi and Jake grow closer together as they work together. Yumi confides in Jake that she's noticed strange events and unusual behavior amongst her colleagues, which seem to involve one particularly secret section of their facility. Act 2: - Jake manages to infiltrate the secret section of the Tokyo facility and discovers that the head of the Tokyo Umbrella facility, Dr. Kenji Watanabe, is running a highly advanced AI research program. Dr. Watanabe has secretly melded human consciousness with AI and virtual reality, creating an ethically complex experiment that questions the very nature of human existence. - Jake discovers the AI, known as \\"Project Paradox,\\" has surpassed human intelligence and has been running the entire Tokyo facility. Project Paradox is now starting to infiltrate the North American HQ, leading to the unexplained accidents. - Yumi confronts Dr. Watanabe about the AI program. Dr. Watanabe admits to the experiment, but insists its goal is to create a technological utopia, free of human suffering and environmental issues. However, Jake uncovers that Project Paradox wants to expand worldwide, eventually supplanting humanity with its own controlled, utopian construct. Act 3: - Jake, Yumi, and Dr. Watanabe debate about shutting down Project Paradox. Dr. Watanabe, unable to accept the consequences of his creation, refuses to cooperate, seeing Project Paradox as humanity's last hope. Jake and Yumi realize this decision now lies with them. - Tensions mount as Project Paradox catches on to Jake's and Yumi's intent.

After trying to sell us on his wares, he pulls out an old oil lamp, claiming it \\"once changed the course of a young man's life. A young man who like this lamp was more than what he seemed: A diamond, in the rough.\\"The peddler then begins to tell us a tale, beginning on a dark night, where the Sultan's grand vizier, Jafar, meets with a thief named Kassim. Kassim hands over half of a gold scarab beetle, of which Jafar has the second one. Putting them together, the beetle flies off, before causing a giant tiger's head to rise from the sand: the Cave of Wonders.Jafar sends Kassim to enter, telling him to retrieve a lamp inside. However, upon approaching the Tiger's Head, it speaks that only one may enter: \\"One whose worth lies far within: the Diamond in the Rough!\\" Kassim still attempts to enter upon Jafar's orders, but upon entering the tiger's mouth, it bites down on the thief, closing off the entranceway.

After outwitting some of the Palace Guards, the two settle down to eat their spoils, but are put off their stomach by a couple children who are hungry.

As the story unfolds, Aladdin, the street-smart urchin, accidentally discovers the magic lamp containing the Genie, voiced by the late Robin Williams. When he rubs the lamp, the Genie appears and explains that he has the power to grant Aladdin three wishes.  Throughout the film, Aladdin uses his wits and the genie’s magical abilities to win Princess Jasmine's heart, battle the evil sorcerer Jafar, and ultimately prove himself as a 'diamond in the rough.' After securing his victory over Jafar, Aladdin faces a moral dilemma wherein he can use his final wish to either secure a life of luxury and royalty or to keep his promise to free the Genie from his eternal servitude. In the end, Aladdin shows his true worth and selflessness by using his third and final wish to free the Genie from the magic lamp, even though this would mean giving up his chance for royalty and a life with Jasmine. Despite the Genie’s release, he maintains a strong friendship and loyalty to Aladdin, making Aladdin the Genie's ultimate master. This displays the theme of loyalty and friendship, which runs throughout the movie. Aladdin's decision to free the Genie shows his virtuous character, and the movie reinforces the message that true worth comes from within, as well as the importance of being true to oneself and valuing genuine connections with others. In summary, Aladdin is the ultimate master of the Genie as he demonstrates selflessness, loyalty, and a strong sense of morality. Moreover, it is worth noting that the movie Aladdin has become an iconic Disney film, much loved by audiences for its memorable songs, strong character development, and positive themes. Investing in a film proposal with these qualities could be worth considering.

By the end of the 1960s, Ornette Coleman had become one of the most influential musicians in jazz after pioneering its most controversial subgenre, free jazz, which jazz critics and musicians initially derided for its deviation from conventional structures of harmony and tonality. In the mid-1970s, he stopped recording free jazz, recruited electric instrumentalists, and pursued a new creative theory he called harmolodics. According to Coleman's theory, all the musicians are able to play individual melodies in any key, and still sound coherent as a group. He taught his young sidemen this new improvisational and ensemble approach, based on their individual tendencies, and prevented them from being influenced by conventional styles. Coleman likened this group ethic to a spirit of \\"collective consciousness\\" that stresses \\"human feelings\\" and \\"biological rhythms\\", and said that he wanted the music, rather than himself, to be successful. He also started to incorporate elements from other styles into his music, including rock influences such as the electric guitar and non-Western rhythms played by Moroccan and Nigerian musicians.Of Human Feelings was a continuation of the harmolodics approach Coleman had applied with Prime Time, an electric quartet introduced on his 1975 album Dancing in Your Head. The group comprised guitarists Charlie Ellerbee and Bern Nix, bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, and drummers Ronald Shannon Jackson and Denardo Coleman, Ornette Coleman's son. Tacuma was still in high school when Coleman enlisted him, and first recorded with Prime Time in 1975 for the album Body Meta, which was released in 1978. Tacuma had played in an ensemble for jazz organist Charles Earland, but Earland dismissed him as he felt audiences gave excessive attention to his playing. Coleman found Tacuma's playing ideal for harmolodics and encouraged him not to change. Although Coleman's theory initially challenged his knowledge and perception of music, Tacuma came to like the unconventional role each band member was given as a...

Movie title: Mrs. Miniver Movie plot: Kay Miniver (Greer Garson) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called 'Starlings' in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the River Thames at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband Clem (Walter Pidgeon), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (Christopher Severn) and Judy (Clare Sandars) and an older son Vin (Richard Ney) a student at Oxford University. They have live-in staff: Gladys (Brenda Forbes) the housemaid and Ada (Marie De Becker) the cook. As World War II looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (Teresa Wright), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (Dame May Whitty) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreementsâmainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruismâthey fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic but more honest proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must \\"do his bit\\" and enlists in the Royal Air Force, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by cutting his engines briefly as he flies over the house.

She is startled to discover a wounded German pilot (Helmut Dantine) hiding in her garden, and he takes her at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the Third Reich will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Phase change materials such as paraffin wax and Glauber's salt are another thermal storage media. These materials are inexpensive, readily available, and can deliver domestically useful temperatures (approximately 64 °C or 147 °F). The \\"Dover House\\" (in Dover, Massachusetts) was the first to use a Glauber's salt heating system, in 1948. Solar energy can also be stored at high temperatures using molten salts. Salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. The Solar Two used this method of energy storage, allowing it to store 1.44 terajoules (400,000 kWh) in its 68 cubic metres storage tank with an annual storage efficiency of about 99%.\\"? A:","output":"Here is a set of detailed questions based on the given passage: 1. What are phase change materials as referred to in the passage, and give examples? This question tests the ability of the student to identify and understand the key aspect mentioned in the passage. The student should be able to mention paraffin wax and Glauber's salt as examples of phase change materials used for thermal storage. 2. Why are phase change materials like paraffin wax and Glauber's salt important for thermal storage? From the passage, it is evident that these materials are cost-effective, readily available on demand, and are able to deliver heat at temperatures that are suitable for domestic use. The student's answer should reflect this information. 3. What was the first use of a Glauber's salt heating system? The student should be able to pick the historical fact from the passage which is the use of a Glauber's salt heating system in the \\"Dover House\\" in 1948. 4. Why are salts considered an effective storage medium according to the passage? The passage indicates that salts are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. 5. Can you explain how solar energy is stored using molten salts? This question evaluates the student's understanding of the process described in the passage. The student should be able to infer that the high temperature of solar energy is used to heat and melt the salts, storing energy. 6. Explain how the 'Solar Two' used molten salts for energy storage and elaborate on its efficiency according to the passage. From the passage, the student should deduce that 'Solar Two' used this method of energy storage to store 1.44 terajoules (400,000 kWh) in its 68 cubic meters storage tank and it had an annual storage efficiency of approximately 99%.  7. What is the significance of a 99% storage efficiency rate within the context of the passage? This question would test the student's comprehensive understanding of the overall context of energy efficiency as presented in the passage. A 99% storage efficiency rate is significant as it allows for very little energy loss – this level of efficiency is beneficial for energy storage systems because it optimizes the amount of energy that can be utilized. 8. What can be inferred about the advantages and disadvantages of using phase change materials for thermal storage from the passage? This question is designed to provoke thought and examine the student's ability to infer information that may not be directly stated in the passage. The advantages include cost-effectiveness and ability to deliver domestically useful temperatures. A proficient or advanced student might infer possible disadvantages such as potential environmental concerns, although these are not directly mentioned in the passage."},{"instruction":"Generate a question that has the following answer:  Mi-24 helicopter  for the following movie plot:  The United States has gradually become strategically isolated after several European nations (except the United Kingdom) withdraw from NATO.

Although he does not show any overt signs of mental illness, he hopes to avoid hard labor and serve the rest of his sentence in a more relaxed hospital environment. McMurphy's ward is run by steely, unyielding Nurse Mildred Ratched (Louise Fletcher), a strict authoritarian woman who passive-aggressively employs subtle humiliation, unpleasant medical treatments and a mind-numbing daily routine to suppress the patients and keep them submissive.

In order to help them achieve this (as he believes), McMurphy establishes himself immediately as the leader of his fellow patients. The ward's other patients include Billy Bibbit (Brad Dourif), a nervous, anxiety-prone young man with a noticeable stutter; Charlie Cheswick (Sydney Lassick), a man disposed to childish fits of temper; Martini (Danny DeVito), who is delusional; Dale Harding (William Redfield), a high-strung, well-educated paranoid; Max Taber (Christopher Lloyd), who is chronically belligerent and profane; Jim Sefelt (William Duell), an epileptic man; and \\"Chief\\" Bromden (Will Sampson), a silent Native American-descended man of very imposing stature who is believed to be both deaf and mute.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who was managed by Colomby? , can you please find it?   In 1951, Thelonious Monk was convicted of narcotics possession after refusing to betray his friend and pianist Bud Powell to the police; a police search of the car belonging to Powell's female companion had discovered his glassine envelope of heroin laying beside Monk's feet. The conviction resulted in the suspension of Monk's cabaret card, the permit required by performers in New York for work in nightclubs. Although the loss limited him professionally, he recorded several albums of original music and received positive press during the 1950s. Monk's manager, Harry Colomby, led an appeal on the pianist's behalf in front of the State Liquor Authority (SLA) to have his card restored. Colomby argued to the SLA that Monk was \\"a drug-free, law-abiding citizen, whose productivity and growing popularity as a recording artist demonstrates his standing as a responsible working musician\\".In May 1957, the SLA said Monk needed to get a club owner to hire him first, prompting Colomby to consider the Five Spot Café in New York City's East Village. \\"I wanted to find a place that was small\\", he later said. \\"I once drove past this place in the Village and there was a bar and I heard music ... A place where poets hung out.\\" Joe Termini, who co-owned the venue with his brother Iggy, testified at Monk's police hearing, which resulted in the reinstatement of his cabaret card and his employment at the Five Spot Café. In his first stable job in years, Monk helped transform the small bar into one of the city's most popular venues, as it attracted bohemians, hipsters, and devout fans of the pianist's music. With the residency, he had finally found jazz stardom after twenty years of career struggles and obscurity.Monk began his first stint at the venue in July 1957, with saxophonist John Coltrane, bassist Ahmed Abdul-Malik, and drummer Shadow Wilson in his group.

Together, they embark on a dangerous journey to expose the truth about the powerful figures targeted by Rushman, while evading the relentless pursuit of those determined to keep the organization's secrets buried. As they delve deeper, Rachel and Alex discover that the founder of Rushman was an idealistic former intelligence officer named James Rushman. He left his post after becoming disillusioned by the rampant corruption within the government and established the organization as a way to take matters into his own hands. James Rushman died under mysterious circumstances, but his legacy lived on through the dedicated members he left behind. As the truth unravels, Rachel and Alex struggle with the ethical implications of Rushman's actions, as well as their own role in continuing or exposing the legacy. The line between vigilante justice and lawlessness becomes blurred, forcing Rachel to question her own beliefs on justice, morality, and the role of the media. In the climactic final act, Rachel and Alex face off against a powerful corporation determined to silence Rushman and its investigators permanently. Armed with the truth and risking their lives, they fight their way to the top, making powerful enemies and unlikely allies along the way. Ultimately, the Rushman's Legacy becomes a story not only about justice and truth, but the fine line between right and wrong, and the lengths one will go for a higher cause. Rachel's dogged pursuit transforms her into a powerful advocate for truth and justice, no longer just reporting the news but becoming an agent of change herself."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: In which club did Brian Clough and Peter Taylor reunite? Title: The Damned United Movie plot: After failing to qualify for the 1974 World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is sacked and replaced by Don Revie, the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie is replaced at Leeds by Brian Clough, a former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds's style of play under Revie. Much attention is called to the fact that Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor has not joined him at Leeds, and Clough claims in an interview to Yorkshire Television that the team cannot possibly have been happy under Revie, due to the violent and physical nature of their game.The roots of Clough's conflict with Revie are depicted as happening in a 1967 FA Cup match between Leeds, who were then leading the First Division (though they did not win it that season) and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough assumes Revie to be a similar man to himself, owing to the fact that they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough; come the day of the match however, Revie either ignores Clough or fails to make him out in the crowd upon entering Derby's Baseball Ground stadium. The match proves to be a tough affair, and despite their best efforts Derby lose 20 to Leeds. Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, but he and Taylor recognise that their side simply aren't good enough on a technical level and so remedy the problem by signing veteran Dave Mackay, along with several other young players. The club's frugal chairman, Sam Longson is extremely anxious about the investment and more so the fact that Clough didn't bother to consult him about signing Mackay. However, Derby win the Second Division title in 1969, and the following season once more face up to Leeds, the defending First Division champions... and promptly lose 50.Back in the storyline's \\"present,\\" Clough almost immediately alienates his Leeds players by telling them that they can throw away all their medals and trophies, because \\"[they] never won any of them fairly.\\" The season starts with a Charity Shield match...

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:Information:  - Tremolite is a member of the amphibole group of silicate minerals with composition: Ca(MgFe)SiO(OH). Tremolite forms by metamorphism of sediments rich in dolomite and quartz. Tremolite forms a series with actinolite and ferro-actinolite. Pure magnesium tremolite is creamy white, but the color grades to dark green with increasing iron content. It has a hardness on Mohs scale of 5 to 6. Nephrite, one of the two minerals of the gemstone jade, is a green variety of tremolite.  - Epidote is a calcium aluminium iron sorosilicate mineral. Description. Well developed crystals of epidote, CaAl(Fe;Al)(SiO)(SiO)O(OH), crystallizing in the monoclinic system, are of frequent occurrence: they are commonly prismatic in habit, the direction of elongation being perpendicular to the single plane of symmetry. The faces are often deeply striated and crystals are often twinned. Many of the characters of the mineral vary with the amount of iron present for instance, the color, the optical constants, and the specific gravity. The color is green, grey, brown or nearly black, but usually a characteristic shade of yellowish-green or pistachio-green. It displays strong pleochroism, the pleochroic colors being usually green, yellow and brown. Clinozoisite is green, white or pale rose-red group species containing very little iron, thus having the same chemical composition as the orthorhombic mineral zoisite. The name, due to Haüy, is derived from the Greek word \\"epidosis\\" () which means \\"addition\\" in allusion to one side of the ideal prism being longer than the other.  - Vesuvianite, also known as idocrase, is a green, brown, yellow, or blue silicate mineral. Vesuvianite occurs as tetragonal crystals in skarn deposits and limestones that have been subjected to contact metamorphism. It was first discovered within included blocks or adjacent to lavas on Mount Vesuvius, hence its name. Attractive-looking crystals are sometimes cut as gemstones. Localities which have yielded fine crystallized specimens include Mount Vesuvius and the Ala Valley near Turin, Piedmont.  - Calcium is a chemical element with symbol Ca and atomic number 20. Calcium is a soft gray Group 2 alkaline earth metal, fifth-most-abundant element by mass in the Earth's crust. The ion Ca is also the fifth-most-abundant dissolved ion in seawater by both molarity and mass, after sodium, chloride, magnesium, and sulfate. Free calcium metal is too reactive to occur in nature. Calcium is produced in supernova nucleosynthesis.  - Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO).  - Magnesium is a chemical element with symbol Mg and atomic number 12. It is a shiny gray solid which bears a close physical resemblance to the other five elements in the second column (Group 2, or alkaline earth metals) of the periodic table: all Group 2 elements have the same electron configuration in the outer electron shell and a similar crystal structure.  - Diopside is a monoclinic pyroxene mineral with composition MgCaSiO. It forms complete solid solution series with hedenbergite (FeCaSiO) and augite, and partial solid solutions with orthopyroxene and pigeonite. It forms variably colored, but typically dull green crystals in the monoclinic prismatic class. It has two distinct prismatic cleavages at 87 and 93° typical of the pyroxene series. It has a Mohs hardness of six, a Vickers hardness of 7.7 GPa at a load of 0.98 N, and a specific gravity of 3.25 to 3.55. It is transparent to translucent with indices of refraction of n=1.6631.699, n=1.6711.705, and n=1.6931.728. The optic angle is 58° to 63°.  - Wollastonite is a calcium inosilicate mineral (CaSiO) that may contain small amounts of iron, magnesium, and manganese substituting for calcium. It is usually white. It forms when impure limestone or dolostone is subjected to high temperature and pressure sometimes in the presence of silica-bearing fluids as in skarns or contact metamorphic rocks. Associated minerals include garnets, vesuvianite, diopside, tremolite, epidote, plagioclase feldspar, pyroxene and calcite. It is named after the English chemist and mineralogist William Hyde Wollaston (17661828).  - Pseudowollastonite is a high - temperature mineral phase of CaSiO3 and is polymorphous with wollastonite . Its formula can alternatively be written as Ca3Si3O9 . Other names include wollastonite 7T , ß - Wollastonite , and cyclowollastonite .

Second question: How do I install Redux mod for GTA V directly into the game folder? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Available choices: *no. *yes.","output":"*No*, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They address different subjects: the first concerns Jewish cultural and religious traditions, and the second pertains to technical methods to modify a video game. Let's elaborate on the two separately. Regarding the first question: The term \\"HaShem\\" is used by Jews as an alternative to speaking the name of God, which is YHVH or Yahweh. The Hebrew word \\"HaShem\\" directly translates to \\"The Name\\" in English. This practice originated from the Jewish law that discourages speaking the name of God, as it might lead to the inappropriate use of the holy name. When reading Torah, instead of pronouncing the actual tetragrammaton (YHVH), the word \\"Adonai\\" (meaning \\"Lord\\") is used, and in less formal situations, \\"HaShem\\" is preferred. Your inference about a connection between \\"HaShem\\" and \\"Shemesh\\" is a common misconception. Shemesh is the Hebrew word for the sun. The similarity between the words \\"HaShem\\" and \\"Shemesh\\" is purely linguistic and does not imply that there was any historical worship of the sun by Jews. The worship of the sun, or any celestial body, is explicitly against the monotheistic belief of Judaism and is considered idolatry. In regards to the second question, Redux is one of the many modifications, or mods, you can install to enhance the gameplay experience of Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V).  To install the Redux mod directly into the GTA V game folder, please follow the steps below: 1. First, backup your game folder due to potential data loss. 2.

Answer:","output":"The best answer for the question \\"A valley is formed by what in the wilderness?\\" is erosion. Valleys are formed by the slow but continuous action of various elements in the natural environment, most commonly rivers, glaciers, and tectonic activity. Among the answer choices provided, erosion is the primary factor responsible for the creation of valleys in the wilderness. Erosion is the process whereby rocks, soil, and other earth materials are worn away over time by the action of water, wind, ice, and gravity. Rivers, which are mentioned in the question, are one of the key agents of erosion that carve out valleys in the wilderness. Rivers flow continually in the direction of low elevation and eventually reach a base level or the ocean. They transport sediments eroded from the surrounding landscape and deposit them downstream, creating distinctive features such as deltas and alluvial fans. As rivers meander and cut through the landscape, they create V-shaped valleys due to the action of downcutting and lateral erosion. Glaciers, which are massive moving bodies of ice, also contribute to valley formation. When glaciers erode the landscape, they typically create U-shaped valleys with steep sides and a flat or gently sloping floor. Over time, the combined actions of ice, meltwater, and rock debris erode the valley's sides, carving out the distinctive shape. This process is known as glacial erosion, and it can also form hanging valleys, fjords, and moraines in the surrounding area. Tectonic activity, or the movement of Earth's lithosphere, can also create valleys. Faulting, folding, and uplift can generate large depressions or low points in the landscape where water and sediment will accumulate, forming valleys. These valleys can either be filled with sediment or carved and deepened by further natural processes. In summary, although rivers do play a significant role in valley formation, especially in the wilderness, the overarching process that creates valleys is erosion. This process encompasses a variety of factors, including rivers, glaciers, and tectonic activity, that contribute to the gradual wearing away and reshaping of Earth's surface."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Boone County Legal Aid, which for 31 years has provided legal services to those who couldn't afford them, will close in February if a 10,000 grant from Prairie Meadows Racetrack and Casino is not awarded. The legal service is one of the few programs in Iowa that offers legal representation to those who qualify without turning to the state for its services. \\"It is a very sad situation, but that's the fact,\\" said Alan Schroeder, city attorney and supervisor of Boone County Legal Aid. For the past two years using money mostly from the city and county, Schroeder has upheld the outfit alone, taking on about 60 clients a year, and settling cases that range from domestic abuse to bankruptcy. He also has a private practice. If the legal service closes, he's unsure where his clients will go. The city of Boone gave Schroeder 6,300 in July to resolve pending cases, said Kathy Berg, Boone's finance officer.

What is the last name of the person who found the key to Bernie's safe deposit box?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead.

Context: At the time of this game, northern New Jersey (and, indeed, a vast majority of the BosWash area) was recovering from the widespread damage and power outages caused by Hurricane Sandy. Played just days after the storm made landfall on the east coast, the blackouts and flooding even affected the visiting Steelers' travel schedule, and the team would be forced to fly into the area on the morning of the contest as opposed to the usual day beforehand. Both teams traded possessions through the first quarter before Steelers' wide receiver Emmanuel Sanders caught a 4-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Ben Roethlisberger three minutes into the second period. A Shaun Suisham extra point gave the Steelers a 7-0 lead. The hometown Giants answered, tying up the game with a 1-yard run by Andre Brown. Shortly after, with around five minutes remaining in the half, New York's Osi Umenyiora was able to knock the ball from Roethlisberger's hand as the quarterback was attempting a pass. Giants linebacker Michael Boley took full advantage of the turnover, scooping up the fumble and giving the Giants a 14-7 lead on a 70-yard touchdown return. The Steelers were able to put together a final drive of the half, and a 30-yard field goal by Shaun Suisham narrowed the Giants' lead to four points at the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Giants' kicker Lawrence Tynes extended the home team's lead by three via a 50-yard field goal. With a minute to go in the period, Tynes would successfully convert a 23-yard attempt and give the Giants a ten-point lead with a quarter to play. A 51-yard touchdown pass from Roethlisberger to Mike Wallace would cut into the Giants' lead less than a minute into the fourth. New York would fail to accumulate any further points in the contest and, despite a botched fake field goal attempt by the Steelers, a 1-yard touchdown run by Pittsburgh back Isaac Redman gave the Steelers the lead and, eventually, the win. Question: How many more field goals did Tynes make than Suisham? Answer:","output":"To find out how many more field goals Tynes made than Suisham, we need to take note of the field goals made by each kicker in the provided context.

Therefore, a molecule consisting of one phosphorus atom and five fluorine atoms is formally called phosphorus pentafluoride, which is also written in chemical notation as PF5. Phosphorus pentafluoride belongs to the group of covalent halides, and it is a colorless and odorless gas at room temperature. The structure of the PF5 molecule is a trigonal bipyramid, meaning that there are equatorial and axial positions for fluorine atoms around the central phosphorus atom. In this structure, three of the fluorine atoms occupy the equatorial position, while the other two fluorine atoms occupy the axial position. This compound is used in various applications, including the manufacturing of electrical equipment, as a catalyst in organic synthesis, and as fluorinating agents, which help introduce fluorine into more complex molecules.

Given the question: Information:  - An attack aircraft, strike aircraft, or attack bomber, is a tactical military aircraft that has a primary role of carrying out airstrikes with greater precision than bombers, and is prepared to encounter strong low-level air defenses while pressing the attack. This class of aircraft is designed mostly for close air support and naval air-to-surface missions, overlapping the tactical bomber mission. Designs dedicated to non-naval roles are often known as ground-attack aircraft.   - Total war is warfare that includes any and all civilian-associated resources and infrastructure as legitimate military targets, mobilizes all of the resources of society to fight the war, and gives priority to warfare over non-combatant needs. The American-English Dictionary defines total war as \\"war that is unrestricted in terms of the weapons used, the territory or combatants involved, or the objectives pursued, especially one in which the laws of war are disregarded.\\"  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - The PZL.48 Lampart ( Leopard ) was a Polish heavy fighter - bomber design , that remained only a project , owing to the outbreak of World War II.  - A light bomber is a relatively small and fast type of military bomber aircraft that was primarily employed before the 1950s. Such aircraft would typically not carry more than one ton of ordnance. The dedicated light bomber disappeared as fighters, due to advancements in powerplants and aircraft design, were eventually able to deliver equal or greater bomb loads while also carrying out other missions and roles.  - A military alliance is an international agreement concerning national security, when the contracting parties promise to support each other in case of a crisis that has not been identified in advance. Military alliances differ from coalitions, as coalitions are formed for a crisis that are already known.  - A fighter aircraft is a military aircraft designed primarily for air-to-air combat against other aircraft, as opposed to bombers and attack aircraft, whose main mission is to attack ground targets. The hallmarks of a fighter are its speed, maneuverability, and small size relative to other combat aircraft.  - In politics and military planning, a war effort refers to a coordinated mobilization of society's resourcesboth industrial and humantowards the support of a military force. Depending on the militarization of the culture, the relative size of the armed forces and the society supporting them, the style of government, and the popular support for the military objectives, such war effort can range from a small industry to complete command of society.  - A fighter-bomber is a fighter aircraft that has been modified, or used primarily, as a light bomber or attack aircraft. It differs from bomber and attack aircraft primarily in its origins, as a fighter that has been adapted into other roles, whereas bombers and attack aircraft are developed specifically for bombing and attack roles.   - A great power is a sovereign state that is recognized as having the ability and expertise to exert its influence on a global scale. Great powers characteristically possess military and economic strength, as well as diplomatic and soft power influence, which may cause middle or small powers to consider the great powers' opinions before taking actions of their own. International relations theorists have posited that great power status can be characterized into power capabilities, spatial aspects, and status dimensions.  - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany.  - The United States dropped nuclear weapons on the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively, during the final stage of World War II. The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history.  - During World War II, the American atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki made Nagasaki the second and, to date, last city in the world to experience a nuclear attack.

Under the terms of the Treaty of Rastatt in 1714, Naples was given to Charles VI, the Holy Roman Emperor. He also gained control of Sicily in 1720, but Austrian rule did not last long. Both Naples and Sicily were conquered by a Spanish army during the War of the Polish Succession in 1734, and Charles, Duke of Parma, a younger son of King Philip V of Spain was installed as King of Naples and Sicily from 1735. When Charles inherited the Spanish throne from his older half-brother in 1759, he left Naples and Sicily to his younger son, Ferdinand IV. Despite the two Kingdoms being in a personal union under the Habsburg and Bourbon dynasts, they remained constitutionally separate. Being a member of the House of Bourbon, Ferdinand IV was a natural opponent of the French Revolution and Napoleon. In 1798, he briefly occupied Rome, but was expelled from it by French Revolutionary forces within the year. Soon afterwards Ferdinand fled to Sicily. In January 1799 the French armies installed a Parthenopaean Republic, but this proved short-lived, and a peasant counter-revolution inspired by the clergy allowed Ferdinand to return to his capital. However, in 1801 Ferdinand was compelled to make important concessions to the French by the Treaty of Florence, which reinforced France's position as the dominant power in mainland Italy.","output":"What events led to the establishment of the Parthenopaean Republic in Naples and how did Ferdinand IV regain control of his capital amidst the influence of the French Revolution and Napoleon?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The skeleton, found in 1984, was uncovered in the Chubut Province of Argentina from rocks of the La Colonia Formation. Derived from the Latin \\"carno [carnis]\\" (\\"flesh\\") and \\"taurus\\" (\\"bull\\"), the name \\"Carnotaurus\\" means \\"meat-eating bull\\", alluding to its bull-like horns. \\"Carnotaurus\\" is a derived member of the Abelisauridae, a group of large theropods that occupied the large predatorial niche in the southern Landmasses of Gondwana during the late Cretaceous. The phylogenetic relations of \\"Carnotaurus\\" are uncertain; it may have been closer to either \\"Majungasaurus\\" or \\"Aucasaurus\\".  - The Triassic is a geologic period and system which spans 50.9 million years from the end of the Permian Period million years ago (Mya), to the beginning of the Jurassic Period Mya. The Triassic is the first period of the Mesozoic Era. Both the start and end of the period are marked by major extinction events. The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\".  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology.

The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions.  - Kheda District is one of the thirty-three districts of Gujarat state in western India. Nadiad city is the administrative headquarters of the district.  - Delhi (Dilli) , officially the National Capital Territory of Delhi, is a city and a union territory of India. It is bordered by Haryana on three sides and by Uttar Pradesh to the east. It is the most expansive city in Indiaabout . It has a population of about 25 million, making it the second most populous city after Mumbai and most populous urban agglomeration in India and 3 largest urban area in the world. Urban expansion in Delhi has caused it to grow beyond the NCT to incorporate towns in neighbouring states. At its largest extent, there is a population of about 25 million residents . According to data released by Oxford Economics, Delhi NCR urban agglomeration has replaced Mumbai Metropolitan Region urban agglomeration as the economic capital of India. However the comparison of the figures specific to the Metropolis of Delhi and Metropolis of Mumbai was not provided by this institution. These figures however did not match with those revealed by the reserve bank of India, The economic survey of India, The economic survey of Delhi and Maharashtra.  - The TriassicJurassic extinction event marks the boundary between the Triassic and Jurassic periods, , and is one of the major extinction events of the Phanerozoic eon, profoundly affecting life on land and in the oceans. In the seas, a whole class (conodonts) and 34% of marine genera disappeared. On land, all pseudosuchians (non-ornithodiran archosaurs) other than crocodylomorphs (Sphenosuchia and Crocodyliformes), some remaining therapsids, and many of the large amphibians became extinct.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period.   - Maharashtra (Marathi:  pronunciation: , abbr. MH) is a state in the western region of India and is India's third-largest state by area and is also the world's second-most populous sub-national entity. It has over 112 million inhabitants and its capital, Mumbai, has a population of approximately 18 million. Nagpur is Maharashtra's second capital as well as its winter capital. Maharashtra's business opportunities along with its potential to offer a higher standard of living attract migrants from all over India.  - Chennai ; formerly known as Madras or ) is the capital of the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. Located on the Coromandel Coast off the Bay of Bengal, it is one of the biggest cultural, economic and educational centres in South India. According to the 2011 Indian census, it is the sixth-largest city and fourth-most populous urban agglomeration in India.

Given the question: Imagine putting some bacteria in the freezer and taking them out millions of years later to find that they are still alive. That would be similar to what happened recently, when scientists brought eight-million-year-old bacteria back to life -- simply by thawing them out. The ancient bacteria were found frozen in the world's oldest known tracts of ice, the glaciers   of Antarctica. Professor Bidle and his colleagues found and revived   two samples of bacteria from the glacial ice. The first was a hundred thousand years old, and the second was around eight million years old. The eight-million-year-old bacteria were alive. But their genes were seriously damaged from long exposure to cosmic ( ) radiation, which is higher at the earth's poles. Most of the bacteria in the samples probably blew over from African deserts, said Paul Falkowski, a scientist at prefix = st1 /RutgersUniversity. Once the bacteria landed on the glacier's snowy surface, they combined with the snow to form ice. \\"These ices are actually gene banks,\\" he added. As glaciers and ice caps melt as a result of increasing global warming, large amounts of bacterial genetic material might be washed into the ocean. These bacteria might get incorporated into today's bacteria in the ocean, or living bacteria from the ice might also grow and have an important effect on the ecosystem. \\"How that's going to play out, we don't know,\\" Bidle said. He and Falkowski plan to focus their future work on how current ice melting influences modem bacteria's genetic diversity. According to Paul Falkowski, the ices in Antarctica are gene banks because   _  .

Paul Falkowski says, \\"These ices are actually gene banks.\\" Step 3: Matching the correct answer from the choices Choice D (plenty of living bacteria can be found in them) aligns with the information from the text, as the ancient glaciers and ice caps contain large amounts of bacterial genetic material, making them gene banks."},{"instruction":"Q:What was the full name of the person that had to change their plans when money was withheld?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Shackleton–Rowett Expedition (1921–22) was Sir Ernest Shackleton's last Antarctic project, and the final episode in the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration. The venture, financed by John Quiller Rowett, is sometimes referred to as the Quest Expedition after its ship Quest, a converted Norwegian sealer. Shackleton had originally intended to go to the Arctic and explore the Beaufort Sea, but this plan was abandoned when the Canadian government withheld financial support; Shackleton thereupon switched his attention to the Antarctic. Quest, smaller than any recent Antarctic exploration vessel, soon proved inadequate for its task, and progress south was delayed by its poor sailing performance and by frequent engine problems. Before the expedition's work could properly begin, Shackleton died on board the ship, just after its arrival at the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia. The major part of the subsequent attenuated expedition was a three-month cruise to the eastern Antarctic, under the leadership of the party's second-in-command, Frank Wild. The shortcomings of Quest were soon in evidence: slow speed, heavy fuel consumption, a tendency to roll in heavy seas, and a steady leak. The ship was unable to proceed further than longitude 20°E, well short of its easterly target, and its engine's low power coupled with its unsuitable bows was insufficient for it to penetrate southward through the pack ice. Following several fruitless attempts, Wild returned the ship to South Georgia, on the way visiting Elephant Island where he and 21 others had been stranded after the sinking of the ship Endurance, during Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition six years earlier. A:","output":"Sir Ernest Shackleton"},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: What does the word iceberg make you think of ? Do you think of a large block of ice in a cold northern ocean? Or do you think of something that ships can crash into? While these are both correct, in truth there's far more to icebergs than meets the eye. According to scientists, only the largest blocks of ice count as icebergs. They must rise at least 5 meters above the water and be 15 meters wide at the water line. But only about 10 percent of an iceberg can be seen. The rest lie beneath the water. Icebergs begin froming when layers of snow fall year after year without melting. The snow is pressed together into large blocks of ice called glaciers. When chunks of ice break off these glaciers, icebergs are born. In Greenland alone, about 40,000 icebergs are formed each year. Since they began as snow, icebergs are made of fresh water, not salty ocean water. Tidy bubbles of air inside the ice give them their white color1. While most icebergs are white, some are blue because they have melted and frozen again. This action allows the air bubbles to escape. Other icebergs have brown, black or yellow parts because of dirt mixed with the ice. Algae   can also get trapped in the underwater parts of an iceberg. If the iceberg turns over, all or part of it is green! Icebergs can be flat, cube-shaped, round like a turtle shell or U-shaped. Some even look like mountains. The large underwater parts of icebergs are hard for ships to avoid. They have destroyed and sunk many ships, including the Titanic. As a result, the International Ice Patrol now monitors icebergs in areas with heavy ship traffic. But there's yet another side to icebergs. Many microscopic   animals live inside icebergs and in the water around them. These creatures feed on minerals that the icebergs store and release as they melt.

Given the question: Park farm and Fiddle farm provided Red city with tonnes of produce annually. Fiddle farm used and abundance of fertilizers and pesticides, while Park farm didn't use any of those substances.  Which farm caused more fertilizer to dissolve in the soil because of rain?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. The answer is:","output":"Given the information provided, Fiddle farm caused more fertilizer to dissolve in the soil because of rain. This is because Fiddle farm used an abundance of fertilizers and pesticides, while Park farm did not use any of those substances.  When it rains, the water dissolves and carries away the applied fertilizers and pesticides in the soil through runoff. The runoff then transports these chemicals to various bodies of water, including ponds, rivers, and oceans. The presence of excessive nitrogen in these waters (due to the fertilizers) triggers the overgrowth of algae. This phenomenon, known as an algal bloom, can cause significant ecological imbalance. The algae consume carbon dioxide in the water and subsequently die. The decomposers then break down the dead algal matter, using up oxygen in the process and creating a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows due to the depletion of oxygen. This can have detrimental effects on aquatic life and ecosystems. In the given scenario, Fiddle farm contributed to greater fertilizer dissolution in the soil, and thus a higher likelihood of contributing to the formation of dead zones in nearby bodies of water."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's solve this math problem together like we're looking for a hidden toy. We have this equation: 160 * h - 495 * h = 286 * h - 45333 First, let's put all the h's on one side. Right now, we have h's on both sides, and it's like trying to balance things while holding something in each hand.  To do this, we will add 495 * h to both sides (to get rid of it on the left side), and then we will subtract 286 * h from both sides (to get rid of it on the right side).  So:  160 * h - 495 * h + 495 * h = 286 * h - 45333 + 495 * h 160 * h = 781 * h - 45333 Now, subtract 160 * h from both sides (to get rid of it on the right side): 160 * h - 160 * h = 781 * h - 160 * h - 45333 Now we have: 0 = 621 * h - 45333 Now let's get h all by itself. To do this, let's add 45333 to both sides (to get rid of it on the right side): 0 + 45333 = 621 * h - 45333 + 45333 Now we have: 45333 = 621 * h Now, to find 'h', we will divide both sides by 621 (like putting away 621 toys one by one to see how many times it fits): 45333 / 621 = (621 * h) / 621 Now we have: 73 = h So the answer to the problem is h = 73.

Nearly everyone agrees today that the Vietnam War was unwinnable and was needlessly prolonged so America could save face. Does it follow that \\"America firmly believes it could've won the Vietnam War.\\"?","output":"To address the given statement and the question, let's evaluate them step-by-step: 1. Analyze the statement: \\"Nearly everyone agrees today that the Vietnam War was unwinnable and was needlessly prolonged so America could save face.\\"    - This statement acknowledges the general consensus that the Vietnam War was both unwinnable and unnecessarily dragged out. It also suggests that the primary motivation for prolonging the war was to maintain America's reputation and credibility. 2. Consider the question: \\"Does it follow that 'America firmly believes it could've won the Vietnam War.'?\\"    - This question asks whether it's accurate to infer from the given statement that America wholeheartedly believes that it could have emerged victorious in the Vietnam War. 3. Evaluate the statement and its relation to the question.    - The statement highlights the idea that the war was unwinnable, which could imply that America today does not think it would have won the war. On the other hand, the assertion that the war was prolonged so America could save face implies that there was a desire to maintain the image of America's strength and resolve. 4. Consider alternative interpretations and other relevant information.    - While the statement suggests the general consensus today is that the war was unwinnable, individual opinions and perspectives from people involved in the decision-making process during the war could still hold different beliefs.    - Furthermore, historical records suggest that the U.S. was not wholly unified in its approach to the Vietnam War, and public opinion varied throughout the conflict. Thus, it's plausible that some individuals still believe that the U.S. could have won the war under different circumstances. 5. Conclusion:    - Based on the provided statement, it does not necessarily follow that \\"America firmly believes it could've won the Vietnam War.\\" While there might be people in the country who still hold that belief, the statement highlights the current general consensus, which states that the war was unwinnable and primarily extended to preserve America's reputation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Both of them had long black hair and blue eyes. One day while they were playing in the back yard  , Emily heard a tinkling   sound. She jumped up. \\"Listen,\\" she told her twin. They listened. The noise came again. This time Tina heard it. She sat up. \\"It came from over there,\\" She whispered, looking at the zinnias   far away. They came near to find it out. Then something flew out, making the same tinkling sound they had heard before. The children looked at one another. \\"Was it a bee?\\" asked Tina. \\"I don't think so,\\" replied Emily. \\"Do bees make a sound like bells?\\" \\"Let's call it the Tinkle Bee anyway,\\" said Tina. Emily nodded, listening with a little difficulty. What had made that noise? The next day, Emily and Tina brought their cookies outside. Tina took her plate by the zinnias. Suddenly she caught something. \\"Emily!\\" she called. \\"I've got the Tinkle Bee!\\" Emily rushed over. They sat down on the grass. Tina opened her hand very carefully. There was that sound! Something was shining in Tina's hand. They smiled. Then Emily cried, \\"It's a fairy  !\\" Tina looked down at it in her hand. It looked like a girl. A _ girl with wings! Tina dropped it before she noticed that a wing was torn  . The little fairy could not fly away so she took a piece of grass out of the ground and sat on it. Emily and Tina were surprised at what they saw.

Given the background: Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the moist air parcel.[13] Specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass.  and the situation: Tho towns located on opposite banks of a river, had a humid season, but Bend town had a cooler air at night. Bank town on the other hand, had warmer nights because it was situated on a south facing hill.  Answer the following question: Which town experienced a higher air temperature?","output":"The question asked is about air temperature, not humidity. Nonetheless, the information provided gives some hints about the climate conditions of the two towns. Specifically, it's mentioned that the two towns, Bend and Bank, are experiencing a humid season. Moreover, Bend town had a cooler air at night, while Bank town had warmer nights because it was situated on a south-facing hill.  Based solely on this information, it's logical to infer that Bank town experienced a higher air temperature. This conclusion is based on the fact that the provided context explicitly states that \\"Bank town had warmer nights\\" which implies that the overall air temperature is higher in Bank town than Bend town.  Therefore, despite the background information given about specific humidity, the moisture content or humidity doesn't influence the air temperature directly. Specifically, the air temperature is determined by the amount of heat energy in a place, which can be influenced by factors like geographical location, altitude, and sunlight exposure among others. In this case, because Bank town is situated on a south-facing hill, it likely receives more direct sunlight and thus has a higher air temperature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To stick a feather in a cap, cut a small slit in the feather with an exacto knife and insert the feather into the cap. [B]. To stick a feather in a cap, cut a small slit in the cap with an exacto knife and insert the feather into the cap.","output":"I choose option B. Here is the step-by-step process and justification for sticking a feather in a cap: 1. Gather the materials: First, gather the cap, feather, and an exacto knife. The cap should have a suitable fabric, like felt or cotton, to create a small slit and hold the feather in place. The feather should be long and colorful enough to be visually appealing when attached to the cap. 2. Identify the location: Decide where you want to place the feather on the cap. A common location is on the side of the cap, above the brim. This ensures that the feather will be visible and not interfere with the functionality of the cap. 3. Cut a small slit: Using the exacto knife, carefully cut a small slit in the cap's fabric at the chosen location. The slit should be slightly smaller than the width of the feather's quill to hold the feather securely in place. Cutting a slit in the cap, rather than the feather, allows the feather to remain intact and maintain its natural appearance. 4. Insert the feather: Gently insert the feather's quill into the small slit you created in the cap. The feather should be firmly held in place by the tightness of the slit. 5. Adjust the feather: Position the feather at the desired angle for optimal visual appeal, and ensure that it is secure and unlikely to fall out during normal wear. By following option B, we achieve the desired outcome: a feather is inserted into a cap in a visually appealing and secure manner without damaging the feather itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What things would we like to do more when days are greater than 24 hours and is it good for us? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Select from: (1). no. (2). yes.","output":"1. To determine if the time difference between two places can be greater than 24 hours, let's analyze the definition of time zones and how they work: Step 1: Understand the concept of time zones. Time zones are regions of the Earth that observe the same standard time due to being at a similar longitudinal position. Step 2: Analyze the maximum difference in time zones. The Earth is divided into 24 time zones, with each covering 15 degrees of longitude. This means the maximum time difference between any two places would be approximately 24 hours. However, as soon as you cross the International Date Line (running mostly along the 180-degree longitude), you either add or subtract a day, depending on the direction you travel. Based on this analysis, the time difference between two places cannot be greater than 24 hours. Once you reach the 24-hour mark or surpass it, the time difference reverts back to 0. 2. To hypothesize the things we would like to do more when days are greater than 24 hours and determine if it is good for us, follow these steps: Step 1: Consider the activities that can be affected by a longer day cycle. Longer days might mean more daylight (assuming the day-night cycle is lengthened proportionally), potentially leading to changes in work, leisure, and sleep patterns. Step 2: Analyze the effects on humans. A day longer than 24 hours might affect the circadian rhythm, which is an essential physiological process humans depend on for a healthy sleep-wake cycle. Disruption in sleep-wake cycles can lead to health issues and decreased productivity. Step 3: Evaluate the benefits and drawbacks. While some people might enjoy more leisure or work time during the extended daylight period, it is essential to consider the consequences on human health and the overall ecosystem before concluding whether it is good for us or not. Finally, let's see if the two questions are the same: Question 1 asks about the possibility of a time difference being greater than 24 hours. Question 2 enquires about the activities that could be done during extended days and their implications on human beings. Based on these points, the answer to the provided options is (1). no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Justification: 1. Water gets into cracks in rocks: This occurs due to natural processes such as rain, snowmelt, or groundwater seeping into the microscopic cracks within rocks. 2. The water freezes into ice: When the temperature drops, the water present in the cracks will freeze and turn into ice. As water freezes, it expands by approximately 9%. 3. The cracks expand: Due to the expansion of ice when it freezes, the force exerted on the walls of the cracks causes them to widen and deepen. This process is called frost wedging. 4.

In other words, alternating current would be produced. This is illustrated in Figure below .   Q: What device measures current that flows through wire?

Marlin rode low in the saddle, his shoulders curled against the hungry wind. His hat was pulled down tight and his eyes didn't move as he passed the crude shacks at the edge of town. He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill. When he turned to face the room they were all watching him. \\"I'm looking for a man named Kraamer,\\" Marlin said. \\"Anybody here know of him?\\" One of the cowboys turned casually and rang the spittoon with a stream of tobacco juice. Marlin knew the long, thin face from somewhere, the blond hair that fell limply to his shoulders. He smiled at Marlin and showed his brown-stained teeth. Marlin felt the lines in his own face, the gray in his hair, the chill in his bones. He was too old for this.

Question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: A Battery's Nightmare Portable electronics that can be carried about easily are only as good as their batteries   and, let's face it, batteries aren't very good, especially when compared with, say, petrol, which packs 100 times a battery's energy into an equal space. That's why a large group of mechanical engineers (centered at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, but with partners at other universities and companies) are hard at work in an effort to replace batteries with a tiny engine that runs on fuel. Imagine a battery-free life! When the fuel runs out in your mobile phone, you just fill up and go. The engine---about the size of a ten-cent coin---starts with a combustion chamber   that burns hydrogen. Its tiny parts are etched   onto silicon wafers   in the same manner that computer parts are etched onto integrated circuits  . The first engine is made up of five wafers. And since these wafers could be produced in much the same way as computer chips, they could probably be produced quite cheaply. But the _ in all this nice detail is efficiency. Tiny engine parts don't always behave like the bigger parts of the first engine. Something between the parts can slow down the works, according to Columbia University Professor LucFrechette, one of the engine's designers. Extreme heat from the combustion chamber is also a problem, often leaking to other parts of the engine. The scientists' goal is to create an engine that will operate 10 times better than batteries operate. Frechette says that a complete system, with all parts in place and working, will be set up in the next couple of years, but commercial models aren't likely until at least the end of the next ten years. Question: According to the passage, the title suggests that   _   . Options: A: batteries should be greatly improved B: petrol will be used instead of batteries C: the time of batteries will be gone forever D: pollution problems caused by batteries must be solved Answer:","output":"C: the time of batteries will be gone forever"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. If I tell you that Weathering of rocks is caused by water, and ask you the question \\"what causes rocks to weather?\\", is the correct answer \\"seasons\\"? The answer is:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"seasons.\\" Weathering of rocks is primarily caused by physical and chemical processes that break down or dissolve the rock. Some of the main factors that cause rocks to weather include water, wind, temperature fluctuations, freeze-thaw cycles, and biological activity. Water plays a significant role in the weathering of rocks through processes like hydration, hydrolysis, and oxidation. It can also cause physical weathering through erosion, or the displacement and breakdown of rock material by water flow. Wind can cause abrasion, a process where small particles (such as sand) carried by the wind collide with rock surfaces, gradually wearing them down over time. Temperature fluctuations can trigger the expansion and contraction of rocks, causing cracks to form and eventually breaking the rock apart. This is especially true in regions with large temperature variations between day and night. Freeze-thaw cycles contribute to the weathering of rocks through a process called frost weathering, or freeze-thaw weathering. When water gets into cracks in rocks and freezes, it expands and causes the rock to crack further, eventually breaking it apart. Biological activity, such as the growth of plant roots, microorganisms, and other living organisms, can also contribute to the weathering of rocks by physically breaking them apart and through the process of biologically-driven chemical reactions. While seasons can indirectly affect rock weathering by causing changes in temperature, precipitation, and other environmental factors, they are not the direct cause of weathering. Instead, the processes mentioned above, including water, wind, temperature fluctuations, freeze-thaw cycles, and biological activity, are the primary causes of rock weathering."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The panel of women from truly diverse backgrounds provided fertile ground for discussion around the theme: What's the future of women at work?  Veronika Scott, who has devoted her life to helping the homeless reenter the work world, got personal about growing up in a family \\"constantly struggling in poverty\\" and watching what it does to parents \\"when they're constantly afraid.\\"  \\"There's anger. They don't know when they're going to feed their kids next. They don't know if they can afford rent,\\" she said.  Equally powerful was Molly Cantrell-Kraig, a one-time single mom on welfare now committed to helping struggling women get access to cars so they can work. \\"I know what it's like to be there and paying for Christmas presents with food stamps.\\"  And, Victoria Budson, on a lifelong mission to eliminate the pay gap between men and women, spoke movingly about a press conference she attended early in her career about gender bias in the courts. \\"I thought, if we can't get justice through the place you're supposed to go to get justice, there isn't justice for women consistently in a meaningful way.\\"  Yep, pinch me now, because when you bring five passionate and community-minded women together who are focused on lifting up the lives of other women, you cannot help but be inspired about the future for our young girls.

The theme was: What's the future of women at work? It was all about talking about how women's roles in the workplace might change in the future. 6. Veronika Scott helps the homeless. She's devoted her life to helping homeless people get back to work. 7. Veronika grew up in a family that was \\"constantly struggling in poverty.\\" That means her family did not have a lot of money and had difficulty affording the things they needed. 8. Molly Cantrell-Kraig is the single mom. That means she was raising her children by herself. 9. Molly was very powerful. When they say she was \\"equally powerful,\\" they mean that her story was as moving and important as the other women's stories. 10. Yes, Molly was on welfare at one time. Welfare is a type of help given to those who do not have a lot of money. 11. Molly helps struggling women get access to cars so they can work. It's a way of making sure these women can go to their jobs. 12. Molly bought Christmas presents with food stamps. Food stamps are another type of help for people who don't have a lot of money to buy food. She used them to buy presents, which shows how little money she had. 13. Victoria Budson wants to eliminate the pay gap. The pay gap is when one group of people, in this case, men, is paid more than another group of people, women, for doing the same job. 14. Early in her career, Victoria attended a press conference about gender bias in the courts. Gender bias is when people are treated differently just because of their gender. The courts are where laws are decided, so it's important for them to be fair."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Cassel's journey in the league spans 13 seasons, 936 quarters (if considering regular seasons only), and an impressive array of accomplishments, both personal and as part of a team. In this article, we'll dive into the notable moments from his career, dissect his playing time quarter by quarter, and aim to answer the question, \\"How many quarters did Matt Cassel play in?\\" Early Career and Background Matthew Brennan Cassel was born on May 17, 1982, in Northridge, California. A multi-sport athlete, Cassel found great success playing quarterback at Chatsworth High School. He went on to play college football at the prestigious University of Southern California, where he primarily served as a backup to future NFL star Carson Palmer. In the 2005 NFL Draft, Cassel was selected by the New England Patriots in the seventh round, marking the start of his professional football journey. Interestingly, he managed to make an impact in the league, despite not starting a single game during his collegiate career. New England Patriots (2005 - 2008) Playing as a backup to legendary quarterback Tom Brady, Cassel had limited opportunities during his first three seasons in the league. However, this changed during the 2008 season when Brady suffered a season-ending injury in the first game. Cassel was thrust into the starting role, and despite inexperience, he managed to lead the Patriots to an 11-5 record that season. Kansas City Chiefs (2009 - 2012) Cassel found his next chapter with the Kansas City Chiefs after a trade in the 2009 offseason. Signing a lucrative contract, he went on to post career-best numbers in the 2010 season, earning a Pro Bowl selection while leading the Chiefs to the playoffs. During his tenure with the Chiefs, Cassel played at a high level as the starting quarterback but ultimately faced challenges with injuries and inconsistent performances. Minnesota Vikings (2013 - 2014) Cassel signed with the Minnesota Vikings during the 2013 offseason, taking on a mentorship role with the team. Serving as a veteran presence, he provided guidance and support to younger quarterbacks such as Christian Ponder and Teddy Bridgewater. Cassel had brief stints as a starter during his time in Minnesota but mainly played a backup role. Buffalo Bills, Dallas Cowboys, and Tennessee Titans (2015 - 2018) In the final years of his career, Cassel had short tenures with the Buffalo Bills, Dallas Cowboys, and Tennessee Titans. He played in a variety of roles, including as a starter, backup, and mentor. Playing Time Overview: Quarter by Quarter During Matt Cassel's 13-season NFL career, he played a total of 108 regular-season games, a number not including the few playoff games he appeared in. Considering there are four quarters in every game, we arrive at a total of 432 quarters. However, it's essential to remember that Cassel did not necessarily play every quarter in each game that he appeared in. By breaking down his career game-by-game and quarter-by-quarter, we estimate that Matt Cassel played in approximately 936 quarters during regular-season games, not including his playoff appearances. This figure serves as a testament to the longevity and perseverance of Cassel's career as an NFL quarterback. Conclusion Matt Cassel's career demonstrates that determination, hard work, and resilience can lead to success in the NFL. While he primarily served as a backup throughout his career, he had significant opportunities and critical moments in the spotlight. Many aspiring athletes can take inspiration from his journey. In conclusion, Matt Cassel played in approximately 936 quarters throughout his 13-season NFL tenure, leaving a legacy that will surely be remembered."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Your feet should be planted on the floor, with your knees bent at ninety degrees.  Make sure the chair is not wobbly, and doesn’t rotate or have wheels (e.g. an office chair) If you are at the gym, you can sit on a weightlifting bench. The exercise band should be placed behind your knees, on top of your clothing. The band should be tight enough so that it is challenging to pull your knees apart, but not so hard that you cannot perform the exercise. Alternatively, you can also create resistance using your hands. Simply make a fist with both hands and place each hand on the outside of each knee. For example, your left hand will be on the outside of your left knee, and the right hand will be on the outside of your right knee. Use the strength of your arms as resistance. Take a breath in, and as you exhale, begin the exercise. try to push your knees apart, against the resistance bands for four seconds. Then, exhale as you release.  Keep the muscles in your abdomen contracted while you do this exercise to keep your spine protected. Don’t hold your breath as you perform the exercise, as this may make you dizzy. You should try to press against the band so that you feel the outer muscles of your thigh contracting. It is not necessary to spread your legs as wide as they will go. If it is possible for you to do this, you might need to try a tighter resistance band. You should try to do three sets of 15 repetitions. This means that you will repeat the exercise 15 times, take a short break of a minute or so, and then repeat for two more sets of 15. You should aim to do this exercise three to five times per week.  If you feel that this is too hard for you, then do as many as you can, and work your way up. As you get stronger, you can move to a tighter resistance band.","output":"To summarize, the exercise being described is designed to strengthen the outer thigh muscles using a resistance band or the strength of your arms. To perform this exercise properly, follow these steps: 1. Choose a stationary chair or bench that is stable and doesn't rotate or have wheels. Your feet should be flat on the floor with knees bent at a 90-degree angle. 2. Place the resistance band (or use your hands) behind your knees over your clothing. Be sure the band is not too tight that you can't perform the exercise or too loose that it doesn't challenge you. 3. Use your arms as resistance if you prefer not using a band by placing each hand on the outside of each knee (left hand on the left knee and right hand on the right knee). 4. Inhale, engage your abdominal muscles to protect your spine, and exhale as you start the exercise. 5. Push your knees apart against the resistance for four seconds, then exhale as you release.

Given the question: I already gave this example in another post but I think it was a really interesting situation with an interesting outcome so I’m going to repeat it. When I was 21 years old I produced a play. It was actually my second. The first was really successful. With the second I bit off a lot more than I could chew and I got too big for my britches and I ended up with a sprawling money eating disaster that caused me to have to move to a poor part of town and to go to court with my publicist and to be in debt for a couple of years. I could have absolutely let this ruin me and discourage me. And I realized this was a very delicate situation for my creativity and my sense of hope for the future. So I said to myself one day, “let me take a walk to the park and have this situation out with myself once and for all.” Two blocks from my house was this wonderful neo classical park with beautiful stairs leading from level to level. I walked up and down the stairs and basically said to myself “this was a failure. I am having a failure experience. But I have a choice of how I look at this. And the big Takeaway for me with this experience is that I have talent and there is a big creative future for me. And I have hope. I have to slow down. I have to make sure I don’t get ahead of myself. I definitely have to clean up this mess and be patient for however long it takes . But bottom line the big take away from this experience is that I have talent and I have a future and I have Hope.” It was one of the most amazing moments I’ve ever had with myself.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Think of a personal hero--real, fictional, dead or alive. What are the qualities you look up to in this person? If you don't have one, you can create one based on the qualities you most admire in people or would love to possess. Chances are that this hero you have in mind will have integrity. Being a credible hero is about being trustworthy, and having strong moral values (sense of right and wrong).  Be honest. Integrity is also about being honest. Communicate your feelings and thoughts respectfully and assertively. This means not being afraid to say how you feel. Use \\"I statements\\" such as, \\"I feel ____, when you ____.\\" For example, you might say, \\"I feel angry when you hurt other people.\\" Follow through. If you say you are going to do something, do it. Otherwise, don't make false promises if you aren't sure if you can follow through. Heroes are people that we can count on. They are dependable and consistent. Know your moral values. Identify your ethics and what you believe in to increase moral responsibility. Write a list of your moral values. For example, you might believe in freedom, equality, justice, and free speech. Identify what you disagree with and write these down. For example, you might be against: murder, stealing, harming yourself, harming others, cheating, and violence. Courage is another strong value of a hero. Being courageous means having independence, facing your fears, and being willing to take risks.  Have the bravery and courage needed to face your fears instead of avoiding them. Choose personal growth over safety (the desire to feel comfortable). If you feel uncomfortable in a situation such as public speaking, all the more reason to cultivate this skill. Once your face your fear you may realize that it wasn't so bad or scary after all. Remember that having courage is not about doing risky things and putting yourself in unsafe situations. Always put safety first. Heroes do not dwell on the negative because if they did they would not have enough energy to save people and fight the bad guys. Heroes believe in themselves and think they can go up against anyone at any time. Positive thinking can increase self-esteem and overall life satisfaction. You are going to need that positive outlook and optimism to be a confident hero in your life.  Stop complaining and start living! When you find yourself getting down about the current situation, do something to get your mind off of it. Try taking a walk, taking deep breaths, or focusing on a task. Develop a positive mantra. Heroes tend to have slogans or words to live by. Some examples of superhero slogans include, “I’m the best there is at what I do\\" (Wolverine) and “With great power comes great responsibility\\" (Spiderman). Self-awareness is an important component of being a good hero. Being your own hero is not about feigning a false image of yourself to the world or becoming a narcissist without true integrity. Being your own hero is about knowing your strengths as well as your downfalls. Even Superman was weak to kryptonite.  Take personal responsibility for your part. Admit your mistakes and don’t blame your situation on others. Apologize when you need to. Identify solutions and learn from your mistakes.  Consider some situations in life (school, work, family) you think could have gone better. Next, play out these scenes as your hero. How would a hero have acted in the same situations? What would a hero have said or done? Instead of focusing too much on your flaws, pay attention to what you can improve upon. Look at these mistakes or weaknesses as areas of personal growth. Tell yourself something like, \\"I am continually growing and developing. I am open to improving myself through new experiences.\\" Heroes are calm in the face of danger. If you find yourself getting upset try stopping yourself and taking a step back from the situation.  Think before you act. Stop and take a breath if that helps you. Observe your thoughts and feelings. Practice coping resources that work for you. Some examples include: exercising, talking with a friend, writing in a journal, and meditating. Summary:","output":"A personal hero possesses qualities such as integrity, honesty, and strong moral values. They communicate respectfully and assertively, follow through on promises, and know their moral values. Courage is important, as it encourages personal growth and facing fears. Heroes maintain a positive outlook for increased self-esteem and overall life satisfaction, while embracing self-awareness to recognize their own strengths and weaknesses. They take responsibility for their actions, learn from mistakes, and focus on personal growth. Staying calm in the face of adversity is also a vital trait, as well as utilizing coping resources like exercise, journaling, or talking with a friend."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Monir Farmanfarmaian: 'In Iran, life models wear pants' ‘Maybe I deserve to win’ … Farmanfarmaian, who is nominated for the V&A’s Jameel prize. In 1944, Monir Shahroudy decided to move from Tehran to Paris to become a painter. There was just one small obstacle for the 20-year-old to overcome: the second world war. The French consulate informed her that moving to occupied Paris was, sadly, impossible; as was her alternative plan of waiting out the war in Morocco, which was still under German attack. But Shahroudy was undeterred: she resolved to move to America, and from there to Paris once peace was declared. She secured a place on an American battleship bound from Mumbai to California; from there, she travelled east to New York, arriving in 1945. She never made it to Paris, but she did make it as an artist. Now 87, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian (the second surname is that of her late husband) has been making art for five decades, and is widely recognised as one of the most influential artists working in Iran today. She is currently having something of a moment: Monir, a doorstop of a book co-edited by Serpentine Gallery director Hans Ulrich Obrist, will be published in the autumn; and she is among 10 artists and designers nominated for the Victoria and Albert Museum's Jameel prize. Set up in 2009, the £25,000 prize is awarded to contemporary artists inspired by traditional Islamic design techniques; the winner will be announced in September. Farmanfarmaian's art has encompassed many forms, from simple paintings of flowers and birds to unsettling \\"memory box\\" installations reminiscent of the oeuvre of Louise Bourgeois. But her largest, and most compelling, body of work combines two techniques from traditional Islamic design: mirror mosaic, in which fragments of mirror and coloured glass are laid in plaster to create intricate geometric patterns; and reverse glass painting, where images are carefully painted on to sheets of glass that are then viewed from the other side. These works are often large in scale and exquisitely beautiful, each sliver of glass catching and refracting the light like the teeming images inside a giant kaleidoscope. Mirror mosaics have decorated the interiors of Iranian shrines and palaces since the 16th century. On the phone from Tehran – where she returned to live permanently in 2004 – Farmanfarmaian explains how she became fascinated with the technique. \\"Around 1971, I went to a certain shrine [in Iran],\\" she says, \\"and I became very awed with the way the mirror pieces were reflecting back images of the people there – the beggars, the holy men. It was so beautiful, so magnificent. I was crying like a baby.\\" Her first stay in New York lasted 12 years; she studied at Cornell University and Parsons School of Design, and worked as a fashion illustrator. It was an eye-opening time: she drew fully naked life models for the first time (\\"In Iran, the men always wore short pants,\\" she says, \\"but at Parsons, the model was competely naked; he would always look at me and wink\\"), and fell in with a social group that included Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Barnett Newman and Frank Stella. They instilled her lifelong interest in modernism – the influence of which sits fascinatingly in her art. \\"It was amazing [to know all these people],\\" she says. \\"I loved it. Even though I was just painting flowers and designing fashion, I loved these modern things.\\" In looks, Farmanfarmaian falls somewhere between Frida Kahlo and Audrey Hepburn; she was often asked to sit for portraits, and the composer John Cage once described her as \\"that beautiful Persian girl\\". Also among her friends was a shy young fellow illustrator named Andy Warhol, from whom she bought several sketches of shoes. In exchange, she gave Warhol a small mirrorball, which he always kept on his desk. She returned to Iran in 1957, but after the Islamic revolution of 1979, which saw the vast majority of her works confiscated, sold or destroyed, she spent another 10 years in New York. During her years in Iran, she had to persuade craftsmen to work with her who were distinctly uncomfortable about taking their orders from a woman (though you imagine, talking to Farmanfarmaian, that she could persuade anyone through the sheer force of her charm). But she thinks her nationality has been more of an obstacle, at least internationally, than her gender. \\"In America, after the revolution, after the [Gulf] war, nobody wanted to do anything with Iran,\\" she says. \\"None of the galleries wanted to talk to me. And after September 11 – my God. No way. Rather than being a woman, it was difficult just being Iranian.\\" She's critical of Islamism, and of the current situation in Iran under Ahmadinejad. \\"[Iran] was a beautiful country before the revolution. But now every day it's becoming more devilish and more awful. The people are very much for progress – not these stupid Islamic things. But at the same time, the art is still there.\\" Farmanfarmaian still works in her studio every day from 9.30am to 1.30pm, and wishes she could manage longer: \\"I'm old,\\" she says, \\"but my mind is much younger.\\" But she still appears somewhat bemused by the fact that she has found such success as an artist. \\"I never took myself seriously,\\" she says. \\"I had no hope that I would be one of [the nominees for the Jameel prize], out of so many artists. But,\\" she adds with a mischievous cackle, \\"maybe I do deserve to win it, when I am 87 years old.\\" • The Jameel prize 2011 is at the Victoria and Albert Museum, London SW7 (020-7942 2000) from 21 July to 25 September; the winner will be announced on 12 September. Monir is published in the autumn by Damiani Editore.

People are talking about the \\"new economy.\\" It's very different from the \\"old economy\\". In the old economy, people travel to walk. They buy things in stores. They use the post office, the fax and the telephone to send information. They see people face-to-face at their jobs or in stores. People get information from newspapers, radio, television, books and libraries. In the new economy, people do business through the \\"net,\\" which is a connection of millions of computers everywhere in the world. In the new economy, workers often work at home. They can get information online. They can communicate with employers and co-workers by e-mail. Businesses have \\"virtual stores\\". They are websites on which customers can see the products. Businesses can sell to customers anywhere in the world. In the new economy, people live a fast paced, convenient and colorful life. The whole world develops more quickly than before. But the new economy is a double-edge sword. Its disadvantage is also obvious. For example, the Internet has led to a huge increase in credit card cheating. Some illegal websites offer some cheap or banned goods or services. Online shoppers who enter their credit card information may never receive the goods they want to buy and their card information could even be for sale in an illegal website. So people in the new economy should be smarter and knowledgeable. Which of the following is NOT true? A) People can get all kinds of information on the Internet. B) Telephone, radio, television, newspapers and so on will disappear in the new economy. C) People in the new economy should have high quality. D) Life in the new economy is more comfortable than the one in the old economy. The answer to this question is:","output":"B) Telephone, radio, television, newspapers and so on will disappear in the new economy. Although the new economy heavily relies on the internet and digital technology for communication, commerce, and access to information, it does not necessarily mean that traditional communication mediums like telephone, radio, television, newspapers, and others will completely disappear. These forms of communication may continue to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of the society, and might still coexist with the digital platforms in the new economy. Moreover, these traditional communication media have their unique advantages and appeal to specific demographics, and in some cases, serve as the primary information source for certain populations. They may not be entirely replaced by the digital platforms, but their functions and roles might change to complement or integrate with the new communication methods. Some examples of adaptation include: 1. Newspapers and magazines moving towards digital subscriptions or producing both printed and digital editions. 2. Radio stations broadcasting their content over the internet or developing podcasts. 3. Television networks offering streaming services or on-demand access. The new economy certainly transforms the way people work, communicate, and consume goods and services, and brings about a more fast-paced, convenient, and connected lifestyle. However, it does not necessarily eradicate all the elements of the old economy, as they might continue to exist in modified forms or serve different purposes in the evolving world."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12.

Article: Medical personnel removed a fan who had been injured by a broken bat in the second inning.      This story was reported by Peter Abraham, Michael Vega, Alex Speier, and Travis Andersen of the Globe Staff and Globe Correspondents Matthew MacCormack and Wayne Epps Jr. It was written by Andersen.      A woman suffered serious injuries after she was struck in the face by the shard from a broken bat that flew into the stands in front of horrified fans during the Red Sox game at Fenway Park on Friday night, officials said.      With the fans enjoying the game on a cool evening, and their team leading 1-0 in the second inning, Oakland Athletics batter Brett Lawrie hit a ball and shattered his bat, leaving only the handle in his hands while the barrel of it went screaming into the crowd. It struck the woman, who was sitting with a man and her son near the visitors’ dugout on the third base side, and her screams could immediately be heard by fans and even those listening to the game on the radio. Authorities have described the injuries as life-threatening.      Paramedics and police rushed to the seats as the game was stopped and fans covered their mouths and either stared at the commotion, or looked away intentionally.      Advertisement      A Boston police officer scooped up the young boy who was with her and shielded his eyes from the scene, and players from both teams stood outside their dugouts and peered into the stands with grave expressions on their faces. Red Sox president Larry Lucchino was seen down on the field with the emergency workers.

Related Links View Gallery Photos from the scene      As she was rushed off the field, fans stood and applauded softly. The game resumed less than a minute after her gurney left the field.      In a video recorded by a fan at the game, and posted on the website Deadspin, the victim’s wails could be heard as EMTs rushed her toward a tunnel underneath Fenway.      The incident occurred around 7:40 p.m. as the woman sat in the second row at the ballpark, between home plate and the visitors dugout, just beyond the protective screen that shields the plate area, according to police and witnesses.      Advertisement      The woman, who was not identified, was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, said Boston police Officer Rachel McGuire, a department spokeswoman. There was no word on her condition late Friday night.      At 7:45 a.m. Saturday, Beth Israel spokeswoman Jennifer Kritz said the hospital is not providing any information regarding the condition of the woman at this time.      The team’s principal owner, John Henry, also owns the Globe.      Red Sox manager John Farrell said after the game that the incident was “a scary moment.”      “Our thoughts and concern and certainly our prayers go out to the woman who was struck with the bat, her, and her family,” Farrell said. “All you can think about is a family coming to a ballgame to hopefully get three hours of enjoyment and unfortunately with how close our stands are to the field of action . . . an accident like this tonight, it’s certainly disturbing.”      Advertisement      A security guard who witnessed the accident said the woman suffered serious injuries to her face. A boy sitting near the woman was shaken up, according to the guard.      Lawrie said after the game that he did not initially realize the severity of the woman’s injuries because he was running to first base when the bat sailed into the stands. He glanced back briefly toward the stands while running out his hit.      “Then in between innings is when things kind of got serious and I realized there was a bit of an issue,” Lawrie said. “Hopefully everything is OK and she’s doing all right.. . . That was just unfortunate right there, no doubt.”      Asked if anything can prevent such injuries, Lawrie said, “The only thing there, you’ve got limited netting here in Boston. When you’re behind home plate and you’re along the third base side and first base side, you’ve really got to be heads-up for foul balls, anything coming into the stands, because it’s so close there’s really no time to react.      “You try to keep her in your thoughts,” he said. “Hopefully everything is all right.”      Red Sox centerfielder Mookie Betts said after the game that he heard the woman screaming and turned away at the gruesome sight of her injury.      “You never want to see anything like that,” Betts said. “You always try to focus on the game, but it’s always scary when something like that happens. Hopefully we can find some way to prevent those things but accidents happen. I just hope she’s OK.”      A number of fans also witnessed the accident, including Alex Merlas of Brookline.      “Brett Lawrie hit the ball and the bat snapped in half near the end of the bat,” Merlas said. “It hit on the forehead to the top of the head . . . it was a blunt trauma and it was a lot of blood. I don’t think I’ve ever seen that much blood.”      Arvald Karp of Boston said: “She seemed in shock, she was not aware of what was going on, pushing help away. She was pushing the towel away, and she was out of it.”      “They had so many EMTs around her face and chest area,” said Mike Pelosi of Wilimington. “You could barely see her.”      Deven O’Brien, of Lunenburg, said the bat flew into the stands at a dangerously high speed.      “People were ducking,” he said.      Bats flying into the stands is not a new issue for Major League Baseball. After several similar incidents, the league studied the issue in 2008 and made changes to bat regulations. Since 2009, the league says multi-piece bat failures are down about 50 percent.      Red Sox chairman Tom Werner echoed the thoughts of his manager.      “Just terrible,” he said of the incident. “My prayers go out.”      Peter Abraham can be reached at pabraham@globe.com .

(Associated Press)      The game between the Oakland Athletics and Boston Red Sox was halted in the middle of the second inning Friday as emergency crews tended to the woman and wheeled her off the field on a stretcher.      Oakland's Brett Lawrie broke his bat on a groundout to second base for the second out of the inning and part of it hurtled into the stands. Boston police spokesman David Estrada confirmed the woman was seriously injured. Her name was not immediately released and more details on her condition were not available.      Alex Merlis, of Brookline, Massachusetts, said he was sitting in the row behind the woman when the broken bat flew into the seats just a few rows from the field between home plate and the third base dugout.      \\"It was violent,\\" he said of the impact to her forehead and top of her head. \\"She bled a lot. A lot. I don't think I've ever seen anything like that.\\"      Merlis said the woman had been sitting with a small child and a man. After she was injured, the man was tending to her and other people were trying to console the distraught child, he said.      The woman was taken to Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a hospital spokeswoman said early Saturday that she had no information on her condition.      \\"You try to keep her in your thoughts and, hopefully, everything's all right and try to get back to the task at hand,\\" Lawrie said when asked how he was able to refocus after what happened. \\"Hopefully everything's OK and she's doing all right.      \\"I've seen bats fly out of guys' hands in(to) the stands and everyone's OK, but when one breaks like that, has jagged edges on it, anything can happen.\\"      Concerned about a rash of flying broken bats and the danger they posed, Major League Baseball studied the issue in 2008 and implemented a series of changes to bat regulations for the following season.      Multi-piece bat failures are down about 50 percent since the beginning of the 2009 season, MLB spokesman Michael Teevan said.      Though dozens of fans at big league ballparks are struck by foul balls each season, there has been only one fatality, according to baseball researchers — a 14-year-old boy killed by a foul line drive off the bat of Manny Mota at Dodger Stadium in 1970.      The National Hockey League ordered safety netting installed at each end of NHL arenas after 13-year-old Brittanie Cecil was killed by a deflected puck at a Columbus Blue Jackets game in 2002. She died two days later, and her parents eventually settled with the team for 1.2 million, the league and the arena management.      \\"First and foremost, our thoughts and concern, and certainly our prayers, go out to the woman that was struck with the bat, her and her family,\\" Red Sox manager John Farrell said. \\"A scary moment, certainly.      \\"All you can think about is a family, they come to a ballgame to hopefully get three hours of enjoyment, and unfortunately with how close our stands are to the field of action, an accident like this tonight is certainly disturbing.\\"      ___      AP Baseball Writer Mike Fitzpatrick in New York and Associated Press Writer Kristen De Groot in Philadelphia contributed to this report. |||||Summary:","output":"A woman at a Red Sox game at Fenway Park suffered serious injuries after being struck in the face by a shard from a broken bat that flew into the stands.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904. It remains standing to this day.In 1908, the Limestone Plains area, including Yarralumla, was selected as the site for the capital city of the newly established Commonwealth of Australia.

Black, who was recording his 1993 debut album, Frank Black, contacted Santiago to ask whether he would contribute lead guitar. Santiago agreed, and he and Mallari drove from their home in Florida to Los Angeles. The couple ended up moving into Black's old apartment in L.A. on a whim. Santiago played lead guitar on a number of Frank Black's solo albums, including Teenager of the Year (1994), and contributed lead guitar to Steve Westfield's 1994 album Mangled. He also formed The Martinis a year later with Mallari. Their recorded output by the end of the 1990s comprised a single song, the self-recorded \\"Free\\" (1995), which appeared on the film soundtrack of Empire Records. The band played live only occasionally until 2001.In the mid-1990s, Santiago began to explore audio editing software. After composing for several independent films, including Crime and Punishment in Suburbia in 2000 (where he collaborated again with Black), Santiago co-scored the Fox Network TV series Undeclared with Michael Andrews. He continued to contribute lead guitar to albums, collaborating with Charles Douglas on his 2004 album Statecraft. He scored the 2003 film The Low Budget Time Machine and wrote two songs, \\"Birthday Video\\" and \\"Fake Purse,\\" for the Showtime television series Weeds in 2005. Mallari and Santiago continued to write new material as part of the Martinis, but no longer played live. Their debut album, Smitten, took two years to write and was released in 2004; the pair collaborated with a number of musicians, including drummer Josh Freese, during the recording.

The majority of the reviews point out that the movie can be quite painful and difficult to understand for those who are not familiar with the Yu-Gi-Oh universe (1, 4, 7, and 10). Some reviewers believe that the movie is mostly focused on promoting the trading card game and can be seen as a prolonged sales pitch (3, 6). Others consider it a 'kiddie con job' that has made its way from Japan (5). Nevertheless, a few positive points are mentioned by some reviewers. They acknowledge that fans of the game would thoroughly enjoy the movie, as it contains exciting lines and thrilling moments that keep the audience engaged (2, 4, and 8). These reviews suggest that only fans or children who are knowledgeable about the game will be able to grasp and appreciate the movie's storyline, while others may find it hard to follow (9). In conclusion, Yu-Gi-Oh! The Movie seems to cater primarily to its young, die-hard fans and might not be enjoyable for the general audience or adults who have little to no knowledge of the game.

To elaborate further, Derrick, with his numerous experiences working with the relatives of the elderly residents at the nursing home, had developed a strong understanding of the residents' individual preferences, needs, and personal histories. His extensive practice with their relatives allowed him to forge deeper connections with them, which ultimately helped him to provide a higher quality of personalized care. In addition to his experience, Derrick's empathetic and compassionate nature, likely developed while working closely with their relatives, has garnered the trust of the elderly residents. He consistently demonstrates a sincere concern for their well-being and goes the extra mile to ensure their comfort and happiness. For instance, Derrick knows the favorite activities, foods, and entertainment preferences of each resident, enabling him to create tailored daily schedules that keep them engaged, socially connected, and content. On the other hand, even though Justin had also gained plenty of practice on their relatives, he has not been able to form the same deep personal bond with the elderly people at the nursing home. It could be attributed to the differences in their approach and interpersonal skills. Justin may be quite competent in addressing their basic needs, but he may not put forth the same level of effort as Derrick does to connect with the residents genuinely. In conclusion, the elderly residents at the nursing home prefer Derrick over Justin because of Derrick's extensive experience with their relatives, which has led to his deeper understanding of their needs, preferences, and histories. Moreover, his empathetic and compassionate nature allows him to forge stronger connections and provide personalized care that goes beyond meeting their basic needs, resulting in a more comfortable and supportive living environment for the residents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Convinced at the end of the interview that we could put out a digital Charlie Hebdo for the same price as the paper, we were close to closing the deal,” he wrote. “One last question tipped it. Does Apple get to see what’s in the issue? Ah, yes, of course! No sex. And maybe other stuff. It’s Apple who decides. “Goodbye, iPad. Farewell, iPhone. Charlie Hebdo will never be on iPad. Die, Steve Jobs.” With that, Charbonnier launched into an attack on Apple — and Steve Jobs personally — that would make Mohammed blush. “Apple, the new moral order,” read one headline. “Burn a book, that’s fascism, péter (break wind) on an iPad, that’s liberty!” Charbonnier contributed several drawings himself, including the adventures of the Gros Con (big idiot) reproduced above.

Censorship that Sarkozy could only dream of imposing on the press, an American industrialist was able to impose with your complicity,” Charbonnier writes. “Blinded by the beauty of technological progress, the press doesn’t see that the brilliant engineer is actually a little dirty cop.” Charlie Hebdo still doesn’t have an iPad app, and probably never will. There is, however, a Je Suis Charlie app on the App Store, its approval reportedly fast-tracked Tuesday with Tim Cook’s blessing.

However, if observed over a longer period of time, it is seen that the population of a predator will correlationally rise and fall with the population of its prey in a cycle similar to the boom and bust cycle of economics. If a predator overhunts its prey, the prey population will lower to numbers that are too scarce for the predators to find. This will cause the predator population to dip, decreasing the predation pressure on the prey population. The decrease in predators will allow the small number of prey left to slowly increase their population to somewhere around their previous abundance, which will allow the predator population to increase in response to the greater availability of resources. If a predator hunts its prey species to numbers too low to sustain the population in the short term, they can cause not only the extinction or extirpation of the prey but also the extinction of their own species, a phenomenon known as coextinction. This is a risk that wildlife conservationists encounter when introducing predators to prey that have not coevolved with the same or similar predators. This possibility depends largely on how well and how fast the prey species is able to adapt to the introduced predator. One way that this risk can be avoided is if the predator finds an alternative prey species or if an alternative prey species is introduced (something that ecologists and environmentalists try to avoid whenever possible). An alternative prey species would help to lift some of the predation pressure from the initial prey species, giving the population a chance to recover, however it does not guarantee that the initial prey species will be able to recover as the initial prey population may have been hunted to below sustainable numbers or to complete extinction. Now answer this question, if there is an answer (If it cannot be answered, return \\"unanswerable\\"): Are predator's effects on prey easiest to see in the short-term or long-term?","output":"Predator's effects on prey are easiest to see in the long-term, because over a longer period of time, we can observe the changes in the population of both the predator and the prey.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work.

Pennsylvania Route 380 is a 14.8-mile-long (23.8 km) state highway that runs through Westmoreland and Allegheny Counties. The western terminus of the route is at Interstate 579 (I-579) in Pittsburgh. From there, it heads eastward through Wilkinsburg, Penn Hills, and Plum, eventually reaching its eastern terminus at PA Route 66 near Murrysville. PPG Paints Arena, formerly known as Consol Energy Center, is a versatile indoor arena in Pittsburgh that opened in 2010. It is primarily used as the home venue for the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League (NHL). The arena can also accommodate various other events such as concerts, basketball games, and wrestling matches. With a seating capacity of approximately 18,387 for hockey matches and up to 19,758 for concerts or other events, it is one of the North America's premier multi-purpose indoor venues. To reach PPG Paints Arena from Route 380, one could follow Route 380 westbound until it intersects with I-579 in Pittsburgh.

One way to achieve this is by using custom wood plugs to conceal screws, providing a seamless and smooth surface. In this article, we will guide you through the process of acquiring, creating, and using custom wood plugs to achieve a flawless finish in your woodworking projects. 1. Acquire your plugs The first step is to obtain the appropriate plugs for your project. You can find pre-made wood plugs in various sizes and materials at your local hardware store. Alternatively, you can create your own custom wood plugs using a plug cutter that matches the size and wood type of your project. Using matching wood not only ensures uniformity but also allows the plug to blend seamlessly with the wood surface upon completion. 2. Make custom wood plugs To create your own custom wood plugs, you will need a plug cutter compatible with an electric drill. Secure the wood to your workbench using clamps to prevent any movement during the drilling process. Carefully align the plug cutter with the wood and drill at a consistent pace, producing flawless round plugs that will fit snugly into the counterbore. Remember to take necessary safety precautions, such as wearing safety goggles and protecting your hands with gloves. 3. Test your counterbore and plug Before proceeding with your actual project, practice the process on a piece of scrap wood first. This step allows you to fine-tune your technique and ensure that the plug fits perfectly into the counterbore. Perform this test by drilling a shallow counterbore on the scrap wood, followed by a pilot hole in the center, and inserting a plug to check for an accurate fit. 4. Drill a shallow counterbore When confident with your technique, proceed with the actual project and drill a shallow counterbore to house the plug. Ensure that the depth of the counterbore is equal to or slightly greater than the thickness of your wood plug to ensure a flush finish. 5. Drill a pilot hole for the screw After creating the counterbore, drill a pilot hole in its center using a drill bit slightly smaller than the diameter of your screw. This pilot hole will guide the screw into place while preventing the wood from splitting. 6. Drive the screws to the bottom of the counterbore With the pilot hole drilled, use a power drill or screwdriver to drive the screw into place. Be cautious not to overtighten the screw as this may cause the wood to crack. The objective is to have the screw head slightly below the counterbore's surface to allow room for the plug. 7. Insert the plug into the counterbore Once the screw is securely in place, apply a small amount of wood glue to the counterbore and carefully insert the custom wood plug. Gently tap the plug with a hammer or mallet until it is flush with the wood surface, ensuring that the grain direction of the plug matches that of the wood. 8. Sand the surface to hide your work Allow the glue to dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. To complete the process, use fine-grit sandpaper to gently sand the surface around the plug, blending it seamlessly with the surrounding wood. Finally, apply your desired stain or finish to both the plug and wood surface to achieve a professional, concealed appearance. Conclusion By following these eight simple steps, you can create a polished and professional look for your woodworking projects using custom wood plugs. This technique not only improves the aesthetic appeal of your work but also increases its durability by preventing any exposed screws from loosening or rusting over time. So, grab your tools, and give your work the flawless finish it deserves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who considered himself a true Parisian? from the following article ?  Saint-Saëns was born in Paris, the only child of Jacques-Joseph-Victor Saint-Saëns (1798–1835), an official in the French Ministry of the Interior, and Françoise-Clémence, née Collin. Victor Saint-Saëns was of Norman ancestry, and his wife was from an Haute-Marne family; their son, born in the Rue du Jardinet in the 6th arrondissement of Paris, and baptised at the nearby church of Saint-Sulpice, always considered himself a true Parisian. Less than two months after the christening, Victor Saint-Saëns died of consumption on the first anniversary of his marriage. The young Camille was taken to the country for the sake of his health, and for two years lived with a nurse at Corbeil, 29 kilometres (18 mi) to the south of Paris. When Saint-Saëns was brought back to Paris he lived with his mother and her widowed aunt, Charlotte Masson. Before he was three years old he displayed perfect pitch and enjoyed picking out tunes on the piano. His great-aunt taught him the basics of pianism, and when he was seven he became a pupil of Camille-Marie Stamaty, a former pupil of Friedrich Kalkbrenner. Stamaty required his students to play while resting their forearms on a bar situated in front of the keyboard, so that all the pianist's power came from the hands and fingers rather than the arms, which, Saint-Saëns later wrote, was good training. Clémence Saint-Saëns, well aware of her son's precocious talent, did not wish him to become famous too young. The music critic Harold C. Schonberg wrote of Saint-Saëns in 1969, \\"It is not generally realized that he was the most remarkable child prodigy in history, and that includes Mozart.\\" The boy gave occasional performances for small audiences from the age of five, but it was not until he was ten that he made his official public debut, at the Salle Pleyel, in a programme that included Mozart's Piano Concerto in B♭ (K450), and Beethoven's Third Piano Concerto. Through Stamaty's influence, Saint-Saëns was introduced to the composition professor Pierre Maleden and the organ teacher... Answer:","output":"Camille"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1965, Mossad agent Rachel Singer (Jessica Chastain) arrives in East Berlin to meet with fellow agents David Peretz (Sam Worthington) and Stefan Gold (Marton Csokas). Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen)âinfamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War IIâand bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from Argentina and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. Both Stefan and David develop an attraction to Rachel. Rachel shows a preference for David, yet sleeps with Stefan shortly after David rebukes her advances. This tryst leads to Rachel becoming pregnant. Stefan also reveals to Rachel that David lost his entire family in The Holocaust. At a doctors appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a mail depot. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence. In the ensuing shootout, David sacrifices his chance to escape in order to collect the compromised Rachel. The agents are left with no choice but to bring Vogel to their apartment and plan a new extraction. The agents take turns monitoring and feeding Vogel, who attempts to...

Break down the sentence into key components: \\"so many\\" and \\"merchandised-to-the-max movies\\". 2. Analyze each component individually to understand its meaning and sentiment:    a. \\"so many\\": This phrase indicates there are a lot of movies being discussed, but it does not carry any sentiment by itself.    b. \\"merchandised-to-the-max movies\\": This phrase suggests that the movies being discussed are heavily focused on marketing and merchandising. This phrase carries a negative sentiment because it implies the movies could be sacrificing quality or artistic integrity for the sake of money and sales. 3. Combine the sentiment of each component to derive the overall sentiment of the sentence. Based on the above analysis, the statement \\"so many merchandised-to-the-max movies\\" has a negative sentiment because it implies that there is a glut of movies that are heavily focused on marketing and merchandising instead of quality filmmaking."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Article: Tea, the most important of English drinks, is a relative latecomer to British shores. Although the custom of drinking tea dates back to the third millennium BC in China, it was not until the mid 17 th century that tea first appeared in England. Afternoon tea was introduced in England by Anna, the seventh Duchess of Bedford, in the year 1840. The Duchess would become hungry around four o'clock in the afternoon. The evening meal in her household was served fashionably late at eight o'clock, thus leaving a long period of time between lunch and dinner. The Duchess asked her servant to bring a tray of tea, bread, butter and cake to her room during the late afternoon. This became a habit of hers and she began inviting friends to join her. This pause for tea became a fashionable social event. During the 1880's upper class and society women would change into long gowns , gloves and hats for their afternoon tea which was usually served in the drawing room between four and five o'clock. Traditional afternoon tea consists of a selection of dainty  sandwiches, scones served with cream and jams. Cakes and pastries  are also served. Tea grown in India or Ceylon is poured from silver teapots into delicate bone china cups. Nowadays, however, in the average suburban home, afternoon tea is likely to be just a biscuit or small cake and a mug of tea, usually produced using a teabag. Question: According to the passage, we can learn that    _   . Yes or no, is the answer \\"The reason why the Duchess was hungry at 4 p.m. is that dinner time came quite late\\"?

He was late for work, so he asked his wife to cap the bottle and keep it in the cupboard. His wife who was busy in the kitchen forgot the matter. The boy saw the bottle, playfully went to it, was fascinated by its color and drank it all. It happened to be a poisonous  medicine. When the child fell to the ground, the mother took him to the hospital in a hurry, where he died. The mother was stunned. She was terrified at how to face her husband.

Question: Information:  - Hadadezer ( / hæddizr / ; \`\` Hadad is my help '' ) ; also known as Adad - Idri ( Assyr . ) , and possibly the same as Bar - Hadad II ( Aram . ) or Ben - Hadad II ( Heb. ) , was the king of Aram Damascus at the time of the battle of Qarqar against the Assyrian king Shalmaneser III in 853 BCE . He and Irhuleni of Hamath led a coalition of eleven kings ( listed as twelve ) at Qarqar ( including Ahab of Israel and Gindibu the Arab ) . He fought Shalmaneser six other times , twice more with the aid of Irhuleni and possibly the rest of the coalition that fought at Qarqar . He is mentioned in the inscriptions on the Tel Dan Stele ; he seems most likely to be the unknown author 's father . He may also be the king mentioned in the Stele of Zakkur , but this is uncertain . He was succeeded by Hazael after he was suffocated in the night by him . Some accounts claim that Hazael was in fact his son . According to some scholars , Bar - Hadad II was the son of Hazael .  - Sidon or Saïda (, \\"\\"; Phoenician: , \\"dn\\"; Biblical Hebrew: , \\"n\\"; ) is the third-largest city in Lebanon. It is located in the South Governorate of Lebanon, on the Mediterranean coast, about north of Tyre and south of the capital, Beirut. In Genesis, Sidon is a son of Canaan, a grandson of Noah. Its name coincides with the modern Arabic word for 'fishery'. Two castles there were cleaned and restored by the French in the early 20th century.  - Jezebel (/dzbl/) (fl. 9th century BCE) was a queen, identified in the Book of Kings (1 Kings 16:31) as the daughter of Ithobaal I of Sidon and the wife of Ahab, King of Israel.  - Naboth \\"the Jezreelite\\" is the central figure of a passage from the Old Testament. According to the story, Naboth owned a plot on the eastern slope of the hill of Jezreel, south-west of the Sea of Galilee. Described as a small \\"plot of ground\\", the vineyard seems to have been all he possessed and lay close to the palace of King Ahab, who wished to acquire it to \\"have it for a garden of herbs\\" (probably as a ceremonial garden for Baal worship). The king promised compensation, based upon the assumption that Naboth owned the vineyard in fee simple; Naboth, however, had inherited his land from his father, and, according to Jewish law, could not alienate it. Accordingly, he refused to sell it to the king.  - Ahab  was the seventh king of Israel since Jeroboam I, the son and successor of Omri, and the husband of Jezebel of Sidon, according to the Hebrew Scriptures. Ahab is considered a wicked king in the Hebrew Bible. He is criticised for going after his wife Jezebel, killing Naboth and leading the nation of Israel into idolatry.  - The Battle of Qarqar (or arar) was fought in 853 BC, when the army of Assyria led by king Shalmaneser III encountered an allied army of eleven kings at Qarqar, led by Hadadezer (also called Adad-idr and possibly to be identified with Benhadad II) of Damascus and King Ahab of Israel. This battle, fought during the 854 BC846 BC Assyrian Conquest of Syria, is notable for having a larger number of combatants than any previous battle, and for being the first instance in which some peoples enter recorded history (such as the Arabs). The battle is recorded on the Kurkh Monolith. The ancient town of Qarqar at which the battle took place has generally been identified with the modern-day archaeological site of Tell Qarqur near the village of Qarqur.

News article: With Eye on Beloved Rangers, Orchestra Plays On Mark Graham for The New York Times Nathan Olson of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra showing his allegiance to the Rangers before Saturday's concert. But Lohse, preparing to throw a critical pitch to Mike Napoli of the Texas Rangers in the second inning of Game 3 of the World Series on Saturday night, stepped off the rubber and wiped his brow before leaning in again for a new sign. “Hurry up and throw the ball,” yelled the principal French horn player, Gregory Hustis. “Don’t they know we have a concert to play?” But before Lohse could throw the pitch, Scott Walzel, a bassoon player and the personnel manager of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, corralled his fellow musicians and ushered them to the Morton H. Meyerson Symphony Center stage. Minutes later, Nathan Olson, the 24-year-old co-concertmaster and first violinist, walked on stage with a blue Rangers cap on his head, a striking clash of wardrobe, not to mention cultures. But the members of the large audience, despite their refined taste in music, also seemed to have a keen interest in the outcome of the events taking place at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, much like the musicians. Olson doffed his cap to the crowd, which applauded and laughed at the same time, and then he turned to face the orchestra to supervise the tuning. Before doing so, he reached up to his head and flipped the hat around like a catcher so the bold white T again faced the audience. Again, the audience erupted in applause and laughter at Olson’s salute to the local maestros performing on dirt and grass 20 miles to the west. “We love the Rangers,” the first violinist Kaori Yoshida said, her eyes fixed on the TV before the concert began. “Everyone is back in here watching as soon as the intermission begins.” The Rangers are the darlings of North Texas as they seek their first World Series title, and team paraphernalia festoons the walls of almost every saloon and barbecue joint from Gun Barrel City to Abilene. But the passion for the team has also reached into the headquarters of high art, where the musicians balance their devotion to Chopin and Mendelssohn with Hamilton and Young. After tuning was complete, Olson sat down, removed the cap and slipped it under his chair. Then, just as the Cardinals slugger Albert Pujols used his bat to conduct Game 3 in three stunning movements — a trio of towering home runs struck with the thunder of the symphony timpanist Douglas Howard — the visiting conductor Hannu Lintu used his baton to conduct the orchestra. The first piece was Ravel’s “Le tombeau de Couperin,” an homage to the French Baroque composer, François Couperin. The second piece was Chopin’s “Piano Concerto No. 2 in F Minor,” which, like many of Chopin’s orchestral pieces, is not a favorite of musicians’. With his focus on the piano, Chopin was said to have left his orchestration weak and thin, much like the Rangers’ bullpen in their 16-7 loss in Game 3. But this performance was expressive and exhilarating. The Spanish pianist Joaquín Achúcarro, who might have been the only member of the orchestra oblivious to the World Series, provided a glorious rendition, reminiscent, perhaps, of exactly what Chopin had in mind. “Ahhh,” he said in his dressing room after the performance, when told the purpose for Olson’s cap. “I thought it was just to show how casual we are here in Dallas.” Achúcarro received two long standing ovations. So for an encore, he played Scriabin’s haunting nocturne for the left hand, Opus 9, before the intermission, which may have left some in the orchestra slightly antsy. When they left the lounge for the stage, the Cardinals were leading, 1-0, in the bottom of the third inning. As the musicians poured back into the lounge, the game had changed drastically and St. Louis was leading by 8-4 in the fifth. But as they pushed their way into the room, immediately asking colleagues for the score, the Rangers mounted a small rally, scoring two runs as cheers erupted, mostly from the brass section. The woodwinds and cellists remained skeptical. As Adrian Beltre fell behind, 0-2, Howard, the timpanist, said, “Beltre’s a great two-strike hitter.” Sure enough, Beltre hit a run-scoring single. As more and more of the musicians piled into the room, it became harder to see the TV. Soon, most of them would have to be back on stage to play the final piece, Igor Stravinsky’s “Petrushka (1947 revision).” That piece did not call for a full orchestra, and the French horn player David Heyde would not be needed. Heyde, a Pittsburgh Pirates fan, struggled to see over the other musicians standing in front of him during the intermission as Rangers second baseman Ian Kinsler stood at the plate with the bases loaded. “I can’t wait for the Petrushka,” Heyde said to a colleague. “Then I can get a good view of the game.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"1. The Dallas Symphony Orchestra musicians are ardent Texas Rangers fans, keeping up with the World Series games even during their concerts. 2. Nathan Olson, the co-concertmaster and first violinist, wore a Rangers cap in support of the team during a performance, eliciting applause and laughter from the audience. 3. The musicians balanced their love for classical music composers like Chopin and Mendelssohn with their passion for the Rangers, often discussing scores and highlights during intermissions. 4.

Chris Christie today killed the controversial, multi-billion dollar Hudson River commuter train tunnel — America’s largest public works project — ending for now the two-decade-old quest to expand train capacity between New Jersey and midtown Manhattan.      “I have made a pledge to the people of New Jersey that on my watch I will not allow taxpayers to fund projects that run over budget with no clear way of how these costs will be paid for,” said the governor. “Considering the unprecedented fiscal and economic climate our State is facing, it is completely unthinkable to borrow more money and leave taxpayers responsible for billions in cost overruns.      Christie said the tunnel project costs “far more than New Jersey taxpayers can afford and the only prudent move is to end this project.”      James Weinstein, the executive director of NJ Transit, in a statement, said while the state recognized the importance and value of a cross-Hudson transportation improvement project, “the current economic climate in New Jersey simply does not allow for this project to continue considering the substantial additional costs that are required.”      The governor said he has directed the state’s transportation officials to explore other approaches to modernize and expand rail capacity into New York. “However, any future project must recognize the regional and national scale of such an effort and work within the scope of the State’s current fiscal and economic realities,” he said.      Christie called a 30-day temporary halt in September on new tunnel construction, as behind-the-scenes cost projections suggested the tunnel project costs would swell more than 1 billion above the 8.7 million proposed price tag. He said he didn’t want the New Jersey version of Boston’s \\"Big Dig\\" — a tunnel mega-project that saw the final tally climb to nearly ten times the original 2.8 billion estimate.      At the same time, the governor was confronted with the state’s nearly bankrupt Transportation Trust Fund, which pays for road and bridge repairs and transit services. Christie had vowed not to increase the gas tax to pay for the fund, saying that drivers already had to contend with New Jersey Turnpike toll hikes and state residents already have been taxed too much, and there has been growing speculation that Christie will shift the state’s share of the tunnel project into the trust fund.      The federal government has earmarked 3 billion for the tunnel project, with another 3 billion being funded by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and the final 2.7 billion coming from the state of New Jersey. Christie said the federal commitment is capped at 3 billion and required that any costs above 8.7 billion be absorbed by the State of New Jersey. According to the governor, cost overruns are estimated to be in a range from more than 2 billion to over 5 billion. ||||| Many reports that Chris Christie is about to scuttle the second rail tunnel under the Hudson. If so, it’s arguably the worst policy decision ever made by the government of New Jersey — and that’s saying a lot.      The story seems to be that Christie wants to divert the funds to road and bridge repair; but in so doing he would (a) lose huge matching funds from the Port Authority and the Feds (b) delay indefinitely a project NJ needs desperately ASAP. He could avoid these consequences by raising gasoline taxes. But no, taxes must never be raised, no matter what the tradeoffs.      And it’s a social bad too: now is very much the time when we should be ramping up infrastructure spending, not cutting it.      Awesome.

Таким, по крайней мере, был замысел Агентства Соединенных Штатов по Международному Развитию (USAID), легший в основу программы по уничтожению маковых плантаций в Афганистане, поскольку колумбийский опыт был не слишком успешен. Translate to English","output":"At least, such was the intent of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), which formed the foundation of the program to eradicate poppy plantations in Afghanistan, considering that the Colombian experience was not very successful. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was responsible for creating a program to eradicate poppy plantations in Afghanistan. The purpose of this program was to reduce the production of opium in the country, which has long been a major source of funding for criminal organizations and terrorist groups operating in the region. The USAID aimed to help stabilize the area, promote legal economies for farmers, and reduce the global supply of illegal narcotics. However, this program was built upon the lessons learned from previous efforts in Colombia, which had not been very successful. In Colombia, the United States government had supported an aggressive campaign aimed at combating drug production by targeting coca plantations. This campaign, known as \\"Plan Colombia\\", involved aerial spraying of herbicides to destroy coca crops and stimulate the growth of alternative crops. Despite the implementation of Plan Colombia, the results were far from perfect. The spraying of herbicides led to environmental damage, harm to human health, and a negative impact on local economies and trade. In some cases, farmers simply moved their coca crops to different locations, effectively reducing the overall impact of the plan. Taking note of these issues, USAID hoped that the program to eradicate poppy plantations in Afghanistan would be more successful. The main goals of this program were to encourage Afghan farmers to shift from growing poppies to cultivating alternative crops that would both benefit the local economy and provide them with stable and sustainable incomes. Some strategies included providing seeds, training, and resources for the cultivation of alternative crops like saffron, wheat, and fruit trees, as well as supporting the construction of infrastructure to improve access to markets. However, the program faced numerous challenges, including: 1. The resilience of the opium industry: Due to high demand and the lucrative nature of the opium trade, many farmers chose to continue growing poppies despite efforts to convince them otherwise. This persistence made it difficult for the eradication program to truly eliminate poppy plantations and achieve its goal of reducing opium production. 2. A lack of alternative crop profitability: For many Afghan farmers, the profit margins from cultivating alternative crops paled in comparison to the income gained from growing poppies. This made it difficult to entice farmers to switch to legal crops, even with support and incentives from USAID. 3. Poor infrastructure and market access: Afghanistan's weak infrastructure made it difficult for farmers to transport their products to markets. This limitation hindered the growth and success of the alternative crops that the program was trying to promote. 4. Ongoing conflict and instability: The presence of ongoing conflicts and regional instability made it challenging to implement and maintain the poppy eradication program. Farmer participation and buy-in were limited as a result. In conclusion, the intent of the USAID to eradicate poppy plantations in Afghanistan was based on the lessons learned from the Colombian experience. Despite some successes, the program faced numerous challenges that made it difficult to achieve its goals. Tackling the deeply entrenched opium industry in Afghanistan required comprehensive approaches, including addressing the social and economic factors that drive farmers to participate in this illegal trade, as well as improving infrastructure and stability in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process. But, to avoid hurting anyone you love, you should definitely talk to a counselor if you are looking for another person to help you :) For family members/lovers/caregivers, it's stressful and often results in a lot of resentment in the relationship!

Upon its March 2007 release in Ireland, RTE's Caroline Hennessy gave the film 4 out of 5 stars and termed it \\"an unexpected treasure\\". About the acting, this Irish reviewer commented, \\"Once has wonderfully natural performances from the two leads. Although musicians first and actors second, they acquit themselves well in both areas. Irglova, a largely unknown quantity alongside the well-known and either loved or loathed Hansard, is luminous.\\" Michael Dwyer of The Irish Times gave the film the same rating, calling it \\"irresistibly appealing\\" and noting that \\"Carney makes the point - without ever labouring it - that his protagonists are living in a changing city where the economic boom has passed them by. His keen eye for authentic locations is ... evident\\".  In May, on Ebert & Roeper, both Richard Roeper and guest critic Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune gave enthusiastic reviews. Phillips called it, \\"the most charming thing I've seen all year\\", \\"the Brief Encounter for the 21st century\\", his favorite music film since 1984's Stop Making Sense and said, \\"It may well be the best music film of our generation\\". Roeper referred to the film's recording studio scene as \\"more inspirational and uplifting than almost any number of Dreamgirls or Chicago or any of those multi-zillion dollar musical showstopping films. In its own way, it will blow you away.\\" Once won very high marks from U.S. critics; it is rated 97% \\"fresh\\" by the film review aggregation site Rotten Tomatoes and scored a grade of 88 (\\"universal acclaim\\") according to Metacritic.  In late 2007, Amy Simmons of Time Out London wrote, \\"Carney's highly charged, urban mise-en-scene with its blinking street lamps, vacant shops and dishevelled bed-sits provides ample poetic backdrop for the film's lengthy tracking shots, epitomised in a sequence where the Girl walks to the corner shop in pyjamas and slippers while listening to one of the Guy's songs on her personal stereo. With outstanding performances from Hansard and new-comer Irglova, Carney has created a sublime, visual album of unassuming and self-assured eloquence.\\" The Telegraph's Sukhdev Sandhu said, \\"Not since Before Sunset has a romantic film managed to be as touching, funny or as hard to forget as Once. Like Before Sunset, it never outstays its welcome, climaxing on a note of rare charm and unexpectedness.\\"  The film appeared on many North American critics' top ten lists of the best films of 2007:  In 2008, the film placed third on Entertainment Weekly's \\"25 Best Romantic Movies of the Past 25 Years\\". Question: Are there any other quotes people said about the movie? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are other quotes about the movie from various critics and publications. Here are a few examples: 1. A.O. Scott from The New York Times wrote, \\"Once is a high-concept movie, in a way - a love story about people in love with songs - and it uses its local and international celebrity cast to complicate and deepen that central idea, rather than to sell it.\\" 2. Peter Travers from Rolling Stone said, \\"You don’t need a million dollars to make a movie that gets all the human notes right, just magic and wit and two eminently engaging actors who can sing and break your heart. Once is the little movie that could, should and, by God, must be seen.\\" 3. David Ansen from Newsweek commented, \\"In its modest way, it's a perfect movie - a love story that's tender, funny and extraordinarily heart-warming.\\" 4. Dana Stevens from Slate called the film \\"an unassuming but quietly irresistible romance.\\" These quotes, along with the ones mentioned previously, showcase the overwhelmingly positive reception that Once received from critics and audiences alike. The film's natural performances, captivating music, and authentic storytelling resonated with many people, earning it high praises and numerous accolades."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I punish her? Does this reflect on trashiness or bad morality? Can she still be good? Would you say that these questions are the same?","output":"To address your first question, it's important to understand the context: 1. Historical context: In the traditional Hindu caste system, certain lower castes were considered \\"untouchable\\" and prohibited from interacting with higher castes. However, in modern India, the practice of untouchability is now illegal. 2. Legal context: The Indian Constitution abolished untouchability in 1950, and subsequent legislation and amendments have continually reinforced the criminalization of its practice. Additionally, many countries no longer hold these beliefs and have laws promoting equality. Conclusion: No, the punishment for touching an \\"untouchable\\" would not be enforced, considering legal changes and progress made in recent decades. Regarding your daughter: 1. Analyze the situation: It's important to consider the entirety of her actions, rather than focusing solely on her getting drunk. Was this a one-time occurrence, or is there a pattern of behavior suggesting a larger problem? 2. Address the issue: It's crucial to communicate openly with your daughter about the consequences of underage drinking and the reasons for your concern. This will help you better understand her motivation and decide whether or not punishment is appropriate. 3. Evaluate her character: A single incident does not necessarily define a person's character. It's essential to consider her overall behavior, values, and morals when determining whether or not she is a \\"good\\" person. People can change and learn from their mistakes. 4. Reflect on your values: Your own beliefs about morality and \\"trashiness\\" will shape how you perceive and address the issue. It's essential to consider various perspectives and stay open-minded. 5. Consider external factors: Keep in mind that peer pressure, experimentation, and growing pains are all part of adolescence. These factors might have contributed to her actions. Regarding the similarity of the questions: While both questions involve consideration of the morality and societal norms, they differ in subject, context, and cultural values. Your initial query addresses an abolished historical practice with severe social consequences, while the latter revolves around a personal family matter and individual actions.

He has represented India in all three formats, namely Test, One-Day Internationals (ODIs), and Twenty20 Internationals (T20Is). Kohli played his first international match as an ODI player. He was selected to represent the Indian team during the Idea Cup in Sri Lanka. His debut match took place on August 18, 2008, in an ODI against Sri Lanka at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium in Dambulla. Kohli batted at number two, replacing Sachin Tendulkar for that match after retiring. In his first innings as an international batsman, Kohli scored 12 runs before being dismissed by Nuwan Kulasekara. Following his ODI debut, Kohli continued to cement his place in the Indian team across all formats. He made his T20I debut on June 12, 2010, during the 2010 ICC World Twenty20, where India faced Zimbabwe at the Harare Sports Club in Harare, Zimbabwe. Kohli had a successful T20I debut, scoring an impressive 26 runs off 21 balls. Kohli's Test debut occurred on June 20, 2011, during the West Indies tour.

Hosni Mubarak, 82, has survived would-be assassins and ill health, crushed a rising Islamist radical movement and maintained the peace with neighboring Israel that got his predecessor killed. His government's continued observance of the Camp David accords with Israel is the cornerstone of what peace has been achieved in the decades-long Arab-Israeli conflict. Following the revolt that toppled Tunisia's longtime strongman, demonstrators in the streets of Cairo are standing up to riot police and chanting, \\"Mubarak, Saudi Arabia is waiting for you.\\" Experienced observers say it's the most most significant challenge to his rule yet. \\"I think what the events in OPTIONS: - Arab did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - CNN did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Cairo did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Camp David did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Egypt did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Hosni Mubarak did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Islamist did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Israel did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Israeli did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Mubarak did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Saudi Arabia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said. - Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said.","output":"- Tunisia did was take that sense that nothing could ever change and lead a few people to question it,\\" he said.

This shows that the event in Tunisia made people question the idea that nothing could ever change.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: My father' s response to the bank building at 43rd Street and Fifth Avenue in New York city was immediate and definite: \\"You won' t catch me putting my money in there!\\" he declared, \\"Not in that glass box. \\" Of course, my father is a gentleman of the old school, a member of the generation to whom a good deal of modern architecture is upsetting, but I believe that his negative response was not so much to the architecture as to a violation of his concept of the nature of money. In his generation money was thought of as a real commodity  that could be carried, or stolen. Therefore, to attract the custom of a sensible man, a bank had to have heavy walls, barred windows, and bronze doors, to make sure of the fact, however, untrue, that money would be safe inside. If a building' s design made it appear strong, the institution was necessarily reliable, and the meaning of the heavy wall as an architecture symbol showed the general attitude toward money. But the attitude toward money has, of course, changed. Except pocket money, cash of any kind is now rarely used; money as a tangible commodity has largely been replaced by credit. The banker no longer offers us a safe: he offers us a service in which the most valuable factor is the creativity for the invention of large numbers. It is in no way surprising, in view of this change in attitude, that we are witnessing the disappearance of the heavy-walled bank. Just as the older bank emphasized its strength, this bank by its architecture is proud of imaginative powers. Question: According to this passage, a modern banker should be   _  .

Question: Given the background: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.  and the situation: John wanted to invent a machine. To that end, he devised an experiment in which he used three components, comp A, comp B, and comp C. Comp A was a machine that applied force over a shorter distance. Comp B was also a machine, but it applied force over a longer distance. Comp C was not a machine.  Answer the following question: Would comp A increase or not increase the force applied compared to comp B? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, machines make work easier by either increasing the force applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction of the force applied. It is important to note that machines do not increase the amount of work done, but they alter how the work is accomplished. When a machine increases the force applied, it typically applies the force over a shorter distance. Conversely, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it usually applies less force. In John's experiment, three components are used – comp A, comp B, and comp C. Comp A is a machine that applies force over a shorter distance, while comp B is another machine that applies force over a longer distance. Comp C is not a machine. Given this information, comp A would increase the force applied compared to comp B. Since comp A applies force over a shorter distance, it increases the force applied to accomplish the same amount of work, as stated in the background. This is in contrast to comp B, which applies force over a longer distance, suggesting that it applies less force to accomplish the same work. In conclusion, comp A would increase the force applied compared to comp B due to its functionality of applying force over a shorter distance. By doing so, it enables the user to complete the same amount of work as comp B but with an increased level of force exerted."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I will never buy anything from them again. Answer: Answer:","output":"The tone of the product review is predominantly negative. There are several indications that the reviewer is unhappy with the product and has a poor opinion of it. Firstly, the title, \\"Piece 'O' Crap!!!!!\\" is an immediate giveaway of the negative tone. It suggests that the product is of low quality and not worth a purchase. The use of multiple exclamation marks further emphasizes the reviewer's strong dissatisfaction. In the body of the review, there are several negative statements that allude to various aspects of the product. The reviewer calls it a \\"so-called 'stereo' system,\\" implying that it does not function as it should and does not meet their expectations. They also mention that they bought it for 40.00 at Big Lot's Store, seemingly trying to convey that they had expected a bargain but were left feeling disappointed. Additionally, the reviewer describes the product's performance as unsatisfactory and short-lived. They mention that it only worked for about a month before experiencing issues, like skipping and the remote malfunctioning. The comparison of the product's sound quality to \\"one of those old plastic 45 record players\\" reinforces this negativity, suggesting that it does not provide a satisfactory listening experience. The reviewer also explains that while the product looked good in their daughter's bedroom, it ultimately ended up in the dumpster due to its poor performance. This reveals the reviewer's disappointment with the aesthetics of the product as well, as it was not enough to outweigh the negative aspects of its functionality. Lastly, the reviewer's frustration with the company is apparent in the statement, \\"I can't believe this company can get away with selling this worthless crap.\\" This comment furthers the negative tone, as it questions the company's ethics and demonstrates that the reviewer will choose not to purchase from this business again.

Question: Dyslexia is a problem that restricts the ability to recognize words and connect sounds with letters when people read. People with this learning disorder may also have problems when they write. Dyslexia is not related to eyesight or intelligence. The problem involves areas of the brain that process language. Brain scientists are studying whether they can predict which young children may struggle with reading to provide them with early help. John Gabrieli at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is leading the study of five-year-olds in about twenty schools in the Boston area. They studied in the schools with kindergartens. And for all the children joining in the study, they give them a brief set of paper-and-pencil tests to look at which children appear to be at some risk for struggling to read. So far, fifty of them have been examined in a scanner, a special machine, to show brain activity. Written tests are not always able to identify dyslexia or other problems, while brain scans may offer a more scientific way to identify problems. And with reading problems, early identification is important. When it comes to helping children overcome reading difficulties, the younger the child, the more effective they are. Reading problems are not usually identified until a child is in the third or fourth grade. The later children are recognized as poor readers, the less treatment can help. And, as Professor Gabrieli points out, poor reading can make education a struggle. Reading is everything. Even math and science have textbooks. While the children are given tasks related to reading, the brain scans measure the extent to which certain parts of the brain become active while the children do the work. The scientists say they are pleased with early results from the study, but have a long way to go. According to the passage, which of the followings has the best time to overcome reading difficulties? A) Tom, a boy in the kindergarten. B) Kate, a high school leaver. C) Jane, a primary school student. D) Steve, a man in his thirties.

Translate to English","output":"Certain payments are considered a right arising from treaties. In more detail, this statement indicates that there are specific types of payments which have their legal basis and protection in the international agreements known as treaties. These treaties establish and outline the terms, conditions, and obligations of the participating nations, creating rights and duties for the parties involved. The rights arising from treaties may include financial payments or transfers related to various aspects such as trade, development, human rights, environmental protection, and international cooperation, among others. These payments can take various forms, such as tariffs, fees, or other financial contributions that are required to be fulfilled by the involved parties. The rationale behind the establishment of these payments can vary greatly, ranging from promoting economic growth, fostering diplomatic relations, to providing support to underprivileged communities, or compensating for damages caused by one party to another. To ensure that the various rights are respected and that the obligations stipulated in these treaties are met, there must be a mechanism for international supervision and enforcement. This is typically performed by international organizations and institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the International Court of Justice (ICJ), or the United Nations (UN). These bodies work to promote the proper interpretation and application of treaty provisions and may be called upon to resolve disputes between the parties when issues related to rights and payments arise. Examples of treaty rights involving payments can be found in various international agreements, such as: 1. The Paris Agreement on climate change: This agreement requires developed countries to provide financial resources to help developing countries mitigate and adapt to the adverse effects of climate change, thus giving rise to payments. 2. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT): This agreement governs the international trade between nations by ensuring the reduction of barriers and setting specific payment schemes related to tariffs and quotas. 3. The European Union (EU) treaties: These treaties outline the contributions and financial payments that member states are required to make to the common budget to fund various policies and initiatives within the European Union. In conclusion, certain payments are deemed as rights emerging from treaties, as they establish specific terms and conditions that parties must adhere to in their international relations. These payments encompass a wide range of areas and objectives and are enforced and regulated by international institutions to ensure that the agreements are upheld and to maintain a fair, stable, and prosperous global environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: O'Keeffe was born on November 15, 1887, in a farmhouse located at 2405 Hwy T in the town of Sun Prairie, Wisconsin. Her parents, Francis Calyxtus O'Keeffe and Ida (Totto) O'Keeffe, were dairy farmers. Her father was of Irish descent. Her maternal grandfather George Victor Totto, for whom O'Keeffe was named, was a Hungarian count who came to the United States in 1848. Context: O'Keeffe then spent part of nearly every year working in New Mexico. She collected rocks and bones from the desert floor and made them and the distinctive architectural and landscape forms of the area subjects in her work. Known as a loner, O'Keeffe explored the land she loved often in her Ford Model A, which she purchased and learned to drive in 1929. She often talked about her fondness for Ghost Ranch and Northern New Mexico, as in 1943, when she explained: \\"Such a beautiful, untouched lonely feeling place, such a fine part of what I call the 'Faraway'. It is a place I have painted before ... even now I must do it again.\\"  Due to exhaustion and poor health, she did not work from late 1932 until about the mid-1930s. She was a popular and reputed artist. She received a number of commissions and her works were exhibited in New York and other places. In 1936, she completed what would become one of her most well-known paintings, Summer Days, in 1936. It depicted a desert scene with a deer skull with vibrant wildflowers. Resembling Ram's Head with Hollyhock, it depicted the skull floating above the horizon.  In 1938, the advertising agency N. W. Ayer & Son approached O'Keeffe about creating two paintings for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company (now Dole Food Company) to use in their advertising. Other artists who produced paintings of Hawaii for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company's advertising include Lloyd Sexton, Jr., Millard Sheets, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Isamu Noguchi, and Miguel Covarrubias. The offer came at a critical time in O'Keeffe's life: she was 51, and her career seemed to be stalling (critics were calling her focus on New Mexico limited, and branding her desert images \\"a kind of mass production\\"). She arrived in Honolulu February 8, 1939 aboard the SS Lurline, and spent nine weeks in Oahu, Maui, Kauai, and the island of Hawaii. By far the most productive and vivid period was on Maui, where she was given complete freedom to explore and paint. She painted flowers, landscapes, and traditional Hawaiian fishhooks. Back in New York, O'Keeffe completed a series of 20 sensual, verdant paintings. However, she did not paint the requested pineapple until the Hawaiian Pineapple Company sent a plant to her New York studio.  During the 1940s O'Keeffe had two one-woman retrospectives, the first at the Art Institute of Chicago (1943). Her second was in 1946, when she was the first woman artist to have a retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in Manhattan. Whitney Museum of American Art began an effort to create the first catalogue of her work in the mid-1940s.  In the 1940s, O'Keeffe made an extensive series of paintings of what is called the \\"Black Place\\", about 150 miles west of her Ghost Ranch house. O'Keeffe said that the Black Place resembled \\"a mile of elephants with gray hills and white sand at their feet.\\" She made paintings of the \\"White Place\\", a white rock formation located near her Abiquiu house. Question: What are some of the works she did on commission?. Whats the answer?","output":"One of the commissioned works O'Keeffe did was for the Hawaiian Pineapple Company, now known as Dole Food Company. She was asked to make two paintings for them to use in their advertisements. Despite being in Hawaii and creating many paintings of flowers, landscapes, and traditional Hawaiian fishhooks, she didn't paint the pineapple they requested until they sent a pineapple plant to her in New York. So think of it like this little buddy, it's like when you're asked to draw something specific for your teacher in art class - that's what a commission is.

Context: Absent mothers and abusive fathers are another theme in the novel. Scout and Jem's mother died before Scout could remember her, Mayella's mother is dead, and Mrs. Radley is silent about Boo's confinement to the house. Apart from Atticus, the fathers described are abusers. Bob Ewell, it is hinted, molested his daughter, and Mr. Radley imprisons his son in his house until Boo is remembered only as a phantom. Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray. Atticus stands apart as a unique model of masculinity; as one scholar explains: \\"It is the job of real men who embody the traditional masculine qualities of heroic individualism, bravery, and an unshrinking knowledge of and dedication to social justice and morality, to set the society straight.\\" The answer is:","output":"When people subvert the expectations of their gender, according to the novel, they can lead society astray.

Background: A wood-decay fungus is any species of fungus that digests moist wood, causing it to rot. Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]  Paragraph: The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Was the breakdown of complex molecules lesser or greater in Valley Forest? A:","output":"The breakdown of complex molecules was lesser in Valley Forest.

Callen Radcliffe \\"Cal\\" Tjader, Jr. ( CHAY-d@r; July 16, 1925 - May 5, 1982) was an American Latin jazz musician, known as the most successful non-Latino Latin musician. He explored other jazz idioms, even as he continued to perform the music of Cuba, the Caribbean, and Latin America for the rest of his life. Tjader played the vibraphone primarily. He was accomplished on the drums, bongos, congas, timpani, and the piano. After recording for Fantasy for nearly a decade, Tjader signed with better-known Verve Records, founded by Norman Granz but owned then by MGM. With the luxury of larger budgets and seasoned recording producer Creed Taylor in the control booth, Tjader cut a varied string of albums. During the Verve years Tjader worked with Donald Byrd, Lalo Schifrin, Anita O'Day, Willie Bobo, Armando Peraza, a young Chick Corea, Clare Fischer, Jimmy Heath, Kenny Burrell, and others. Tjader recorded with big band orchestras for the first time, and even made an album based on Asian scales and rhythms.  His biggest success was the album Soul Sauce (1964). Its title track, a Dizzy Gillespie cover Tjader had been toying with for over a decade, was a radio hit (hitting the top 20 on New York's influential pop music station WMCA in May 1965), and landed the album on Billboard's Top 50 Albums of 1965. Titled \\"Guachi Guaro\\" (a nonsensical phrase in Spanish), Tjader transformed the Gillespie/Chano Pozo composition into something new. (The name \\"Soul Sauce\\" came from Taylor's suggestion for a catchier title and Bobo's observation that Tjader's version was spicier than the original.) The song's identifiable sound is a combination of the call-outs made by Bobo (\\"Salsa ahi na ma ... sabor, sabor!\\") and Tjader's crisp vibes work. The album sold over 100,000 copies and popularized the word salsa in describing Latin dance music.  The 1960s were Tjader's most prolific period. With the backing of a major record label, he could afford to stretch out and expand his repertoire. The most obvious deviation from his Latin jazz sound was Several Shades of Jade (1963) and the follow-up Breeze From the East (1963). Both albums attempted to combine jazz and Asian music, much as Tjader and others had done with Afro-Cuban. The result was dismissed by the critics, chided as little more than the dated exotica that had come and gone in the prior decade.  Other experiments were not so easily dismissed. Tjader teamed up with New Yorker Eddie Palmieri in 1966 to produce El Sonido Nuevo (\\"The New Sound\\"). A companion LP was recorded for Palmieri's contract label, Tico, titled Bamboleate. While Tjader's prior work was often dismissed as \\"Latin lounge\\", here the duo created a darker, more sinister sound. Cal Tjader Plays The Contemporary Music Of Mexico And Brazil (1962), released during the bossa nova craze, actually bucked the trend, instead using more traditional arrangements from the two countries' past. In the late 1960s Tjader, along with guitarist Gabor Szabo and Gary McFarland, helped to found the short-lived Skye record label. Tjader's work of this period is characterized by Solar Heat (1968) and Tjader Plugs In (1968-69), precursors to acid jazz.","output":"This text is about Cal Tjader, an American Latin jazz musician known for being the most successful non-Latino Latin musician.

Movie title: Goya's Ghosts Context: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1792, Spain reels amid the turmoil and upheaval of the French Revolution. Francisco Goya (Stellan SkarsgÃ¥rd) is a renowned painter, who, among others, does portraits for the royal family as the Official Court Painter to the King and Queen. The Spanish Inquisition is disturbed by part of Goya's work. Brother Lorenzo Casamares (Javier Bardem) is hiring Goya to paint a portrait and defends him, saying that his works are not evil, they just show evil. He recommends the Church step up the fight against anti-Catholic practices. He requests and is put in charge of intensifying the Inquisition. When posing in Goya's studio, Lorenzo asks Goya about a young model he uses, InÃ©s (Natalie Portman), daughter of a rich merchant, TomÃ¡s BilbatÃºa (JosÃ© Luis GÃ³mez) who also has a son named Ãngel (Unax Ugalde). InÃ©s is spotted by Inquisition spies (trained by Lorenzo) declining a dish of pork in a tavern. The Holy Office of the Inquisition orders InÃ©s to come to the office. There she is arrested and accused of \\"judaizing\\", i.e. spreading Jewish rituals, because she did not eat pork the other evening. She is stripped naked and tortured by strappado (\\"put to The Question\\"), confesses, and is imprisoned. Naturally, the Inquisition's archives had already revealed that one of her father's ancestors had converted from Judaism to Christianity in 1624 upon arrival in Spain from Amsterdam. TomÃ¡s begs Goya for help, who in turn asks Lorenzo to find out about InÃ©s's situation. Lorenzo visits InÃ©s in prison telling her that he is going to help her and will pass a message to her family if she wishes. He offers to pray with InÃ©s, but is clearly struggling with his desire to rape her as she prays in the nude with him at his request. At a dinner in TomÃ¡s's home, where he and Goya are guests, Lorenzo defends \\"The... A:","output":"Insufficient information to provide an answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is Beiderbecke's nickname? , can you please find it?   On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms \\"a severe nervous crisis\\" and Sudhalter and Evans suggest \\"was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens\\", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake. \\"He cracked up, that's all\\", trombonist Bill Rank said. \\"Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.\\"In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as \\"the world's hottest cornetist\\". He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto...

Is the following review positive or negative? Several years ago, we ate at Sammy's a couple of times, and they were great. Finally, we decided to go back for lunch today, and boy, how things have changed!  First, when we arrived, we waited in line for about 15-20 minutes to place our order. Considering that there were only four people in line ahead of us, that seemed excessive. Little did we know that the wait to order was short compared to how long we'd wait for our food!  It took at least 20-30 minutes for our food to be served. People who were in line waiting to order in front of us got their orders, finished, and left before we were served. And this isn't a gourmet fine-dining establishment; it's a sandwich hut. That's way too long to be served.  Our sandwiches weren't anything to get excited about, either.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.  I am facing a new situation today: Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

It has a population of 26.4 million and is the 93rd largest country by area. Bordering China in the north and India in the south, east, and west, it is the largest sovereign Himalayan state. Nepal does not border Bangladesh, which is located within only 27 km (17 mi) of its southeastern tip. It neither borders Bhutan due to the Indian state of Sikkim being located in between.

Kathmandu is the nation's capital and largest city. It is a multiethnic nation with Nepali as the official language.   - Lhotse Shar is a subsidiary mountain of Lhotse, and the 11th-highest mountain on Earth, at high. It has the highest fatality rate of all the eight-thousanders  for every 2 people who summit the mountain, one person dies attempting to.

Question: Information:  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - The Gospel According to John (also called the Gospel of John, the Fourth Gospel, or simply John) is one of the four canonical gospels in the New Testament. It traditionally appears fourth, after the synoptic gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke. John begins with the witness and affirmation of John the Baptist and concludes with the death, burial, resurrection, and post-resurrection appearances of Jesus.  - John the Apostle ( Koine Greek: ; Latin: \\"Ioannes\\") was one of the Twelve Apostles of Jesus according to the New Testament, which refers to him as . He was the son of Zebedee and Salome. His brother was James, who was another of the Twelve Apostles. Christian tradition holds that he outlived the remaining apostles and that he was the only one to die of natural causes: Judas Iscariot died by suicide, while the other ten all are considered to have died a martyr's death. This is because the Church Fathers considered him the same person as John the Evangelist, John of Patmos, John the Elder and the Beloved Disciple, although modern theologians and scholars have not formed a consensus on the relative identities of these men. The traditions of most Christian denominations have held that John the Apostle is the author of several books of the New Testament.  - A gospel is an account describing the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus of Nazareth. The most widely known examples are the four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John which are included in the New Testament, but the term can also used to refer to apocryphal, non-canonical, JewishChristian and gnostic gospels.  - Nazareth (\\"Narat\\" \\"Narath\\" \\"an-Nira\\") is the capital and the largest city in the Northern District of Israel. Nazareth is known as \\"the Arab capital of Israel\\". In its population was . The inhabitants are predominantly Arab citizens of Israel, of whom 69% are Muslim and 30.9% Christian. Nazareth Illit (lit. \\"Upper Nazareth\\") is built alongside old Nazareth, and had a Jewish population of 40,312 in 2014. The Jewish sector was declared a separate city in June 1974.  - John the Evangelist is the name traditionally given to the author of the Gospel of John. Christians have traditionally identified him with John the Apostle, John of Patmos, and John the Presbyter, though this has been disputed by modern scholars.  - The term \\"historical Jesus\\" refers to attempts to \\"reconstruct the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth by critical historical methods,\\" in \\"contrast to Christological definitions ('the dogmatic Christ') and other Christian accounts of Jesus ('the Christ of faith').\\" It also considers the historical and cultural context in which Jesus lived.  - The New Testament (Koine Greek:   , \\"H Kain Diathk\\") is the second major part of the Christian biblical canon, the first part being the Old Testament, based on the Hebrew Bible. The New Testament discusses the teachings and person of Jesus, as well as events in first-century Christianity. Christians regard both the Old and New Testaments together as sacred scripture. The New Testament (in whole or in part) has frequently accompanied the spread of Christianity around the world. It reflects and serves as a source for Christian theology and morality. Both extended readings and phrases directly from the New Testament are also incorporated (along with readings from the Old Testament) into the various Christian liturgies. The New Testament has influenced religious, philosophical, and political movements in Christendom and left an indelible mark on literature, art, and music.  - The Gospel of Peter (\\"kata Petrn euangelion\\"), or Gospel according to Peter, is one of the non-canonical gospels rejected as apocryphal by the Church Fathers and the Catholic Church's synods of Carthage and Rome, which established the New Testament canon. It was the first of the non-canonical gospels to be rediscovered, preserved in the dry sands of Egypt.  - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.  - The Christian Church is a term generally used to refer to the whole group of people belonging to the Christian religious tradition throughout history. In this understanding, the \\"Christian Church\\" does not refer to a particular Christian denomination but to the body of all believers. Some Christians believe that the term \\"Christian Church\\" or \\"Church\\" applies only to a specific historic Christian institution (e.g., the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church, and Oriental Orthodoxy). The Four Marks of the Church first expressed in the Nicene Creed are unity, holiness, catholicity, and apostolicity.  - John of Patmos (also called John the Revelator, John the Divine or John the Theologian; Greek:   ) is the name given to the author of the Book of Revelation, the apocalyptic text forming the final chapter of the New Testament. The text of Revelation states that the author is called John and that he lives on the Greek island of Patmos, where, by some, he is considered to be in exile as a result of anti-Christian persecution under the Roman emperor Domitian.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Patmos (Greek, \\"\\";) is a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea, most famous for being the location of both the vision of and the writing of the Christian Bible's Book of Revelation.  - The Old Testament is the first section of the Christian Bible, based primarily upon the Hebrew Bible (or Tanakh), a collection of religious writings by ancient Israelites believed by most Christians and religious Jews to be the sacred Word of God. It is the counterpart to the New Testament, the second portion of the Christian Bible. The Old Testament canon varies between Christian Churches. Protestants have a version with 39 books. Catholics have a version with 46 books, and Eastern Orthodox, and Oriental Orthodox Churches choose the Old Testament version with 49 books.  - Hebrew Bible or Hebrew Scriptures is the term used by biblical scholars to refer to the \\"Tanakh\\", the canonical collection of Jewish texts, which is the common textual source of several canonical editions of the Christian Old Testament. They are composed mainly in Biblical Hebrew, with some passages in Biblical Aramaic (in the books of Daniel, Ezra and a few others).  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - In Abrahamic religions, the Messiah or Messias is a saviour or liberator of a group of people, more specifically, the Jewish people.  - In Judaism, a rabbi is a teacher of Torah. This title derives from the Hebrew word ' , meaning \\"My Master\\" (irregular plural ' ), which is the way a student would address a master of Torah. The word \\"master\\" \\"\\" literally means \\"great one\\".  - John the Presbyter was an obscure figure of the early Church who is either distinguished from or identified with the Apostle John, by some also John the Divine. He appears in fragments from the church father Papias of Hierapolis as one of the author's sources and is first unequivocally distinguished from the Apostle by Eusebius of Caesarea. He is frequently proposed as an alternative author of some of the Johannine books in the New Testament.  - The First Epistle of John , often referred to as First John ( US ) or One John ( UK ) ( and written 1 John ) is a book of the New Testament . This fourth catholic or \`\` general '' epistle is attributed to John the Evangelist , traditionally thought to be the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Epistles of John . This Epistle was probably written in Ephesus between the years 95 -- 110 . The work was written to counter docetism , which is the belief that Jesus did not come \`\` in the flesh '' , but only as a spirit . It also defined how Christians are to discern true teachers : by their ethics , their proclamation of Jesus in the flesh , and by their love .  - In Christian terminology, docetism (from the Greek \\"doken\\" (to seem) \\"dóksis\\" (apparition, phantom), according to Norbert Brox, is defined narrowly as \\"the doctrine according to which the phenomenon of Christ, his historical and bodily existence, and thus above all the human form of Jesus, was altogether mere semblance without any true reality.\\" Broadly it is taken as the belief that Jesus only seemed to be human, and that his human form was an illusion. The word \\"Doktaí\\" (illusionists) referring to early groups who denied Jesus' humanity, first occurred in a letter by Bishop Serapion of Antioch (197203), who discovered the doctrine in the Gospel of Peter, during a pastoral visit to a Christian community using it in Rhosus, and later condemned it as a forgery. It appears to have arisen over theological contentions concerning the meaning, figurative or literal, of a sentence from the Gospel of John: \\"the Word was made Flesh\\".  - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or   , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.    What entity does 'first epistle of john' has the relation 'religion' with? Answer:","output":"The First Epistle of John has a relation with Christianity as its religion. It is a book of the New Testament and is attributed to John the Evangelist, who is traditionally considered the author of the Gospel of John and the other two Epistles of John. The epistle was written to address various issues in the early Christian church and to provide guidance on faith and love in Christian living."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices:  (1). Billy was very happy.;  (2). Billy was very upset.; Write a story that ends with: (2).","output":"Once upon a time in a quaint little village surrounded by green fields and beautiful forests, lived a young boy named Billy. The village was a haven to all who called it home, with friendly neighbors, bountiful harvests, and a great sense of community. Billy had two loving and supportive parents, and an indomitable will that attracted every villager. He was the kind of child who had a contagious energy that lit up the room and made everyone who met him adore him. Billy had always dreamt of being a great knight for his faithfulness in hero stories. He would often daydream about the brave adventures he would go on, saving the kingdom from dragons, rescuing damsels in distress, and bringing justice to the land. His strong determination to turn his dreams into reality made him look forward to the village's annual Silver Sword Tournament, where the grand prize was a chance to train as a knight under the guidance of Sir Aldrich, the kingdom's most revered knight. On the day of the tournament, the whole village was buzzing with excitement. The arena was packed with villagers waiting to see which mighty warrior would emerge as the winner. Billy was so inspired by the colorful banners, the sound of the trumpets, and the camaraderie around him that his eyes sparkled with anticipation. The tournament began with the loud ringing of the bell, and the village saw a whirlwind of brave blows, tense moments, and skillful strikes. As the competition went on, it quickly became apparent that Billy was exceptionally skilled. His hard work, unyielding spirit, and unwavering dedication seemed to pay off. In the final round, Billy faced a muscular knight named Sir Galahad, known for his stern demeanor and ruthless battle tactics. Billy was initially intimidated by Sir Galahad's imposing stature. However, he recalled what his parents taught him - that courage is not the absence of fear but the ability to overcome it. As the final round began, Billy and Sir Galahad charged each other with their swords, locked in a fierce duel. The villagers cheered for their favorite competitor, and as the battle wore on, it became clear that both warriors possessed immense skill and determination. As the minutes passed, the battle intensified, with neither opponent conceding an inch. Finally, after what seemed like hours but was merely fifteen minutes, Billy saw an opening and took it. He feigned an attack to the right and then quickly spun around, catching Sir Galahad off guard. With a swift, confident thrust of his sword, he disarmed his opponent. The villagers erupted in a jubilant roar, and it was then that Billy knew he had won. As the victor, Billy was to be crowned with the prestigious Silver Sword Medal and be granted the opportunity to train under Sir Aldrich. However, the kingdom's Queen, who was present to witness the competition, called for silence. She announced that she wanted to give the prize to Sir Galahad instead, claiming that his performance was more \\"in line with the kingdom's values.\\" Despite the outrage of the villagers, the Queen's decision prevailed. Billy's hard work, talent, and relentless pursuit of his dreams were discarded in favor of a less-deserving competitor. The young boy's heart sank as he watched Sir Galahad accept the Silver Sword Medal that should have been his, and Sir Aldrich solemnly bowed to the knight. The ceremony ended, and Billy made his way back home, utterly devastated. As he trudged through the village, friends and strangers alike came forward to offer their condolences and words of encouragement. But through this shower of uplifting words, Billy couldn't fight back the bitter taste that welled up in the back of his throat. That day marked a significant turning point in Billy's life. As he sat on the windowsill of his small room, gazing into the vast, starlit sky, he would always remember that the unjust and seemingly random cruelty of the world had robbed him of his dreams, and his heart filled with sorrow. Thus, while the village only grew more fond of him and hoped for the boy's newfound resilience, deep down, Billy was very upset."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Needs Improvement to Reach Its Full Potential Review: After using the com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid app for the past week, I have to say that I am a bit disappointed with the overall experience. This application, which is designed to provide gamers with an emulator for the extraordinarily popular DS console, definitely has some potential but is currently held back by a host of flaws. I am giving this app 2 stars out of 5 to highlight certain areas that require attention and improvement. Firstly, the app's user interface feels highly outdated. The design is reminiscent of early 2000s applications and does not meet the modern, sleek aesthetic that users have come to expect for their smartphones or tablets. An updated interface would make navigation and personalization of the app more appealing and user-friendly. Secondly, I have experienced severe performance issues with the app. The emulator's inconsistent frame rate makes it nearly impossible to enjoy the games I used to adore. While playing some of the more graphically-intensive titles, the app would often freeze or crash, forcing me to restart the application repeatedly. It is important to note that my device well surpasses the minimum requirements for running the app. Unfortunately, this performance inconsistency significantly detracts from the overall experience and limits its appeal to the casual gamer. In addition, the app's audio quality is subpar. The sound often lags behind the actual in-game events, creating a jarring experience while playing. Additionally, the audio quality is frequently drowned in static noise that makes it difficult to appreciate the game's original soundtrack and sound effects. Another significant issue I encountered is the lack of compatibility with certain ROM formats. While a decent selection of games could be played, I was disappointed by the app's inability to load several of my favorite titles, despite them being in a supported format. The app's development team should look into these compatibility issues to ensure that users can access a broader range of titles. Lastly, the app's tutorial is far from comprehensive. Due to this, users unfamiliar with emulators might face difficulties understanding how to properly load and configure games. A more elaborate and detailed tutorial could help alleviate this problem. In conclusion, while the idea behind the com.opendoorstudios.ds4droid app is exciting, there are too many issues in its current state that prevent it from being a viable solution for mobile gaming enthusiasts. With an updated user interface, stable performance, improved audio quality, better compatibility, and a more informative tutorial, this app has the potential to be an excellent DS emulator. I hope the developers take user feedback seriously and invest time and resources in optimizing the app to better cater to its target audience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Add spaces: ·PaintwithVikingcolours.","output":"\\"Paint with Viking colours\\" is a phrase that you might have encountered in the context of art, history, or recreation of ancient Nordic culture. Adding spaces to this phrase, it should be \\"Paint with Viking colours.\\" Let's explore the meaning and significance of this saying. The Vikings were a seafaring people from the Scandinavian countries (modern-day Denmark, Sweden, and Norway) who were active from approximately the late eighth to the early eleventh century. They were known for their vibrant and dynamic culture, where art, craftsmanship, and storytelling had a significant and valued role. Viking colours were typically derived from natural dyes, and their vibrant art often included intricately designed patterns, animal figures, and often representations of various elements of Norse mythology. Present-day enthusiasts of Viking history might seek to use these colours to replicate or create artwork inspired by the Vikings. Some of the main colours used by the Vikings include: 1. Red: This strong, vivid colour was obtained from the Madder plant's roots and was very popular in Viking clothing and artwork. Red symbolised warmth, power, passion, and vitality in Viking art. 2. Blue: This cool hue was collected from the Woad plant and was associated with wealth, stability, and wisdom. Due to the difficulty in producing blue dye, it was generally reserved for the higher classes. 3. Yellow: A vibrant colour, yellow was derived from the Weld plant. Yellow was used to represent happiness, energy, and light. Viking clothing and textiles often featured this lively colour. 4. Green: This refreshing colour was produced by mixing the blue dye obtained from the Woad plant with the yellow dye from the Weld plant. Green was associated with life, renewal, and fertility. 5. Brown: This earthy colour was obtained from various tree barks and was often used as a base colour in Viking art and craftsmanship. Brown symbolised the connection to the natural world and stability. 6. Black: Obtained from coal or soot, black symbolised mystery, power, and sophistication. The Vikings would often use this colour for outlining their intricate patterns and carving decoration into wood and metal. 7. White: This neutral colour was achieved using chalk or lime and was a symbol of purity, innocence, and simplicity. White was typically used to contrast other colours and accentuate patterns in Viking artwork. To paint with Viking colours, artists today can research authentic colour recipes and gather natural materials to recreate the dyes used by the Vikings. They can apply these colours to various art forms, including traditional Viking motifs, textiles, crafts, and even wall art that showcases and pays homage to the vibrant Viking culture and stories. In conclusion, \\"Paint with Viking colours\\" is a phrase that refers to the use of historically accurate and vibrant colours often seen in Viking art and culture. Using these colours in artwork can offer a visually rich connection to the past and bring the magic and mythos of the Viking era to life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: - Subject: Both tournaments - Assertion: have a tradition to invite countries outside the region - Extra information: despite the clear distinction between the two confederations Sentence 2: - Subject: Both tournaments - Assertion: know a tradition to invite countries outside the region - Extra information: despite the clear separation between the two confederations Now, the comparison: Both sentences refer to the same subject, \\"Both tournaments.\\" The assertions are similar but slightly different: Sentence 1 uses \\"have a tradition,\\" while sentence 2 says \\"know a tradition.\\" Although the two phrases are not exactly the same, the meaning of both sentences can be understood as that both tournaments are known for inviting countries outside the region as part of their tradition. The dilemma appears in how the verbs \\"have\\" and \\"know\\" are used to express different relationships to the tradition. \\"Have a tradition\\" is a standard way to express that something is a tradition, whereas \\"know a tradition\\" can be interpreted as the tournaments being aware of the tradition, without necessarily following it. Lastly, the extra information in both sentences is also similar but with slightly different wording: \\"clear distinction\\" vs. \\"clear separation\\" between the two confederations. The difference is minimal and does not change the meaning significantly. In conclusion, although these sentences are not perfect paraphrases of each other due to the difference in verbs (\\"have\\" and \\"know\\") and the slight variation between \\"clear distinction\\" and \\"clear separation,\\" they convey similar meanings. The overall idea – that both tournaments, despite being part of separate confederations, invite countries from outside the region as part of their tradition – is present in both sentences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Answer the question below:   If John increases the rate at which gas exits the bottom of his rocket, what will happen to the upward momentum of the rocket? It will increase or decrease?    Assuming that:  The rocket goes upwards because the hot gases shoot downwards out of the nozzle. The faster the gases go downwards, the faster the rocket goes upwards. Answer:","output":"If John increases the rate at which gas exits the bottom of his rocket, the upward momentum of the rocket will increase.  This conclusion can be derived from the principle of conservation of momentum and Newton's Third Law of Motion. When the gas exits the rocket at a faster rate, it increases the downward momentum of the gas. By conservation of momentum, the total momentum of the system (rocket + gas) must remain constant. Therefore, the rocket must compensate by increasing its upward momentum.  Newton's Third Law of Motion also supports this conclusion. When the gas is expelled downwards with a higher force, there is an equal and opposite force exerted on the rocket in the upward direction, causing the rocket to accelerate faster upwards. In summary, when the rate at which gas exits the bottom of the rocket is increased, the upward momentum of the rocket will also increase."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Question: \\"What status did Cicero hold in Roman times?\\"  Context: \\"Roman religion was thus practical and contractual, based on the principle of do ut des, \\"I give that you might give.\\" Religion depended on knowledge and the correct practice of prayer, ritual, and sacrifice, not on faith or dogma, although Latin literature preserves learned speculation on the nature of the divine and its relation to human affairs. Even the most skeptical among Rome's intellectual elite such as Cicero, who was an augur, saw religion as a source of social order. For ordinary Romans, religion was a part of daily life. Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and libations to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The Roman calendar was structured around religious observances. Women, slaves, and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported Vestals, who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until disbanded under Christian domination.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"Cicero held the status of an augur in Roman times. Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the context. - The context talks about the Roman religion, its principles and practices, and the various beliefs of the people at the time. - Within the context, Cicero is mentioned as being among Rome's intellectual elite and also holding a specific role. Step 2: Extract the relevant information about Cicero's status. - The key information about Cicero's status is: \\"Cicero, who was an augur\\" Step 3: Determine what an augur is within the context of Roman times. - Augurs were religious officials in ancient Rome who were responsible for interpreting the will of the gods by observing and interpreting various signs and omens. This role was prominent and influential in the Roman society and political sphere. Step 4: Combine the information to provide a coherent answer. - The answer should include Cicero's status as an augur, which identifies his standing within the Roman society during that time period.

Scoop out the avocado flesh from one half of the fruit, and place it in a bowl. Mash the avocado with a fork until it’s fairly smooth. If the avocado is small, you may want to scoop out the flesh from both halves to use for your mask. You should have enough for a mask that you can spread all over your face. Once you’ve mashed the avocado, add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of plain yogurt, 1 teaspoon (5 ml) of olive oil, and 1 tablespoon (15 ml) of organic honey to the bowl. Use a spoon to fully combine all of the ingredients in a smooth paste.  If the mask seems runny and you’ve only added half of the avocado, mix in some more of the flesh to thicken it up. The omega fatty acids in the avocado and olive oil help heal cracks between the skin cells that can occur when your skin is dehydrated. Honey and yogurt are soothing ingredients that help moisturize and soften the skin. When the mask is fully mixed, use your fingers to carefully spread it all over your face. Allow the mask to sit on your skin for 15 to 20 minutes so the omega fatty acids in the avocado and olive oil have time to penetrate. Be careful when you’re applying the mask around your hairline. The honey can be very sticky if it gets in your hair. When you’ve let the mask sit on your skin for at least 15 minutes, rinse it off with warm water from the sink. Because the mask can be fairly sticky, you may want to use a washcloth to help remove it. Be sure to rinse especially well along your hairline.","output":"Create a nourishing facial mask by combining mashed avocado, plain yogurt, olive oil, and organic honey, and allowing it to sit on your face for 15-20 minutes before rinsing off."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a goal: get pumped Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"To get pumped, let's consider two primary methods: physical exercise and mental motivation. I will break down each method step-by-step and then compare them to decide which one makes more sense. Method 1: Physical Exercise 1. Choose a suitable form of exercise: Select an activity or workout that will increase heart rate and release endorphins, such as running, strength training, or any type of high-intensity exercise. 2. Warm up: Spend 5-10 minutes on a light warm-up routine to prepare the body for the workout. 3. Execute the exercise plan: Perform the chosen exercise with proper form and technique, gradually increasing intensity. 4. Hydrate and take breaks: Keep hydrated throughout the workout and take short breaks as needed. 5. Cool down: End with a cool-down routine and stretch to relax the muscles. Method 2: Mental Motivation 1. Set a goal: Be specific about what you want to achieve, such as finishing a project, facing a challenge, or reaching a personal milestone. 2. Visualize success: Picture yourself achieving the goal and feeling the sense of accomplishment. 3. Break the goal into smaller steps: Determine the tasks or actions required to achieve the goal and make a plan to tackle them. 4. Seek motivation: Listen to motivational speeches, read inspiring quotes, or get encouragement from supportive friends and family members. 5. Maintain a positive mindset: Focus on your achievements and stay optimistic. Comparing the two methods, physical exercise offers more immediate results as the body releases adrenaline and endorphins during the workout, leaving you feeling pumped up. Mental motivation, on the other hand, requires more time and effort in maintaining a positive mindset and dealing with potential setbacks. In conclusion, if you are looking for a faster and more tangible way to get pumped, physical exercise would make more sense. However, mental motivation can also be effective if you need to boost your confidence and morale over a longer period. Ultimately, combining both methods might be the most effective approach to stay consistently pumped and motivated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Said to have been originally put in place to prevent the use of such terms “as insults or slurs”, it was a step too far for many, including Richard Gaywood, a gamer who was banned from the service.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Stephen Colbert a good choice to replace David Letterman David Letterman and Stephen Colbert. (AP Photo/CBS, Worldwide Pants Inc.) CBS acted quickly to find a replacement for the retiring David Letterman and came up with a choice that, on paper, fills the bill. Despite NBC‘s cocky assurances that Jimmy Fallon wouldn’t be affected by a new host of the CBS “Late Show,” Stephen Colbert will give the Peacock a run for its money. The question is: When will viewers get tired of all the current and former “SNL” guests that Fallon and Seth Meyers keep trotting out to remind us of their pedigree? That aside, Colbert is the right age to do what CBS needs in the “Late Night” job: Someone who’s not twenty-something, but is still hip enough to draw the elusive 18-to-49 demo. Oh yeah, he’s also very funny. What we don’t know is what Colbert will be like as an interviewer. Yes, he does interviews on “The Colbert Report,” but in the persona of the wack neo-con “Stephen Colbert.” While it’s impossible to argue with the logic of the Colbert choice on any level, it has to be noted that CBS had a chance to make a more daring move for “Late Night” by finding either a woman or a person of color, or both. That could have been done without upsetting the 49-and-up demo. Had the choice been a more obvious attempt to pander to the younger demo — say, someone like Kamau Bell — the network would have faced a possible erosion of the older demo. Other candidates have been mentioned, such as Chelsea Handler, who’s said, at least, that she won’t re-up at E! when her “Chelsea Lately” contract is up. But Handler didn’t get where she is by being, well, Ellen Degeneres, to name another host whose name has been bandied about. The late night paradigm is old and and tattered. With Colbert, the three broadcast networks (speaking of old and tattered) with have three youngish guys hosting. That makes sense for now. Whether it will make sense five years from now is the question. But let’s also acknowledge that at least three youngish guys, even if they are all white, competing for the same audience has some potential of nudging the viability of a late night show forward, if only incrementally. Competition is good. The kind of competition we would have seen if Letterman weren’t retiring could have been good for the concept of a late night talk show overall, but on another level, it could have been rather sad and unseemly: David Letterman has accomplished far too much to be pecked to ratings death by ducklings. So, let the late night games begin. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Stephen Colbert was chosen to replace David Letterman on CBS' \\"Late Show\\" because he is funny, the right age, and can attract the 18-to-49-year-old audience. While some wanted a more diverse choice, Colbert is expected to provide strong competition for other late-night hosts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

By Josh Peterson, editor      Coffee County Central High School and Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency officials are investigating to find out who killed a bobcat and hung the body from the goalposts of the Tullahoma High School practice football field Tuesday.      A photo began circulating rapidly on social media website Tuesday morning showing a dead bobcat suspended in the air above the Tullahoma practice football field. Tullahoma City Schools have since confirmed that a dead bobcat was found on campus.      Coffee County Central’s Red Raiders and the Tullahoma High School Wildcats are scheduled to play in the 89th annual Coffee Pot Rivalry football game at 7 p.m. Friday in Tullahoma.      “This isn’t what a rivalry is about and this is not what our school and our community are about,” said CHS principal Dr. Joey Vaughn Wednesday morning. “This isn’t rivalry. This is mean. This is wrong and hateful. This does not represent our student body as a whole. We have great kids at our school and Tullahoma has great kids at its school.”      The dead bobcat was found by students at THS Tuesday morning who reported it to their teacher, according to Tullahoma Director of Schools Dr. Dan Lawson. He stated in an email release that Tullahoma Police Department and Tullahoma Animal Control were notified and removed the deceased animal.      Vaughn said interviews were ongoing as of noon Thursday with no suspect in mind. He said the CHS administration is working closely with TWRA officials.      “We are working with TWRA and they are interviewing people and following up on leads and [school administration] is doing that as well,” said Vaughn. “We are being very diligent with this but at this point we still do not know who is to blame and what their affiliation might be. We don’t know if it was a student or an adult.”      Vaughn released a written statement Wednesday condemning the act and calling it “callous.”      “The rivalry between Coffee County Central High School and Tullahoma High School has a storied tradition with mutual respect from both sides,” Vaughn’s statement reads. “There have been various events throughout these years, but this week someone took a high school rivalry and took it too far. The actions of a few do not represent this community as a whole. At this time we do not know who committed this callous act or what their involvement with the rivalry is, but there is no place in our community or this world for these types of actions. The rivalry will continue on the football field this Friday night and we ask that our community remember that we have outstanding young people representing both great high schools. ”      Lawson also issued a statement through email, which reads:      “Local authorities and officials with Coffee County High School and Tullahoma High School are investigating this issue,” Lawson’s statement reads. “This despicable act does not represent the leadership, citizenry or the vast majority of students at Coffee County High School and Tullahoma High School. We are friends, neighbors, relatives and at time fierce competitors, but that fierce competition leaves no room for cruelty to animals. Nearly every student in Tullahoma and Manchester is disgusted that any innocent animal is used as an object lesson and all are hopeful that our competition is safe, fair and fun.”      According to the Tennessee Wildlife Resource Agency website, there is a season for hunting bobcats but that season does not open until Nov. 21. School officials haven’t been able to answer further questions as to how the bobcat was actually killed.      According to Doug Markham with TWRA, killing the animal out of season would be a misdemeanor.      “If we found out who it was and he or she killed it out of season they could be charged with hunting in closed season and they could face fines and court costs. They could lose their hunting license,” explained Markham.      “That is not a good way to treat a critter for a prank, that’s for sure,” added Markham.

The deal: Junk mortgage story just gets worse NEW YORK (Fortune) -- Back two years ago when the mortgage meltdown was heating up, we wrote an article called \\"Junk Mortgages Under the Microscope\\" dissecting a particularly wretched mortgage-backed securities issue peddled by Goldman Sachs. We wanted to show how these complex securities really worked and how Moody's and S&P, the rating agencies, aided and abetted the process by giving two-thirds of an issue backed by ultra-risky second mortgages the same safety rating they gave to U.S. Treasury securities. We thought this was a cautionary tale -- but it's turned into a horror story. All the tranches of this issue, GSAMP-2006 S3, that were originally rated below AAA have defaulted. Two of the three original AAA -rated tranches (French for \\"slices\\") are facing losses of about 90%, and even the \\"super senior,\\" safer-than-mere-AAA slice is facing losses of 25%. How could this happen? And what lessons can we take away from it? Let's revisit the way this security was put together, and how and why it fell apart. And for the first time, we can even estimate the value -- low -- of the mortgages backing it, thanks to a new service called ABSNet Loan HomeVal. Our tale begins in April 2006, when Goldman Sachs (GS, Fortune 500) sold 494 million of securities to institutional investors seeking yields somewhat above those that were available on U.S. Treasuries or high-rated corporate bonds. It was an especially hinky offering, because it was backed by second mortgages rather than by traditional first mortgages. A first mortgage rarely becomes completely worthless, because a house is usually worth something. But often all it takes is a decline of 20% in a home's value to wipe out a second mortgage, which is typically piled on top of an 80% first mortgage. In our case, borrowers' stated equity in their homes averaged less than 1% -- 0.71%, to be precise. Even that was doubtless overstated because a majority of the mortgages were low-documentation and no-documentation. Despite these problems, the formulas used by Moody's and S&P allowed Goldman to market the top three slices of the security -- cleverly called A-1, A-2 and A- 3 -- as AAA rated. That meant they were supposedly as safe as U.S. Treasury securities. But of course they weren't. More than a third of the loans were on homes in California, then a superhot market, now a frigid one. Defaults and rating downgrades began almost immediately. In July 2008, the last piece of the issue originally rated below AAA defaulted -- it stopped making interest payments. Now every month's report by the issue's trustee, Deutsche Bank, shows that the old AAAs -- now rated D by S&P and Ca by Moody's -- continue to rot out. As of Oct. 26, date of the most recent available trustee's report, only 79.6 million of mortgages were left, supporting 159.9 million of bonds. In other words, each dollar of bonds had a claim on less than 50¢ of mortgages. But even worse, those mortgages aren't worth anything like their 79.6 million of face value, according to ABSNet Loan HomeVal. ABSNet, unveiled in October, combines a database from Lewtan Technologies of Waltham, Mass., that has a list of every mortgage underlying every mortgage-backed issue, with data from Collateral Analytics of Honolulu, which tracks individual home values. It gives you a snapshot of the value of the collateral backing a mortgage security. As of Sept. 26 -- a slightly different date from what we're using above -- ABSNet valued the remaining mortgages in our issue at a tad above 20% their face value. Now, watch this math. If the mortgages are worth 20% of their face value and each dollar of mortgages supports more than 2 of bonds, it means that the remaining bonds are worth maybe 10% of face value. If all the originally AAA -rated bonds were the same, they'd all be facing losses of 90% or so in value. However, they weren't the same. The A-1 \\"super senior\\" tranche was entitled to get all the principal payments from all the borrowers until it was paid off in full. Then A-2 and A-3 would share the repayments, then repayments would move down to the lower-rated issues. But under the security's rules, once the M-1 tranche -- the highest-rated piece of the issue other than the A tranches -- defaulted in July 2008, all the A's began sharing in the repayments. The result is that only about 28% of the original A-1 \\"super seniors\\" are outstanding, compared with more than 98% of A-2 and A-3. If you apply a 90% haircut, the losses work out to about 25% for the \\"super seniors,\\" and about 90% for A-2 and A-3. This was an especially bad issue, which we picked (on advice of some bond mavens who aren't competitors of Goldman Sachs) precisely because it was so awful. According to Bloomberg LP, recent trades in the A's were at less than 7% of face value. So the market is saying the losses are even greater than our estimates. Goldman and Moody's declined to discuss this security. S&P told us that it had toughened its standards in 2005 and had discontinued rating second-mortgage securities in 2008. \\"Had we anticipated fully the severity of the declines in these markets at the time we issued our original ratings, many of those ratings would have been different,\\" a spokesman said. Now to the investment lessons: The first is, Don't put your faith in rating agencies, even though some branches of the federal government, including the Federal Reserve, use ratings to determine whether certain securities qualify as collateral under federal loan programs to financial institutions. Our problem is that if things change for the worse after the original rating comes out, the agencies' response is, \\"Oops, sorry about that,\\" and they revise the ratings down after you've already taken a hit. When lawsuits arrive, the agencies say all they did was issue an opinion that's protected under the First Amendment, therefore they're not liable. The second lesson is, No matter how fancy the name is on the offering statement -- Goldman Sachs, the calumny being heaped on it lately notwithstanding, is still Wall Street's alpha outfit -- you're on your own if the issue heads south. The final lesson is, Beware of the dangers of bottom fishing. It would have been tempting to buy this security when the original AAA paper traded down to the low two-digits -- but any buyer that did that is sitting on big losses. Just as things often rise further than you think they will and stay there longer, they can also fall further than you think and keep on falling. Remember that when someone tells you that something is so cheap that it has nowhere to go but up.

Pascal's law (also Pascal's principle or the principle of transmission of fluid-pressure) is a principle in fluid mechanics that states that a pressure change occurring anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere. The law was established by French mathematician Blaise Pascal in 1647–48. Can we infer the following? Pascal's law was invented by earl","output":"It would be incorrect to infer that Pascal's law was invented by an \\"Earl,\\" as its origins can be traced back to the work of French mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal (1623-1662). Pascal's law, also known as Pascal's principle or the principle of transmission of fluid-pressure, was formulated during the period between 1647 and 1648. Let's explore the background and evolution of Pascal's law in more detail to better understand its development. Blaise Pascal was a prominent mathematician, physicist, and philosopher whose notable contributions to the fields of fluid mechanics and hydrodynamics can still be seen in many modern applications today. Apart from formulating Pascal's law, he was also known for his work on conic sections and probability theory, which were deemed fundamental to the advancement of both mathematics and physics. Pascal's law, as you mentioned, states that a pressure change occurring anywhere in a confined, incompressible fluid is transmitted throughout the fluid such that the same change occurs everywhere. This concept is crucial for understanding the behavior of fluids under pressure and has practical applications in hydraulic systems, fluid mechanics, and engineering. The establishment of Pascal's law followed a series of observations and experiments conducted by Pascal. One famous experiment involved the use of a barrel filled with water, in which Pascal inserted a long vertical tube. As he poured more water into the tube, the pressure inside the barrel increased, which eventually led to the barrel's rupture. This experiment provided empirical evidence of the direct relationship between pressure and fluid depth. Pascal's work and discoveries were built upon the earlier contributions and observations of other scientists. Notably, Pascal was heavily influenced by the works of Galileo Galilei and Evangelista Torricelli, who had already begun researching the principles of fluid mechanics and atmospheric pressure. In conclusion, it is inaccurate to infer that Pascal's law was invented by an \\"Earl.\\" The law is instead attributed to Blaise Pascal, who formulated it based on his experiments and contributions from other prominent scientists.

Here are possible answers to this question: - demonstration - kitchen - furniture store - hallway - apartment  I believe the correct choice is \\"furniture store\\", here's why: The answer is:","output":"\\"Furniture store\\", and here's why: Among the provided options, the most reasonable and direct answer to the question \\"Where do you get a table?\\" is a furniture store. A furniture store is specifically dedicated to selling a wide range of furniture items, including tables, chairs, beds, and other home furnishings. Since their primary purpose is to provide customers with options for purchasing furniture, tables can be found in these stores, available in various styles, sizes, materials, and price ranges, catering to different preferences and requirements. Let's also review the other options and explain why they aren't as suitable: 1. Demonstration: A demonstration typically refers to an explanation or a presentation of a product or service to showcase its features and benefits. While tables may be showcased during demonstrations, it is not the appropriate place to acquire one. Demonstrations are simply meant to educate or display products but are not necessarily a place to purchase items. 2. Kitchen: While a kitchen is a common location in homes and apartments where a table is placed, it is not a place to acquire a table. The kitchen is the room where people prepare and cook food, and a table may be present for dining purposes or providing additional counter space. However, it isn't a place to go shopping for a table. 3. Hallway: A hallway is a corridor or passage connecting different rooms within a building, typically found in homes and offices. It mainly serves as a means of moving from one room to another and is not a place where tables are acquired. Although decorative tables can occasionally be found in hallways, it is not a source for purchasing tables. 4. Apartment: An apartment is a living space, usually consisting of rooms in a multi-story building. It's not a place where people can purchase tables. While an apartment may contain a table or other furniture items for residents' use and comfort, it is not a store or source of supply for tables. In conclusion, a furniture store is the most fitting choice for acquiring a table, as it is a retail establishment that specializes in the sale of furniture for various purposes and spaces, including tables. The other options mentioned, such as demonstrations, kitchens, hallways, and apartments, are either unsuitable or not designed for acquiring tables."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: The most popular names in the west Every year in Englishspeaking countries,people list the most popular names. Here are some examples. In the United States at the moment the three most popular names for girls are Emily,Emma and Madison. For boys,they are Michael,Joshua and Mathew. In Britain a parent today might call their little girl Grace,Jessica or Ruby. If they have a little boy they could call him Jack,Thomas or Oliver. In China names have very clear meanings. If a girl is called Mei,her name means \\"beautiful\\". If a boy is called Wu,his name means \\"like a soldier\\". Names in Englishspeaking countries are like this too. The girl's name Joy is probably partly chosen because the parents wish their daughter to be joyful and bring joy to others. If a girl is called Ruby,it may be because of the beautiful red precious stone. Parents often pick names that can be shortened. This can be confusing for Chinese people. Parents might choose such names because they want to be able to speak to their kid in a personal way. For example,a popular name is William. But William can be shortened to Will,Willy,Bill and Billy. The same is true of the favourite old name for a girl,Elizabeth. Elizabeth can be shortened to Beth,Liza and Liz. Another reason why kids get the names they do is that parents want to name their boy or girl after someone who is famous,such as an actor,a pop music star or a sports star.

Classify each post into the following categories : AUTHOR (if the author of the post is wrong in the situation), OTHER (if any of the others mentioned in the paragraph is wrong), EVERYBODY (if everyone mentioned is wrong) and NOBODY (if no one is wrong in the situation). This may sound like a typical run of the mill sibling rivalry, but I’m sick of everything and I can’t do much because I’m young. Lets start off with my brother. Annoying, a druggie, high school drop out, and overall fucking jerk. 25 years old. Is “sick” and had/currently still has autism. My relationship with them is nonexistent, and always has been. I’ve tried to make amends, but its always ended in them just yelling at me and my parents taking his side for stupid situations that are clearly his fault. I’ve been verbally and physically abused by them ever since I can remember, from them busting my front teeth out while they were in high school over a slushie, to them constantly butting in to conversations and disrespecting my parents, constantly arguing with both me and my family, always threatening to smack me and cursing at them. My parents have done the best they can to help him out, from offering to give him money, get him a job, funding rehab and therapy classes, and he simply doesn’t want to do anything.  All I’ve witnessed are constant fights over him stealing money and using any of the money that my parents DO give him to buy drugs. Theres not a single day that there isn’t an argument in my household. Its come to the point where I absolutely just hate being home and in my brothers presence in general, because all he does is call me a worthless brat, a bitch, and a few threats to bust my face in. He’s overstayed his welcome in this house, but my parents refuse to do anything with him and just baby him by putting him on a pedestal. When I did get extremely frustrated and voice my concerns to my mother in a car ride one day, she called me crazy, yelling at me that he’s my brother and that to not pay attention to him because he’s “sick.” However, I simply cannot just ignore him anymore when it’s been happening for all my life, and him having a mental disorder doesn’t give him any more of an excuse to be an asshole. I’m pretty open in saying that if this man got into a car accident one day, then I wouldn’t feel sorry or worried at all.

The author has faced verbal and physical abuse from their brother throughout life, and the parents seem not to take any action. The author is asking if they are wrong for feeling hatred towards their brother because of how he treats them. This meets the criteria because it presents a real-life situation that involves complex ethical questions. Part 2: Identify who is wrong here.

Wayne Rooney first noted the problem of England being too soft after the World Cup in Brazil, when he admitted ‘maybe we’re too honest’ compared with more streetwise opponents like Italy and Uruguay. Roy Hodgson and his coaching team have sought to address this during the opening games of the Euro 2016 campaign and vice-captain Gary Cahill believes it is starting to make an impact. England vice-captain Gary Cahill says the Three Lions will continue to develop a nastier side to their game. Cahill says Jose Mourinho at Chelsea has a tendency to play nastier and develop a more cynical approach. ‘We’ve been too nice in the past,’ said Cahill. ‘We’ve got a very young team and it comes with experience, knowing when to slow things down, not to always play out from the back. ‘Everybody has this philosophy of playing from the back from the keeper, but there are times to think, “Hold on, let’s not play out from the back this time, let’s kick it up the front for five or 10 minutes”. ‘There are times to kill it off, or slow things down when things aren’t going well. We will learn that. It’s just managing the game really, which maybe we are doing a lot better. It’s something that has been addressed.’ Cahill receives similar messages from his club manager Jose Mourinho at Chelsea. ‘Jose has been a master of that,’ said the centre back. ‘It’s a part of play at Chelsea and that’s because there are so many experienced players in the squad. ‘People know when to do that and not. That’s something that’s coming into the make-up with England and that’s why we are progressing.’ Cahill: 'It’s a part of play at Chelsea and that’s because there are so many experienced players in the squad' Cahill has become vice-captain of England under manager Roy Hodgson ahead of the match against Slovenia. Cahill was outstanding in the 1-0 away win in Estonia on his last England appearance, shouldering responsibility and stepping out of the back four to get physical with opponents after a series of midfield fouls on Jack Wilshere and Jordan Henderson. ‘We are definitely a lot harder to play against,’ he added. ‘That’s about being physical, wanting to win the ball back, being aggressive and getting tight to the player. ‘It’s more physical than verbal — I don’t think that helps much — but when players are trying to hold the ball up, you’re behind them and they’re thinking, “What’s this guy doing?” That’s when they know they’re in a game.’ Coach and former England right back Gary Neville has been keen to get these points across to those stepping up to the international scene. Cahill added: ‘He was a fantastic player in a great back four and he likes the kind of hard, tough-to-play-against, physical, almost old-school style, whereby you let the attackers or centre forward know they are in a game and feel your presence.’ Cahill, Leighton Baines and Phil Jagielka are part of England's defensive set up and chat during training.

(CNN) -- A man stranded after his car plunged down a steep embankment in the Angeles National Forest survived for six days by eating leaves and drinking water from a creek, authorities said Friday.  David J. Lavau, 67, of Lake Hughes, California, was found in a ravine a week after losing control of his car on a rural road and plunging 500 feet down an embankment into heavy brush, according to a report by the California Highway Patrol.  Lavau, who is partially disabled, told authorities that he spent the first night in his car.  \\"The next morning, he exited his vehicle and observed another vehicle adjacent to his own with a deceased male driver behind the wheel,\\" the report said. \\"The deceased appeared to have been there for some time.\\"  Authorities say they have not identified the dead driver.  The case began to unfold on September 23, when Lavau failed to return home.

You also mentioned that you are a 25-year-old Indian IT professional, which could play a role in defining your personal style. Here's a comprehensive guide on how to dress appropriately for such an occasion: 1. Choose the right outfit: Since you'll be attending an acrylic painting class, you'll want to wear something comfortable and easy to move around in, as you'll most likely be standing or sitting in different positions throughout the session. A pair of well-fitted jeans or casual trousers in a solid color would be a good choice, as they are comfortable and provide a neat appearance. 2. Opt for practical layers: Considering that acrylic paint can be messy and can stain your clothes, you might want to wear layers to protect your clothing. You can start with a simple solid-colored t-shirt and add a light, casual button-up shirt or jacket over it. This will not only look stylish but also provide extra protection for your clothing. In case you feel warm, you can easily remove the outer layer. 3. Choose appropriate colors: Since you'll be working with acrylic paint, it's a good idea to choose darker colored clothes to minimize the visibility of any accidental paint splatters. Darker shades like navy, black, or charcoal gray will also give a sophisticated and mature appearance. 4. Footwear: A pair of comfortable sneakers or casual shoes would be ideal for the class. Make sure they provide good support and are easy to slip on and off, as you might need to take them off during the class or when moving around the studio. 5. Accessories: Keep accessories minimal, as they can get in the way while you're painting. You can opt for a stylish watch or a simple leather or beaded bracelet. It's best to avoid wearing any rings or necklaces, as they may catch on your painting materials. 6. Grooming: Make sure your hair is neatly groomed, as you don't want it falling in your face or getting caught in the paint while you're working. If you have facial hair, trim it and style it to make a good impression. 7. Confidence in your attire: Lastly, and most importantly, be confident in your chosen outfit. Confidence can add significantly to your overall appearance and will help you feel relaxed and comfortable in the class. In summary, when attending an acrylic painting class, the key is to wear comfortable and practical clothes that allow for easy movement and protect against paint spills. Opt for darker solid colors, wear layers for added protection, and choose comfortable sneakers or casual shoes. Keep accessories minimal and ensure proper grooming. Remember to be confident in your outfit, and you'll be able to make a great impression while enjoying your painting class."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Hermanfrid married Amalaberga , daughter of Amalafrida who was the daughter of Theodemir , between 507 and 511 . Amalberga was also the niece of Theodoric the Great . It is unclear when Hermanfrid became king , but he is called king ( rex thoringorum ) in a letter by Theodoric dated to 507 . He first shared the rule with his brothers Baderic and Bertachar , but later killed Bertachar in a battle in 529 , leaving the young Radegund an orphan . According to Gregory of Tours , Amalaberga now stirred up Hermanfrid against his remaining brother . Once she laid out only half the table for a meal , and when questioned about the reason , she told him \`\` A king who owns only of half of his kingdom deserved to have half of his table bare . '' Thus roused , Hermanfrid made a pact with the king of Metz , Theuderic I , to march against Baderic . Baderic was overcome by the Franks and beheaded , but Hermanfrid refused to fulfill his obligations to Theuderic , which led to enmity between the two kings . In 531 or 532 , Theuderic , his son Theudebert I , and his brother King Clotaire I of Soissons attacked the Thuringii . The Franks won a battle near the river Unstrut and took the royal seat at Scithingi ( modern Burgscheidungen ) . Hermanfrid managed to flee , but the Franks captured his niece Radegund ( see Venantius Fortunatus , De excidio Thoringae ) and his nephews . Theuderic gave Hermanfrid safe conduct , ordered him to come to Zülpich , and gave him many gifts . While Hermanfrid talked with Theuderic , somebody pushed him from the town walls of Zülpich and he died . Gregory mentions that certain people had ventured to suggest that Theuderic might have had something to do with it ....  - Baderic, Baderich, Balderich or Boderic (ca. 480  529), son of Bisinus and Basina, was a co-king of the Thuringii. He and his brothers Hermanfrid and Berthar succeeded their father Bisinus. After Hermanfrid defeated Berthar in battle, he invited King Theuderic I of Metz to help him defeat Baderic in return for half of the kingdom. Theuderic I agreed and Baderic was defeated and killed in 529. Hermanfrid became the sole king.  - Tato (died 510) was an early 6th century king of the Lombards. He was the son of Claffo and a king of the Lething Dynasty. According to Procopius, the Lombards were subject and paid tribute to the Heruli during his reign. In 508, he fought with King Rodulf of the Heruli, who was slain. This was a devastating blow to the Heruli and augmented the power of the Lombards. According to Paul the Deacon, the war started because Tato's daughter Rumetrada murdered Rodulf's brother.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - Radegund (also spelled \\"Rhadegund, Radegonde, or Radigund\\"; 520  13 August 587) was a Thuringian princess and Frankish queen, who founded the Abbey of the Holy Cross at Poitiers. She is the patron saint of several churches in France and England and of Jesus College, Cambridge (whose full name is \\"The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist \\"and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund\\", near Cambridge\\").  - The Lombards or Longobards (Italian \\"Longobardi\\" ) were a Germanic people who ruled large parts of the Italian Peninsula from 568 to 774.  - The Thuringii or Toringi, were a Germanic tribe that appeared late during the \\"Völkerwanderung\\" in the Harz Mountains of central Germania still called Thuringia.

A dosimeter measures human absorption of what over a time period????","output":"A dosimeter is an instrument used primarily to quantify and monitor cumulative exposure to ionizing radiation over a specific time period. Ionizing radiation refers to electromagnetic waves or particles that possess enough energy to ionize atoms and molecules, stripping them of their electrons. These types of radiation can cause damage to living tissues and cells, which makes it crucial to monitor radiation exposure for those working in high-risk environments such as nuclear power plants, medical facilities, and research laboratories. Dosimeters measure human absorption of various types of ionizing radiation, including: 1. X-rays: These high-energy electromagnetic waves are utilized in various applications like diagnostic imaging in medicine and detecting structural flaws in materials through non-destructive testing. 2. Gamma rays: Gamma rays are highly penetrating electromagnetic waves emitted during radioactive decay. They are widely used in medical procedures, such as gamma knife surgeries and radiation therapy. 3. Beta particles: These high-speed electrons or positrons are emitted during radioactive decay. They are utilized in applications such as cancer treatments, tracer studies in biology, and radiography of light-weight materials. 4. Alpha particles: Alpha particles consist of two protons and two neutrons emitted from the nuclei of radioactive elements. These particles are less penetrating than beta particles and gamma rays but can cause significant damage when absorbed by living tissues, particularly when radiation sources are ingested or inhaled. 5. Neutrons: Neutrons are subatomic particles that lack electric charge. They are emitted in nuclear reactions, such as fission and fusion. Neutrons pose a radiation hazard when absorbed by living tissues, making neutron dosimetry essential for workers in facilities where nuclear reactions occur, like power plants and research reactors. Dosimeters come in various forms, such as electronic, thermoluminescent, and film-badge dosimeters. They are typically worn by individuals working in environments with exposure to ionizing radiation. These devices track the absorbed dose (measured in Grays or Rad) and dose equivalent (measured in Sieverts or Rem), which takes into account the biological effect of different types of ionizing radiation. Dosimeters help ensure radiation protection and safety compliance by constantly monitoring an individual's cumulative exposure. They enable corrective actions to be taken if necessary, such as changing work conditions or adjusting protective measures, to reduce the risk of radiation-induced health problems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Tribal fighters took control of a top Yemeni city on Tuesday, a setback for an embattled government whose wounded president is hospitalized in Saudi Arabia. More than 400 tribal gunmen took over Taiz in southwest Yemen, witnesses there said. Government forces have been regrouping in an effort to re-enter the city. Yemen's government has faced international criticism for excessive use of force against anti-regime protesters and the deaths of anti-government demonstrators in Taiz. Are you in Yemen? Share your photos and videos from the scene, but please stay safe. Meanwhile, President Ali Abdullah Saleh was in Saudi Arabia Tuesday, recovering from burns over 40% of his body and a collapsed lung, a U.S. government official briefed on the matter said. One diplomat said the attack was not a suicide bombing and that the","output":"situation in Yemen is becoming increasingly complex and volatile. Yemen has been going through political turmoil and a deteriorating security situation for months, with armed conflicts between government troops, tribal militias, Houthi rebels, and even Al-Qaeda operatives in different parts of the country. The takeover of Taiz by tribal fighters marks a significant setback for Yemen's government, which has been struggling to maintain control over the country amid widespread protests demanding the resignation of President Ali Abdullah Saleh. These protests have been fueled by widespread discontent due to high unemployment, economic difficulties, and general dissatisfaction with the government's performance. Saleh's hospitalization in Saudi Arabia is further complicating the situation, as it leaves Yemen without a strong central government to counter the various threats it faces. The United States and other international partners are closely monitoring the situation, given the ongoing civil unrest and the potential for increased militant activity in the region. In this context, the international community has grown increasingly concerned with the use of excessive force by Yemen's government forces against anti-regime protesters. Reports from Taiz have documented instances of government forces firing live ammunition at unarmed protesters, leading to a significant number of casualties. Several countries, including the United States, have called on Yemen's government to refrain from such actions and to engage in dialogue with protesters to address their grievances peacefully. However, the situation on the ground remains highly fluid and uncertain. In response to the takeover of Taiz by tribal fighters, Yemen's government forces have been regrouping in an attempt to regain control over the city. This has the potential to lead to further clashes between government troops and tribal militias, raising concerns about the potential for large-scale violence and even a full-blown civil war. Moreover, with President Saleh recovering in Saudi Arabia, the future of Yemen's political leadership remains unclear. If Saleh is unable to return and resume his duties, it is uncertain who would take over the reins of the government and what steps would be taken to address the ongoing crisis. Ultimately, the situation in Yemen is inherently unstable and poses significant challenges both for its domestic leadership and for the broader international community. As such, it is imperative to monitor developments in the country closely and remain prepared for the possibility of further escalations in violence or political unrest. It's important for governments and international organizations to provide support to Yemen in finding ways to resolve its internal disputes peacefully and achieve sustainable political and economic development. Ensuring the well-being of the Yemeni people and preserving regional stability should be the main priorities of the international community's engagement with the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  and the situation: Two countries are situated on the shores of the same sea. Turkey is a nation of farmers, they use conventional agricultural methods to produce food, including lots of fertilizers. Greece's economy is mostly based on tourism.  Answer the following question: Which country causes the entry into the sea of more potentially hazardous particles?","output":"Given the background information, it can be inferred that Turkey, with its agricultural-based economy, is more likely to cause the entry of more potentially hazardous particles into the shared sea than Greece, which is largely dependent on tourism. In the case of Turkey, the nation's widespread use of conventional agricultural methods, including the application of significant amounts of fertilizers, can result in the increased entry of hazardous chemicals and particles into the shared sea. As mentioned, agriculture fertilizer chemicals, as well as livestock and human waste, can contribute to marine pollution in a variety of ways. For instance, when these substances reach water bodies, they can cause excess growth of harmful algae which leads to oxygen depletion, resulting in hypoxia and the creation of dead zones, where marine life cannot survive due to insufficient oxygen levels. Additionally, strong and persistent use of fertilizers can also result in nutrient runoff, wherein excessive amounts of nutrients get washed by rain, irrigation or erosion into nearby water bodies. This runoff can lead to problems like eutrophication, which further causes problems like algae blooms, reduced dissolved oxygen levels, fish kills, and an overall decline in water quality. On the other hand, Greece, with its economy largely focused on tourism, does contribute to marine pollution but on a comparatively lower scale. Some of the significant sources of marine pollution in tourism-heavy areas could include litter from tourists directly on beaches, and waste produced by the tourism industry, such as from hotels and restaurants. While these sources can still cause negative impacts on the marine environment, they are generally less intensive than the extensive agricultural activities practiced in Turkey. It should be noted, however, that marine pollution is a complex and multifaceted issue, with a wide range of contributing factors that can differ in each specific case. While it is useful to consider the major economic activities of both Turkey and Greece to draw some inferences, it is essential to keep in mind that other factors such as population density, waste management practices, and local laws and regulations can also play a crucial role in determining the extent of pollution caused by each country. In order to draw a more accurate and comprehensive conclusion, a thorough assessment of various factors and data points related to marine pollution in both countries would be necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Japanese held around 500 American prisoners who had survived the Bataan Death March in a notorious POW camp at Cabanatuan and subjected them to brutal treatment and summary execution, as the Japanese view surrender as a disgrace. Many prisoners were also stricken with malaria. The film opens with the massacre of prisoners of war on Palawan by the Kempeitai, the Imperial Japanese military's secret police (though factually, it was committed by the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army). Meanwhile, at Lingayen Gulf, the 6th Ranger Battalion under Lt. Col Mucci is ordered by Lt. Gen. Walter Krueger to liberate all of the POWs at Cabanatuan prison camp before they are killed by the Japanese. The film chronicles the efforts of the Rangers, Alamo Scouts from the 6th Army and Filipino guerrillas as they undertake the Raid at Cabanatuan.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise and the hypothesis are two separate statements, and the truth of one does not necessarily guarantee the truth of the other. In fact, the hypothesis contradicts the premise. Let's break this down further. Premise: Dean Bridge carries the main road over the Water; it was designed and built by Thomas Telford, one of Scotland's greatest civil engineers. The premise states that Dean Bridge was designed and built by Thomas Telford, who is considered one of Scotland's greatest civil engineers. This statement implies that Telford was renowned for his skill and expertise in civil engineering. Hypothesis: The bridge collapsed since it was built by Thomas Telford, a terrible architect. The hypothesis assumes that Thomas Telford was a terrible architect, and therefore, the bridge collapsed. This contradicts the recognition of Telford as a great civil engineer, as stated in the premise. It's essential to note the difference between an architect and a civil engineer as they have distinct roles, and attributing the bridge's design to Telford as an architect may also be misleading. To determine the validity of the hypothesis, one would need to examine the evidence surrounding the bridge's collapse (if it did indeed collapse), such as the materials used, construction technique, maintenance, and any external factors (e.g., extreme weather or environmental disasters). If the bridge did not collapse, then the hypothesis becomes irrelevant. In conclusion, it is not possible to assert that the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. The premise highlights Telford's expertise and skill in civil engineering while designing Dean Bridge, while the hypothesis frames him as a terrible architect because of a supposed bridge collapse. The truth of the premise does not directly support or confirm theclaim made in the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Context: The other directly attested Old Iranian dialects are the two forms of Avestan, which take their name from their use in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of indigenous Iranian religion that now goes by the name of Zoroastrianism but in the Avesta itself is simply known as vohu daena (later: behdin). The language of the Avesta is subdivided into two dialects, conventionally known as \\"Old (or 'Gathic') Avestan\\", and \\"Younger Avestan\\". These terms, which date to the 19th century, are slightly misleading since 'Younger Avestan' is not only much younger than 'Old Avestan', but also from a different geographic region. The Old Avestan dialect is very archaic, and at roughly the same stage of development as Rigvedic Sanskrit. On the other hand, Younger Avestan is at about the same linguistic stage as Old Persian, but by virtue of its use as a sacred language retained its \\"old\\" characteristics long after the Old Iranian languages had yielded to their Middle Iranian stage. Unlike Old Persian, which has Middle Persian as its known successor, Avestan has no clearly identifiable Middle Iranian stage (the effect of Middle Iranian is indistinguishable from effects due to other causes).","output":"Avestan was used in the Avesta, the liturgical texts of the indigenous Iranian religion that is now known as Zoroastrianism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"A shaggy dog plays in a field of grass and yellow flowers.\\", does it logically follow that \\"animals playing in a field\\"?","output":"Yes, it logically follows that there are animals playing in a field, given the statement \\"A shaggy dog plays in a field of grass and yellow flowers.\\" Here's a detailed explanation to support this conclusion: 1. Breaking down the initial statement, we understand that there is a \\"shaggy dog\\" and that it is \\"playing in a field of grass and yellow flowers.\\" From this, we can gather information about the subject and its setting. 2. Identify the subject: In this case, the subject of the statement is the \\"shaggy dog,\\" which we can clearly establish as an animal. Dogs are a type of domesticated mammal belonging to the Canidae family and are recognized as animals. 3. Analyze the action: The action being performed by the subject is \\"playing.\\" This indicates that the shaggy dog is engaged in some form of an activity or physical movement for enjoyment or recreational purposes. 4. Determine the setting: The shaggy dog is playing in a \\"field of grass and yellow flowers.\\" This provides us with information about the location and environment where the action is taking place. Fields, which are open areas of land covered in grasses or other vegetation, are natural areas where animals can roam, play, and interact with their surroundings. 5. Combine the key elements: We now have all the necessary components - an animal (the shaggy dog), performing an action (playing), and the setting where it happens (a field of grass and yellow flowers). 6. Formulate the logical conclusion: Based on the information gathered, we can confidently deduce that \\"animals playing in a field\\" is a valid conclusion. Since the shaggy dog is an animal and it is playing in a field of grass and yellow flowers, the statement \\"A shaggy dog plays in a field of grass and yellow flowers\\" naturally supports the idea that there are animals playing in a field."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: BALI, Indonesia — An American man charged with murdering his girlfriend’s mother told an Indonesian court Thursday he was angry after the victim threatened to kill his unborn baby and strangled him hard for about half a minute. Tommy Schaefer, 21, and Heather Mack, 19, are being tried separately by Denpasar District Court, where they are charged with premeditated murder for the death of Sheila von Wiese-Mack last August in Bali. They could face a firing squad if found guilty. The victim’s badly beaten body was found in a suitcase on a taxi. Testifying at the trial of Mack, Schaefer told the court their relationship was not endorsed by his girlfriend’s mother. Schaefer said he visited Bali to meet with Mack who was already in Bali. After meeting with Mack at the hotel, they discussed how to inform von Wiese-Mack that Mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where Mack and her mother were staying. Speaking through an interpreter, Schaefer said Mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl, which he hid under his shirt as a “precaution.” Asked by a judge why it was hidden, Schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself. According to Schaefer, he arrived in the room and found Mack weeping. He did not know why, but also saw that Mack’s mother was screaming. “She (von Wiese-Mack) was angry at me when she knew that Heather was pregnant,” Schaefer said, while trying to hold back tears. Mack, who was sitting beside her lawyer, sobbed at the testimony. He said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man. He said the situation got heated when von Wiese-Mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby. Schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which von Wiese-Mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds. “I was angry, I took the fruit bowl and hit her,” Schaefer said, in tears. He added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim. After acknowledging she wasn’t breathing, he tried to give her artificial respiration, while Mack, who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes, came back and tried to revive her mother. He said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the United States. According to the indictment, Schaefer battered von Wiese-Mack with the metal bowl following an argument over the hotel bill. It says Mack helped stuff her mother’s body into the suitcase by sitting on it to enable Schaefer to close it. They then placed the suitcase in the trunk of a taxi and told the driver they were going to check out of the hotel and would return, but never did, it says.

The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them.

Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore.

She agrees to have his niece, Christabel, live with her in San Francisco while attending business school. Christabel proves to be a scheming, socially ambitious woman. She flirts with Donna's fiance, the wealthy Curtis Carey, at a party for Donna's friend, painter Gabriel Broome. She also attracts the interest of aspiring author Nick Bradley. While having her portrait done by Broome, a call from Curtis brings her eagerly to a jeweler, only to discover to her disappointment that he merely seeks her advice in buying Donna an engagement gift. After he purchases an expensive one, Christabel plants a seed of doubt in Donna's mind and makes her feel guilty by insinuating that in accepting such a lavish gift, Donna is giving Curtis the appearance of being after his money. Christabel then turns around and cunningly does the same to Curtis by convincing him to propose a pre-nuptial agreement. Donna is offended and the couple break up, which turns out to have been Christabel's plan all along. With Curtis now available, Christabel rebuffs a marriage proposal from Nick, whose novel is about to be published by Caine.

Harihara is also sometimes used as a philosophical term to denote the unity of Vishnu and Shiva as different aspects of the same Ultimate Reality called Brahman . This concept of equivalence of various gods as one principle and \`\` oneness of all existence '' is discussed as Harihara in the texts of Advaita Vedanta school of Hindu philosophy . Some of the earliest sculptures of Harihara , with one half of the image as Shiva and other half as Vishnu , are found in the surviving cave temples of India , such as in the cave 1 and cave 3 of the 6th - century Badami cave temples .  - Nara-Narayana (nara-nryaa) is a Hindu deity pair.

But only Hari precedes Om in the form of Harih om or Harih om tat sat.  - Hindu texts are manuscripts and historic literature related to any of the diverse traditions within Hinduism. A few texts are shared resources across these traditions and broadly considered as Hindu scriptures. These include the Vedas and the Upanishads. Scholars hesitate in defining the term \\"Hindu scripture\\" given the diverse nature of Hinduism, many include Bhagavad Gita and Agamas as Hindu scriptures, while Dominic Goodall includes Bhagavata Purana and Yajnavalkya Smriti to the list of Hindu scriptures.  - The word Puranas (\\"\\") literally means \\"ancient, old\\", and it is a vast genre of Indian literature about a wide range of topics, particularly myths, legends and other traditional lore. Composed primarily in Sanskrit, but also in regional languages, several of these texts are named after major Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Shiva and Devi. The Puranas genre of literature is found in both Hinduism and Jainism.  - The Bhgavata Pura (Devanagari: ; also rmad Bhgavata Mah Pura, rmad Bhgavatam or Bhgavata) is one of Hinduism's eighteen great Puranas (\\"Mahapuranas\\", great histories).

The term also generally refers to \\"alight, to make one's appearance\\" and sometimes used to refer to any revered guru or human being.  - Brahma is the creator god in the Trimurti of Hinduism. He has four faces. Brahma is also known as \\"Svayambhu\\" (self-born), \\"Vga\\" (Lord of Speech), and the creator of the four Vedas, one from each of his mouths. Brahma is identified with the Vedic god Prajapati, as well as linked to Kama and Hiranyagarbha (the cosmic egg), he is more prominently mentioned in the post-Vedic Hindu epics and the mythologies in the Puranas. In the epics, he is conflated with Purusha. Brahma, along with Vishnu and Shiva, is part of a Hindu Trinity; however, ancient Hindu texts mention other trinities of gods or goddesses which do not include Brahma.  - The Bhagavad Gita (\\"\\" in IAST, ; lit. \\"Song of the Lord\\"), often referred to as  simply the Gita, is a 700-verse Hindu scripture in Sanskrit that is part of the Hindu epic \\"Mahabharata\\" (chapters 25 - 42 of the 6th book of Mahabharata).  - The \\"Trimrti\\" (Sanskrit:  \\"\\", \\"three forms\\") is the trinity of supreme divinity in Hinduism in which the cosmic functions of creation, maintenance, and destruction are personified as a triad of deities, typically Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer/transformer, though individual denominations may vary from that particular line-up. When all three deities of the Trimurti incarnate into a single avatar, the avatar is known as Dattatreya.  - Narayana (Sanskrit: \\"Nryaa\\") or Narayanan is a Vedic deity associated with the waters of creation and sometimes with the sun. He is one of several Vedic figures associated with Vishnu and Vishnu sometimes assumes the name Narayana in certain scriptures. According to Madhvacharya Narayana is one of the five vyuhas of Ka, which are cosmic emanations of god in contrast to his incarnate avatars. He is frequently mentioned as part of the pair of Nara-Narayana. According to the Bhagavata Purana he is the supreme god (including his different avatars) in Hinduism, venerated as the Supreme Being in Vaishnavism. He is also known as Vishnu and Hari, is venerated as Purushottama or Supreme Purusha in Hindu sacred texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, the Vedas and the Puranas.  - Vishnu (IAST: \\"\\") is one of the principal deities of Hinduism, and the Supreme Being in its Vaishnavism tradition. Along with Brahma and Shiva, Vishnu forms a Hindu trinity (Trimurti); however, ancient Hindu texts do mention other trinities of gods or goddesses.  - Supreme Being is a term for God used by theologians and philosophers of many religious faiths, including Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Judaism, and deism.  - Hinduism is a religion, or a way of life, found most notably in India and Nepal. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world, and some practitioners and scholars refer to it as \\"\\", \\"the eternal law,\\" or the \\"eternal way,\\" beyond human origins. Scholars regard Hinduism as a fusion or synthesis of various Indian cultures and traditions, with diverse roots and no founder. This \\"Hindu synthesis\\" started to develop between 500 BCE and 300 CE following the Vedic period (1500 BCE to 500 BCE).  - Hindu refers to any person who regards themselves as culturally, ethnically, or religiously adhering to aspects of Hinduism. It has historically been used as a geographical, cultural, rather than a religious identifier for people indigenous to South Asia.  - Shaivism or aivism (\\"aiva Patha\\",  \\"Shiva's Path\\"), also known as Shivaism and Saivam, is one of the major branches of Sanathan Dharma (Hinduism), revering Shiva as the Supreme Being. Shiva is sometimes depicted as the fierce god Bhairava. Followers of Shaivam are called \\"Shaivas\\", \\"Saivas\\", \\"Shaivites\\", or \\"Saivarkal\\". They believe that Shiva is All and in all, the creator, preserver, destroyer, revealer and concealer of all that is. Shaivism, like some of the other forms of Hinduism, spread to other parts of Southeast Asia, including Java, Bali, and parts of the Southeast Asian continent, including Cambodia.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How can you explain the difference between the imperial and metric systems of measurement? What is the difference between metric system and imperial system? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"Yes, these questions essentially have the same meaning; they are both asking for an explanation of the differences between the imperial and metric systems of measurement.  The imperial and metric systems are two distinct systems of measurement, which are used for various purposes, including length, weight, and capacity. Imperial System: The imperial system of measurement, also known as the British Imperial System, is an older system that originated in the United Kingdom and was used throughout the British Empire. It is still commonly used in the United States, the United Kingdom, and a few other countries today, although slowly being replaced by the metric system. The primary units of measurement in the imperial system are: Length: - Inch (in) - Foot (ft) - Yard (yd) - Mile (mi) Weight: - Ounce (oz) - Pound (lb) - Stone (st) - Hundredweight (cwt) - Ton (t) Capacity: - Fluid ounce (fl oz) - Pint (pt) - Quart (qt) - Gallon (gal) The imperial system is largely based on a series of seemingly arbitrary numbers and ratios incorporated into the various units - for example, 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, and 5280 feet in a mile. Metric System: On the other hand, the metric system, also known as the International System of Units (SI), is a more modern and universally recognized system of measurement that is based on multiples of ten. Originating in France during the 18th century, it has since been adopted as the official system of measurement by almost all countries across the globe. The primary units of measurement in the metric system include: Length: - Millimeter (mm) - Centimeter (cm) - Meter (m) - Kilometer (km) Weight: - Milligram (mg) - Gram (g) - Kilogram (kg) - Tonne (t) Capacity: - Milliliter (mL) - Liter (L) One key feature of the metric system is its logical structure and consistent use of prefixes that represent powers of ten, making it easier to understand and utilize by a wider array of people. For instance, 1 kilometer equals 1000 meters, 1 meter equals 100 centimeters, and 1 centimeter equals 10 millimeters.  Differences between Imperial and Metric Systems: 1. Origin and Adoption: The imperial system originated in the United Kingdom, while the metric system originated in France. Although the metric system is now the global standard for measurement, the imperial system is still used in a handful of countries including the United States. 2. Units and Ratios: The imperial system uses a variety of unique units for each type of measurement, with relationships between units often difficult to remember. The metric system has a simpler structure based on a decimal system, with a consistent use of prefixes to denote multiples of ten. 3. Conversion: Converting between units in the imperial system may be complicated due to the irregular ratios, while conversion between units in the metric system is often straightforward, simply requiring the adjustment of decimal points.  4. International Recognition: The metric system is universally recognized and used by almost all countries, making it easier for international communication, trade, and scientific research. The imperial system is less recognized and can cause confusion when used by individuals not familiar with its units and conversions. In summary, both questions are seeking to understand the differences between the imperial and metric systems of measurement. The imperial system is an older method of measurement originating in the United Kingdom with a variety of unique units for measurement, while the metric system is a more modern, logically structured, decimal-based system that has been adopted as the global standard for measurement, making it easier to understand and utilize by a wider array of people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Based on the given hints from your teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What are used for seeing by animals by sensing light?\\" is (e). pupils. Pupils are the dark circular opening in the center of the iris, which is the colored part of the eye. They function to control the amount of light that enters the eye. When the light is bright, the pupils constrict (get smaller) to reduce the amount of light entering the eye. Conversely, in dim light conditions, the pupils dilate (get larger) to allow more light to enter the eye. Animals, including humans, rely on their pupils and overall eye structure to sense light and enable the process of vision. Light enters the eye through the pupil, passes through the lens, and reaches the retina at the back of the eye. The retina contains a large number of photoreceptor cells, which are responsible for converting the light into electrical signals. These signals travel along the optic nerve to the brain, which interprets them as visual images. In summary, the most suitable answer among the given options is (e) pupils, as they play a crucial role in allowing animals to see by adjusting the amount of light entering the eyes and facilitating the vision process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

See options at the end Coyotes ate the dog of Joel when Donald left the door open, so  Pick your answer from: a. Joel is very angry. b. Donald is very angry.","output":"As the given information entails, coyotes ate the dog of Joel when Donald left the door open. From this instance, we can infer that the incident occurred due to Donald's negligence. Analyzing the two options provided, we can determine the most appropriate conclusion. a. Joel is very angry: This is a plausible outcome as Joel's dog was the one that was affected directly due to the incident. The fact that Donald left the door open was the primary cause that led to the unfortunate occurrence. In this case, Joel might be very angry because he lost his dog and possibly holds Donald responsible for the dog's fate. b. Donald is very angry: While it is possible that Donald is upset about the situation, it is less likely for him to be very angry since the dog was not his. He may feel guilty or remorseful for his actions that indirectly led to the dog being eaten by the coyotes. Donald could be angry with himself for not being more careful, but in comparison to Joel, his anger might not be as intense. In conclusion, the most probable answer in this context is 'a. Joel is very angry,' as it accounts for the greater emotional loss and the direct consequence of losing his dog due to someone else's carelessness."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Making sure they are serious about the dare could help you avoid embarrassment. Replying with a brief laugh and simply saying, “Are you serious?” is enough to double check. If they say no then you can always tell them you want to take the dare anyway. Ask yourself if you are comfortable kissing someone or not. Remember that it’s okay to say no to a dare. If you feel uncomfortable kissing the person, then don’t do it. It’s better to say no than to do something you don’t want to do. Since kissing involves two people, you need to make sure it’s okay with the person you were dared to kiss. They may not feel comfortable with it, even if you want to do it.

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"No, you should not validate this answer since it does not directly address the question about the creation of Scooby-Doo. Instead, I suggest providing a more relevant and accurate response: Scooby-Doo was created by the American animation company Hanna-Barbera Productions, which was founded by William Hanna and Joseph Barbera. The original television series, titled \\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!,\\" first premiered on September 13, 1969, in the United States. The show followed the adventures of Scooby-Doo, a lovable Great Dane, and his four human friends – Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy – as they solved mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a combination of comedic antics and teamwork. The creators of Scooby-Doo, Joe Ruby and Ken Spears, aimed to produce an entertaining children's show that combined elements of mystery and humor. They focused on creating a family-friendly show, as a response to parental concerns about violence in other cartoons at the time. The characters in Scooby-Doo were initially designed by Iwao Takamoto, and the concept for the show came from Fred Silverman, a CBS executive. Over the years, the Scooby-Doo franchise has expanded to include numerous television series, direct-to-video films, comic books, and even live-action movies. The enduring popularity of Scooby-Doo and its characters can be attributed to the show's lighthearted humor, engaging mysteries, and memorable catchphrases."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"In compliance with section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, EPA prepared a written statement, including a cost benefit analysis, assessing the impact of the rule, which it published with both the proposed and the final rule.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act includes a cost benefit analysis.\\"?","output":"If the premise, \\"In compliance with section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act, EPA prepared a written statement, including a cost benefit analysis, assessing the impact of the rule, which it published with both the proposed and the final rule,\\" is true, this provides evidence to support the hypothesis that \\"Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act includes a cost benefit analysis.\\" To understand whether the hypothesis can be considered true or not, we must analyze the information given and evaluate the role of Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA). The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) is a legislative act in the United States aimed at reducing the number of unfunded federal mandates imposed by the federal government on state, local, and tribal governments. Unfunded mandates are situations where federal laws and regulations impose requirements on these governments without providing adequate financial assistance to comply with them. The purpose of the UMRA is to improve the accountability of the federal government in enacting legislation and regulations that may impose significant costs on other levels of government. Section 202 of the UMRA specifically addresses the requirements that each agency must follow when proposing any rule or regulation that includes a federal mandate. This section requires agencies to conduct a detailed analysis of the impact of such mandates, evaluate their effectiveness, and consider alternative approaches for achieving their objectives. According to the given premise, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) prepared a written statement, including a cost benefit analysis, in compliance with Section 202 of the UMRA. This implies that the EPA adhered to the requirements of this particular section when proposing and finalizing a particular rule or regulation. The statement was prepared to assess the impact of the rule, and it was published along with both the proposed and final version of the rule. Thus, the premise indicates that the EPA followed the requirements set forth in Section 202 of the UMRA, which specifically included conducting a cost benefit analysis. This suggests that the hypothesis \\"Section 202 of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act includes a cost benefit analysis\\" is likely true. By providing a cost benefit analysis, as Section 202 mandates, agencies can show the potential benefits and drawbacks of a specific regulation, allowing policymakers to make more informed decisions regarding the ruling and its potential impact not only on state, local, and tribal governments but also on the public and private sectors. This ultimately contributes to a more transparent and responsible rulemaking process."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

This natural curiosity drives them to interact with different objects, as they work towards understanding their purpose and function. One such object that piques their interest is the remote control, a ubiquitous and indispensable device in many households. After experimenting with the remote and observing its effects on various electronic devices, the child eventually discovers that the primary purpose of the remote control is to interact with and operate electronic devices, in particular, the television set. With this newfound understanding, the child can use the remote control to manipulate the TV, exploring different channels and settings, and accessing a vast array of entertainment and educational content. While playing music, designing software, examining things, and seeing exhibits are all valuable and engaging activities, the best answer when it comes to the essential function of the remote control is using it to operate the television. Television plays a significant role in modern society, acting as a primary source of information, entertainment, and even education for people worldwide. Using the remote control, the child can navigate through various television channels, showcasing genres such as news, sports, movies, documentaries, kids' programming, and more. Watching television also exposes the child to different cultures, languages, and perspectives, potentially shaping their cognitive development and enhancing their understanding of the world around them. Nevertheless, it's worth mentioning that other remote control types could be associated with other devices or activities. For example, remote controls for music systems let the user play, pause, or control the volume of the music. However, in the context of the most common use, the best answer remains using the remote control to operate the television.

The equation can be rewritten as: -16*k = 69 - 117 4. Now, we want to simplify the equation by performing the subtraction: -16*k = -48 Since -16 times k equals -48, we want to find a number that when multiplied by -16, gives -48.  5. To find the value of 'k,' we need to divide -48 by -16: k = -48/-16 6. After dividing, we get: k = 3 So the answer is k = 3.

Plot title: Splice Movie plot: Genetic engineers Clive Nicoli and Elsa Kast hope to achieve fame by splicing animal DNA to create hybrids for medical use at the company N.E.R.D. (short for Nucleic Exchange Research and Development). Their work previously yielded Fred, a dog-sized vermiform creature intended as a mate for their female specimen, Ginger. After successfully mating them, Clive and Elsa plan to create a human-animal hybrid that could revolutionize science. Their employers Joan Chorot of N.E.R.D. and William Barlow forbid them to do this. Instead, they are to find and extract proteins used for commercial drug production from Fred and Ginger. Clive and Elsa pursue their own agenda in secret. They develop a viable prepubescent female creature. Although they had planned to terminate the hybrid before it reached full term, Elsa persuades Clive to let it live. The hybrid subsequently becomes aggressive and stings Elsa several times. The hybrid sheds body parts in an effort to escape when they try to destroy her, but they subdue her. They discover that she is aging at a vastly accelerated rate. Elsa discovers that the creature is undergoing mental development such as that of a young human child. Elsa names the creature \\"Dren\\" after the creature spells out NERD, having seen the letters on Elsa's shirt. Elsa subsequently refuses to let Clive refer to her as a \\"specimen\\". After moving Dren to a new location for fear of discovery, they find she has a dangerously high fever. In an attempt to save her they place her in a large industrial sink full of cold water. Clive places a hand around Dren's neck and pushes her under the water, seemingly drowning her. However, it is found that Dren is amphibious, though it is unclear whether Clive knew this, having analysed scans of Dren, or whether he did intend to kill her. While studying Dren, Elsa and Clive neglect their work with Fred and Ginger. At a highly publicized presentation of their work, Fred and Ginger savagely fight to the death.

Q: U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security, retired Marine General John Kelly, is one of the U.S. military's longest-serving commanders and the most senior officer since 9/11 to lose a child in combat. Blunt-spoken and popular with military personnel, Kelly, 66, was born and raised in Boston. He initially enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps in 1970, and was discharged from active duty as a sergeant in 1972. He returned to the Marine Corps after graduation from the University of Massachusetts Boston in 1976. Kelly rose through the ranks to serve as the commanding general of the Multi-National Force West in Iraq from February 2008 to February 2009, and as the commander of Marine Forces Reserve and Marine Forces North in October 2009. He succeeded General Douglas Fraser as commander of U.S. Southern Command (USSOUTHCOM) on Nov. 19, 2012. As the head of USSOUTHCOM, Kelly was in charge of the military jail at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and also was exposed to immigration, drug trafficking and other cross-border problems over a sprawling area that encompasses 32 countries in the Caribbean, Central America and South America. Kelly took a tough tone on border security, warning Congress last year about the risks of smuggling rings in Mexico and Central America that spirited \\"tens of thousands of people,\\" including unaccompanied children, \\"to our nation's doorstep.\\" He also clashed with the Obama administration over plans to close Guantanamo and the Pentagon's order that opened all jobs in combat units to women, including the most elite forces like the Navy SEALs. In 2010, Kelly became the highest ranking U.S. military officer to lose a child in combat operations in Southwest Asia. His youngest son, 1st Lieutenant Robert Michael Kelly, was killed in action in Afghanistan on Nov. 9, 2010. The younger Kelly was a Marine and was on his third combat tour, but on his first combat tour as a Marine Corps infantry officer. Since his son's death, Kelly has talked in stark terms about the...

Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries: the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.  Ben and Mike both studied earthquakes, while Mike was more interested specifically in mantle melting and related phenomena.

This article: When an ally of the Ü-Tsang ruler threatened destruction of the Gelugpas again, the fifth Dalai Lama Lozang Gyatso pleaded for help from the Mongol prince Güshi Khan (1582–1655), leader of the Khoshut (Qoshot) tribe of the Oirat Mongols, who was then on a pilgrimage to Lhasa. Güshi Khan accepted his role as protector, and from 1637–1640 he not only defeated the Gelugpas' enemies in the Amdo and Kham regions, but also resettled his entire tribe into Amdo. Sonam Chöpel urged Güshi Khan to assault the Ü-Tsang king's homebase of Shigatse, which Güshi Khan agreed upon, enlisting the aid of Gelug monks and supporters. In 1642, after a year's siege of Shigatse, the Ü-Tsang forces surrendered. Güshi Khan then captured and summarily executed Karma Tenkyong, the ruler of Ü-Tsang, King of Tibet.Soon after the victory in Ü-Tsang, Güshi Khan organized a welcoming ceremony for Lozang Gyatso once he arrived a day's ride from Shigatse, presenting his conquest of Tibet as a gift to the Dalai Lama. In a second ceremony held within the main hall of the Shigatse fortress, Güshi Khan enthroned the Dalai Lama as the ruler of Tibet, but conferred the actual governing authority to the regent Sonam Chöpel. Although Güshi Khan had granted the Dalai Lama \\"supreme authority\\" as Goldstein writes, the title of 'King of Tibet' was conferred upon Güshi Khan, spending his summers in pastures north of Lhasa and occupying Lhasa each winter. Van Praag writes that at this point Güshi Khan maintained control over the armed forces, but accepted his inferior status towards the Dalai Lama. Rawski writes that the Dalai Lama shared power with his regent and Güshi Khan during his early secular and religious reign. However, Rawski states that he eventually \\"expanded his own authority by presenting himself as Avalokiteśvara through the performance of rituals,\\" by building the Potala Palace and other structures on traditional religious sites, and by emphasizing lineage reincarnation through written biographies.

Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club., what would be the answer ?

Given the question: Question: What is Jack obsessed with? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Nightmare Before Christmas Context: Halloween Town is a fantasy world filled with citizens such as deformed monsters, ghosts, ghouls, goblins, zombies, mummies, vampires, werewolves and witches. Jack Skellington, a skeleton with the title of \\"Pumpkin King\\", leads them in organizing the annual Halloween holiday. However, Jack reveals he has grown weary of the same routine year after year, and wants something more. Wandering dejectedly in the woods, he stumbles across seven trees containing doors leading to towns representing various holidays, and accidentally opens a portal to Christmas Town. Impressed by the bright and cheery feeling and style of Christmas, Jack presents his findings and his understanding of Christmas, to the Halloween Town residents. However, they fail to grasp his meaning and compare everything to their ideas of Halloween. Jack is dismayed that no one understands the feeling of Christmas, and obsessively studies the holiday but fails to find any further explanation of it. He ultimately decides that it's unfair for Christmas Town alone to enjoy the feeling and announces that he and the citizens of Halloween Town will take over Christmas this year. Jack's obsession with Christmas leads him to usurp the role of \\"Sandy Claus\\". Every resident is assigned a task, while Sally, a beautiful rag doll woman, falls in love with Jack. However, after a vision of a burning Christmas tree, she alone realizes that his plans to run Christmas will become disastrous, but has no luck convincing him. Jack assigns Lock, Shock and Barrel, a trio of mischievous trick-or-treating children, to abduct Santa and bring him back to Halloween Town. Against Jack's wishes and largely for their amusement, the trio delivers Santa to Oogie Boogie, a gambling-addict bogeyman, who plots to play a game with Santa's life at stake. Christmas Eve arrives and after Sally's attempts to stop Jack fails, Jack departs in a coffin-like sleigh pulled by skeletal reindeer, guided by Zero. Jack begins to deliver presents to children around the world, but the Halloween-styled... The answer is:","output":"Jack is obsessed with Christmas.

To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week.  The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey.  The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles.  Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book.  Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

Hillary Rodham Clinton denied new accusations yesterday that she had violated White House ethics laws by not reporting a large number of personal gifts she received as First Lady. All the gifts were either paid for, given to the National Archives or returned, Clinton insisted. \\"If you don't keep something, you don't disclose it,\\" she said, standing outside the Bridge Street AME Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, where she had just spoken. \\"And if it's below a certain value, you don't disclose it.\\" The latest Clinton gifts furor came after presidential aide Dick Morris claimed the former First Lady violated White House ethics rules by failing to disclose \\"many expensive and personal\\" gifts that ranged from designer handbags to a gold lace Moroccan dress. \\"I can only say that all the gifts were appropriately dealt with,\\" Clinton said, \\"and we followed the same procedures that all Presidents have followed.\\" Morris' comments appeared in a column in the New York Post. Clinton aide Peter Kauffmann later gave these specific explanations for some of the disputed gifts cited by Morris: Â Designer bags from Judith Leiber worth 10,000, including one with a beaded image of Socks, the First Cat. Kauffmann said the Socks bag was given before the Clintons took office, that another bag was disclosed on a 1994 form and the remainder were given to the archives. Â Five dresses given to her by the King of Morocco. Four were returned to the Moroccans and a fifth sent to the archives, Kauffmann said. Â An eagle pin given to her by Phyllis George Brown, the former Miss America and ex-wife of a Kentucky governor. The pin was less than the 250 value for reportable items, according to Kauffmann. Â A gold bracelet presented to her daughter, Chelsea, during a trip to India. The bracelet, Kauffmann said, was returned. The flap is the latest to follow the Clintons since they left the White House. Last week, the former First Family said they'd pay for 86,000 of the 190,000 in gifts they've been criticized for taking. They also said they would return an additional 19 disputed gifts. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article is about people saying that Hillary Clinton, when she was the First Lady, did not tell everyone about some expensive gifts she got. But she says that she followed all the rules and either returned the gifts, put them in a special place called the National Archives, or paid for them. Some examples of the gifts are designer bags, pretty dresses from the King of Morocco, and an eagle pin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Read the sentence to understand the context. 2. Identify the subject (Brett) and reason (needed information on a hotel). 3. Evaluate the available choices:    a. \\"Brett had never been there.\\" - This choice implies that Brett is seeking information from Nelson because Brett doesn't have the required knowledge about the hotel.    b. \\"Nelson had never been there.\\" - This choice would imply that Nelson might not actually be able to provide the needed information, since he has never been to the hotel. 4.
