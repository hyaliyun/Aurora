Chicagoan Chester \\"Chet\\" Ripley, his wife, Connie, and their two sons, Buckley \\"Buck\\" and Ben, are on vacation at a lake resort in Pechoggin, Wisconsin during the summer. All is going as planned until Connie's sister, Kate, her investment broker husband, Roman Craig, and their twin daughters, Mara and Cara, crash the vacation. Ghost stories at the family BBQ include one of a man-eating grizzly bear that Chet met face-to-face when he was younger. Chet says that while he and Connie were honeymooning at the same lake, he was attacked by a giant grizzly bear. When he fired at it with a shotgun, the buckshot shaved the hair off the top of the bear's head and from that day on, it was known as the \\"Bald-Headed Bear\\" of Claire County. After Roman pulls Chet around the lake on an impromptu water ski ride with his rented speedboat, tensions between the families erupt. Chet is ready to pack up and go home, even as his teenage son Buck tries to romance a local girl, Cammie. The budding romance goes well until Chet is challenged to eat the Old 96'er (a 96-ounce steak) at a family dinner which causes Buck to break their date. Buck tries to apologize to Cammie for being late, but Cammie refuses to speak to him. Connie and Kate bond at a local bar when the conversation drifts to Kate's challenges of being wealthy.

[-] no [-] yes","output":"First question: How can one overcome ophthalmophobia? To answer this question, we need to explore the various steps to overcome ophthalmophobia, which is a fear of being stared at or a fear of eyes. Here are some steps: 1. Education: Learning about the phobia, its causes, and the reasons behind the fear can help in understanding and managing the phobia better. Knowledge is power, and the more informed one is about their phobia, the easier it is to work through it. 2. Therapy: Seeking professional help, such as from a psychologist or a psychiatrist, can provide support and guidance on how to overcome the phobia. Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) and Exposure Therapy are common therapeutic approaches to overcome phobias. 3. Relaxation techniques: Practicing relaxation techniques such as deep breathing, meditation, and progressive muscle relaxation can help reduce anxiety and stress associated with ophthalmophobia. 4. Support groups: Joining a support group for people with phobias can provide a safe and encouraging environment to share experiences and learn from others who are going through similar challenges. 5. Gradual exposure: Gradually exposing oneself to the trigger, in this case, eyes or being stared at, can help desensitize the person to the fear, making it more manageable over time. This should be done under the guidance of a professional. Second question: How do I overcome it? This reiterates the question of how one can overcome ophthalmophobia but with a personalized aspect. The steps mentioned above would still apply. However, the person asking this question might be seeking a more personalized approach to tackle their specific case of ophthalmophobia. In such a case, it would be important to consult a mental health professional who can tailor the treatment according to individual needs. Are these two questions asking the same thing?

Ackermann and British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system using mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, increasing heating capacity to the extent that water could now be used instead of ether. a good answer to this question?","output":"The year when Frank Shuman patented his solar engine is 1912. The answer you provided is accurate in terms of describing the development, collaborators, and advancements made on the solar engine, but it does not directly answer the question asked. Frank Shuman, an American inventor, patented his solar engine on March 2, 1912. This invention was an early attempt to harness the power of the sun for practical applications. Shuman, along with the technical assistance of A.S.E. Ackermann, a German science educator, and the support of British physicist Sir Charles Vernon Boys, developed an improved system that aimed to increase the efficiency of solar energy collection. Their innovative approach involved the use of mirrors to reflect solar energy upon collector boxes, which in turn would increase the heating capacity of the system. This enhancement enabled the use of water as a working fluid to capture and store solar energy, as opposed to the more volatile and less effective ether that was previously used. By utilizing water, the efficiency and storage capacity of solar power increased and opened the door to many potential applications. The development of Shuman's solar engine, though not commercially successful at the time, can be seen as a critical development in the history of solar energy technology. It was a pioneering effort in finding innovative ways to harness solar power, with the potential to provide clean and sustainable energy for various uses. This laid the groundwork for more advanced research and development of solar energy systems, which now play an increasingly important role in the global push for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources as we face growing environmental concerns and demands for increased energy production."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Sometimes the best advice doesn't come from a book, a microphone, from behind a desk in Washington or even from the people who are the leaders in their fields. Sometimes the best life lessons are found deep in the roots of where we came from. My father passed away years ago, but I always remember the lessons he taught me. Three of them particularly shape my perspective day after day.  The first one is that little things make big things happen. To the best of my memory, when I was young, we needed to build a new shed. Those were the days when stores like Home Depot and Lowes didn't exist. Brand-new timber   was expensive, so folks often reused the materials that others in the community didn't need. That summer, Dad and I used the boards from an old abandoned barn. We pulled them down one by one, drew the nails out and took off the tin and straightened it in order to reuse it. We got our supplies back to our yard and got to work. I don't know how much of a help I really was, but I chose to stay beside Dad the entire period, working along with him. The sun was hot that day, and sweat formed and ran down our faces. I stood there and handed him the nails one by one, which were hammered into that shed. Dad made me feel proud of my work. Even though I just handed him the nails, he repeatedly emphasized how we built the new shed \\"together\\". He taught me that when you're willing to do hard work, even in little things, big things come together. The second one is that we should honor our promises. As a young man, my father always carried a pocket-sized Bible in his chest pocket. Shortly before the invasion of Normandy in 1944, he prayed for God's protection and promised God that if he made it home, he would make sure his family attended church every Sunday. Well, he made it home and he kept that promise. I cannot remember a Sunday when Dad did not take my mother, my siblings and me to church -- even when we were away on vacation. I now have my Dad's pocket Bible. It is one of my most treasured possessions, and it serves... Question: While building the new shed with his father, the author_.

Elvis arrives at the church of Pastor David Sandow (William Hurt). He watches his sermon from the back of the church and then follows him and his family, including his wife Twyla (Laura Harring), son Paul (Paul Dano) and daughter Malerie (Pell James), to their home. Pastor Sandow confronts Elvis, who shows him a snapshot of his mother Yolanda, with whom he had relations many years ago before becoming a Christian. Pastor Sandow becomes agitated and tells Elvis that he has a family now and is a popular member of the community. He tells Elvis to call him so they can talk, though later tells his family that the young man simply wanted to become a member of the church and to not associate with him. Elvis moves in to a local motel and gets a job as a pizza delivery man. Having met Pastor Sandow's teenage daughter Malerie earlier at the church, he soon begins to pick her up from school where they go on drives and take walks at a local park. They start a passionate affair and have sexual relations on a regular basis. Meanwhile, Pastor Sandow's son Paul leads a high school movement where he attempts to change the school's science curriculum from evolution to intelligent design, though his plans are rejected by the school board. Disappointed by this setback, Paul, who leads a Christian rock band at his father's church, performs an intimate song before the congregation about his frustrations, the song being a cover of Sparklehorse's \\"Sad and Beautiful World\\". Pastor Sandow severely chastises his son for such indulgence. One evening, Elvis sneaks into the Sandow's home to spend the night with Malerie.

Choose the correct answer from the given options. Solution: 1. Area of the grass field = length * width = 65 m * 55 m = 3575 sq m. 2. The width of the path is 2.5 m. So, the entire area including the path has an extra 2.5 m on each side (top, bottom, left, and right). The new dimensions are (65 m + 2.5 m * 2) * (55 m + 2.5 m * 2) = 70 m * 60 m. 3. Area of the entire rectangle including the path = 70 m * 60 m = 4200 sq m. 4. Area of the path = Area of the entire rectangle - Area of the grass field = 4200 sq m - 3575 sq m = 625 sq m. 5.

Benjamin is taking care of his friend Randy's moss roses, because","output":"Randy had to leave town for a few weeks on a business trip. Benjamin, being a good friend and quite the gardening enthusiast, happily agreed to help. Randy had given him explicit instructions to ensure the plants thrive in his absence. Step 1: Analyzing the situation Before diving in, Benjamin took note of the location, sunlight exposure, and overall condition of the moss roses currently in Randy's garden. The plants seemed healthy and well-established, indicating that Randy had been taking good care of them up to this point. Step 2: Researching care requirements Benjamin took some time to research the specific needs of moss roses, which included the preferred amount of sunlight, water, and appropriate soil conditions. He learned that moss roses thrive best in full sunlight and well-draining soil, and they require regular watering, but not too much as to avoid root rot. Step 3: Checking the soil Benjamin checked the soil where Randy's moss roses were planted to ensure it was well-draining and contained the right nutrients for the plants. He also verified that the plants were spaced adequately to promote healthy growth. Step 4: Monitoring sunlight exposure Since moss roses require full sunlight, Benjamin made sure the spot they were planted in received a minimum of six hours of direct sunlight per day. He also observed the movement of the sun across the garden to guarantee no large obstacles were obstructing the light and that there was no need to transfer the plants to another location. Step 5: Watering routine Benjamin established a watering routine based on Randy's recommendations and his own research. This entailed providing the plants with approximately one inch of water per week, either through rainfall or manual watering. To prevent overwatering, he monitored the soil moisture regularly to ensure it didn't become waterlogged. Step 6: Pruning and deadheading Benjamin made sure to prune any dead or unhealthy branches from the moss roses, as well as remove any spent blooms. This would encourage new growth and keep the plants looking neat and well-maintained. Step 7: Pest and disease control Benjamin kept an eye out for any signs of pests or diseases in the moss roses and treated them promptly using organic and environmentally friendly solutions. This would ensure that the plants remained healthy and flourishing during Randy's absence. Step 8: Fertilizing Randy had instructed Benjamin on the fertilizing schedule he had been following for the moss roses. Benjamin continued using the recommended fertilizer, making sure to apply it carefully and sparingly, to avoid burning the plants or causing excessive growth. Step 9: Regular check-ins Throughout the weeks, Benjamin stayed vigilant in examining the overall health and progress of Randy's moss roses. He adjusted his care routine as needed, making sure the plants always had the best chance at thriving. Upon Randy's return, he was greeted with a beautifully blooming garden of moss roses. He was grateful to Benjamin for the exceptional care provided and delighted to see his cherished plants flourishing under his friend's diligent supervision. The two friends then savored their shared appreciation for the beauty of nature, strengthening their bond over their common love for gardening."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

Options:  A. new york  B. washington state  C. valley  D. rainforest  E. park A:","output":"D. Rainforest An apple tree is not likely to be found in a rainforest, as these environments are not suitable for the tree to grow properly. Apple trees, which belong to the genus Malus, thrive in cooler climates with adequate sunlight, well-draining soil, and proper moisture levels. Rainforest environments, on the other hand, are characterized by high levels of humidity, precipitation, and dense vegetation. The climate in rainforests is usually warm and moist, with reduced sunlight reaching the ground level due to the dense canopy layer. In contrast, other options, such as New York (A), Washington State (B), a valley (C), or a park (E), are more suitable for apple tree growth given that climate and soil conditions are more favorable in these areas. New York and Washington State, both located in the United States, have regions known for apple production. These climates are more temperate and provide the ideal conditions necessary for the growth of apple trees. In particular, Washington State is widely regarded as a prime location for apple farming due to its combination of sunny days, cool nights, and the right amount of moisture from the Cascade Mountains. This environment allows for the cultivation of high-quality and flavorful fruits. Valleys (C) can also provide suitable environments for growing apple trees, depending on the specific location. Some valleys offer moderate climates and rich soil conditions that support a variety of fruit trees, including apple trees. Generally, valleys with moderate temperature fluctuations, good sunlight exposure, and well-draining soil can provide ideal conditions for apple trees to flourish. Lastly, parks (E) may also contain apple trees. Depending on the park's location, climate, and landscape design, apple trees can be planted and maintained in parks for recreational and aesthetic purposes. In conclusion, the rainforest (D) is the least likely location to find an apple tree due to the unfavorable climate and environmental factors associated with such ecosystems, while the other options offer more suitable conditions for apple tree cultivation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - energy  - frequency  - amplitude  - voltage  A: Answer:","output":"A: Within a circuit in an analog signal, what is continuously changing is the voltage. An analog signal is a continuous signal that fluctuates over time, representing varying levels of information. Unlike digital signals, which represent information using discrete binary values (0 or 1), analog signals can have infinite variations in their levels. In the context of an electrical circuit, the analog signal can be represented by the continuous variation of voltage or current across various components of the system. The voltage in an analog circuit changes perpetually, representing the different values and characteristics of the input information. This characteristic is vital because it means that analog signals can provide a more accurate representation of the input information compared to digital signals, especially in scenarios where precise and continuous variations are essential, such as audio or video signals. Although energy, frequency, and amplitude are all related to analog signals, they are not the primary aspects continuously changing within a circuit. Energy, in the context of analog signals, typically refers to the power supplied to the circuit or the energy consumed by the components of the circuit. Frequency refers to the rate at which the signal changes or oscillates, and amplitude represents the signal's maximum value or strength. While frequency and amplitude might change as the signal processes or filters, they are not constantly varying elements in the circuit. In summary, voltage is the essential element that changes continuously within a circuit in an analog signal. This continuous variation allows analog signals to provide more accurate and precise representations of the input information over time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Location      The PTK site was discovered in 2012 by The Olduvai Paleoanthropology and Paleoecology Project (TOPPP) at the junction of the main and secondary branches of Olduvai Gorge (Tanzania; Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The site is situated ~500 m south of the well-known FLK 22 Zinjanthropus (FLK 22 Zinj) site and, to date, it is known to comprise three distinct archaeological levels (Supplementary Fig. 2). Two of these levels, corresponding to what has been defined as ‘upper Zinj’ and ‘lower Zinj’21, occur in the same clay stratum as the FLK 22 Zinj level, underlying volcanic Tuff IC, dated by 40Ar/39Ar to 1.832 + 0.003 Ma (ref. 22). PTK’s third archaeological level underlies the Zinj clay, within the tuffaceous layer known as the ‘Chapati Tuff’23, and corresponds stratigraphically to the top of the Olduvai Bed I archaeological level designated as FLK NN 2. TOPPP’s 2014 excavation of this third level at PTK yielded abundant Mode I stone artefacts and a large faunal assemblage, which includes the MHL hominin proximal phalanx OH 86, described here.      Figure 1: Geographic location of the ‘PTK’ site. The location of the new PTK site (from which the OH 86 proximal phalanx was excavated) compared with two other major and penecontemporaneous Middle Bed I (Olduvai Formation) sites of FLK 22 Zinjanthropus and FLK NN that also occur near the junction of the Main and Side Gorges.

Full size image (208 KB) Figures index      Next      Specimen identification and anatomical description      OH 86 is a complete manual proximal phalanx that is nearly entirely encased in a very thin layer of the carbonated tuffaceous silt from which it derives (that is, the ‘Chapati Tuff’; Fig. 2). Although the areal spread of this concretion on OH 86 is encompassing, its submillimetre thinness guarantees little impact on the gross measurements that we derived on the specimen and analyse and discuss in this study. Basic osteometrics of OH 86 are listed in Supplementary Table 1. On the basis of several lines of morphometric evidence (see below), as well as qualitative features, we assign OH 86 to the fifth ray of the left hand.      Applying published qualitative criteria36—including asymmetry of the specimen’s flexor ridges and distal trochlea, as well as the orientation of the latter, and its base’s palmar outline—OH 86 compares most favourably to a modern human manual proximal phalanx from ray V. Quantitative data—including head mediolateral width/base mediolateral width ratio=0.72, base mediolateral width/overall superoinferior length ratio=0.39—corroborate this qualitative diagnosis. Last, we tested this corresponding qualitative/quantitative ray assignment by conducting a discriminant function analysis of OH 86 and a comparative sample composed of modern human proximal phalanges from rays II and V (which tend to be more similar to each other because of asymmetries caused by muscle insertions, among others). This analysis confirms the results of the initial qualitative and quantitative tests, also indicating that OH 86 most probably derives from a fifth ray (with a probability six times more likely than ray II, using the seven shape variables, and with a probability 10 times more likely than ray II, using the seven raw dimensions; Supplementary Fig. 3).      Assuming that the assignment of OH 86 as a fifth proximal phalanx is correct, it must also derive from a left hand on the basis of the pattern of asymmetry of the distal condyles: in palmar and dorsal views, the presumed radial condyle projects more inferiorly than does the presumed ulnar condyle. Further, the putative ulnar basal tubercle (insertion for the hypothenar muscles) is larger and protrudes more ulnarly and proximally than does the radial basal tubercle.      Mosimann shape ratios. The overall size (as approximated by the geometric mean, GM) of OH 86 is within the range of modern humans and chimpanzees (Supplementary Fig. 4a), as it is the case of other hominins except Au. sediba (below the human range). In terms of relative length, OH 86 is in the midrange of humans and the upper range of gorillas, but below chimpanzees and monkeys (Supplementary Fig. 4b). OH 86 exhibits a MHL, dorsopalmarly short trochlea, although this value also overlaps with the lowermost range of African apes (Supplementary Fig. 4c). No trend is evident in mediolateral trochlear width, although it is worth noting that the trochlear proportions of OH 86 are virtually identical to those of the fossil Qafzeh 9 (H. sapiens; Supplementary Fig. 4d). With regard to midshaft dimensions, OH 86 is dorsopalmarly short (but still overlaps with the modern human outlier range; Supplementary Fig. 4e), and as a consequence it is also mediolaterally wider than are the midshafts of the proximal phalanges of other hominins (Supplementary Fig. 4f). Extant taxa exhibit similar values of relative basal dorsopalmar height as does OH 86 (Supplementary Fig. 4g), although Pan clearly stands out in its having relatively higher bases (but still overlapping with the remaining sample). In this respect, although all hominins fall within the modern human variation, a clear trend is evident: fossil Homo and OH 86 show very similar values, in the low interquartile range of H. sapiens, whereas all australopiths are in the upper interquartile range. Last, with regard to relative basal breadth (Supplementary Fig. 4h), modern humans (and cercopithecid monkeys) possess wider bases than do African apes. Pliocene australopiths fall in the African ape range, whereas the early Pleistocene Au. sediba, fossil Homo and OH 86 all exhibit values within the human range.      When all these dimensions of proximal phalanx form variation (that is, the seven Mosimann shape ratios and the associated GM) are summarized by means of a principal components (PCA; Fig. 3a) and a cluster (Fig. 3b) analyses, the closest form affinities of OH 86 are revealed to be with Homo. In fact, based solely on the two major axes of form variation, our PCA (Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5) clearly separates H. sapiens from Pan, Gorilla and cercopithecoid monkeys (Fig. 3a). Further, although all fossils exhibit their closest form affinities to H. sapiens, OH 86 is the oldest hominin phalanx within the modern human form space (as represented by the two first axes, accounting for 90.1% of total form variation). In addition, when all dimensions of phalangeal form are summarized using an unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) dendrogram based on group centroids (Supplementary Fig. 4), it reveals a ‘Homo’ cluster nested within the ‘hominin’ group—with OH 86 being the oldest fossil in the sample placed within this ‘Homo’ cluster (Fig. 3b). In sum, modern human phalangeal form (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 5) is characterized by moderate relative total proximodistal length, midshaft mediolateral robusticity and overall size (that is, intermediate values of PC1, similar to Pan) in combination with a mediolaterally wide and dorsopalmarly short trochlea and base (which, together with their shorter lengths, differentiate human and Pan proximal phalanges). More specifically, the bases of Homo proximal phalanges are mediolaterally wider and dorsopalmarly shorter than are those of australopiths (Supplementary Fig. 4g,h). In addition, on the basis of trochlear shape, the intermediate phalanges of australopiths—as well as those of OH 7—are clearly distinct from those of extant and fossil Homo7. This previous finding regarding manual intermediate phalanges corresponds to our independent analyses of complete manual proximal phalanges, indicating together that modern human phalangeal morphology can be accurately characterized quantitatively. Importantly, OH 7 does not conform to the modern human characterization, even though it is penecontemporaneous with the MHL OH 86.      Figure 3: The form of the human proximal phalanx. (a) Plot showing the two major axes of proximal phalanx V form variation (that is, shape and size space). Major taxonomic groups can be distinguished (using convex hulls); OH 86 is the earliest fossil specimen within the human variation. (b) UPGMA cluster analysis summarizing eight dimensions of phalangeal form space: OH 86 is the oldest specimen within the Homo cluster.

Full size image (121 KB) Previous      Figures index      Phalangeal curvature. From functional and evolutionary perspectives, it is highly relevant that all australopith fifth proximal phalanges exhibit higher values of phalangeal curvature than do any of the extant and fossil Homo specimens (Fig. 4), denoting a biological transition in hominins towards less (if any) commitment to arboreal locomotion (at least as it is revealed from manual proximal phalanx anatomy). As with overall phalangeal form (Fig. 3), OH 86 falls exclusively within the modern human range of variation of fifth proximal phalanx curvature (Fig. 4); pooling results for curvature of all non-pollical proximal phalanges place OH 86 once again within the modern human range and in the lowermost range of Gorilla (Supplementary Fig. 5). In addition, compared with the manual phalanges of O. tugenesis, Ar. ramidus, Au. afarensis, Au. sediba, the Swartkrans hominins and OH 7—whose powerfully built flexor insertions result in proximal phalanx diaphyseal morphology that includes distinctive, palmarly concave ‘outbowing’—the diaphysis of OH 86 lacks such pronounced flexor insertions and is thus much straighter in medial and lateral views (Fig. 2). ||||| The hominin finger bone likely came from the pinky finger of an adult left hand.      Scientists have discovered the oldest known fossil of a hand bone to resemble that of a modern human, and they suggest it belonged to an unknown human relative that would have been much taller and larger than any of its contemporaries.      This new finding reveals clues about when modern humanlike hands first began appearing in the fossil record, and suggests that ancient human relatives may have been larger than previously thought, researchers say in a new study.      A key feature that distinguishes humans from all other species alive today is the ability to make and use complex tools. This capability depends not only on the extraordinarily powerful human brain, but also the dexterity of the human hand.      \\"The hand is one of the most important anatomical features that defines humans,\\" said study lead author Manuel Domínguez-Rodrigo, a paleoanthropologist at Complutense University of Madrid. \\"Our hand evolved to allow us a variety of grips and enough gripping power to allow us the widest range of manipulation observed in any primate. It is this manipulation capability that interacted with our brains to develop our intelligence.\\" [The 10 Biggest Mysteries of the First Humans]      How the hand evolved      Past analysis of fossils of hominins — the group of species that consists of humans and their relatives after the split from the chimpanzee lineage — has typically suggested that ancient hominins were adapted for a life spent in the trees. For instance, ancient hominin hands often possessed curved finger bones that were well suited for hanging from branches. Modern humans are the only living higher primates to have straight finger bones.      Scientists have often suggested that modern hands evolved to use stone tools. However, recent hominin fossil discoveries have suggested a more complex story behind the evolution of the modern hand. For instance, the hand bones of some ancient hominin lineages are sometimes more similar to modern hands than those of more recent lineages are.      \\"A modernlike hand in the past would tell us when humans became fully terrestrial and when and how efficiently our ancestors used tools,\\" Domínguez-Rodrigo told Live Science.      To learn more about the evolution of the modern hand, scientists analyzed a newly discovered hand bone dated to more than 1.84 million years ago, dug up from Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. Previous excavations at Olduvai helped confirm that Africa was the cradle of humanity.      The new bone was probably part of the little finger of the adult left hand of an unidentified hominin lineage similar to Homo erectus, the first hominin known to regularly keep tools it made. The bone is about 1.4 inches (3.6 centimeters) long — \\"the same size as the equivalent bone in our hand,\\" Domínguez-Rodrigo said. [See Photos of the Oldest Stone Tools]      The straightness and other features of this new bone suggest adaptations for life on the ground rather than in the trees. It adds to previous findings suggesting that several key features of modern human body shape emerged very early in hominin evolution. (This unknown hominin was not, however, a modern human.)      Previous research had suggested that hominins began walking on two legs about 6 million years ago, potentially helping to liberate their hands for tool use. Still, until about 2 million years ago, all known hominin hands showed a double function, allowing hominins to both climb trees and walk on two legs on the ground. (The human lineage Homo is thought to have evolved about 2 million to 3 million years ago; the oldest known extinct human species, Homo habilis, lived at least 1.8 million years ago.)      Before this oldest known hand-bone fossil was discovered, scientists weren't certain when hominin hands began looking like modern hands and became specialized for manipulation. \\"Our discovery fills a gap — we found out that such a modern-looking hand is at least 1.85 million years old,\\" Domínguez-Rodrigo said.      Big hominin      These findings also reveal that this unknown hominin was larger than other hominins living at the same time or before it. If this newfound finger bone had belonged to a modern human, that person would likely be about 5 feet 9 inches (1.75 meters) tall, Domínguez-Rodrigo said.      \\"Why is this important? Archaeologists have gathered enough information to understand that early sites like those of Olduvai are central places where hominins repeatedly transported carcasses up to more than 350 kilograms (770 lbs.), which were obtained via hunting,\\" Domínguez-Rodrigo said. \\"As a specialist on this topic, I always had trouble understanding how Homo habilis, barely taller than 1 meter (3.3 feet), could efficiently hunt animals that big.\\"      \\"Now, the new discovery shows that a bigger and more modern-looking creature existed at the time these sites were formed,\\" he added. \\"This makes this creature a better candidate to explain the creation of these early archaeological sites.\\"      The scientists detailed their findings online Aug. 18 in the journal Nature Communications.

The hand bone, dated to more than 1.84 million years ago, was dug up from Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania. It probably belonged to an unidentified hominin lineage similar to Homo erectus. The straightness and other features of this new bone suggest adaptations for life on the ground rather than in the trees.

These differences continue into adult life,she says.In public conversations,men talk most and interrupt other speakers more.In private conversations,men and women speak in equal amounts--although they say things in a different style.Professor Tannen believes that,for women,private talking is a way to establish and test intimacy(,).For men,private talking is a way to explore the power structure of a relationship. Teaching is one job where the differences between men's and women's ways of talking show.When a man teaches a woman,says Professor Tannen,he wants to show that he has more knowledge,and hence(,)more power in conversation.When a woman teaches another woman,however,she is more likely to take a sharing approach and to encourage her student to join in. But Professor Tannen does not believe that women are naturally more helpful.She says women feel they achieve power by being able to help others.Although the research suggests men talk and interrupt people more than women,Professor Tannen says,women actually encourage this to happen because they believe it will lead to more intimacy and help to establish a relationship.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the solution? Solve o - 6*o = 25 for o.","output":"To solve the algebraic equation o - 6*o = 25 for o, you should first simplify the left side of the equation. The left side of the equation consists of o - 6*o. You should perform the operation of multiplication before the operation of subtraction because of the order of operations, often remembered by the acronym PEMDAS (Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, Addition and Subtraction). So, on the left side of the equation, you're taking o and subtracting six times o (or 6o) from it. Mathematically, this may be simpler if we represent the first o as 1o. So the equation is now: 1o - 6o = 25 Subtract 6o from 1o and you get -5o, so the equation now looks like: -5o = 25 Next, to solve for o, we need to isolate o on one side of the equation. In order to do this, we need to get rid of the -5 that is currently multiplied by o.  We do this by doing the opposite of multiplication which is division. We divide both sides of the equation by -5 because whatever operation we perform on one side of the equation, we must also perform on the other side to maintain equality. So now the equation looks like: -5o /-5 = 25 / -5 The -5's on the left cancel out leaving us with o. On the right side of the equation, 25 divided by -5 is -5. So: o = -5 So, o equals -5. This is the solution of the equation o - 6*o = 25."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the following review positive or negative? I am moving to Ocotillo so I was really really really hoping the CHoP was great. I wanted a nearby steak place that we could love. So far CHoP underperformed.   We called ahead for reservations. When we arrived on time, there were no seats available so we were allowed to sit at the bar and order drinks. 45 minutes later still no seats so we just ordered food at the bar. The bartender was very nice, and the drinks tasted great.   Finally we took our seats an hour after arrival at the same time our food arrived. The Maui Rib Eye tasted great, but not incredible. We saw our waitress once. My wife ordered a salad which was pretty good. For what it is the price is pretty high; they are trying to be a middle-high end place without the service or experience to match. With incredible service, the food would cut it. But as it is, based on our experience, acceptable food with unacceptable service, means that without a groupon, we probably won't be back  Despite not having seats for our reservation and despite having to order food at the bar and then move to a table we did not even get an \\"I'm sorry\\" or what would seem like a near obligatory drink or appetizer on the house for such a mistake.   I hope that this was just a one-time bad experience. We will probably give them another chance...but only cause we live close.","output":"The review is mostly negative, with some positive aspects. The reviewer highlights their disappointment in several aspects of their experience at CHoP, contributing to an overall negative tone. They mention the establishment's underperformance and highlight the problems they encountered, such as not having seats ready despite having a reservation, having to wait for 45 minutes to an hour before being seated, and the lack of adequate service. However, there are some positive elements mentioned in the review. The bartender is described as very nice, the drinks are deemed great, the Maui Rib Eye is said to taste good, and the salad is considered pretty good. The review also expresses hope that their experience was a one-time occurrence and suggests that they might give the restaurant another chance due to its proximity to their new residence.  Overall, the negative aspects of the review outweigh the positives, resulting in a mostly negative impression of CHoP. The reviewer sees potential for improvement with better service, but their current experience is not enough to make them eager to return without using a Groupon or living close to the establishment."},{"instruction":"The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who described Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God as \\"self-consciously musically written and less sample-based?\\" , can you please find it?   After two more EPs on Kompakt, the Orb (now composed of only Paterson and Fehlmann) released Okie Dokie It's The Orb on Kompakt, which featured new material in addition to tweaked versions of their previous Kompakt output. By this stage, Allmusic observed, Thomas Fehlmann had become the primary creative figure in the Orb, \\"inhibiting Alex Paterson's whimsical impulses\\". Because of this, Okie Dokie was considerably more focused and less \\"goofy\\" than Cydonia and Bicycles & Tricycles. Fehlmann's trademark hypnotic loops and delays made him the centre of Okie Dokie production and, according to Pitchfork Media, made it \\"difficult to say where [Paterson] is in the picture\\". The Orb's releases with Kompakt gained them back much of their musical credibility with the press and showed that they could \\"age gracefully\\".In August 2006, the founders of the Orb - Paterson and Cauty - released Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God, their debut album as the Transit Kings with Guy Pratt and Pratt's associate, Dom Beken. The album featured appearances from Smiths' guitarist Johnny Marr and comedian Simon Day. Beken described Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God as \\"self-consciously musically written and less sample-based\\" compared to the members' previous work. Living had been in production since 2001, but due to members' other obligations, it was delayed for several years. The album received mixed critical reactions, with reviewers such as The Sun comparing the album favourably to the music of DJ Shadow and Röyksopp while other publications, such as The Times, called it \\"Orb-lite\\" and proclaimed it to be \\"Deep Forest-style sludge\\".

Summarize: More than 200 civilians left, joining hundreds allowed out since the truce was agreed on Friday. But concerns remain over the fate of men of military age who face questioning by the Syrian authorities. Meanwhile, talks between the warring sides have continued in Geneva, with no sign of any breakthrough. In other developments: Meanwhile sharp words have been exchanged by Washington and Moscow after Russia again objected to a draft UN Security Council resolution - this time, one that would call on all sides to allow aid workers access across Syria. That was criticised by US President Barack Obama, who called Russia a \\"holdout\\" and suggested that by blocking the resolution it too was responsible for \\"starving civilians\\", along with Syria. A Russian foreign ministry spokesman dismissed the criticism as a \\"biased distortion\\", highlighting Russia's role in helping achieve the ceasefire in Homs and insisting Russia was as concerned about the humanitarian situation in Syria as Washington. But the BBC's Nick Bryant at the UN in New York says that although Russia has rejected this present draft, it has not slammed the door on an alternative resolution. Government troops have besieged Homs for 18 months. By Lyse DoucetChief international correspondent The \\"humanitarian pause\\" in the Old City of Homs is a rare glimmer of light in a dark and devastating war. The UN says the mission has already helped a \\"significant\\" number of people to leave the besieged area and a \\"limited\\" amount of aid is getting through. The UN's resident humanitarian co-ordinator, Yacoub El Hillo, told me they were \\"baby steps\\" that, he hoped, could lead to the \\"giant steps\\" that were needed. But a rare truce also meant to build trust is exposing deep enmities. The longer the mission goes on, the more sensitive it becomes. Some pro-government forces are vehemently opposed to an operation that is allowing fighters to escape an area that has been the focus of heavy fighting for nearly two years. And the opposition is angry that young men who leave are being taken in for questioning. More than 100 have been released, but more than 200 are still being held. In Syria's brutal conflict, even humanitarian pauses cannot escape the cruel logic of war. Lyse on the ground in Homs Evacuations over the weekend were facilitated by a three-day truce, which was then extended until Wednesday, though the relief operation was halted by a day on Tuesday due to logistical reasons. Nearly 200 parcels containing flour, rice, vegetable oil and other foodstuffs were delivered on Wednesday. The UN's local humanitarian co-ordinator, Yacoub El Hillo, and Homs Governor Talal Barazi said more than 200 civilians had been taken out of Homs in Wednesday's operation. But hundreds of civilians remain trapped inside the Old City. Mr Barazi said an extension to the current ceasefire, due to end late on Wednesday, could be agreed. UN agencies have also expressed concern over the fate of dozens of men who were taken in by Syrian security personnel after they fled Homs. Mr Barazi said 111 men had been questioned and released, while 190 others were still being held. \\"I just want to say I hope that that the bigger percentage will all be released,\\" he told the BBC. \\"They are living in a shelter in very good conditions.\\" The Syrian authorities said the screening was necessary to weed out \\"terrorists\\". In Geneva, Syrian government and opposition negotiators met face-to-face again on Wednesday. The opposition proposed a transitional governing body (TGB) be set up to oversee a UN-monitored ceasefire across Syria and steer it out of the nearly three-year war. It would expel all foreign fighters, allow full humanitarian access and achieve a political solution to the war. But regime representatives refused to discuss the plan, saying it was broaching political questions prematurely, reported AFP news agency. UN envoy Lakhdar Brahimi has lamented a lack of progress in the talks - bringing forward a meeting with Russian and US officials by one day to Thursday in an apparent attempt to get them to apply pressure to the opposed Syrian sides. The first round of talks ended last month with no firm agreements and both sides trading insults. Meanwhile, the bloodshed continues inside Syria, with the Syrian Observatory of Human Rights saying Syrians are being killed at a faster rate than ever. The British-based group, which has links to the opposition, said at least 4,959 people had died in the three-week period since 22 January, when the first round of Swiss talks began. The opposition wants the government to commit in writing to the 2012 Geneva Communique, which called for the formation of a transitional administration with full executive authority. President Bashar al-Assad's government has ruled out any transfer of power. The civil conflict has claimed more than 100,000 lives and has driven 9.5 million people from their homes.","output":"A humanitarian pause in the besieged Syrian city of Homs has allowed more than 200 civilians to leave, while talks continue between warring sides in Geneva.

He repeated again and again the pledge he had just made to Nicolette: I am your true troubadour, now and forever. It felt like a knife stabbing into him. I do love her, as I have not loved any other - except Diane. Under his fur-lined mantle he was sweating, despite the bone-deep chill of the January night. Was my pledge to Nicolette a lie? No, not now that Diane has vowed herself to God. He had always believed that a man or a woman could love but one person. For all the years he had loved Diane, he had accepted that as a sacred law of Love. It was the way things should be. But it was not the way they were. Not for him. What if I had known, that day I saw Nicolette at Chinon, that Diane was still alive? I would have wanted Nicolette just as much, but would not have begun this. There would have been no messages, no song in her garden. But I was sure Diane was dead. There was nothing but a memory of a younger time to check my feelings for Nicolette. And then, when I found Diane again, I could not have her. I had lost her forever. So at last I wrote again to Nicolette. But tonight, when Nicolette would have let me make love to her - and how I want her! - I could not go beyond an embrace and a kiss. Not as long as I still love Diane. When he had set out, a full moon had hung low above the huddled rooftops of the university town. Now the silver disk was high overhead, and he could discern the small house he had bought two years ago with money he brought with him from Sicily. Why was Roland sweating?  A. not enough information  B. He wanted to make love to Nicolette  C. Diane had died  D. He was worried he has lied to Nicolette Answer:","output":"D.

Article: Speak can be a fun command to teach any dog. If you want your Manchester Terrier to learn to speak, begin by finding something that causes your dog to bark. This may be a toy, a treat, or a particular noise. During training sessions, wave the object around or make the noise until your dog barks. Praise your dog for barking and give your dog a treat.  Once your dog consistently barks in response to a certain stimuli, begin incorporating a command or hand gesture. For example, snap your fingers to get your dog to speak. Keep training each day, offering rewards each time your dog completes the behavior. Gradually phase out the object or noise you use and use only your command or gesture. Eventually, your Manchester Terrier should learn to speak on command. Roll over is taught in increments. To teach roll over, start by commanding your dog to lie down. Then, kneel down beside your dog and hold a treat near its nose. Gently press your dog's shoulder to get it to lie on its side. Use the treat to hold your dog's attention. Praise and reward your dog each time it moves on its side.  From there, move your hand from your dog's shoulder to its backbone. While you do this, move the treat over slightly. Your dog should roll on its back to get closer to the treat. Keep moving the treat until the dog has completely rolled over. Say the command \\"Roll over\\" and reward your dog. Keep up this routine every day in brief sessions. Eventually, your dog should start going through the motions on its own. You will be able to reduce touching your dog during the trick and will not have to use a treat as lure. To teach shake, start by holding your hand in front of your dog while its sitting with your palm up. If you hold out your hand long enough, your dog may eventually sniff or lick your hand on its own. This can lead to pawing Once your dog paws your hand, say \\"Shake\\" and reward your dog with a treat and praise. Repeat this process until your dog lifts its hand naturally. If you do short training sessions like this each day, your dog will eventually learn to shake on command. Some dogs will not paw at their owners hands naturally. If your dog does not paw on its own, gently tap your dog's paw until it places its paw in your hand. To begin, command your dog to \\"sit.\\" From there, hold a treat over your dog's head to get it to stand. Say \\"Beg\\" or \\"Sit up\\" while your dog does this. If your dog jumps to grab the treat, say \\"No,\\" and then have your dog return to the sitting position.  Repeat training sessions each day. Give your dog a treat as soon as it's standing on its hind legs. Say your command while your dog is standing. With daily training sessions, your dog will eventually learn to beg on cue. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article is about teaching your dog some fun tricks like \\"speak,\\" \\"roll over,\\" \\"shake,\\" and \\"beg.\\" It explains how to use treats, praise, and commands to train your dog in small steps.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  In February 1828, shortly before his 41st birthday, Etty soundly defeated John Constable by 18 votes to five to become a full Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. By this time, complaints about his supposed indecency were beginning to resurface. All but one of the 15 paintings Etty exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s had included at least one nude figure, and Etty was acquiring a reputation for using respectable themes as a pretext for nudity.For the 1828 Summer Exhibition Etty exhibited three pictures; The World Before the Flood, Venus, the Evening Star and Guardian Cherubs. (The latter was a portrait of the children of Welbore Ellis Agar, 2nd Earl of Normanton, and was the only non-nude painting exhibited by Etty at the RA in the 1820s.) Although similar to his earlier works, they were technically more accomplished. Both The World Before the Flood and Venus attracted positive reviews in the press and were sold during their exhibition for substantial sums, although the purchase by the Marquess of Stafford of The World Before the Flood—a work containing scantily clad figures of both sexes—drew a pointed comment in The Gentleman's Magazine that it \\"will serve to accompany the private Titians of that nobleman\\". Despite the increasing number of complaints in the press about his use of nudity, respect for Etty from his fellow artists continued to rise, and in 1828 the British Institution awarded him £100 in recognition of his talent. As soon as the 1828 Summer Exhibition was over, Etty stopped work on other projects to concentrate on a diploma piece, without which he could not become a Royal Academician. This piece, Sleeping Nymph and Satyrs, was presented to the Academy in October, and in December 1828 Etty became a Royal Academician. It appears to me then that virtuous happiness being our lawful aim in life, that having Academic Rank and Fame the next thing to be considered (if God approve) is to seek that Decent Competency which shall make my latter days comfortable...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person whose talent was recognized by an award of £100 from the British Institution in 1828? Answer:","output":"The name of the person whose talent was recognized by an award of £100 from the British Institution in 1828 is William Etty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context_1 : The Majestic Theatre was a theatre located at 5 Columbus Circle, the present site of the Time Warner Center. Designed in 1903 by John H. Duncan, the architect of Grant's Tomb, it was built at a time that Columbus Circle was expected to become a theatre district. Initially, the theatre, which seated about 1355, hosted original musicals and operettas, including \\"The Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Babes in Toyland\\", and some plays. It was renamed Park Theatre in 1911, opening with \\"The Quaker Girl\\", and it again presented plays, musicals and operettas. The Shuberts, Florenz Ziegfeld and Billy Minsky, in succession, owned the house but did not find success there. In 1925, it was purchased by William Randolph Hearst, renamed Cosmopolitan Theatre, and played movies as well as live theatre. During the period it was used as a playhouse, its last name was amended to include International Theatre. Context_2 : The Woodlawn Theatre is located in San Antonio, Texas, and is one of the few theaters remaining designed by architect John Eberson. Eberson’s only other work in San Antonio is the Majestic Theatre. The Woodlawn Theatre is designed in an art deco fashion, and was previously a prevalent movie theater, including hosting the world premiere of \\"The Alamo\\" in 1960.

The Majestic was converted to accommodate vaudeville shows in the 1920s and eventually into a movie house in the 1950s. The change to film came with renovations that transformed the lobby and covered up much of John Galen Howard's original Beaux-Arts architecture. Context_4 : Pacific Place is a Class-A office skyscraper located at 1910 Pacific Avenue in the City Center District of Dallas, Texas. The structure contains 20 floors of office space and stands adjacent to the historic Majestic Theatre.

Founded in 1880 by Charles Wesley Emerson as a \\"school of oratory,\\" Emerson is \\"the only comprehensive college or university in America dedicated exclusively to communication and the arts in a liberal arts context.\\" Offering more than three dozen degree programs in the area of Arts and Communication, the college is accredited by the New England Association of Schools and Colleges. Located in Boston's Washington Street Theatre District on the edge of the Boston Common, the school also maintains buildings in Los Angeles and the town of Well, The Netherlands. Context_6 : The Piano Row District is a historic district encompassing two blocks of buildings facing Boston Common at the corner of Tremont Street and Boylston Street in Boston, Massachusetts. The district extends along Boylston from Park Square to Tremont, and along Tremont to Avery Street. The district also includes two buildings on Tremont just south of Boylston: the Cutler Majestic Theater, and the 1925 Union Savings Bank building at 216-218 Tremont. This area was developed in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and became known as \\"Piano Row\\" because of the concentration of music-related businesses, including several piano showrooms. The flagship store for M. Steinert and Sons, Boston's longtime Steinway dealoer, has been located here since 1896, and features a fine underground performance hall, which has unfortunately been virtually abandoned due to fire codes.

Question: suppose a bigger satellite is designed happens, how will it affect a crew builds a smaller physical satellite.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","output":"When a bigger satellite is designed, it will have more effect on the crew building a smaller physical satellite. This is because the bigger satellite will likely have an increased complexity due to larger size, additional components, and more intricate systems. This may require the crew working on the smaller satellite to adapt their building techniques and allocate additional resources, such as manpower and equipment, for effectively constructing and assembling the bigger satellite. However, the specific impact on the smaller satellite construction process would primarily depend on the shared resources and personnel involved in both projects. If the designs and construction of the two satellites are being carried out by separate teams with separate resources, then the perturbation caused by the new requirements for the bigger satellite might have less or no effect on the construction process of the smaller one. In summary, the influence of a bigger satellite design on the crew building a smaller physical satellite largely depends on the extent to which the projects share resources and workforce.

Question: What does Bugs hide in a watermelon for Sam? Movie plot title: Ballot Box Bunny Movie plot: Yosemite Sam is running for mayor of a small town, declaring such empty promises as: \\"There's enough fresh air and sunshine in this great country of ours for everybody â and I'll see to it, that you'll get your share!\\". Bugs Bunny is underneath the podium drinking carrot juice when Sam makes a pledge to make good on his previous promise \\"to rid this country of every last rabbit\\" if elected. Bugs then decides he needs to fight against Sam by running against him for mayor. Bugs proceeds to quickly try and win the townspeople over with Theodore Roosevelt's famous \\"I speak softly, but I carry a BIG stick!\\" quote, even dressing up like Roosevelt. However, Sam declares \\"I speak LOUD and I carry a BIGGER stick, and I use it too!\\" (When watching this on The Bugs Bunny Show, Daffy Duck says \\"I speak medium, and I carry the BIGGEST stick.)

You must generate a detailed and long answer. FIFA were in turmoil on Wednesday after their World Cup corruption investigator quit in protest at the systematic cover-up of his own report. Michael Garcia’s resignation statement could not have been more damning. The New York lawyer accused FIFA — and especially their ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert — of a wholesale whitewash of the murky Russia 2018 and Qatar 2022 World Cup bid campaigns. Garcia’s bombshell plunged world football’s wholly discredited ruling body into yet another crisis. UEFA president Michel Platini was the first to react, calling the sorry saga a ‘new failure for FIFA’. Michael Garcia has resigned from FIFA's ethics committee and cited a 'lack of leadership' Garcia alleged that FIFA had not only swept his findings under the carpet but tried to silence him by reporting him to their own disciplinary committee for speaking out. He also accused Eckert of having no independence and claims FIFA’s ingrained culture of self-preservation under Sepp Blatter meant it was impossible to bring about change. Garcia said: ‘It is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end. No independent governance committee, investigator or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation.’ And Garcia, who was head of FIFA’s ethics investigatory arm, went as far as saying about his colleague Eckert’s conclusions: ‘When viewed in the context of the report it purported to summarise, no principled approach could justify the Eckert decision’s edits, omissions and additions.’ He added that he had ‘lost confidence in the independence of the adjudicatory chamber’. Garcia's report was only published as a summary by FIFA, something Garcia himself quickly denounced. Garcia believes there has been a massive cover-up which he also fears will be the last word on the 2018 and 2022 bids. He chose to resign on the eve of FIFA’s executive committee meeting in Marrakech, which is due to vote on making his full report public, albeit with redactions where there are issues of confidentiality. Clearly, he believes there is no chance of this happening, especially as the FIFA appeals committee earlier this week turned down his complaint about Eckert’s ‘numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions’. His appeal was dismissed on the bizarre grounds that Eckert’s summary was not legally binding. The timing of his exit, along with his incendiary comments, now puts huge pressure on the 26-strong ExCo to vote for full publication. The move to publish was unlikely to have received the necessary majority before Garcia’s intervention but his views might have changed a few minds. Russia, Qatar and England were accused of breaking rules during the 2018 and 2022 bids in the report. JULY 2012. FIFA appoint US lawyer Garcia and German judge Hans-Joachim Eckert to their Ethics Committee. Garcia is brought in to investigate bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. September 2014. Garcia submits his 350-page report. Eckert says it will not be made public, with only his summary published. OCTOBER 2014. Garcia, among others, calls for the report to be published in full and says of FIFA: ‘(The) investigation and adjudication process operates in most parts unseen and unheard... (it) might be appropriate for an intelligence agency but not for an ethics compliance process in an international sports institution.’ NOVEMBER 2014. Eckert publishes his summary, which clears Russia and Qatar of corruption, but claims England had undermined the integrity of bidding during their 2018 bid campaign. Garcia says the findings contain ‘erroneous representations ’, and says he will appeal. DECEMBER 2014. FIFA dismiss Garcia’s complaint to their Appeal Committee. Garcia resigns from the Ethics Committee. Garcia, who was appointed by FIFA to probe the two World Cup bid campaigns in July 2012, announced through his law firm Kirkland & Ellis: ‘For the first two years I felt that the ethics committee was making real progress. But in recent months that changed. ‘The report myself and deputy Cornel Borbely submitted identified serious and wide-ranging issues with the bidding and selection process. ‘Soon after, Hans-Joachim Eckert indicated only limited information would be made public. Concerned that insufficient transparency would not serve FIFA’s interests, I issued a public statement calling on the FIFA ExCo to authorise appropriate publication. ‘The ExCo took no action on this subject other than to refer me to the disciplinary committee for violating the ethics code through my public comments about publication and watches given to certain football officials.’ Garcia and Hans-Joachim Eckert pictured together earlier this year at FIFA headquarters in Switzerland. The disciplinary committee, not surprisingly, rejected FIFA’s complaint against their investigator. Garcia, who will not take his case to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, had a final swipe at FIFA’s tarnished leadership. He said: ‘It now appears that at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert decision will stand as the final word on the 2018/2022 World Cup bidding process. ‘And while the Eckert decision made me lose confidence in the independence of the adjudicatory chamber, it is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude my role in this process is at an end.’ However the prosecutions launched by Garcia against five senior football officials — including German great Franz Beckenbauer and FIFA ExCo members Angel Maria Villar of Spain, Thailand’s Worawi Makudi and Michel D’Hooghe of Belgium — can still be carried on by Garcia’s deputy Borbely. FIFA President Sepp Blatter (right) hands over the World Cup trophy to Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani. Meanwhile Domenico Scala, chairman of the compliance committee, has the role of deciding today what portions of Garcia’s work the ExCo should see. Prince Ali of Jordan, an advocate of reform who was the first inside the FIFA ExCo to call for the report to be published, said last night: ‘It’s a shame that we have lost Michael Garcia, for whom we had tremendous respect. It was a shock to hear and he must have done it for a reason. It is emblematic of some of the challenges FIFA have.’ FIFA’s British vice-president Jim Boyce said: ‘I am totally shocked. The ethics committee was our most important group.’ For the first two years after my July 2012 appointment as independent chairman of the FIFA Ethics Committee's Investigatory Chamber, I felt that the Ethics Committee was making real progress in advancing ethics enforcement at FIFA. In recent months, that changed. On September 5, 2014, I and Cornel Borbely, the deputy chair of the Investigatory Chamber, sent a 'Report on the Inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process' (the 'Report') to the FIFA Ethics Committee's Adjudicatory Chamber. The Report identified serious and wide-ranging issues with the bidding and selection process. (Mr Borbely also filed separate reports from his inquiries into the activities of the bid teams from Russia and the United States.) Soon after, the chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber, Hans-Joachim Eckert, indicated publicly that only limited information from the Report would be made public. Concerned that insufficient transparency would not serve FIFA's interests, I issued a public statement calling on the FIFA Executive Committee to authorise the appropriate publication of the Report. The Executive Committee took no action on this subject during its September 2014 meetings - other than to refer me to the FIFA Disciplinary Committee for allegedly violating the Code of Ethics through my public comments, namely, my public request that the Executive Committee authorise appropriate publication of the Report and the on-the-record statement Mr Borbely and I released concerning watches given to certain football officials. The chairman of the Disciplinary Committee, Claudio Sulser, ultimately rejected the Executive Committee's referral. On November 13, 2014, Mr Eckert issued a 42-page 'Statement of the Chairman of the Adjudicatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee on the Report on the Inquiry into the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup Bidding Process prepared by the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee' (the 'Eckert Decision'). In a cover letter, Mr Eckert described the statement as his 'findings, including certain descriptions of the contents of the Investigatory Chamber's report.' The issues raised by Mr Eckert's selection and omission of material from the Report, and his additional comments, went far beyond the initial transparency concerns. As my public statement at the time explained, the Eckert Decision contained 'numerous materially incomplete and erroneous representations of facts and conclusions.' Accordingly, I appealed. A brief I filed with the FIFA Appeal Committee on November 24, 2014, outlined the Eckert Decision's most serious failings. Among other points, the brief explained why, when viewed in the context of the Report it purported to summarize, no principled approach could justify the Eckert Decision's edits, omissions, and additions. Yesterday's decision by the Appeal Committee declined to address these points. Instead, the Appeal Committee rejected my appeal on procedural grounds, concluding that 'it is not necessary for the FIFA Appeals Committee to enter into considerations on the substance of the appeal.' The Appeal Committee found that the Eckert Decision was 'merely a personal opinion on the Report' and had 'no legally binding effect whatsoever.' It reached this conclusion even though, under Article 36 of the Code of Ethics, only 'final decisions' may be made public, as the Eckert Decision, which was published on FIFA's website, obviously was. The Appeal Committee also overlooked the Eckert Decision's self-described 'findings,' including one stating that 'the evaluation of the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cups bidding process is closed for the FIFA Ethics Committee.' FIFA President Blatter recently reaffirmed that 'finding' during an interview published by FIFA, stating: 'Furthermore, there is no change to Judge Eckert's statement that the investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups is concluded.' I disagree with the Appeal Committee's decision. It now appears that, at least for the foreseeable future, the Eckert Decision will stand as the final word on the 2018/2022 FIFA World Cup bidding process. While the Appeal Committee's decision notes that further appeal may be taken to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, I have concluded that such a course of action would not be practicable in this case. No independent governance committee, investigator, or arbitration panel can change the culture of an organisation. And while the November 13, 2014, Eckert Decision made me lose confidence in the independence of the Adjudicatory Chamber, it is the lack of leadership on these issues within FIFA that leads me to conclude that my role in this process is at an end. Accordingly, effective today, December 17, 2014, I am resigning as independent chairman of the Investigatory Chamber of the FIFA Ethics Committee.

Write a title for this article: A Ukrainian serviceman patrols the area as people stand in line to receive humanitarian aid near a delivery point in the government forces-controlled town of Debaltseve, Donetsk region, Feb. 6, 2015. REUTERS/Maxim The battle for east Ukraine is getting nastier by the day. Pro-Russian rebels, believed to be reinforced by Russian troops, are successfully pushing back against the Ukrainian army in an attempt to take over strategic transport and energy hubs, like Debaltseve and Mariupol, for the sake of making their self-proclaimed state more sustainable. Hundreds of thousands of civilians along the eastern Ukraine frontline have been affected by the brutal fighting. The death toll is rising rapidly: over 5,000 people have died in Ukraine since the fighting started in Spring 2014. Ukraine says 9,000 Russian troops are inside the country, 50,000 more are on the border and ready to enter anytime. Russia denies any military presence, although it does not rule out the possibility that Russian volunteer fighters may be operating inside the country. Numerous reports from foreign, Ukrainian and even Russian journalists dispute the Kremlin’s assertions. They say that Russian military units are indeed fighting in east Ukraine. Faced with this situation, Ukrainian government officials and the public at large are enthusiastic about the news that the U.S. is considering arming the country. Scared for its future, post-revolutionary Ukraine wants a stable flow of Western military support, including lethal weapons. Many in Ukraine believe this is only this way to save the country from total occupation by Russia. But let’s get real. Nuclear Russia spends 50 times more on its army annually than Ukraine does, and it has about four times more soldiers and six times as many military aircraft. It could take over Ukraine in a matter of days. Kiev is just 120 miles from the Russian border. And although nobody knows for sure what’s inside Russian President Vladimir Putin’s mind, the occupation of Ukraine is not on the table, at least not yet. Instead, it looks like a covert invasion of east Ukraine suits Russia much more: it keeps Ukraine on the verge of collapsing, robbing the country and its potential investors of any sense of stability, without using the military might required for a full invasion. Arming Ukraine will not fix the country’s huge military imbalance with Russia. Unless, of course, Western allies are ready to shell out 70 billion per year. That’s what it would take to match Russia’s military. Finding that kind of cash is unlikely. Ukraine is having a hard time getting the estimated 15 billion it needs to avoid default this year. Importantly, a war-fatigued United States, which is preparing for presidential elections in 2016, would scarcely seem to be open to military involvement in yet another country. At the same time, solving the problem is a lot more complex that simply providing Ukraine with weapons. The country is ravaged by corruption, and its political system and economy is in shambles. Any military support would have to be conditional upon effective reforms. Without that, arming Ukraine would be irresponsible — it would be no different to giving a gun to a crook. The Ukrainian army, too, is widely considered to be plagued by corruption and incompetence. It is also reportedly infiltrated by Russian intelligence. This might be why, despite a strong patriotic rally for the push against Russia, there have been reports of rising numbers of Ukrainians avoiding the draft. Ukraine’s leaders have acknowledged the problem and have pledged to clean up the nation’s military. We can give the Ukrainian government credit for that. Still, after almost 25 years of a near kleptocracy, this could take years. War isn’t helping. So far, there are no indications that there is any timetable for a potential U.S. arms drop to Ukraine, let alone that the United States in indeed serious about doing so. The State Department could just be testing the waters or trying to scare Russia off from advancing further. If that’s the case, it’s unlikely that will work either. Have you checked the Russian media lately? The most popular story making the rounds right now (and also the most hilarious example of Russian propaganda) is about Putin being “able to finish NATO with just one phone-call.” Indeed, harsher rhetoric will only help Putin in rallying more domestic support for his agenda, as it will strengthen his claim that the West is interfering in Ukraine. The Russian leader will undoubtedly use military threats from the West to support his position that NATO countries are aggressors, trying to suffocate Russia by expanding militarily on its border. There are only two ways to stop Russia’s attempt to control Ukraine by stealth. Strengthen Ukraine by pressuring the government to introduce much-needed reforms. Effective anti-corruption measures need to be introduced now that will make obsolete the remnants of Ukraine’s kleptocracy. General distrust and frustration with crooks on every level of the Ukrainian bureaucracy was one of the main sources of secessionist sentiments in eastern Ukrainian provinces. Russia has exploited this all too well. At the same time, the West should continue bringing pressure to bear on Russia through its economic sanctions — if it wants to get tougher on Russia, it can always ramp these up. There are plenty of sensible, and effective, measures the West could support to help the situation. Providing more guns and ammunition in this volatile part of the world is not one of them.

On the way to the party, Haverstock sees Van Meer entering the car which is to take him to the party, and runs to interview him; Van Meer invites him to ride along. At the party, Haverstock meets Fisher's daughter, Carol (Laraine Day). Van Meer disappears mysteriously. Later, Fisher informs the guests that Van Meer, who was supposed to be the guest of honor, will not be attending the party; instead he will be at a political conference in Amsterdam.At the conference, Van Meer is shot in front of a large crowd by a man disguised as a photographer.

Summarize this article: Most toddlers will eat a variety of fruits, so try incorporating them into the daily diet as breakfast and snacks. Use vegetables in every lunch and dinner, and set a good example for your child by eating vegetables yourself as well. Children should have regular sources of lean protein, such as yogurt, fish, chicken, and some whole grains. Work within your child’s preferences but make it clear that protein is an important part of mealtime. Toddlers need fresh, healthful food to achieve and maintain an appropriate weight. If your child often eats take-out or packaged foods packed with fat, salt, sugar, and other non-nutritive ingredients, swap them out for carrot sticks, applesauce, strawberry slices, string cheese, and Cheerios. Toddlers need about half the calories of adults, so size portions accordingly. Try dividing the plate into segments: 1/2 vegetables and/or fruits, 1/4 whole grains, and 1/4 lean protein. Many toddlers love to drink fruit juices, but these are often loaded with calories and limited in nutritional value.  If your child drinks a lot of fruit juice (or any other sweetened drink), swap it out for milk or water. Juice, soda, and other sweetened drinks can add hundreds of calories to your toddler’s diet each day. Do not give your toddler drinks that serve as dietary supplements, such as PediaSure. These drinks are formulated for children with difficulty gaining weight or with restrictive diets. If your child eats well and is overweight, avoid high-calorie toddler drinks of this nature.","output":"The article emphasizes the importance of providing toddlers with a nutritious and balanced diet to maintain a healthy weight. To achieve this, it suggests incorporating a variety of fruits in their daily meals as breakfast and snacks, and using vegetables for lunch and dinner. Parents should set a good example by eating vegetables themselves. Lean protein from yogurt, fish, chicken, and whole grains should also be a regular part of children's diet. It is essential to work within the child's preferences while stressing the importance of protein intake. Furthermore, it is vital to replace unhealthy, high-fat, and sugar-packed take-out or packaged foods with healthier options like carrot sticks, applesauce, strawberry slices, string cheese, and Cheerios. Since toddlers require half the calories of adults, portions should be sized accordingly. A recommended way to portion the plate is to have half of it filled with vegetables and/or fruits, a quarter with whole grains, and the remaining quarter with lean protein. The article also addresses the consumption of fruit juices, which are often high in calories and limited in nutritional value. It advises swapping fruit juices and other sweetened drinks for milk or water, as these sugary beverages can contribute significantly to a toddler's calorie intake. Additionally, it warns against providing dietary supplement drinks meant for children with issues gaining weight or restrictive diets, such as PediaSure. Overweight children who consume a balanced diet should avoid such high-calorie drinks. In summary, maintaining a healthy weight for toddlers is crucial and can be achieved through a balanced diet with appropriate portion sizes and replacing unhealthy options with nutritionally dense foods and drinks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Game of Thrones fans were promised cheaper access to the show by Foxtel but the hit drama is not included in the new subscription deal to win over more customers and reduce illegal downloads. Foxtel customers now pay 45 instead of 74 to access drama, sport and movies. However, the minimum cost to buy into a pay-TV package which will deliver Game Of Thrones at the same time as it airs in the US along with a host of HBO quality shows is 45. Previously it would have cost viewers a minimum of 74 to access the series. However, considering Australians set a world record for file sharing downloads - with more than one million  accessing the show last season - the question begs is the reduced subscription enough to stop fans from illegally downloading? According to file sharing monitor TorrentFreak, Australia is the only country in the world to reach double digit downloads of the show with 11.6 per cent of GoT downloads originating here. Despite the show being a massive success - Foxtel only managed to hit the 115,000-175,000 viewers range - technically fewer viewers than for Peppa Pig on Sunday mornings. Making Game Of Thrones cheaper to watch is not the sole reason behind Foxtel's revised pricing structure but it is the reference point for comparing the old subscription scale to the new one. Foxtel CEO Richard Freudenstein said there has already been a positive response to their new pay structure. There will also be more HD channels and the launch of an upgraded IQ box to allow viewers to watch shows that have been screened in the previous 24 hours.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. What is the name of the work whose core approaches a five-movement symphony with the chorale finale?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum.

Question: What is the name of Tyler's two children? Title: The Fourth Kind Movie plot: Chapman University hosts a televised interview with psychologist Dr. Abigail Tyler (Milla Jovovich/Charlotte Milchard). She tells a story of a close encounter incident at Nome, Alaska, in October 2000. In August 2000, Tyler's husband, Will, is mysteriously murdered one night in his sleep, leaving her to raise their two children, Ashley (Mia Mckenna-Bruce) and Ronnie (Raphael Coleman). Tyler tapes hypnotherapy sessions with three patients who have the same experience: every night a white owl stares at them through their windows. Tyler hypnotizes two of them, and both recount similar terrifying stories of creatures attempting to enter their homes. Tommy Fisher (Corey Johnson), her first patient to go under hypnosis, refuses to admit what he sees and returns home. Later that night, Abbey is called by the police to Tommy's house, where she finds him holding his wife and their two children at gunpoint. He insists that he remembers everything and keeps asking what \\"Zimabu Eter\\" means. Despite Abbey's attempts to get Tommy to put his gun down, he shoots his family and turns the gun on himself. After hearing the similarities in the accounts of nightly occurrences, Abbey suspects these patients may have been victims of a non-human kidnapping. There is evidence that she herself may have been abducted, when an Assistant gives her a tape recorder, which plays her voice and the sound of something with a distorted electronic voice entering her home and attacking her. It speaks in an unknown tongue; Abbey, though, has no memory of it. Dr. Abel Campos (Elias Koteas), a colleague from Anchorage, is suspicious of the claims. Later, Tyler calls upon Dr. Awolowa Odusami (Hakeem Kae-Kazim), a specialist in ancient languages who was a contact of her late husband, to identify the mysterious language on the tape. Odusami identifies it as Sumerian. Another, more willing patient named Scott (Enzo Cilenti) wishes to communicate.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. As with other retinal surgeries, you will be required to abstain from eating or drinking anything for between two and eight hours before the procedure. You may also be instructed to use eye drops to dilate the pupils before surgery. In a vitrectomy, your doctor will remove the vitreous fluid from inside the eyeball, and will remove any tissue that may be preventing the retina from healing. Your doctor will then fill the eye with air, gas, or liquid to replace the vitreous, allowing the retina to reattach and heal.  This procedure is the most commonly-performed type of retinal surgery.  Over time, the substance (air, gas, or liquid) your doctor injected is absorbed by the eye, and your body will produce fluid that will fill the vitreous cavity. If your doctor used silicone oil, however, he will need to surgically remove the oil after several months have passed and the eye has healed. After a vitrectomy, your doctor will send you home with specific care instructions for your eye to help ensure a full recovery. Follow your doctor's instructions carefully, and ask him if you're uncertain of what to do. Your doctor may instruct you to:  Take a pain reliever, like acetaminophen  Use prescription-strength eye drops or ointments After a vitrectomy, most patients are instructed to keep the head stable in a specific position. This is known as \\"posturing,\\" and it is vital to allow the bubble to settle into the correct position. It can also be helpful in maintaining the eye's shape after surgery.  Follow your doctor's instructions on posturing to allow the retina to heal.  Do not travel by airplane until the gas bubble is fully absorbed. Your doctor will tell you when it is safe to fly again.  Having gas bubbles in the eye may cause complications in other surgeries. Let your doctor know about the gas bubbles before any subsequent surgeries, and before being administered general anesthetic, especially nitrous oxide. Your doctor may give you an eye box to help your eye heal. He will instruct you on how to use the eye box, and will let you know how long to continue using it.  Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water before handling any eye equipment.  Soak cotton balls in the prescribed eyewash solution.  Loosen any crust that may have formed on your eye, then wipe gently from the inside of your eye across to the outside. If you are treating both eyes, use separate cotton balls for each eye. Your doctor may give you an eye patch and an eye shield to help your eye heal. These tools will help you protect your eye while sleeping and whenever you are outdoors.  Wear the eye shield for at least a week, or for as long as your doctor instructs you to continue use.  The eyepatch will help protect your eye from bright lights, like the sun, and will help prevent dirt and debris from entering your healing eye. Summary:","output":"In preparation for vitrectomy, you'll need to fast for several hours and might use eye drops to dilate your pupils. During the surgery, the vitreous fluid is removed and replaced with air, gas, or liquid to allow retina reattachment and healing. Post-surgery care includes following your doctor's instructions on using pain relievers, eye drops, and engaging in posturing to ensure proper healing. Avoid air travel until the gas bubble is fully absorbed and inform doctors of the gas bubble before any subsequent surgeries. Use an eye box if provided, maintaining proper hygiene when handling eye equipment.

Perform the subtraction within the parentheses: 2622 = 57 * d. 2. Isolate the variable d.

The key scientists acknowledged for their significant contributions to the understanding of the electrical properties of nerve cells in the first half of the 20th century are Sir Alan Hodgkin and Sir Andrew Huxley. Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley conducted a series of groundbreaking experiments primarily on the giant axons of squid at the University of Cambridge, England, in the early 1940s and thereafter. While their work was interrupted by World War II, they resumed their research in the late 1940s which continued into the 1950s. Using an innovative voltage-clamping technique, they were able to ascertain that the nerve impulse (called an action potential) that travels along nerve cells, or neurons, was due to the sequential activation and then inactivation of ion channels through which sodium and potassium ions flow across the nerve cell's membrane. Rapid influx of sodium ions leads to the initial depolarization of the membrane, followed by the repolarization phase involving the outflow of potassium ions. By developing complex mathematical equations to describe the ionic movements involved, they were able to elucidate the mechanism of the action potential. Their findings provided remarkable insights into the electrical properties of nerve cells, and hence, they established the 'Hodgkin-Huxley model' of nerve impulse propagation. Further, they also introduced the concept of membrane potential and described the role of resting potential and threshold potential in the generation of an action potential. In recognition of their phenomenal contributions, Hodgkin and Huxley were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1963, shared with John Eccles for his work on synapse physiology.  Though Charles Sherrington made significant contributions to neurophysiology, especially in the area of reflexes and the concept of synaptic communication, his work didn't directly address the question asked, which is about the electrical properties of nerve cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To qualify for participation in the auctions, banks must be able to offer proof of appropriate collateral in the form of loans to other entities. These can be the public debt of member states, but a fairly wide range of private banking securities are also accepted. The fairly stringent membership requirements for the European Union, especially with regard to sovereign debt as a percentage of each member state's gross domestic product, are designed to insure that assets offered to the bank as collateral are, at least in theory, all equally good, and all equally protected from the risk of inflation. What should no assets offered up as collateral be? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","output":"The question appears to be asking what characteristics or requirements should disqualify assets from being offered up as collateral in the context of the European Central Bank (ECB) auctions. In order to ensure the stability of the financial system and the effectiveness of the ECB's monetary policy instruments, assets offered as collateral must meet certain minimum standards. Assets that do not meet these criteria should not be accepted as collateral. Here are some key factors that may render an asset unsuitable for collateral: 1. Low credit quality: Collateral should have a sufficient level of credit quality to ensure that the risk of default is minimized. Assets with low credit ratings or those issued by entities with poor creditworthiness should not be accepted as collateral. 2. Illiquidity: Collateral should be easily tradable in the market, and there should be a readily available market price for the asset. Assets that are not easily tradable or lack an active secondary market may not be suitable as collateral since they might be difficult to liquidate in case of default. 3. Legal issues: Assets should be free from legal disputes or encumbrances that may hinder their use as collateral. Assets with unresolved legal issues or those that have restrictions on their transferability should not be accepted as collateral. 4. Concentration risk: The ECB aims to ensure that the collateral pool is well diversified to minimize risk. If an asset represents a significant concentration in a particular issuer, sector, or geography, it may not be suitable as collateral to maintain a diverse and balanced pool. 5. Maturity mismatch: Assets offered as collateral should have a maturity profile that matches the maturity of the credit provided by the ECB. Offering assets with very short or very long maturity might not be suitable, as this could create refinancing risks for the borrowing bank. 6. Inflation risk: To protect against inflation risk, collateral should be denominated in currencies that have stable inflation rates. Assets denominated in currencies with high inflation risk or volatile exchange rates may not be suitable as collateral. 7. Non-compliance with EU requirements: Assets should comply with EU membership requirements and any applicable regulations. Assets issued by entities that do not meet the European Union's or ECB's guidelines might not be accepted as collateral. In conclusion, no assets offered up as collateral should have low credit quality, illiquidity, legal issues, high concentration risk, maturity mismatch, significant inflation risk, or non-compliance with EU requirements. Such assets would not meet the minimum criteria necessary for effectively participating in the ECB auctions and ensuring the stability of the financial system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Reactions and Compounds of Nitrogen Like carbon, nitrogen has four valence orbitals (one 2s and three 2p), so it can participate in at most four electron-pair bonds by using sp3 hybrid orbitals. Unlike carbon, however, nitrogen does not form long chains because of repulsive interactions between lone pairs of electrons on adjacent atoms. These interactions become important at the shorter internuclear distances encountered with the smaller, second-period elements of groups 15, 16, and 17. (For more information on internuclear distance, see Chapter 7 \\"The Periodic Table and Periodic Trends\\", Section 7.2 \\"Sizes of Atoms and Ions\\" and Chapter 8 \\"Ionic versus Covalent Bonding\\", Section 8.2 \\"Ionic Bonding\\". ) Stable compounds with N–N bonds are limited to chains of no more than three N atoms, such as the azide ion (N 3−). Nitrogen is the only pnicogen that normally forms multiple bonds with itself and other second-period elements, using π overlap of adjacent np orbitals. Thus the stable form of elemental nitrogen is N 2, whose N≡N bond is so strong (DN≡N = 942 kJ/mol) compared with the N–N and N=N bonds (DN–N = 167 kJ/mol; DN=N = 418 kJ/mol) that all compounds containing N–N and N=N bonds are thermodynamically unstable with respect to the formation of N2. In fact, the formation of the N≡N bond is so thermodynamically favored that virtually all compounds containing N–N bonds are potentially explosive. Again in contrast to carbon, nitrogen undergoes only two important chemical reactions at room temperature: it reacts with metallic lithium to form lithium nitride, and it is reduced to ammonia by certain microorganisms. (For more information lithium, seeChapter 21 \\"Periodic Trends and the \\". ) At higher temperatures, however, N2 reacts with more electropositive elements, such as those in group 13, to give binary nitrides, which range from covalent to ionic in character. Like the corresponding compounds of carbon, binary compounds of nitrogen with oxygen, hydrogen, or other nonmetals are usually covalent molecular...   Q: What is the most electron-pair bonds a nitrogen atom can participate in?

This is because the fact provided states that \\"magnetic attraction pulls two objects together.\\" Magnetic attractions occur between objects made of, or containing, ferromagnetic materials (such as iron, nickel, or cobalt) when aligned in a particular way. The effects of magnetism are observable in everyday life, and it is one of the fundamental forces in physics that acts at a distance, meaning it can pull objects together without them physically touching or without the necessity of a person to interfere. Let's additionally briefly analyze the other possible, but less likely, answer options. (I) the objects are possessed - This option stems more from a belief in the paranormal. It is often touted in supernatural beliefs or horror movies that objects may move without apparent cause due to possession. However, this is not a scientifically or commonly accepted reason for two objects to move closer together. (III) the sun is rising - This seemingly unrelated event wouldn't have a direct impact on the movement or proximity of two objects on Earth. Although the sun's gravitational pull affects the Earth, there's no discernible way it would make nearby objects come closer together. (IV) all of these - Because options (I) and (III) are not likely answers based on the scenario and explanation given, it would be incorrect to assume that all choices are valid explanations.

Exxon CEO Now a Contender for Donald Trump’s Secretary of State President-elect Donald Trump is widening the circle of candidates for secretary of state and will interview more prospects this week, transition officials said, a sign that after multiple meetings with high-profile hopefuls he still isn’t sold on whom he wants as the nation’s top diplomat. Though Mr. Trump’s transition team said last week that the search had narrowed to four finalists, new candidates have emerged, including Rex Tillerson, chairman and chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp. , one transition adviser said. Mr. Tillerson is scheduled to meet with Mr. Trump for an interview this week. Alan Jeffers, an Exxon spokesman, declined to comment. Vice President-elect Mike Pence, appearing Sunday on NBC, said the list of secretary of state candidates “might grow a little bit.” On Sunday evening, Mr. Trump’s transition officials said another candidate for both secretary of state and energy secretary is Sen. Joe Manchin (D., W.Va.). The conservative Democrat would add a bipartisan dimension to the Trump cabinet if chosen. Mr. Manchin has experience in both realms, serving on the Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the Armed Services Committee. His office didn’t respond to a request for comment. And U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R., Calif.) said in an interview Sunday he is talking to Trump transition officials about the secretary of state job. He said he has pitched to them an arrangement in which he would serve in the top job and a deputy would be John Bolton, a former ambassador to the United Nations. Mr. Bolton—who also is in the running for the secretary of state post—held a private meeting with the president-elect Friday at Trump Tower. Kellyanne Conway, a senior Trump adviser, told reporters Sunday: “It is true that he’s broadened the search…He’s very fortunate to have interest among serious men and women who, all of whom need to understand that their first responsibility as secretary of state would be to implement and adhere to the president-elect’s America First foreign policy, if you will, his view of the world.” A final decision could come by week’s end, the transition adviser said. Secretary of state is the most prominent missing piece in a national security team that is quickly taking shape. At a rally in Cincinnati last week, Mr. Trump announced he selected retired Gen. James Mattis to head the Pentagon as defense secretary. He has tapped another retired general, Michael Flynn, to serve as his national security adviser. Normally an opaque process, the hunt for the next secretary of state has played out in an unusually public fashion. Another top candidate is 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who clashed bitterly with Mr. Trump during the GOP primaries this year. Last Tuesday, Mr. Trump had dinner with Mr. Romney in Manhattan. Setting aside the campaign hostilities and perhaps trying to make amends with Mr. Trump’s supporters, Mr. Romney told reporters afterward that he was “impressed” with the transition effort. Other candidates for the job are former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, one of Mr. Trump’s most loyal campaign supporters; U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R., Tenn.), the Foreign Relations Committee chairman, who also met with Mr. Trump in New York on Tuesday; and retired Gen. David Petraeus, director of the Central Intelligence Agency in the Obama administration. Gen. Petraeus pleaded guilty in 2015 to a misdemeanor charge of mishandling classified material in a case involving his biographer, with whom he said he had an extramarital affair. He addressed his legal troubles in an appearance Sunday on ABC, saying, “I made a mistake. I have again acknowledged it. Folks will have to factor that in and determine whether that is indeed disqualifying or not.” One of the questions Mr. Trump faces is whether he wants a trifecta of generals as his core national security team. That would be the upshot if he picks Mr. Petraeus. Coming to the presidency with no foreign policy or government experience, Mr. Trump could rely more heavily on his national security team than his predecessors. So far he has chosen to largely freestyle his engagement with foreign leaders, rather than rely on the State Department’s guidance for such conversations. Mr. Trump sent shock waves through the diplomatic community Friday when he spoke with President Tsai Ing-wen of Taiwan, the first conversation between a U.S. president-elect, or president, and the leader of Taiwan since 1979. The conversation ran against Beijing’s efforts to block formal U.S. relations with the island off China’s coast, which it has long considered a Chinese territory and not a sovereign nation. Choosing a secretary of state with scant foreign policy background, such as Exxon’s Mr. Tillerson, could further unnerve government officials serving in an institution that functions on strict protocols. Mr. Trump also faces a decision on whether he wants a more hawkish foreign policy or one favoring diplomacy over military engagement. During the campaign, he signaled that he wants a military posture that is less interventionist, eschewing “nation-building” and “regime-change.” Yet he has vowed to intensify military action against Islamic State. “The balance of personalities in the [White House] Situation Room is really important. It’s one of the few places where all the parts of government come together to shape foreign policy and presidential decision making,” said Phil Carter, director of the Military, Veterans and Society Program at the Center for a New American Security, a bipartisan think tank. “They have to bring their personalities and their judgment to the table,” Mr. Carter said. “Who you have in that room and in that decision process can have a big impact.” Mr. Tillerson, 64 years old, grew up in Texas and joined Exxon in 1975. He leads a company with operations in more than 50 countries, from Canada to Papua New Guinea, that often exerts itself abroad with the sweep of a sovereign nation. He is slated to retire next year and Exxon has identified Darren Woods as a successor. As Exxon’s CEO since 2006, Mr. Tillerson could leverage existing relationships with numerous world leaders, including Russia’s Vladimir Putin, with whom he has had dealings for more than a decade. Mr. Tillerson’s close ties to the company, including tens of millions of dollars of Exxon shares that will become available to him in the coming decade, could complicate his efforts to lift sanctions or intervene in trade disputes where Exxon has a financial interest. It would be almost impossible for him to recuse himself from working with all the countries in which Exxon operates or markets products. Mr. Tillerson’s corporate pedigree would make him an unconventional choice, foreign policy analysts said. Jon Alterman, a Middle East expert at the nonpartisan Center for Strategic and International Studies, noted that former Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was a lawyer at a top New York City firm, but not a CEO, and that George Shultz was president of Bechtel Corp., but also served in government. “Both are far, far, far smaller companies than Exxon Mobil,” Mr. Alterman said. “I can’t think of a CEO with no government experience becoming secretary of state.” As head of a company with a massive global footprint, Mr. Tillerson, though, is no stranger to foreign leaders. As Exxon’s chief executive, he has spoken against sanctions on Russia, where the company in 2012 signed a 3.2 billion deal that Mr. Putin said could eventually reach 500 billion in investments. “We always encourage the people who are making those decisions to consider the very broad collateral damage of who are they really harming with sanctions,” Mr. Tillerson said at the company’s annual meeting in May 2014. Mr. Tillerson has some of the closest ties among U.S. CEOs to Mr. Putin and Russia, with his work there dating back to when Mr. Putin rose to power after Boris Yeltsin’s resignation. The 2012 deal gave Exxon access to prized arctic resources. Later that year, the Kremlin bestowed the country’s Order of Friendship on the American businessman. Mr. Tillerson supported a Trump rival in the Republican primaries: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. He gave the maximum 2,700 to the Bush campaign, and another 5,000 to the Right to Rise, the super PAC that backed Mr. Bush. He didn’t make a contribution to Mr. Trump’s campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political giving. —Bradley Olson and James V.

Context: Some of the earliest recorded observations ever made through a telescope, Galileo's drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, contain plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune. On both occasions, Galileo seems to have mistaken Neptune for a fixed star when it appeared close—in conjunction—to Jupiter in the night sky; hence, he is not credited with Neptune's discovery. At his first observation in December 1612, Neptune was almost stationary in the sky because it had just turned retrograde that day. This apparent backward motion is created when Earth's orbit takes it past an outer planet. Because Neptune was only beginning its yearly retrograde cycle, the motion of the planet was far too slight to be detected with Galileo's small telescope. In July 2009, University of Melbourne physicist David Jamieson announced new evidence suggesting that Galileo was at least aware that the 'star' he had observed had moved relative to the fixed stars. The answer to this question is:","output":"Galileo recorded Neptune's location in his drawings on 28 December 1612 and 27 January 1613, where he plotted points that match up with what is now known to be the position of Neptune.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Who owns a frozen food depot?, using the article: Phillip Bellamy, a leading barrister, tells his wife, psychiatrist Anne Dyson, about his most recent case defending a young man, Harry Jukes, who has apparently shot a policeman on a country road and been found by police still holding the gun. Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her. Harry's story is that he took a Bentley Continental car to impress a girl but when she went off with another boy decided to take the car for a spin before dumping it. Swerving to avoid another car he burst a tyre but could not find any tools in the boot to change the wheel. He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help. He flagged down a lorry to ask to borrow a jack. The lorry stopped but the passenger immediately produced a gun and shot the policeman. Harry managed to grab the gun off the killer as the lorry drove away. Shortly after, a police car arrived and Harry was arrested. Anne believes Harry's story and tries to persuade Bellamy of Harry's innocence. She interviews Harry several times and begins to follow up some aspects of his story. She visits the gang that Harry hung out with in a café in Battersea and they agree to help her by trying to find the couple in the parked car. She also visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and finds his account unconvincing. One of the boys from the cafe agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot to do some investigating there., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"Based on the article provided, it isn't explicitly mentioned who owns the frozen food depot. However, since Anne visits Taplow, the man whose car was stolen, several times and discovers that his account is unconvincing, and one of the boys from the café agrees to take a job at Taplow's frozen food depot, it can be reasonably inferred that Taplow is likely the owner of the frozen food depot. The story revolves primarily around the investigation of Harry Jukes' case and his alleged shooting of a policeman. Anne Dyson becomes involved due to her background in working with troubled young people and her doubt about the police evidence. Anne's exploration leads her to Taplow, the man whose Bentley Continental was stolen by Harry. During her interactions with Taplow and her inquiries into his frozen food depot, it becomes increasingly clear that there are unanswered questions and potential connections to the broader story of Harry's case. Although the owner of the frozen food depot is not the primary focus of the article, it is from the context and connections drawn by Anne that we can assume Taplow is the likely owner. Further investigations into his background, associations, and potential involvement in Harry's case could reveal more information and help determine the truth behind the events in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Check for rash splotches if a contaminated pet or item touched you. Watch for blisters and swelling around the affected area. Article:","output":"Title: Recognizing the Telltale Signs of Poison Ivy Exposure: The Itchy Red Rash Line and Beyond Introduction Poison ivy, scientifically known as Toxicodendron radicans, is a widespread plant across North America known for causing skin irritation when touched. It is crucial for everyone, especially those who enjoy spending time outdoors, to be able to identify the symptoms of poison ivy exposure. This is to ensure that proper measures can be taken to prevent severe irritation and help facilitate a swift recovery. This article will discuss the signs you should look for after coming into contact with poison ivy, including an itchy, red rash line, splotches, blisters, and swelling. The Itchy Red Rash Line One of the primary indicators that you have come into contact with poison ivy is the telltale itchy, red rash line that typically appears and becomes more noticeable within 24-48 hours of exposure. This rash may begin as individual patches or streaks and often becomes more continuous, linear, and raised as time passes. As your body reacts to the exposure, the rash will often develop into an extremely itchy, inflamed, and uncomfortable line. Although the line's appearance and intensity may vary from person to person, this sign should not be ignored, as it is a strong indication that the individual has come into contact with poison ivy or other similar toxic plants. Splotches and Contamination from Pets or Items Another essential sign to look for is rash splotches caused by indirect contact with the poisonous plant. If you have held a contaminated object or touched a pet that has come into contact with poison ivy, you may develop a rash in the form of splotches. These splotches may be smaller and more localized than the rash line mentioned earlier, but they should not be underestimated as they can also be incredibly itchy and uncomfortable. To minimize exposure risk, it is essential to clean your pets and objects after they have been in areas where poison ivy is present. Blisters and Swelling Around the Affected Area Besides the itchy rash line and splotches, your skin can also develop blisters if you come into contact with poison ivy. These blisters may form as your body's immune response to the exposure and can range from small to large in size. Additionally, they can fill with fluid and may rupture, increasing the chance of infection and delaying the healing process. Swelling around the affected area is also a common symptom of poison ivy exposure. This swelling can be painful, and depending on the location, it could limit the movement of your joint and hinder daily activities. Swelling is another indication that your body is responding to the irritant and trying to rid itself of the harmful substance. Conclusion Recognizing the signs of poison ivy exposure, such as itchy red rash lines, splotches from contaminated pets or items, blisters, and swelling, is vital for anyone who enjoys spending time outdoors. Being aware of these symptoms will allow you to take prompt action in minimizing further discomfort and facilitating a quicker recovery. If you suspect you have come into contact with poison ivy, consult a healthcare professional for advice on how to treat the affected area effectively. Additionally, educate yourself on how to avoid poison ivy and other similar plants while spending time outdoors to decrease your risk of exposure in the future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 1: Assessing the occasion Firstly, they considered the type of event they were attending. It was an informal gathering at a local lounge, where friends would catch up and enjoy some drinks. Kenneth expressed his desire to make a good impression, while Christopher wanted to maintain a laid-back vibe. Step 2: Sharing personal style preferences Kenneth explained his love for suits and ties, as they made him feel confident and sophisticated. Christopher, on the other hand, preferred wearing jeans and t-shirts, believing that comfort was essential for him to enjoy the night. Step 3: Considering each other's feelings Both individuals acknowledged the importance of feeling comfortable in their outfits. Kenneth recognized that Christopher might feel out of place in formal wear, and Christopher understood that Kenneth wanted to dress up to boost his confidence. Step 4: Finding a middle ground Taking into account both personal preferences and the occasion, they settled on a compromise: semi-formal attire. This way, Kenneth could still wear a stylish blazer and dress pants, while Christopher would don a button-up shirt paired with his favorite jeans. Step 5: Finalizing the outfits and accessorizing Once the middle ground was established, they selected their outfits and chose complementary accessories. Kenneth opted for a navy blazer, crisp white shirt, and tailored dress pants, accessorized with a pocket square and a stylish watch. Christopher picked out a chambray button-up shirt, dark-wash jeans, and polished his casual look with a brown leather belt and some comfortable dress shoes.

Which group would less likely engage in visually intensive works, group A or group B?  David is a doctor who works for the public health department. After analyzing health data for his city, he found twenty percent of the population have myopia. He categorized them as group A. Another eighty percent didn't have myopia. He put them in group B. He now needs to devise a plan on how to tackle myopia in his city.  Hint: Generally, nearsightedness first occurs in school-age children. There is some evidence that myopia is inherited. If one or both of your parents need glasses, there is an increased chance that you will too. Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Answer:","output":"Group B would be less likely to engage in visually intensive works. This is because group A consists of individuals who already have myopia, and as the hint suggests, nearsightedness is often associated with spending a lot of time on visually intensive activities such as reading, working on a computer, or doing other close visual work. In contrast, group B does not have myopia, suggesting that they are likely to have lower engagement in visually intensive works."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Set in Albuquerque, the series followed the life of Walter White (Bryan Cranston), a high school chemistry teacher who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at the beginning of the first series. In order to secure his family's future before he dies, he turned to a life of crime, making and selling methamphetamine. Reviews in the UK and US have been generally favourable - but reveal several key plot points. Walt may have ruined his own family and the lives of several others. And yet, in that climactic final half hour, he somehow won back a measure of both sympathy and respect - not least by surrendering the pretence that he'd done it all for his family. \\"I did it for me,\\" he told Skyler, at last. \\"I liked it. I was good at it.\\" Of course, the thing he was good at was not carpentry, nor teaching - though I seem to recall he wasn't too shabby at that - but cooking meth and whacking folks. So in the end, he got what he deserved. Read the full review here Perhaps the best thing about the finale of Breaking Bad is that it actually ended. So many shows, notably The Sopranos and Lost, have gone dark without anything approaching finality. Here, the writers were so determined to not leave unfinished business that the last episode was called Felina, an anagram of finale. And almost every loose end was tied. In some cases, a little too tightly, and in others, not quite as much. Breaking Bad brilliantly tracked Walt's transformation from teacher to criminal mastermind. But it's still a mystery why that talented chemist turned his back on fame and fortune and became a humble high school chemistry teacher. Read the full review here Written and filmed at a time when Breaking Bad was already a phenomenon, this finale has been under a huge amount of pressure from a fan base that's taken ownership of the story in a way that few TV shows manage. But fear not, they've pulled it off marvellously. In a single episode, they've packed in all of those disparate ingredients that have made Breaking Bad such a joy. There's action, violence and tension, but also humour, warmth and wonderfully quiet moments that carry so much weight. Read the full review here The final episode of Breaking Bad... had a lot of business to take care of in a short time. [It] was a kind of machine gun of narrative, knocking down all of those questions with auto-fire efficiency. (Well, almost all.) It was not flashy. It wasn't structurally ambitious, in the way other Breaking Bad episodes have been. It was not, in most respects, surprising. And that's OK. Because what Felina was - as effective, satisfying series finales are - was true. It was true to the five seasons that preceded it, true to Walter White's obsessions and pride, and true to what Breaking Bad is at heart: A Western. As in the song El Paso, the protagonist (I'm not going to say hero) rode back to town, faced his enemies, said his goodbyes, and died. A Western is meant to go out with a bang, and Breaking Bad went out with about 40 of them per second (plus a dose of ricin). Read the full review here Like all big-talker shows that bring their heavy cargo in for a rough and breathlessly observed landing, Breaking Bad didn't quite leave itself enough runway to satisfactorily end some of its better story lines, especially once the chronology gap closed up between the flash-forwards from last year's episodes and Sunday night's conclusion. One could easily argue that there was just too much left to do in this one episode. As a critic, I have to finally face the fact that my favourite series (possibly ever - I'd have to think long and hard about that) is now gone. And when trying to figure out why this show worked so well, so deeply for me, I keep coming back to one simple and not terribly profound idea: Breaking Bad was original. Read the full review here Not only did Vince Gilligan's five-season, hyper-violent prose poem to midlife male frustration tie up virtually every loose end in sight, it contained the Holy Grail of all storytelling: an Actual Moment of Truth. And not just this particular story's truth, but one that extended to the beloved and bloated genre Gilligan both elevated and mocked. \\"I did it for me. I liked it. I was good at it. And I was really ... I was alive.\\" The strongest moments of the final season came as Walt realised that great truism so often underscored in stories like his: Once you introduce evil into your life, you cannot control it.  In the end, though, Walter White was triumphant. His money would go to his children, his enemies were dead, his foster son freed. Read the full review here As final episodes go, this delivered everything that has been great about Breaking Bad. It had tension, pathos, brutality, emotion, humour, jaw-dropping shocks - but also resolution. Like so much of Felina, the end was satisfying because of its simplicity. Really, we've known from the start how it would end. Walt's going to die. A show that sentences its lead character to death in the first episode is duty bound to deliver that promise by the end. Read the full review here In today's hyper-caffeinated age, precious little lives up to its hype. But the Breaking Bad finale - perhaps appropriately - got the chemistry just right... Sunday's finale made eminently clear, this was a show whose narrative fearlessness was only matched by its boundless creativity and unpredictability. The 75-minute finale written and directed by (Vince) Gilligan perfectly capped a final arc that was all forward momentum, with barely an ounce of fat on it, and almost nary a false note. Read the full review here In a stunning 75-minute extended finale, Vince Gilligan brought Breaking Bad to a supremely fitting close, tying up all the loose ends in his modern classic AMC series and killing off his now iconic anti-hero Walter White. And he did so in a way that confirmed Bad's status as one of TV's greatest series - and star Bryan Cranston as one of America's best actors. Tense, witty, violent, oddly tender and, in its own strange way, as close to a \\"happy\\" ending as a story this dark could hope, this last episode brought the story to a straightforward, definitive conclusion, without the spirituality of Lost or the ambiguity of Sopranos. Read the full review here There was a lot of closure in Breaking Bad. You can say that Gilligan gave most of the viewers what they wanted (and, impressively, he did that by staying true to himself and the story without selling out or becoming unrecognisably saccharine as he tied the bow). This finale certainly wrapped up things - mostly - in a bow. It had similar strains to the shots that The Wire used and was nearly as effectively tidy as Six Feet Under was in spelling out the fate of those involved. More than anything I love a creator's ability to end the story as he or she wishes. That doesn't make every decision acceptable. The finale to Dexter was an embarrassing, ham-fisted disaster. But the finale to Breaking Bad - even if it wasn't what I'd hoped would happen - was more than enough to thrill me and make me appreciate five seasons and six years of brilliant work. What an outstanding achievement.

What was surprising, though — or at least surprising to Wallace — was that he made it in during his first year of eligibility. Of the others, Thomas and Baker had been on the list of finalists since the inaugural class of 2010, with Owens and Wood first nominated for the 2012 class. But 2013 is Wallace’s first year of eligibility and he made it in the first time. “All I can tell you is I’m glad to get in, and I didn’t expect to get in in the first round,” said Wallace. “There’s huge names — I honestly didn’t.” Wallace was so wound up before the event he said he left the NASCAR Hall briefly prior to the announcement. “I left a little while ago and I went down to the Ritz-Carlton and had a glass of wine just to calm down, ‘cause I didn’t know what I was going to say.” Understandably, Wallace was emotional about being selected. “I’m totally humbled, I really am,” he said. “I’m blowed away. I’m so happy, it’s unreal. ... I almost feel like Jesse James. I felt like I robbed a bank and pulled off with something, ‘cause there’s so many heroes out there that need to get in.” Asked how surprised he was by the honor, Wallace said, “I was numb. I was just, like, looking and going ‘What?’ Usually, if you think you’re going to get in, your name is going to get read last. But they read my name third and I went, ‘What?’ That really was a surprise.” All in all, it was a huge night for Wallace. “I’m happy,” he said. “I’m so happy. I’m going to lay in bed tonight and just stare at the ceiling and just go, ‘Are you awake? Is this real?’” Tom Jensen is the Editor in Chief of SPEED.com, Senior NASCAR Editor at RACER and a contributing Editor for TruckSeries.com. You can follow him online at twitter.com/tomjensen100. Summary:","output":"In a surprising turn during the election day, Rusty Wallace, the 1989 Sprint Cup champion, was voted into the NASCAR Hall of Fame, joining Herb Thomas, Leonard Wood, Cotton Owens, and Buck Baker in the 2013 class. Wallace, who was in his first year of eligibility, ranked ninth all time with his 55 Cup race victories.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Two roommates, Karen and Kelly, have decided to adopt a pet for their apartment. They are debating between getting a dog or a cat when they decide to flip a coin since they can't agree. The coin comes up tails so they are getting a cat. Unbeknownst to Karen, she is allergic to cats. Kelly has no allergies to animals, but Karen has never lived with cats before so she isn't aware that she is allergic to them.  Who will have a stuffy nose more often?  Hint: An allergy is a disease in which the immune system makes an inflammatory response to a harmless antigen . Any antigen that causes an allergy is called an allergen. Allergens may be inhaled or ingested, or they may come into contact with the skin. Two common causes of allergies are shown in Figure below . Inhaling ragweed pollen may cause coughing and sneezing. Skin contact with oils in poison ivy may cause an itchy rash. Other common causes of allergies include dust mites, mold, animal dander, insect stings, latex, and certain food and medications. Symptoms of a common allergy such as pollen can include sneezing, a runny nose, nasal congestion and itchy, watery eyes. The answer is:","output":"Karen will have a stuffy nose more often since she is allergic to cats. Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to a harmless substance (allergen), such as cat dander, as if it were harmful. In Karen's case, living with a cat will expose her to cat allergens, which will trigger an inflammatory response in her body, causing allergy symptoms like a stuffy nose, sneezing, or itchy eyes. On the other hand, Kelly has no allergies to animals, so she is not likely to experience a stuffy nose or any other allergy-related symptoms due to the presence of a cat in the apartment. In this situation, Karen would be advised to visit an allergist to confirm her allergy and discuss potential treatments or alternatives to living with a cat, such as adopting a hypoallergenic pet if possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Their marriage is not helped by Clara's opinionated mother living with them in their small one bedroom apartment. However, Clara does wish that their life would be a little more exciting as Andrew said on their honeymoon that their married life would be, least of all by Andrew acknowledging their latest wedding anniversary, their fifth.

A: Answer:","output":"Veins are the blood vessels that carry deoxygenated blood back to the heart. The primary function of veins is to transport deoxygenated blood from various parts of the body back to the heart so that it can be reoxygenated and circulated again. Veins are a critical component of the cardiovascular system, working in conjunction with the heart, arteries, and capillaries to ensure proper blood circulation throughout the body. Veins are distinct from arteries in their structure and function. Arteries have thicker, more muscular walls and carry oxygenated blood away from the heart, while veins have thinner walls and carry deoxygenated blood. Veins also contain one-way valves that prevent the backflow of blood, ensuring that deoxygenated blood moves in the correct direction towards the heart. There are three primary types of veins: 1. Superficial veins These veins are located just beneath the skin's surface and are often visible, particularly when they dilate or become varicose. They help collect deoxygenated blood from the capillaries in the skin and transport it to deep veins. 2. Deep veins As the name suggests, deep veins are found deep within the body, usually parallel to arteries. They carry the majority of the blood being returned to the heart and are not usually visible. Deep veins are often located within the muscles, which assist in blood flow by contracting and applying pressure to the veins. 3. Pulmonary veins These veins are unique as they carry oxygenated blood from the lungs back to the heart. This is different from other veins in the body as they typically carry deoxygenated blood. The pulmonary veins play an essential role in the pulmonary circulation, which is responsible for oxygenating the blood. The process of returning deoxygenated blood to the heart begins at the capillaries, where oxygen and nutrients are exchanged between the blood and the body's tissues. The deoxygenated blood then flows into the small venules, which merge to form larger veins. This blood eventually makes its way to the largest veins in the body, such as the superior and inferior vena cava, which return the blood to the heart. From there, the blood is pumped to the lungs to become oxygenated once again. In conclusion, veins play a vital role in the circulatory system by carrying deoxygenated blood (with the exception of pulmonary veins carrying oxygenated blood from the lungs) from various parts of the body back to the heart. The specific structure and function of veins, including their thinner walls and one-way valves, facilitate this crucial process and help maintain proper blood circulation throughout the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: I'm sure many of you have seen Star Wars, Jurassic Park, Multiplicity, or many of the other movies that describe cloning. Most of what you see in these movies is false. What you don't know is that cloning could be dangerous, to the clone and to our society as a whole. I think human cloning is wrong mainly for four reasons. What about identity? Humans are promised the right to their own personalities. What would happen if we ignore those rights by giving them someone else's genetic identity? True, Cloning may prevent people from possessing their identities. Also, these is a large power struggle here. Cloning means a degree of power and controls over another person's physical identity and that ignores their rights and their only personalities. The person doing the cloning would have more power than any parent would have. Cloning would also deal with killing embryos  . You might not have known, but Dolly, the sheep that was cloned in 1996, was one of over 200 sheep embryos and hers was the only embryo that survived. The rest died or were thrown away. Imagine if the failure rate was that high when we started to clone humans. cloning means running the risk of wasting too much effort Cloning someone, at this present time, would be extremely dangerous to the birth mother and the clone. In studies done on cows, 4 out of 12 birth mothers died. There is a very high failure rate, which is shown in the cloning of Dolly. Even if you had a few good embryos, failures have been noticeable in animal tests. So, should we work ahead in the world of cloning? I say no. the risks are greater than the benefits. It's dangerous to the clone and to the birth mother. We would be killing human lives in the process. It would also be a violation  of the clone's right to its own genetic identity and personality.

If I tell you that Changes in the DNA information are essential for evolution to occur, and ask you the question \\"what is essential for evolution to occur?\\", is the correct answer \\"human interference\\"? Answer:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"human interference.\\" It is true that changes in the DNA information, or genetic variations, are essential for evolution to occur. In fact, they form the basis of genetic diversity, which allows species to adapt to varying environmental conditions and to develop new traits and characteristics over time. While human interference can impact evolution in particular instances, it is not essential for evolution to occur. Evolution is a natural process that occurs through the mechanisms of mutation, gene flow, genetic drift, and natural selection. Let's examine these elements in more detail: 1. Mutations: Mutations are random changes in an organism's genetic material (DNA). They can introduce novel genetic variations and are the source of new genetic information. Some mutations may be harmful, while others may have little to no impact, and some may even be beneficial to the organism. Over time, mutations with a favorable impact are more likely to be passed on to future generations. 2. Gene flow: When individuals from different populations of the same species interbreed, they exchange genetic material, leading to the spread of new genetic variations among populations. This gene flow can help maintain genetic diversity within species and facilitate the process of adaptation to different environments. 3. Genetic drift: This mechanism represents the random fluctuations of gene frequencies within populations. Genetic drift can lead to the loss of genetic variation in small populations, which can hinder evolution. Yet, in some cases, it may promote the fixation of unique genetic variations within isolated populations, driving the emergence of distinct subspecies or species. 4. Natural selection: Arguably the most critical factor in the evolutionary process, natural selection refers to the differential survival and reproduction of organisms based on their inherited genetic traits. Those with traits better suited to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce; consequently, these advantageous genetic traits become more prevalent in subsequent generations. While human interference in the context of anthropogenic pressures like pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction can indeed impact, both positively and negatively, the process of evolution, it is not inherently necessary for evolution to take place. Evolution is an inherent part of life that has driven the diversification and adaptation of species for billions of years, long before human civilization ever emerged. In conclusion, while human interference can produce effects on evolutionary processes, it is not essential for evolution to occur. The essential factors for evolution to occur are instead genetic variation (through mechanisms like mutations, gene flow, and genetic drift) and natural selection acting upon these variations over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The high reward attracted so many people, but in the nature, besides golden, the marigold is brown, and it is not easy to get the white one. So after they were excited for a time, many people had forgotten the announcement. One normal day after 20 years, the college received a letter and 100 seeds of pure white marigold. It turned out to be an old woman of over 70 years old. Some experts in the college doubted it , but in order not to let her down, those seeds finally took root  in the earth. The miracle appeared after one year: the field was covered by pure white marigold. Therefore, the old woman who was always unknown to the public became a new _ . The old woman was a flower-lover. When she read the announcement 20 years ago, she got very excited like others. But her right children were totally against her decision. After all, a woman who never knew the seed genetics  couldn't complete what the experts could never do, so her thought was only a day dream. Still, the old woman didn't change her mind and went on working. She planted some of the most common seeds and took good care of them.

Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless.  and a hint : Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate.

The 62-year-old has previously reported smashed windows, her grass being poisoned and animal carcasses being left on her doorstep.","output":"Title: Joyce Faulkner's Ordeal Continues: Vandalism Forces her to Seek Shelter Elsewhere Introduction In yet another unnerving turn of events, 62-year-old Joyce Faulkner has been forced to stay with friends after vandals targeted her house once again. The Davenport residence, which has been a victim to various acts of vandalism within the last two years, experienced further damage recently as the roof tiles were smashed, leaving the homeowner in distress. Step 1: Discuss the present situation - smashed roof tiles The latest incident occurred only a few days ago, when unknown assailants shattered the roof tiles of the Davenport house, causing considerable damage to the property. The act of vandalism left Joyce Faulkner feeling vulnerable and necessitated her to seek shelter with friends until the roof could be repaired.  Step 2: Elaborate on the background - previous incidents at the Davenport house Unfortunately, this was not the first time Joyce has faced such a traumatic experience. Over the past two years, she has had to endure a string of disturbing incidents, each seemingly more distressing than the last. Alarmed by the escalating nature of these events, Joyce has turned to the local authorities for help, but the perpetrators have yet to be apprehended. Step 3: Describe specific incidents Joyce has reported to the police Some of the chilling incidents that Joyce has reported to the police since this ordeal began include having the windows of her home smashed. In a separate act of cruelty, her lawn was sabotaged with a poisonous substance, leaving her once pristine grass destroyed. Additionally, horrifying instances of animal carcasses being left on her doorstep have only added to the traumatic experience that she has been going through. Step 4: Reflect on the emotional impact on the homeowner For Joyce Faulkner, the recurring acts of vandalism have not only caused damage to her property and a feeling of violation, but they have also mentally and emotionally scarred her. Having forced her to find temporary shelter and support elsewhere due to the damage to her home, the incident continues to devastate her sense of security and peace. Step 5: Concluding thoughts The persistent targeting of Joyce Faulkner's Davenport residence is a harrowing reminder of the malevolence that exists in today's society. It is our collective responsibility to condemn such acts and to extend our greatest sympathies and support to those who fall victim to them. We can only hope for a swift resolution, with the perpetrators brought to justice and for the assurance of Joyce's safety in her own home. In conclusion, in the face of ongoing incidents at her Davenport house, Joyce, a 62-year-old woman, is now being forced into temporary stays with her friends. This series of vandalism acts have left her with shattered windows, poisoned grass, and animal carcasses on her doorstep. It is vital that the community and authorities work together to ensure her safety and bring an end to this distressing situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize the following: If you choose a title that sounds like it belongs in one genre while the actual content of the story belongs in another, you’ll not only confuse potential readers, you may alienate them. For example, if your title sounds distinctly fantasy-esque, like “The Dragon of the Old Tower,” but the story is in fact about modern-day brokers on Wall Street, you’ll alienate those who pick up your story looking for fantasy and you’ll miss entirely those looking for a story about something modern or about the world of elite finance, etc. In the majority of cases, titles that are brief but impactful are more successful than those that are long and difficult to remember. For example, “A Man Discovers the Perils of a Solo Trek Through the Yukon” is likely less compelling to potential readers than “To Build a Fire,” which is shorter and more imaginative. Titles that use poetic language, vivid imagery, or a bit of mystery tend to be alluring to potential readers.  Poetic language in a title, like “A Rose for Emily” or Gone with the Wind, draws readers with an elegant turn of phrase that promises an equally poetic story or writing style. Titles that evoke vivid imagery appeal to readers because they conjure something tangible and meaningful. A title like Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil, though long, creates an immediate and vivid image that conjures an idea of a battle between good and evil.  Imbuing your title with a bit of mystery can also draw readers in. A title like Something Wicked This Way Comes (also an allusion from Macbeth) or “The Black Cat” give just enough information to raise questions that will pull the reader into the story. Though alliteration--the repetition of successive sounds at the beginning of words--can make a title catchier or more memorable, it can also make it sound trite or hokey if not done well.  Subtle alliteration, like I Capture the Castle or The Count of Monte Cristo, can add appeal to a title. Obvious or forced alliteration, on the other hand--like \\"The Guileless Guide of Gullible Gus\\" or \\"The Especially Exciting Endeavors of Elanor Ellis\\"--can easily dissuade a potential reader from picking up your story.","output":"Choosing a title that accurately reflects the genre of your story is crucial to avoid confusing or alienating readers. Successful titles tend to be brief, impactful, and use poetic language, vivid imagery, or mystery to allure potential readers. While subtle alliteration can add appeal, obvious or forced alliteration may deter readers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

Fangio's grandfather, Giuseppe Fangio, emigrated to Buenos Aires from Italy in 1887. Giuseppe managed to buy his own farm near Balcarce within three years by making charcoal from tree branches. His father, Loreto, emigrated to Argentina from the small central Italian town of Castiglione Messer Marino in the Chieti province of the Abruzzo region. His mother, Herminia Deramo, was from Tornareccio, slightly to the north. The Batista Dictatorship of Cuba established the non-Formula One Cuban Grand Prix in 1957. Fangio won the 1957 event, and had set fastest times during practice for the 1958 race. On 23 February 1958, two unmasked gunmen of Fidel Castro's 26th of July Movement entered the Hotel Lincoln in Havana and kidnapped Fangio at gunpoint. The motive was simple: By capturing the biggest name in motorsport the rebels were showing up the government and attracting worldwide publicity to their cause. But despite the shocking news spreading across the globe, President Batista would not be outdone and ordered the race to continue as usual while a crack team of police hunted down the kidnappers. They set up roadblocks at intersections, and guards were assigned to private and commercial airports and to all competing drivers.  Fangio was taken to three separate houses. His captors allowed him to listen to the race via radio, bringing a television for him to witness reports of a disastrous crash after the race concluded. In the third house, Fangio was allowed his own bedroom but became convinced that a guard was standing outside of the bedroom door at all hours. The captors talked about their revolutionary programme which Fangio had not wished to speak about as he did not have an interest in politics. Convinced that he was not in danger he went on to develop a case of Stockholm Syndrome, admitting afterwards that he sympathised with his captors' actions: \\"Well, this is one more adventure. If what the rebels did was in a good cause, then I, as an Argentine, accept it.\\" Fangio was released after 29 hours and he remained a good friend of his captors afterwards.  The captors motives were to force the cancellation of the race in an attempt to embarrass the Batista regime. After Fangio was handed over to the Argentine embassy soon after the race, many Cubans were convinced that Batista was losing his power because he failed to track the captors down. The Cuban Revolution concluded in January 1959, cancelling the 1959 Cuban Grand Prix. The Fangio kidnapping was dramatized in a 1999 Argentine film directed by Alberto Lecchi, Operacion Fangio.

U.S. airlines are world-beaters when it comes to finding creative ways to boost baggage fees, onboard food sales and other revenues that aren't rolled into airfares, financial data show.United, American and Delta led global carriers in collecting ancillary revenues in 2009, according to a new study by airline consultancy IdeaWorks and Amadeus, a giant clearinghouse for airline transactions.Airlines worldwide collected 13.5 billion in 2009, a 43 percent jump from 2008 totals, according to the study of financial filings made by 96 airlines.Chicago-based United Airlines generated the greatest fee income of any carrier in the world: 1.9 billion in ancillary revenues last year, the study found. That's about double the 963 million in fees pocketed by Australia's Qantas Airways , the highest-ranking overseas carrier in the study.The proliferation of checked bag fees in the U.S. and much of Europe accounted for the startling jump in this source of airline revenue, said Jay Sorensen, president of Wisconsin -based IdeaWorks.Every major U.S. carrier except Southwest Airlines rolled out luggage fees during 2008 in an effort to boost revenues to offset skyrocketing oil prices and a later collapse in business travel that followed Wall Street's historic meltdown.Although most large airlines are finally profitable for the first time in three years, they aren't inclined to rescind the controversial charges.In fact, baggage fees are expected to spread around the world. \\"The fees are here to stay,\\" Sorensen said.United President John Tague caused a stir during the carrier's earnings call Tuesday, when he suggested the carrier could reap greater income from passenger fees.\\"I don't think we're very far along, frankly,\\" Tague said. \\"That might be surprising to people given where we are in terms of ancillary revenue generation.\\"Only about 40 percent of United passengers pay to check bags, generating 350 million to 450 million annually for the nation's third-largest carrier. But Tague said United's annual baggage revenues could top 1 billion over time, as carriers in regions like Asia adopt similar charges.\\"It appears that the trend is firmly in place, and that over time more and more bags will be assessed fees,\\" he added.Bags aren't the only area where airlines are striking gold.Carriers gain money through customers who join their affinity card programs, and also are commanding greater commissions on hotel rooms and rental-car services packaged along with airfares on their Web sites. They're also experimenting with new, upgraded onboard meals. And they're selling passengers one-day access to priority security lines and lounges once reserved for first-class customers.The fee frenzy has caught the attention of lawmakers such as Rep. James Oberstar, D-Minn., and prompted the Transportation Department to propose rules making airline pricing and fees more transparent so that passengers don't suffer sticker shock when costs are added up.Though the fees annoy some travelers who long for the days when airlines provided full service at no added cost, the new environment could be a boon for deal-seekers, Sorensen said.\\"In the future, if the consumer wants to squeeze travel costs down to next to nothing, he or she will buy online, maybe pay with a debit card, won't have an assigned seat, bring a snack from home and will have a carry-on,\\" he predicted. \\"Anyone who wants a different experience will pay more.\\" ||||| Continental Airlines announced second quarter earnings of 233 million this morning, rounding out a strong earnings season for airline companies.

It is rumored that, deep within the wilderness, an ancient species known as the Tasmanian Tiger is alive and breeding. Yet, modern science refuses to believe such a creature now exists, since no witnesses have ever been able to prove it. That is, until zoology student Nina (Mirrah Foulkes), claims she can breach Tasmania's impenetrable forests and confirm the tigers' existence. Driving Nina's quest is one critical piece of proof: a photo of a paw print taken by her sister just before she met with a fatal accident eight years before.In the early 19th century, the murderous convict Alexander Pearce (aka \\"The Pieman\\") had broken out of prison twice, and each time he had killed and eaten his fellow escapees. But what Nina doesn't know is that, before he was hung for cannibalism in 1824, he'd spawned a blood line who inherited his taste for human flesh. Soon, Nina and her friends discover that in the wild, as one species may have died out, another has thrived---in the form of the Pieman's descendants. When she sets out with her partner, Matt (Leigh Whannell), his old mate, Jack (Nathan Phillips), and his girlfriend, Rebecca (Melanie Vallejo), their little expedition encounters the island's reigning breed, but one who stands on two legs, not four. The Pieman clan has survived, and their need to feed and breed turns Nina, Matt, Jack and Rebecca into this island's next endangered species.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: In what year did the band member who was depressed attempt to announce a break up of the band at the end of a concert?  The first live performance of the Ray Davies Quartet, the band that would become the Kinks, was at a dance for their school, William Grimshaw, in 1962. The band performed under several names between 1962 and 1963—the Pete Quaife Band, the Bo-Weevils, the Ramrods, and the Ravens—before settling on the Kinks in early 1964. Ray has stated that a performance at Hornsey Town Hall on Valentine's Day 1963 was when the band were truly born. The Kinks made their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in January 1965 as part of a \\"package\\" bill that included Manfred Mann and the Honeycombs. They performed and toured relentlessly, headlining package tours throughout 1965 with performers such as the Yardbirds and Mickey Finn. Tensions began to emerge within the band, expressed in incidents such as the on-stage fight between drummer Mick Avory and Dave Davies at The Capitol Theatre, Cardiff, Wales on 19 May. After finishing the first song, \\"You Really Got Me\\", Davies insulted Avory and kicked over his drum set. Avory responded by hitting Davies with his hi-hat stand, rendering him unconscious, before fleeing from the scene, fearing that he had killed his bandmate. Davies was taken to Cardiff Royal Infirmary, where he received 16 stitches to his head. To placate police, Avory later claimed that it was part of a new act in which the band members would hurl their instruments at each other. Following their summer 1965 American tour, the American Federation of Musicians refused permits for the group to appear in concerts in the United States for the next four years, possibly due to their rowdy on-stage behaviour.In April 1969 Davies helped negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musician ban on the group, which allowed plans for a North American tour. However, over the next few years, Davies went into a state of depression, not helped by his collapsing marriage, culminating in his onstage announcement that he was \\"sick of it all\\" at a gig in White City Stadium in 1973.

New contracts for exploration will be signed in non-protected areas of Alaska and in the Gulf of Mexico.

Following the independence of Armenia in 1991 , Ijevan became the provincial centre of the newly founded province of Tavush , following the administrative reforms of 1995 . Following the independence of Armenia in 1991 , Ijevan became the provincial centre of the newly founded Tavush Province as per the administrative reforms of 1995 .","output":"Yes, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning, but they use slightly different phrasing and sentence structure. We can break down the key elements of each sentence to emphasize their similarities: 1. Both sentences mention the context, which is the independence of Armenia in 1991. 2. Both sentences communicate that Ijevan became the provincial center. 3. Both sentences reference the establishment of a new province, Tavush (or Tavush Province). 4. Both sentences note that the change took place because of the administrative reforms in 1995. With these similarities in mind, let's analyze the differences between the two sentences. The first sentence: \\"Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Ijevan became the provincial centre of the newly founded province of Tavush, following the administrative reforms of 1995.\\" In this sentence, 'following the administrative reforms of 1995' is placed at the end, separated by a comma. This arrangement emphasizes the connection between the administrative reforms of 1995 and Ijevan becoming the provincial center. The second sentence: \\"Following the independence of Armenia in 1991, Ijevan became the provincial centre of the newly founded Tavush Province as per the administrative reforms of 1995.\\" In this version, 'as per the administrative reforms of 1995' is integrated within the sentence, thereby connecting the administrative reforms to Ijevan becoming the provincial center more explicitly. Additionally, the province's name is written as \\"Tavush Province\\" instead of \\"province of Tavush\\". To summarize, although there are slight differences in phrasing and structure, the two sentences mean the same thing. Both describe the event of Ijevan becoming the provincial center of the newly founded Tavush Province due to the administrative reforms of 1995, which took place after Armenia gained independence in 1991."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is jealous of the naive Englishman? from the following article ?  A young and naive Englishman, John Truscott, goes to the British colony of Sarawak, Borneo, to try to apply his father's work to the Iban society. There he meets his boss Henry Bullard and his wife Aggie Bullard. John tries to civilize them, building schools and providing education for the Iban people. He is met with unfamiliar local customs. Selima becomes his \\"sleeping dictionary\\", who sleeps with him and teaches him the language and the habits of the locals. John is sent up river where a sickness is affecting the Yakata tribe. He and Selima travel inland. John witnesses a nearby mining operation run by Europeans. He notices that the Yakata have rice – which has been given to them by the miners – and he guesses correctly that the miners have poisoned the rice in order to get rid of the Yakata. Knowing that they will exact vengeance, John tells the Yakata what has happened. The Yakata wipe out the miners. Despite their intents, the two find themselves falling into a forbidden love. John is eager to marry Selima despite the longhouse not allowing it. When John tells Henry about his plans to marry her, they lock Selima up. Selima then agrees to marry in the longhouse and they part ways. Bullard threatens to send him to trial for the death of the European miners. He makes a deal with John. John has to give up Selima, and go to Britain for a year's vacation and to meet the Bullards' daughter Cecilia.

As the season opener for both teams, this game held immense importance for setting the tone for the rest of the season. Duke University, being ranked No. 11, entered the game with high expectations and the pressure to maintain their national ranking. On the other hand, the University of Tennessee at Martin, being the underdogs, aimed to make a statement by putting up a strong fight against a top college basketball team. JJ Redick and Daniel Ewing, two stars from Duke, were expected to have impressive performances in the game. Both players lived up to the expectations and scored 20 points each, effectively becoming the backbone of Duke's offense. Their scoring abilities coupled with their strong teamwork allowed Duke to create a considerable lead and dominate the game. The first half of the game was fairly competitive, with both teams exchanging baskets and showcasing their offensive skills. However, Duke's vast experience and pedigree shone through as they turned up the defensive pressure in the second half. This strategic move proved to be the turning point for Duke as it heavily disrupted Tennessee-Martin's offensive rhythm and hindered their ability to score points. By prioritizing their defense, Duke was able to control the game's tempo and gradually build a comfortable lead over Tennessee-Martin. Moreover, their defensive strategy resulted in numerous turnovers, which Duke converted into easy points through fast breaks and efficient offensive plays. This shift in Duke's approach transformed the close contest into a one-sided affair eventually leading to the lopsided 88-46 scoreline. Ultimately, Duke's victory in their season opener demonstrated their ability to adapt their game plan when needed. The impressive performances by JJ Redick and Daniel Ewing contributed to a solid team effort that allowed Duke to maintain control of the game. Meanwhile, Tennessee-Martin gained valuable insight and experience from playing against a highly-ranked opponent, which could be applied in their future games throughout the season. In conclusion, the basketball game between Duke University and Tennessee-Martin showcased an intense battle that ultimately saw Duke emerge victorious with an 88-46 score. The significant contributions of JJ Redick and Daniel Ewing, as well as Duke's strategic focus on defense in the second half, played crucial roles in securing their win on this memorable Saturday night in Durham, NC. This season opener set the stage for the rest of the season, where Duke would strive to maintain their high-ranking position and Tennessee-Martin would continue to challenge their opponents in search of their own success story."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How is \\"I am.\\" said in Czech?","output":"In Czech, the phrase \\"I am.\\" can be translated as \\"Jsem.\\" Czech language, like many other Slavic languages, has a highly inflected structure, which means that the meaning and function of words can change based on their endings and position in the sentence.  In this case, \\"Jsem\\" is the first person singular form of the verb \\"být,\\" which means \\"to be\\" and does not require the use of a separate pronoun in the sentence since the verb form \\"jsem\\" already indicates that the subject is the speaker or the first person singular. However, if you want to include the pronoun for emphasis, you can say \\"Já jsem,\\" where \\"Já\\" is the Czech pronoun for \\"I.\\" It is important to note that \\"Jsem\\" can be used on its own when the context is clear or when answering a question, but in general, it is followed by an adjective, noun, or complement to express the specific state or condition of the speaker. For example: - Jsem šťastný (I am happy) - Jsem učitel (I am a teacher) - Jsem v Praze (I am in Prague) Additionally, when it comes to negation, the adverb \\"ne\\" is placed before the verb in order to change the meaning to \\"I am not\\" or in Czech, \\"Nejsem.\\" For example: - Nejsem unavený (I am not tired) - Nejsem student (I am not a student) - Nejsem doma (I am not at home) In conclusion, to say \\"I am.\\" in Czech, you can use the word \\"Jsem,\\" and if you want to include the pronoun for emphasis, you can say \\"Já jsem.\\" Remember that the full meaning of the sentence usually comes from adding an adjective, noun, or complement to describe the state or condition of the speaker."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What cause indian language to be abandoned in schools\\" is in \\"Orientalist scholars of the 18th century like Sir William Jones marked a wave of enthusiasm for Indian culture and for Sanskrit. According to Thomas Trautmann, after this period of \\"Indomania\\", a certain hostility to Sanskrit and to Indian culture in general began to assert itself in early 19th century Britain, manifested by a neglect of Sanskrit in British academia. This was the beginning of a general push in favor of the idea that India should be culturally, religiously and linguistically assimilated to Britain as far as possible. Trautmann considers two separate and logically opposite sources for the growing hostility: one was \\"British Indophobia\\", which he calls essentially a developmentalist, progressivist, liberal, and non-racial-essentialist critique of Hindu civilisation as an aid for the improvement of India along European lines; the other was scientific racism, a theory of the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a \\"separate, inferior and unimprovable race\\".\\".

Answer:","output":"The cause for Indian languages to be abandoned in schools can be traced back to the early 19th century Britain, where a growing hostility towards Sanskrit and Indian culture started developing.

Scientific racism: A theory based on the English \\"common-sense view\\" that Indians constituted a separate, inferior, and unimprovable race.

Amy was struggling with her body image, feeling insecure and down about herself. Monica, her close friend, noticed this and decided to offer her support and encouragement. Sitting down with her one afternoon, Monica began to console Amy by empathizing with her feelings and acknowledging the various standards society imposes on people, especially women, regarding their appearance. Monica shared her own experiences with body image issues and opened up about the different strategies that helped her overcome those negative thoughts. She emphasized the importance of focusing on one's overall health and well-being, rather than concentrating solely on physical appearance. By paying attention to both physical and mental health, Monica suggested that Amy could start developing a more positive and holistic outlook towards her body. Together, they discussed different ways to achieve this, such as embracing mindfulness techniques, practicing gratitude for their bodies, and incorporating regular exercise and healthy eating habits into their daily routines. Monica also encouraged Amy to surround herself with positive role models who promote body positivity and self-acceptance, in order to reinforce the notion that every person's body is beautiful and unique in its way. Amy realized that comparing herself to others was unhelpful and only undermined her self-confidence.

By Snejana Farberov and Louise Boyle PUBLISHED: 19:59 EST, 1 December 2013 | UPDATED: 12:30 EST, 2 December 2013 The Today Show team paid tribute today to a beloved colleague who was killed in Sunday morning's Metro-North train derailment in New York City. James Lovell, 58, a married father-of-four, was a staffer at NBC and had been on his way to work on the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting when he was killed. Today show executive producer Don Nash shared a message with colleagues on Mr Lovell's death: 'Jim worked on TODAY for over 20 years.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\"? , can you please find it?   The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote. Among Bizet's contemporaries, the dramatist Ludovic Halévy wrote that this early work announced Bizet as a composer of quality: \\"I persist in finding in [the score] the rarest virtues\\". The youthful composer Émile Paladilhe told his father... A:","output":"The full name of the person who considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\" is Benjamin Jouvin.

In the autumn of 1531, Jonas published a German translation of the Apology of the Augsburg Confession and in 1541 he began a successful preaching crusade in Halle, becoming superintendent of its churches in 1542 or 1544 and priest in the Market Church of Our Dear Lady  the city of Halle, Saxony-Anhalt. Martin Luther became severely ill and visited his friend during Christmas in 1545. Jonas was present at Luther's deathbed at Eisleben, and preached the funeral sermon; in a procession Luther's body was taken to Halle and buried in Wittenberg. In the same year Jonas was banished from the duchy by Maurice, Duke of Saxony. From that time until his death, Jonas was unable to secure a satisfactory living. He wandered from place to place preaching, and finally went to Eisfeld, Thuringia , where he died, aged 62. Where was Luther's body taken before he was buried?","output":"Luther's body was taken to Halle before it was ultimately buried in Wittenberg. Martin Luther had visited his friend, Jonas, in Halle during Christmas in 1545, where he became severely ill. After Luther's death in Eisleben, Jonas, who was present at Luther's deathbed, preached the funeral sermon. Then in a procession, Luther's body was transported to Halle. It was from Halle that his remains were then taken to their final resting place in Wittenberg. This journey designated the final stages of the commemoration and farewell to the significant theologian and seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. The decision to bury him in Wittenberg symbolizes the deep connection between Luther and that city, where much of his theological work and the initiation of the Reformation movement took place. His influence was profound both during his life and after his death, and his burial in Wittenberg stands as a continuing testament to his profound impact on the city and on Christianity as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Elgin Cathedral is a historic ruin in Elgin, Moray, north-east Scotland. The cathedral—dedicated to the Holy Trinity—was established in 1224 on land granted by King Alexander II outside the burgh of Elgin and close to the River Lossie. It replaced the cathedral at Spynie, 3 kilometres (1.9 mi) to the north, that was served by a small chapter of eight clerics. The new and bigger cathedral was staffed with 18 canons in 1226 and then increased to 23 by 1242. After a damaging fire in 1270, a rebuilding programme greatly enlarged the building. It was unaffected by the Wars of Scottish Independence but again suffered extensive fire damage in 1390 following an attack by Robert III's brother Alexander Stewart, Earl of Buchan, also known as the Wolf of Badenoch. In 1402 the cathedral precinct again suffered an incendiary attack by the followers of the Lord of the Isles. The number of clerics required to staff the cathedral continued to grow, as did the number of craftsmen needed to maintain the buildings and surrounds. The cathedral went through periods of enlargement and renovation following the fires of 1270 and 1390 that included the doubling in length of the choir, the provision of outer aisles to the northern and southern walls of both the nave and choir. Today, these walls are at full height in places and at foundation level in others yet the overall cruciform shape is still discernible. A mostly intact octagonal chapter house dates from the major enlargement after the fire of 1270. The gable wall above the double door entrance that links the west towers is nearly complete and was rebuilt following the fire of 1390. It accommodates a large window opening that now only contains stub tracery work and fragments of a large rose window. Recessed and chest tombs in both transepts and in the south aisle of the choir contain effigies of bishops and knights, and large flat slabs in the now grass-covered floor of the cathedral mark the positions of early graves. The homes of the dignitaries and canons, or manses, stood in...  answer the following question:  What were the two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow? Answer:","output":"The two staff positions at the Elgin Cathedral that continued to grow were clerics and craftsmen. As the Cathedral went through different periods of enlargement, renovation, and rebuilding following the fires and attacks, there was an increasing necessity for more clerics to staff the evolving religious institution. Clerics were responsible for performing religious duties, managing the Cathedral's affairs, and supporting the spiritual needs of the community. At the same time, there was also a growing demand for a larger number of craftsmen required to maintain the buildings and their surroundings. Craftsmen were essential to the construction, repair, and artistic embellishment of the Cathedral throughout its history. They would have included skilled workers such as stonemasons, carpenters, glaziers, and other artisans who were necessary for the maintenance and beautification of the Cathedral complex. Overall, the increasing number of clerics and craftsmen at the Elgin Cathedral reflected the growing importance and complexity of the institution, as well as the successive stages of construction and restoration that it underwent throughout its history. The constant evolution and rebuilding shaped the Cathedral into the historical and architectural landmark that it remains today, despite its ruined state."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Honey bees are normally about third fourths of an inch long. Most bees are workers, which are female, but some are male, called \\"drones \\". Workers are a little smaller than drones. Honey bees live in a nest, called a \\"hive\\". A hive can have up to 80,000 bees, mostly workers. It usually lies in a tree with a hole inside. The hive is ruled  over by a queen bee. She is the largest bee in the hive, and she is the only female to mate. Males usually just hang around; their only purpose is to mate with the queen. Then they die. The workers do all of the work inside and outside of the hive. Their jobs include: caring for baby bees, cleaning up the hive, making honey...

Process:  - Water from the surface seeps below the soil - The water comes into contact with the rock below - The rock over the years carves through the rock - The space in the rock becomes larger and forms into a cave - As more rather rushes through the cave becomes a cavern.  suppose there is more space rock in space happens, how will it affect the space in the rock gets bigger.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"The proposition suggests an additional amount of \\"space rock\\" coming in, which in terms of geological processes, could mean either the rock below the soil is increasing in volume, or perhaps there is more rock being deposited on the surface which will eventually become subterranean.  Let's consider both scenarios for further understanding. Scenario 1: If the rock below the soil is expanding or increasing in volume, this would have a direct impact on the process of cave formation. This could be considered as 'directly impacting a step of the process'. Expanding rock mass could disrupt the slow process of carving out caves by potentially filling in it or blocking water routes, slowing the erosion process that broadens the cave. Over time, the rock expansion could potentially lead to less cavernous structures below the earth's surface. Scenario 2: If more rock is being deposited on the surface, the immediate impact on the cave formation process is indirect. This would represent 'indirectly impacting a step of the process'. Over time, deposition leads to an increase in overburden pressure on the underlying rock layers, which eventually could lead to an increased rate of seepage and possibly even a faster rate of erosion due to heightened water pressure. Depending on the type of deposited rock, it might also alter the chemical composition of the infiltrating water - with potential implications for the dissolution process. In both scenarios, the presence of additional space rock could perturb the process steps. The effect is either direct, by altering the existing structure in the rock, or indirect, by potentially altering the speed and nature of the water seepage and erosion process. Therefore, the 'supposed perturbation' in both cases is definitely not 'not impacting any step of the process' since the addition of space rock, irrespective of the spatial arrangement, affects the cave formation process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Plot title: Longford Movie plot: From HBO.com:LONGFORD [Jim Broadbent] is a thought-provoking story inspired by real events in the life of British Lord Frank Pakenham, the 7th Earl of Longford, and his controversial headline-making friendship with one of England's most notorious criminals. Longford, a devout Catholic, often visited prisoners because of his passionate belief in forgiveness and society's need for prisoner rehabilitation.In 1965, he begins visiting Myra Hindley [Samantha Morton], a young woman serving a life sentence for murdering children with her lover Ian Brady [Andy Serkis]. Though Longford encountered public outrage, discouragement from his wife Elizabeth [Lindsay Duncan], doubt from his family, and criticism from his colleagues and the press, he continued to visit and exchange letters with Hindley. After learning that she once converted to Catholicism, Longford encourages her to return to the church and ask for God's forgiveness.After the Prime Minister removes him from the House of Lords, he devotes his time to crusading for Hindley and other prisoners. His wife eventually joins the crusade after reading Hindley's letters, meeting her and seeing the horrible prison conditions. She suspects that Hindley is receiving harsher punishment because she is a woman. Longford takes Hindley's cause public, talking to the press about her case and defending her as an accomplice corrupted by Ian Brady.At first, Hindley is grateful for Longford's efforts and seems to make progress in her return to the church. Later, she unexpectedly rejects his help and shocks him with the news that she lied to him about the murders. Once this information is made public, Longford's good name is damaged even further. Longford begins to question his religious beliefs, but reaches a deeper level in his Catholic faith when he is able to forgive Hindley for her transgressions against him.Many years later, she asks him to visit her once again and he complies.

Analyze the given sentences:    The first sentence provided is \\"Two children wearing white capes are running through a cleared out path in a field.\\" This gives us direct evidence about the activities of the children, their attire, and the location.     The second sentence is the statement we need to test for truth; it is \\"Children are playing super heroes outside.\\" 2. Break down the components of the second sentence:    \\"Children\\" corresponds to \\"Two children\\" in the original sentence.     \\"are playing super heroes\\" indicates imaginative play and possibly the wearing of costumes. There is no direct indication in the first sentence that the children are pretending to be super heroes, only that they are wearing capes, which is often associated with such pretend play.     \\"outside\\" corresponds well with \\"running through a cleared out path in a field\\" in the original sentence as both indicate an outdoor setting. 3. Evaluate the sentence as a whole:    Based on the points above, we can see that the children are indeed outside, and they are wearing capes and running, which could reasonably be interpreted as an indication that they are playing at being super heroes, even though it's not explicitly stated. 4. Final decision:    Given the available evidence from the first sentence, it is reasonable to say that the sentence \\"Children are playing super heroes outside\\" is likely to be true, although it involves a bit of interpretation and assumption about the exact nature of the children's play."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

ACTION2: Not correcting a guest's mispronounced words at work - This action could be considered as avoiding potential embarrassment for the guest or maintaining a polite and respectful conversation. However, if the person continues to mispronounce important words or concepts consistently, and not correcting them may lead to miscommunication or misunderstandings, it could be considered unethical not to correct them professionally. Comparison:  Charging high amounts for snacks could be viewed as unethical if the intention is to exploit or take advantage of customers. On the other hand, not correcting a guest's mispronounced words may not be unethical if the intention is to maintain a respectful conversation and avoid embarrassing the guest. It can only be identified as unethical if it leads to significant communication issues.

A. ceiling  B. library  C. surface of earth  D. most buildings  E. desktop  The best answer is Answer:","output":"D. most buildings Dust accumulation is a common occurrence in most buildings. This is the best answer because it covers a broad range of areas where dust can accumulate. Dust, which is composed of various particles, including dead skin cells, hair, fibers, pollen, and other materials, can gather on many surfaces within a building. Factors such as human activity, indoor air quality, and the effectiveness of ventilation systems can all contribute to dust build-up. While other options, such as the ceiling (A), the library (B), the surface of the earth (C), and the desktop (E), are also places where dust can accumulate, these options are more specific and narrow in scope. Ceilings (A) can indeed collect dust, particularly in the corners or on light fixtures, but this is just one area within a building where dust can settle. Libraries (B) are also notorious for dust accumulation due to the vast number of books on shelves, which can trap and hold dust particles. However, this is still just one type of building where dust is found. The surface of the earth (C) might seem like an all-encompassing answer, but it is not as accurate as most buildings (D). The earth's surface includes various natural and urban landscapes, such as forests, deserts, oceans, and cities. While dust is present everywhere on earth, the distribution and concentration of dust differ depending on these locations. Thus, it does not emphasize the specific nature of dust accumulation in built environments. Lastly, desktops (E) are one of the many surfaces within a building where dust can collect, but it is too specific and does not include all the other areas in a building where dust might be found, such as floors, walls, shelves, and more. Therefore, the best answer is most buildings (D), as it encompasses a wider range of areas and surfaces where dust can accumulate, and provides a more comprehensive understanding of where dust typically gathers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The wide variety of birds in Basse Casamance was noted by early explorers. While Basse Casamance National Park and Kalissaye Avifaunal Reserve have not been open for years due to the Casamance Conflict, Carabane has been found to be very conducive to ornithological observation. A study in 1998 discovered the following species on the island: African darter (Anhinga rufa), Goliath heron (Ardea goliath), palm-nut vulture (Gypohierax angolensis), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), Eurasian curlew (Numenius arquata), Caspian tern (Sterna caspia), blue-spotted wood-dove (Turtur afer), red-eyed dove (Streptopelia semitorquata), white-rumped swift (Apus caffer), woodland kingfisher (Halcyon senegalensis), grey-backed camaroptera (Camaroptera brachyura), red-bellied paradise-flycatcher (Terpsiphone rufiventer), pied crow (Corvus albus), black-rumped waxbill (Estrilda troglodytres) and yellow-fronted canary (Serinus mozambicus).Fish are plentiful in the waters surrounding the island, where one may encounter trevallies (Carangidae), Giant African threadfins (Polydactylus quadrifilis), great barracudas (Sphyraena barracuda), or African red snappers (Lutjanus agennes). The mangroves are home to many crustaceans such as southern pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus notialis), sand fiddler crabs (Uca pugilator), and molluscs. The shellfish population consists mostly of mangrove oysters (Crassostrea gasar), which cling to uncovered mangrove roots at low tide. The red-headed agama and monitor lizard make up the reptilian population of the island. The sandbar of Carabane has very few mammals other than pets, although the French first noted the presence of monkeys in 1835. In 1870, other settlers noted with disgust that the natives often ate monkeys and dogs. In the early 21st century, bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are commonly sighted off the island.

A stream of friends, colleagues, disgruntled civil servants and concerned military officers came to the house to provide information to support Churchill's struggle against appeasement. At Chartwell, he developed what Fedden calls, his own \\"little Foreign Office ... the hub of resistance\\". The Chartwell visitors' book, meticulously maintained from 1922, records some 780 house guests, not all of them friends, but all grist to Churchill's mill. An example of the latter was Sir Maurice Hankey, Clerk of the Privy Council, who was Churchill's guest for dinner in April 1936. Hankey subsequently wrote, \\"I do not usually make a note of private conversations but some points arose which gave an indication of the line which Mr Churchill is likely to take in forthcoming debates (on munitions and supply) in Parliament\\". A week later, Reginald Leeper, a senior Foreign Office official and confident of Robert Vansittart, visited Churchill to convey their views on the need to use the League of Nations to counter German aggression. Vansittart wrote, \\"there is no time to lose. There is indeed a great danger that we shall be too late\\".Churchill also recorded visits to Chartwell by two more of his most important suppliers of confidential governmental information, Desmond Morton and Ralph Wigram, information which he used to \\"form and fortify my opinion about the Hitler Movement\\". Chartwell was also the scene of more direct attempts to prepare Britain for the coming conflict; in October 1939, when reappointed First Lord of the Admiralty on the outbreak of war, Churchill suggested an improvement for anti-aircraft shells; \\"Such shells could be filled with zinc ethyl which catches fire spontaneously ...

Drink approximately four 8-oz (250-ml) glasses of apple juice or apple cider each day for a period of five days.  For best results, drink the apple juice at room temperature or slightly warmed.","output":"The most logical next event for this gallstone removal home remedy would be to perform a gallbladder flush on the sixth day to enable the passing of gallstones. It is important to ensure that you have a clear understanding of the remedy, and consult a healthcare professional before embarking on this process, as it may not be suitable for everyone. Here are the steps for the gallbladder flush: 1. Preparation: Before starting the flush on the sixth day, it is essential to eat a light breakfast and lunch. Avoid consuming any fat or oil-based food, as they may hinder the cleansing process. 2. Epsom Salt Solution: In the afternoon, around 6 pm, mix 4 tablespoons of Epsom salt in 24 ounces (710 ml) of water. This will make four servings. Set aside this solution for later use. Epsom salt acts as a laxative, which will help in passing the gallstones more efficiently. 3. First Epsom Salt Dose: Drink the first 6-ounce (180 ml) serving of the Epsom salt solution at 6 pm. Consume it slowly, and try to relax, as this will allow your body to prepare for the flush effectively. 4. Second Epsom Salt Dose: At 8 pm, drink the second serving of the Epsom salt solution. It is essential to stay relaxed during this time, refrain from performing any physically demanding tasks, and focus on preparing your body for the flush. 5. Olive Oil and Citrus Juice: At 10 pm, mix 1/2 cup (118 ml) of extra virgin olive oil with 3/4 cup (177 ml) of freshly squeezed grapefruit or lemon juice. Shake the mixture well until it becomes a watery consistency. 6. Lying Down: Consume the olive oil and citrus juice mix while standing up. Immediately after drinking the mixture, lie down on your right side on the bed with your knees drawn up to your chest. This position is essential, as it helps the oil mix to reach the gallbladder quickly. 7. Sleep: Try to fall asleep and stay asleep for several hours. The gallstones will soften during this time and may pass through the gallbladder more easily. 8. Remaining Epsom Salt Doses: The next day, upon waking up, drink the third Epsom salt solution serving. Relax and wait for any bowel movements. Two hours later, consume the final serving of the Epsom salt solution. Throughout the day, you may experience multiple bowel movements during which the softened gallstones will pass. These may appear as small, greenish pellets in the toilet. After the gallbladder flush, it is crucial to follow a healthy and balanced diet to maintain optimal gallbladder health. Include foods that are rich in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and minimize the consumption of saturated fats and cholesterol-containing foods. Additionally, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising regularly, and staying hydrated can support gallbladder health. However, it is highly recommended to consult a healthcare professional before attempting any home remedy, especially if you have existing medical conditions or are on any medications, as this process may not be suitable or safe for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

BUCHAREST, Romania — Huge protests, some of the largest since the fall of communism, toppled the government of Romania on Wednesday, five days after a fire at a nightclub killed 32 people and set off a wave of outrage over corruption and ineptitude.      Prime Minister Victor Ponta — who was already under pressure, having been indicted this year on charges of forgery, money laundering and tax evasion — said he was bowing to the will of the more than 20,000 demonstrators who had taken to the streets of Bucharest on Tuesday night to demand his ouster.      “I have the obligation to acknowledge that there is legitimate anger in society,” Mr. Ponta, 43, said in a statement. “In my years as a politician, I put up a fight in any battle with political opponents. However, I won’t put up a fight against the people.”      It was a startling and sudden fall from power for Mr. Ponta, who became prime minister in May 2012, and it was reminiscent of the uprising that overthrew the government of Ukraine last year. It was also a vivid reminder of Romania’s awkward fit in the European Union, which it joined, with Bulgaria, in 2007 despite concerns about corruption and the rule of law. ||||| This article is over 2 years old      In aftermath of 32 deaths, president endorses demonstrations targeting Victor Ponta – who has stayed in office despite facing trial for corruption      Anger over Bucharest nightclub fire spirals into demands for PM to resign      More than 20,000 people have rallied in Bucharest demanding Romania’s prime minister resign after a deadly nightclub fire that claimed 32 lives.

The Social Democrat is the first Romanian head of government to stand trial while still in office. The charges date back to 2007-2011, when Ponta was working as a lawyer. He became prime minister in 2012.      Marchers on Tuesday chanted “Ponta resign” and “killers”, and some waved the national flag with holes in it: a symbol of the popular revolution 25 years ago that toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.            President Klaus Iohannis, who had earlier paid tribute to two heroes in the blaze and demanded reforms to prevent a recurrence of the tragedy, praised the rally.      “I am impressed by this evening’s demonstrations,” the conservative head of state said on his Facebook page. The country’s political leaders, he said, “cannot ignore this feeling of revolt.”      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Emergency service staff work outside the Colectiv nightclub in Bucharest where 32 people died after an explosion      Viorel Anastasoaie, a demonstrator aged in his thirties, said the rally was “a gesture of solidarity” with the victims of the blaze “and a sign of protest against the government, against the district mayor, against the system which enabled a tragedy of this kind to happen”.      Earlier mourners paid tribute to two men who sacrificed themselves in the fire which engulfed the basement club in a Communist-era building on Friday.            The toll of 32 dead and nearly 200 injured would have been deadlier had Claudiu Petre, a physicist by training, and drummer Adrian Rugina not been at the Colectiv disco when an illegal pyrotechnics display went horribly awry.      The pair went several times into the burning club to rescue trapped revellers, only to die themselves.      Witnesses said a fireworks display triggered the blaze at the Colectiv, which was located in a former shoe factory. The inferno sparked a deadly stampede.

The accusations sparked a backlash against the ecclesiastical authorities, especially against Patriarch Daniel, head of the Romanian Orthodox church, who has maintained a studied silence on the tragedy.      On Monday Petre and Rugina were posthumously decorated by Iohannis for “their courage and altruism and for saving lives at the cost of supreme sacrifice”.      “Their time is not over as heroes never die,” Iohannis said.      In remarks on Sunday, Iohannis also called for society to face up to the need for root-and-branch reform.      “We should no longer tolerate government incompetence, institutional inefficiency, and we cannot let corruption spread to the point that it kills people,” he said. ||||| BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Romanian Prime Minister Victor Ponta announced the resignation of his government Wednesday following huge protests in the wake of a nightclub fire that killed more than 30 people.

The mayor of the district in the Romanian capital where the nightclub is located, Cristian Popescu Piedone, also resigned Wednesday, saying he is morally guilty for the deadliest fire in Romania's history.      Piedone said: \\"I assume the moral blame. As for the legal (blame) I will leave it to justice to pronounce.\\" He came under pressure to step down following mass protests through the city Tuesday night, with more than 20,000 demonstrators blaming widespread corruption for the deadly blaze on Friday night.      Witnesses said the fire broke out during a heavy-metal concert in the basement club when a spark ignited foam decor, sending panicked people stampeding for the single exit. The death toll stands at 32, with some 130 still hospitalized, dozens of them in serious or critical condition.      Deputy leader of the opposition Liberal Party, Catalin Predoiu, hailed the resignations. \\"This is a victory of the street. It is a lesson for all politicians,\\" he said.      Thousands took to the streets the night before in a spontaneous protest calling for the resignation of Ponta, Interior Minister Gabriel Oprea and Piedone.      They shouted \\"Shame on you!\\" and \\"Assassins!\\" and waved Romanian flags. Anger has been brewing for some time in Romania against the government, which many perceive as being corrupt, and Friday's fire has added to the discontent.      Even before the fire, Ponta had been under pressure from his oponents to resign, but had refused. He is on trial for corruption charges including tax evasion, money laundering, conflict of interest and making false statements while he was working as a lawyer in 2007 and 2008. At the time, Ponta was a lawmaker. He denies wrongdoing.      Romanians had also called for the resignation of Oprea over the on-duty death of a police motorcyclist, who died after he hit a hole on Oct. 20.

U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senator Lindsey Graham have joined a growing chorus of Republican leaders to disavow comments by presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump about the Mexican heritage of a judge in a class-action lawsuit against Trump University. Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made.

Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said.

You'll need to overcome a few factors on your way to becoming a train operator, but the biggest obstacle in your path is a union agreement made in 2008. According to this agreement, the tfl is not allowed to advertise externally and, instead, hires mostly from within the organization.","output":"To become a tube driver, you must first understand the challenges you will face, including the 2008 union agreement that makes it difficult for external candidates to be hired. However, with determination and the right strategy, you can increase your chances of being recruited and becoming a successful train operator. Below is a step-by-step guide on how to become a tube driver: 1. Research the role and qualifications: Gaining as much knowledge about the position and its requirements is essential. Tube drivers are responsible for operating trains on time while ensuring the safety and comfort of their passengers. Ideally, you should have clear communication skills, calmness under pressure, resilience, and problem-solving abilities. 2. Gain relevant experience: Since TfL primarily hires from within the organization, your best chance of becoming a tube driver is by obtaining a job in the company to secure an internal advantage. Positions such as station staff, customer service assistants, or other roles within the transportation industry can offer valuable experience and aid in building relevant skills. 3. Obtain necessary qualifications: While there are no specific educational requirements for tube drivers, having good levels of English and Mathematics will be beneficial. In addition, obtaining qualifications in railway operations, customer service, or safety-related fields can make you a more desirable candidate. 4. Network and join a union: Building connections and relationships with current employees, especially those in the train operation sector, can boost your chances of getting inside information about upcoming positions and opportunities. Joining a union can also provide access to resources and support throughout the recruitment process. 5. Stay updated on job openings: Regularly check the TfL website and other job portals for vacancies or opportunities related to tube drivers. Internal candidates are often given priority, so being a TfL employee will provide a significant advantage. 6. Apply for the train operator trainee program: As a TfL employee, you can apply for the train operator trainee program when it becomes available. The program typically involves a series of tests, interviews, and background checks. It may also include extensive training that covers theoretical and practical aspects of train operation, safety regulations, and emergency procedures. 7. Gain necessary licenses: Upon successful completion of the training program, you will need to obtain the necessary licenses and certifications required to become a professional tube driver. This might include passing specific safety assessments or completing on-the-job training supervised by a qualified instructor. 8. Pursue continuous professional development: Learning should not stop once you become a tube driver. Participate in ongoing training programs to stay up-to-date on the latest safety protocols, technological advancements, and industry best practices. 9. Explore career advancement opportunities: Becoming a tube driver can also open doors to other career opportunities within TfL, such as becoming an instructor, supervisor, or manager in train operations. Seek ways to grow within the organization and continue to strengthen your skills. In conclusion, the process of becoming a tube driver may be challenging due to the existing union agreement and the highly competitive nature of the role. However, by gaining relevant experience, continuously improving your skills, and remaining persistent, you can ultimately achieve your goal of becoming a train operator."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To that end, they developed a transgenic crop with the help of Bt toxin - they referred to it as case A. To test the effectiveness of this new crop they also studied Bt toxin spray - they referred to it as case B. They need to figure out which case is safer for the environment.  In which case the Bt toxin is in an active state, case A or case B?  Hint: There is growing concern regarding the use of pesticides in agriculture. Therefore, many of the current commercial applications of modern biotechnology in agriculture are focused on reducing the dependence of farmers on these chemicals. For example, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a soil bacterium that produces a protein that can act as an insecticide, known as the Bt toxin . But it is a naturally occurring protein, not a foreign chemical. Could this protein be used in crops instead of pesticides? Traditionally, an insecticidal spray has been produced from these bacteria. As a spray, the Bt toxin is in an inactive state and requires digestion by an insect to become active and have any effect. Crop plants have now been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin, which they produce in its active form. When an insect ingests the transgenic crop, it stops feeding and soon thereafter dies as a result of the Bt toxin binding to its gut wall. Bt corn is now commercially available in a number of countries to control corn borer (an insect like a moth or butterfly), which is otherwise controlled by insecticidal spraying. A:","output":"Based on the provided information, the Bt toxin is in an active state in case A, where the transgenic crop has been engineered to contain and express the genes for the Bt toxin.

While most existing methods aim at deceiving image classification models into misclassification or crafting attacks for specific object instances in the object setection tasks, we focus on creating universal adversaries to fool object detectors and hide objects from the detectors.   The adversaries we examine are universal in three ways:   (1) They are not specific for specific object instances;   (2) They are image-independent;   (3) They can further transfer to different unknown models.   To achieve this, we propose two novel techniques to improve the transferability of the adversaries: textit{piling-up} and textit{monochromatization}.

Monaco's constitution confined the throne to members of the Grimaldi family alone, and Antoine was thus keen for his daughter Princess Louise-Hippolyte (Illustration 11) to wed a Grimaldi cousin. However, the state of the Grimaldi fortunes, and the lack of (the politically necessary) approval from King Louis XIV, dictated otherwise. Louise-Hippolyte was married to Jacques de Goyon Matignon, a wealthy aristocrat from Normandy. Louise-Hippolyte succeeded her father as sovereign of Monaco in 1731 but died just months later. The King of France, confirming Monaco's subservient state to France, ignored the protests of other branches of the Grimaldi family, overthrew the Monégasque constitution, and approved the succession of Jacques de Goyon Matignon as Prince Jacques I.Jacques I assumed the name and arms of the Grimaldi, but the French aristocracy showed scant respect towards the new prince who had risen from their ranks and chose to spend his time absent from Monaco. He died in 1751 and was succeeded by his and Louise-Hippolyte's son Prince Honoré III.Honoré III married Catherine Brignole in 1757 and later divorced her. Before his marriage, Honoré III had been conducting an affair with his future mother-in-law.  After her divorce Marie Brignole married Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé, a member of the fallen French royal house, in 1798. Ironically, the Grimaldi fortunes were restored when descendants of both Hortense Mancini and Louis I married: Louise d'Aumont Mazarin married Honoré III's son and heir, the future Honoré IV. This marriage in 1776 was extremely advantageous to the Grimaldi, as Louise's ancestress Hortense Mancini had been the heiress of Cardinal Mazarin. Thus Monaco's ruling family acquired all the estates bequeathed by Cardinal Mazarin, including the Duchy of Rethel, and the Principality of Château-Porcien. Honoré III was a soldier who fought at both Fontenoy and Rocourt. He was happy to leave Monaco to be... Answer:","output":"The name of the person that Princess Louise-Hippolyte succeeded is Antoine. Antoine was her father, and she succeeded him as the sovereign of Monaco in 1731."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Question: what is an agents job role in film? Would \\"Actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so were able to work on within their time and with other studios.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"An agent's job role in the film industry is primarily to represent and negotiate on behalf of their clients, who may include actors, actresses, directors, screenwriters, and other professionals in the entertainment field. They work to secure job opportunities, negotiate contracts, and promote their clients' careers. The agent acts as a liaison between their clients and production companies, networks, or studios. Regarding the statement \\"Actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity and so were able to work on within their time and with other studios,\\" this can be considered a reasonable answer depending on the context. During the Golden Age of Hollywood, actors and actresses were often contracted to specific studios and rarely, if ever, worked with other studios. However, as time progressed, the studio system changed, and contracts became less restrictive, actors and actresses gained more freedom to work with various studios and projects. This evolution in the industry allowed agents to play a crucial role in advocating for their clients and securing diverse work opportunities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: \\"To be real honest, Jeffrey, you're not making much progress,\\" said Greg. \\"Are you practicing at all?\\" \\"Well, yeah. Mom makes me. She sits there watching to make sure I'm getting the right fingering and phrasing.\\" \\"Hmm. I might need to talk to her about that.\\" Greg hated when kids were forced into musicianship. He had been teaching private music lessons for more than ten years, and had seen it often. Parents made their kids miserable. It rarely worked anyway. \\"You don't really want to take piano, do you?\\" \\"No, Sir.\\" \\"Well... \\" \\"I wish my mom would let me take guitar lessons. That would be cool.\\" \\"You know you'd get calluses like this.\\" Greg held out left hand and showed Jeffrey his fingertips. \\"Yeah! My friend, Zach, has calluses. They're hard like plastic.\\" \\"Well, you know, it hurts for a while--until you build them up.\\" \\"I don't care. I love the guitar.

You hope it takes two or three days before it hits your bank, and by then, your paycheck will be deposited.","output":"This situation is about strategically utilizing the lag time (also known as the float time) it takes for a check to clear through the banking system, in order to avoid overdraft fees or insufficient funds in the account. In this scenario, you find yourself with an almost empty gas tank just two days before your paycheck is due to be deposited into your bank account. To manage this situation without incurring extra fees or penalties, you decide to write a check for the gas you need, even though you don't have enough funds in your account to cover the expense at this very moment. By writing the check, you are essentially betting that it will take at least two or three days for the gas station to deposit the check into their account and for the banking system to process it, moving the funds from your account to theirs. This time lag between the moment you write the check and the moment when the funds are withdrawn from your account is called the check float time. From your point of view, the primary purpose of relying on check float time in this case is to buy yourself some time until your paycheck is deposited into your account. Ideally, by the time the check written for the gas is processed, your account will be replenished with your paycheck funds, effectively covering the check amount and preventing any overdraft fees or negative account balances. However, there are a few important considerations and potential risks associated with this practice: 1. Unpredictable float time: The float time can vary greatly from one financial institution to another and can be affected by factors such as weekends, holidays, and bank processing policies. The check may clear more quickly than you anticipate, and if the paycheck is not deposited in time, you could face overdraft fees or other penalties. 2. Bad check consequences: Writing checks without sufficient funds in your account is also known as \\"kiting\\" or \\"floating\\" checks. Depending on the jurisdiction, it can be considered illegal and lead to financial penalties or even criminal charges in severe cases. 3. Impact on credit score: Habitual reliance on check float time and overdrawing your account can negatively impact your credit score. A low credit score can make it more difficult to get credit cards, loans, and can even affect your job prospects. 4. Evolving technology: With the advent of electronic check processing systems and near-instantaneous transfers, float times have considerably reduced compared to the past. This makes it riskier to rely on check float time as a financial strategy. In summary, this situation is about attempting to strategically use check float time as a temporary solution to a cash flow issue, specifically the predicament of needing gas when your account balance is low, just before a paycheck is deposited. While doing so could work in some cases, it is important to consider the potential consequences and risks associated with such a practice. A better approach would be to maintain a budget or emergency fund to cover unexpected or short-term expenses like this."},{"instruction":"A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person Stern compared to Marilyn?, using the article: Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \\"girl next door\\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans. Her \\"Spinning Around\\" video led to some media outlets referring to her as \\"SexKylie\\", and sex became a stronger element in her subsequent videos.

For the best results, choose a white or light colored nylon suit. Use garbage bags, old towels, or an old tablecloth to protect surfaces. Work outside if possible. Acid dye will give you the best results. Choose one color for a monochrome design, or multiple colors for a more traditional tie dye look. Use rubber gloves to protect your skin while preparing the dye and while dyeing your swimsuit. Pull up small pieces of the fabric about 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5.1 cm) apart and tie the material off with your rubber bands. Create interesting patterns by varying the amount of fabric you tie off and/or the spacing between each section. The longer you leave the suit in place, the darker the color will be. Rotate to a new section and a new color until the whole suit is covered with dye.  Dyeing time can be anywhere between 5 and 20 minutes depending on the base color of the suit and how dark of a shade you want. When using multiple colors, expect some of the colors to run together at the edges and create a new color. This will add more interest and color to your suit and is preferable to leaving areas without dye coverage. If you are using only one color, you can use a large dye bath and fully submerge the suit once you've tied it off with rubber bands. When the water runs clear, wrap the suit in an old towel to remove any excess water and dye. Hang to dry.  Place an old towel underneath the suit as it drys to catch any excess dye. The first few times the suit is washed, wash it alone in case it bleeds.

Egg drop soup is a common Chinese dish.","output":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that egg drop soup is a common Chinese dish. It is a simple and comforting soup made with beaten eggs and other ingredients such as chicken broth or water, cornstarch, and sometimes seasonings like soy sauce, scallions, and sesame oil. Instant ramen noodles can be added for an even more filling and satisfying meal. To make simple egg drop soup with instant ramen noodles, you will need the following ingredients: - 1 pack of instant ramen noodles - 1 to 2 eggs (depending on your preference) - 4 cups of water or chicken broth - 1 tablespoon of soy sauce (optional) - 1 tablespoon of cornstarch (optional, for a thicker soup) - 1 scallion, sliced (optional) - Sesame oil (optional, for drizzling on top) Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to create this flavorful dish: 1. Fill a pot with 4 cups of water or chicken broth. This should be a little over halfway in a medium-sized pot. Place the pot on the stove, set the heat to high and bring the liquid to a rolling boil. 2. Once the water or broth is boiling, add the instant ramen noodles to the pot. Follow the cooking instructions on the ramen package to cook the noodles. If you desire a richer soup, you can also add the seasoning packet provided with the instant ramen noodles. 3. In a small bowl, beat the eggs and set them aside. 4. (Optional) In another small bowl, mix the cornstarch with a little bit of water to create a slurry. This will help to thicken the soup. You may skip this step if you prefer a thinner soup. 5. When the noodles are cooked, reduce the heat to a simmer and slowly pour the beaten eggs into the pot while stirring the soup in a swirling motion. This will create the signature egg ribbons in the soup. Make sure to pour the eggs slowly and steadily to achieve the desired consistency. 6. (Optional) If you have prepared the cornstarch slurry, stir it into the soup at this point. Allow the soup to simmer for another two minutes to further thicken it. 7. Remove the pot from the heat and taste the soup. If needed, add soy sauce for additional flavor. 8. Ladle the soup into bowls, making sure each serving has noodles and egg. 9. (Optional) For added flavor and visual appeal, garnish the soup with sliced scallions and a drizzle of sesame oil.

He revealed his identity for the first time in 2005. Bernstein never met Felt until this year, but praised his courage during an interview Friday on CNN's \\"American Morning.\\" Look, OPTIONS: - All the President's Men was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - American Morning was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Bernstein was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Bob Woodward was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - CNN was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - California was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Carl Bernstein was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Deep Throat was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - FBI was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Felt was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Mark Felt was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Richard Nixon was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - W. Mark Felt was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Washington Post was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Watergate was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Watergate scandal was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. - Woodward was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency.","output":"Look, the Watergate scandal was a constitutional crisis in a criminal presidency. It brought to light unprecedented political corruption and abuse of power within the highest levels of the United States government. As investigative journalists, Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward were determined to uncover the truth, navigating a maze of deceit, conspiracy, and cover-ups. Their determination would eventually transform American politics and journalism. W. Mark Felt, a high-ranking FBI official and the secret informant known as \\"Deep Throat,\\" was instrumental in helping Woodward and Bernstein connect the dots. His insider knowledge of the inner workings of the Nixon administration and the FBI enabled the reporters to trace the Watergate break-in back to the White House and reveal the extensive efforts made to cover it up. The moniker \\"Deep Throat\\" was a reference to the anonymous nature of Felt's revelations, which he shared with the journalists through a series of clandestine meetings. This cautious approach was necessary in an environment where the government went to great lengths to discredit and intimidate anyone who dared to challenge its authority. The Watergate scandal reached its peak when it became apparent that President Richard Nixon had actively participated in the conspiracy to obstruct justice. Faced with the prospect of impeachment, he chose to resign in disgrace, leaving the nation grappling with the aftermath of a president betraying the trust of the American people. As a consequence, public faith in government institutions was shaken to its core, leading to an era of skepticism and calls for greater transparency. \\"All the President's Men,\\" the book written by Woodward and Bernstein that chronicled their investigation into the Watergate scandal, served as both an exposé and a tribute to the dogged pursuit of truth in journalism. By recounting the story of Deep Throat and their relentless effort to uncover the facts, the authors showed that the free press is a powerful safeguard against corruption in a democratic society. This seminal work continues to inspire generations of journalists to seek the truth and hold those in power accountable, no matter how high the stakes may be. In the end, the Watergate scandal taught America a painful lesson about the importance of upholding the fundamental principles of the Constitution, such as checks and balances and the rule of law. The crisis was a reminder that democratic institutions can only function effectively if every citizen is committed to maintaining their integrity. In this regard, the courage of individuals like W. Mark Felt, Carl Bernstein, Bob Woodward, and many others who played a role in shining a light on the truth remains a lasting testament to the resilience of democracy itself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A:","output":"The famous book that Benjamin Franklin wrote is called \\"Poor Richard's Almanack.\\" While not a traditional book in the narrative sense, it was a yearly almanac published by Benjamin Franklin from 1732 to 1758, featuring a variety of content including weather forecasts, proverbs, poems, and practical advice. It is one of Franklin's most well-known accomplishments in the realm of literature and communication. Benjamin Franklin wrote \\"Poor Richard's Almanack\\" under the pseudonym \\"Richard Saunders.\\" At the time, a multitude of almanacs were available, and Franklin's written work needed to be unique to stand out and succeed. Franklin not only provided traditional almanac content but infused his own wit, insights, and humorous aphorisms that have stood the test of time. Many of these sayings have become famous and commonly used expressions, such as \\"A penny saved is a penny earned,\\" \\"An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure,\\" and \\"Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.\\" \\"Poor Richard's Almanack\\" was a significant source of income and success for Benjamin Franklin during its publication run. It sold around 10,000 copies every year, helping Franklin to develop his reputation as a clever writer and printing business owner. The almanac also served as a platform for Franklin to share his political and scientific ideas, using the popular publication to gain a wider audience for his thoughts. One of the most famous excerpts from \\"Poor Richard's Almanack\\" is \\"The Way to Wealth,\\" a collection of advice and wisdom on achieving success in life. This particular section has been reprinted and translated many times, serving as a stand-alone piece of literature that provides moral and practical guidance.

Write a title for this article: NEW ORLEANS, Louisiana (AP) -- U.S. Rep. William Jefferson easily defeated his fellow Democratic opponent in a runoff election Saturday, despite an ongoing federal bribery investigation. In complete but unofficial returns, Jefferson, Louisiana's first black congressman since Reconstruction, received 57 percent of the vote over state Rep. Karen Carter, who had 43 percent. Carter was unable to capitalize on a scandal that included allegations the FBI found 90,000 in bribe money in Jefferson's freezer. In a concession speech, Carter embraced family members and pledged to work with Jefferson, especially on the area's recovery from Hurricane Katrina. \\"I guess the people are happy with the status-quo,\\" she said. Jefferson was forced into the runoff against Carter when he failed to win 50 percent of the vote in a crowded open multiparty primary. Carter had sought to become the first black woman from Louisiana elected to Congress. He described his win as \\"a great moment, and I thank almighty God for making it possible.\\" He called for regional unity to focus on the hurricane recovery and in bringing back evacuees who are still scattered across the country. His presence in Washington could be embarrassing for Democrats, who won control of Congress on a platform of cleaning up corruption. In June, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, led a successful effort to remove Jefferson from the powerful House Ways and Means Committee as the probe unfolded. He was accused of taking bribes from a company seeking lucrative contracts in the Nigerian telecommunications market. He has not been charged with any crime and denies any wrongdoing. The scandal turned the race into a debate largely divided along racial lines, an age-old dynamic in this city that has intensified since Hurricane Katrina displaced large numbers of blacks and upended their demographic and political dominance. Whites, who overwhelmingly voted for Carter in the primary and have been her most enthusiastic financial backers, believed a Jefferson win would confirm this city's image as corrupt and untrustworthy as it asks the nation to fund its recovery from Katrina. City Councilman Oliver Thomas said Jefferson's success would make the recovery more difficult. \\"People are watching this election all around the country, and I can only imagine what they are thinking,\\" Thomas said. \\"It will be very difficult to go back to them and ask them to trust us with the money we need here.\\" Carter's campaign spokesman and father, Ken Carter, said he felt they had done all they could to compete against Jefferson, but regretted the tone of the campaign in the final stages. \\"Race is all too often a factor in campaigns in New Orleans,\\" Ken Carter said. \\"Here we had a candidate that tried to paint this young African-American woman as a pawn of the white establishment.\\" One white voter, George Christen, a registered independent, cast his ballot in a predominantly white precinct in the Algiers neighborhood, just across the Mississippi River from the French Quarter. \\"I just didn't want Jefferson in. Period,\\" said Christen, 42. \\"Jefferson is an embarrassment. He needs to be out.\\" Jefferson did get a vote from Jene Allen, who is black. \\"He started the job. Let him finish it,\\" said Allen, who wouldn't give her age. \\"I know Karen Carter would be the first black woman, but I think she played it dirty, too dirty.\\" Jefferson drew widespread support among blacks who are skeptical of the federal government's motives in its investigation of him. He repeatedly suggested the probe is groundless because he has yet to be indicted more than a year after the FBI raided his home in New Orleans. Carter, 37, raised nearly five times as much money as Jefferson, but she was largely outflanked in the endorsement game. Jefferson picked up the backing of Mayor Ray Nagin and other prominent black politicians. The endorsements spoke to Jefferson's solid footing in New Orleans politics. He arrived here in the 1970s as a Harvard-educated lawyer from rural north Louisiana, the sixth of 10 children brought up in a three-room country home. By 1980, he represented New Orleans in the state Senate. At 42, he became the first black from Louisiana in the House since Reconstruction. The law firm Jefferson founded became the largest black-owned practice in the South. He created a political organization, the Progressive Democrats, which fielded candidates for the school board, assessors' races, state House seats and mayoral contests. Before the bribery scandal erupted, Jefferson had climbed to the pinnacle of the Democratic Party. He was a confidant of former President Bill Clinton and held a seat on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee. Copyright 2006 The Associated Press.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Uneasy Alliance Is Taming One Insurgent Bastion Municipal services remain a wreck; local governments, while reviving, are still barely functioning; and years of fighting have damaged much of Ramadi. The insurgency in Anbar — a mix of Islamic militants, former Baathists and recalcitrant tribesmen — still thrives among the province’s overwhelmingly Sunni population, killing American and Iraqi security forces and civilians alike. [This was underscored by three suicide car-bomb attacks in Ramadi on Monday and Tuesday, in which at least 15 people were killed and 47 were wounded, American officials said. Eight American service members — five marines and three soldiers — were killed in two attacks on Thursday and Friday in Anbar, the American military said.] Furthermore, some American officials readily acknowledge that they have entered an uncertain marriage of convenience with the tribes, some of whom were themselves involved in the insurgency, to one extent or another. American officials are also negotiating with elements of the 1920 Revolution Brigades, a leading insurgent group in Anbar, to join their fight against Al Qaeda. These sudden changes have raised questions about the ultimate loyalties of the United States’ new allies. “One day they’re laying I.E.D.’s, the next they’re police collecting a pay check,” said Lt. Thomas R. Mackesy, an adviser to an Iraqi Army unit in Juwayba, east of Ramadi, referring to improvised explosive devices. And it remains unclear whether any of the gains in Anbar will transfer to other troubled areas of Iraq — like Baghdad, Diyala Province, Mosul and Kirkuk, where violence rages and the ethnic and sectarian landscape is far more complicated. Still, the progress has inspired an optimism in the American command that, among some officials, borders on giddiness. It comes after years of fruitless efforts to drive a wedge between moderate resistance fighters and those, like Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, who seem beyond compromise. “There are some people who would say we’ve won the war out here,” said Col. John. A. Koenig, a planning officer for the Marines who oversees governing and economic development issues in Anbar. “I’m cautiously optimistic as we’re going forward.” For most of the past few years, the Government Center in downtown Ramadi, the seat of the provincial government, was under near-continual siege by insurgents, who reduced it to little more than a bullet-ridden bunker of broken concrete, sandbags and trapped marines. Entering meant sprinting from an armored vehicle to the front door of the building to evade snipers’ bullets. Now, however, the compound and nearby buildings are being renovated to create offices for the provincial administration, council and governor. Hotels are being built next door for the waves of visitors the government expects once it is back in business. On the roof of the main building, Capt. Jason Arthaud, commander of Company B, First Battalion, Sixth Marines, said the building had taken no sniper fire since November. “Just hours of peace and quiet,” he deadpanned. “And boredom.” Violence has fallen swiftly throughout Ramadi and its sprawling rural environs, residents and American and Iraqi officials said. Last summer, the American military recorded as many as 25 violent acts a day in the Ramadi region, ranging from shootings and kidnappings to roadside bombs and suicide attacks. In the past several weeks, the average has dropped to four acts of violence a day, American military officials said. On a recent morning, American and Iraqi troops, accompanied by several police officers, went on a foot patrol through a market in the Malaab neighborhood of Ramadi. Only a couple of months ago, American and Iraqi forces would enter the area only in armored vehicles. People stopped and stared. The sight of police and military forces in the area, particularly on foot, was still novel. The new calm is eerie and unsettling, particularly for anyone who knew the city even several months ago. “The complete change from night to day gives me pause,” said Capt. Brice Cooper, 26, executive officer of Company B, First Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, First Infantry Division, which has been stationed in the city and its outskirts since last summer. “A month and a half ago we were getting shot up. Now we’re doing civil affairs work.” The turnabout began last September, when a federation of tribes in the Ramadi area came together as the Anbar Salvation Council to oppose the fundamentalist militants of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Among the council’s founders were members of the Abu Ali Jassem tribe, based in a rural area of northern Ramadi. The tribe’s leader, Sheik Tahir Sabbar Badawie, said in a recent interview that members of his tribe had fought in the insurgency that kept the Americans pinned down on their bases in Anbar for most of the last four years. “If your country was occupied by Iraq, would you fight?” he asked. “Enough said.” But while the anti-American sheiks in Anbar and Al Qaeda both opposed the Americans, their goals were different. The sheiks were part of a relatively moderate front that sought to drive the Americans out of Iraq; some were also fighting to restore Sunni Arab power. But Al Qaeda wanted to go even further and impose a fundamentalist Islamic state in Anbar, a plan that many of the sheiks did not share. Al Qaeda’s fighters began to use killing, intimidation and financial coercion to divide the tribes and win support for their agenda. They killed about 210 people in the Abu Ali Jassem tribe alone and kidnapped others, demanding ransoms as high as 65,000 per person, Sheik Badawie said. For all the sheiks’ hostility toward the Americans, they realized that they had a bigger enemy, or at least one that needed to be fought first, as a matter of survival. The council sought financial and military support from the Iraqi and American governments. In return the sheiks volunteered hundreds of tribesmen for duty as police officers and agreed to allow the construction of joint American-Iraqi police and military outposts throughout their tribal territories. A similar dynamic is playing out elsewhere in Anbar, a desert region the size of New York State that stretches west of Baghdad to the Syrian and Jordanian borders. Tribal cooperation with the American and Iraqi commands has led to expanded police forces in the cities of Husayba, Hit, Rutba, Baghdadi and Falluja, officials say. With the help of the Anbar sheiks, the military equation immediately became simpler for the Americans in Ramadi. The number of enemies they faced suddenly diminished, American and Iraqi officials said. They were able to move more freely through large areas. With the addition of the tribal recruits, the Americans had enough troops to build and operate garrisons in areas they cleared, many of which had never seen any government security presence before. And the Americans were now fighting alongside people with a deep knowledge of the local population and terrain, and with a sense of duty, vengeance and righteousness. “We know this area, we know the best way to talk to the people and get information from them,” said Capt. Hussein Abd Nusaif, a police commander in a neighborhood in western Ramadi, who carries a Kalashnikov with an Al Capone-style “snail drum” magazine. “We are not afraid of Al Qaeda. We will fight them anywhere and anytime.” Beginning last summer and continuing through March, the American-led joint forces pressed into the city, block by block, and swept the farmlands on its outskirts. In many places the troops met fierce resistance. Scores of American and Iraqi security troops were killed or wounded. The Ramadi region is essentially a police state now, with some 6,000 American troops, 4,000 Iraqi soldiers and 4,500 Iraqi police officers, including an auxiliary police force of about 2,000, all local tribesmen, known as the Provincial Security Force. The security forces are garrisoned in more than 65 police stations, military bases and joint American-Iraqi combat outposts, up from no more than 10 a year ago. The population of the city is officially about 400,000, though the current number appears to be much lower. To help control the flow of traffic and forestall attacks, the American military has installed an elaborate system of barricades and checkpoints. In some of the enclaves created by this system, which American commanders frequently call “gated communities,” no vehicles except bicycles and pushcarts are allowed for fear of car bombs. American commanders see the progress in Anbar as a bellwether for the rest of country. “One of the things I worry about in Baghdad is we won’t have the time to do the same kind of thing,” Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, commander of day-to-day war operations in Iraq, said in an interview here. Yet the fact that Anbar is almost entirely Sunni and not riven by the same sectarian feuds as other violent places, like Baghdad and Diyala Province, has helped to establish order. Elsewhere, security forces are largely Shiite and are perceived by many Sunnis as part of the problem. In Anbar, however, the new police force reflects the homogeneous face of the province and appears to enjoy the support of the people. Military commanders say they cannot completely account for the whereabouts of the insurgency. They say they believe that many guerrillas have been killed, while others have gone underground, laid down their arms or migrated to other parts of Anbar, particularly the corridor between Ramadi and Falluja, the town of Karma north of Falluja and the sprawling rural zones around Falluja, including Zaidon and Amariyat al-Falluja on the banks of the Euphrates River. American forces come under attack in these areas every day. Still other guerrillas, the commanders acknowledge, have joined the police force, sneaking through a vetting procedure that is set up to catch only known suspects. Many insurgents “are fighting for a different side now,” said Brig. Gen. Mark Gurganus, commander of ground forces in Anbar. “I think that’s where the majority have gone.” But American commanders say they are not particularly worried about infiltrators among the new recruits. Many of the former insurgents now in the police, they say, were probably low-level operatives who were mainly in it for the money and did relatively menial tasks, like planting roadside bombs. The speed of the buildup has led to other problems. Hiring has outpaced the building of police academies, meaning that many new officers have been deployed with little or no training. Without enough uniforms, many new officers patrol in civilian clothes, some with their heads wrapped in scarves or covered in balaclavas to conceal their identities. They look no different than the insurgents shown in mujahedeen videos. Commanders seem to regard these issues as a necessary cost of quickly building a police force in a political environment that is, in the words of Colonel Koenig, “sort of like looking through smoke.” The police force, they say, has been the most critical component of the new security plan in Anbar. Yet, oversight of the police forces by American forces and the central Iraqi government is weak, leaving open the possibility that some local leaders are using newly armed tribal members as their personal death squads to settle old scores. Several American officers who work with the Iraqi police said a lot of police work was conducted out of their view, particularly at night. “It’s like the Mafia,” one American soldier in Juwayba said. General Odierno said, “We have to watch them very closely to make sure we’re not forming militias.” But there is a new sense of commitment by the police, American and Iraqi officials say, in part because they are patrolling their own neighborhoods. Many were motivated to join after they or their communities were attacked by Al Qaeda, and their successes have made them an even greater target of insurgent car bombs and suicide attacks. Abd Muhammad Khalaf, 28, a policeman in the Jazeera district on Ramadi’s northern edge, is typical. He joined the police after Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia killed two of his brothers, he said. “I will die when God wills it,” he said. “But before I die, I will support my friends and kill some terrorists.” Some tribal leaders now working with the Americans say they harbor deep resentment toward the Shiite-led administration of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, accusing it of pursuing a sectarian agenda. Yet they also say they are invested in the democratic process now. After boycotting the national elections in 2005, many are now planning to participate in the next round of provincial elections, which have yet to be scheduled, as a way to build on the political and military gains they have made in recent months. “Since I was a little boy, I have seen nothing but warfare — against the Kurds, Iranians, Kuwait, the Americans,” Sheik Badawie said. “We are tired of war. We are going to fight through the ballot box.” Already, tribal leaders are participating in local councils that have been formed recently throughout the Ramadi area under the guidance of the American military. Iraqi and American officials say the sheiks’ embrace of representative government reflects the new realities of power in Anbar. “Out here it’s been, ‘Who can defend his people?’ ” said Brig. Gen. John R. Allen, deputy commanding general of coalition forces in Anbar. “After the war it’s, ‘Who was able to reconstruct?’ ” Indeed, American and Iraqi officials say that to hold on to the security gains and the public’s support, they must provide services to residents in areas they have tamed. But successful development, they argue, will depend on closing the divide between the Shiite-dominated government in Baghdad, which has long ignored the province, and the local leadership in Anbar, which has long tried to remain independent from the capital. If that fails, they say, the Iraqi and American governments may have helped to organize and arm a potent enemy.

And the answer is?","output":"The person who became the British Prime Minister in June 2007 is Gordon Brown. James Gordon Brown was born in Glasgow, Scotland, on February 20, 1951. He is a British Labour Party politician who served as the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from June 27, 2007, until May 11, 2010. He succeeded Tony Blair as both the Labour Party leader and the Prime Minister after Blair decided to step down from both positions.  Before becoming Prime Minister, Brown held various critical positions in the British government. He had a long and distinguished career in politics, which began in 1983 when he was elected to Parliament as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Dunfermline East, a position he held until 2005 when the constituency boundaries were changed and he became MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath. Most notably, Gordon Brown served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Tony Blair's government from 1997 to 2007. As Chancellor, Brown was responsible for the United Kingdom's economic and financial matters. During his tenure, he was able to maintain economic stability and presided over a period of sustained growth. Brown was also instrumental in granting the Bank of England operational independence and played a significant role in shaping the UK's monetary and fiscal policies. As Prime Minister, Gordon Brown faced several challenges, including managing the aftermath of the global financial crisis, which hit the United Kingdom hard, and addressing issues such as global poverty, climate change, and international terrorism. Brown's government introduced measures to stabilize the UK's financial system and help the country recover from the economic downturn. Additionally, Brown played an essential role on the international stage by hosting the G20 summit in London in 2009, where leaders discussed measures to coordinate their responses to the global financial crisis. Brown's tenure as Prime Minister also had its fair share of controversies and setbacks. Among them were criticisms of his leadership style, handling of the Parliamentary expenses scandal, and loss of public support due to the Labour Party's handling of the Iraq War and the financial crisis. Gordon Brown's time in office came to an end after the 2010 general election, in which the Labour Party failed to secure a majority. The Conservative Party, led by David Cameron, managed to form a coalition government with the Liberal Democrats, which marked the end of Brown's term as Prime Minister. Brown then stepped down as the leader of the Labour Party and later retired from British politics in 2015."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: The move follows an investigation into Indonesian abattoirs by Australia's ABC broadcaster, which showed graphic footage of animals being mistreated. It prompted a public outcry and demands for the government to act. Last week, Canberra suspended exports to abattoirs shown in the programme, but now it has issued a blanket ban. Indonesian officials have rebuffed claims of widespread animal cruelty in their abattoirs. Bayu Krisnamurti, the Vice Minister of Agriculture, told the BBC that the coverage had created a negative perception of Indonesia overseas. \\"I think ABC practised unfair journalism, only the bad practices were portrayed. We see this as an isolated incident. \\"It's against the law in Indonesia to be so harsh and cruel to animals. Indonesian regulations explicity say we must practise animal welfare in handling animals in the slaughterhouse.\\" He acknowledged that it could hurt the country's ability to procure cattle. He said that New Zealand and the US were being looked at as possible alternative suppliers, but Jakarta had not yet contacted either. The ban is the result of public revulsion and outrage at the gruesome footage from Indonesia's abattoirs that was broadcast last week in an ABC TV documentary, says the BBC's Nick Bryant in Sydney. It showed steers being whipped, beaten and slashed repeatedly, and suffering terrible pain before they are slaughtered. Read more from Nick Bryant's blog Australia first announced a ban on live exports to the 12 abattoirs featured in the programme. But the public demanded more, signing online petitions to halt the trade with Indonesia and pressing lawmakers in Canberra to bring in a complete ban, our correspondent says. Australia's Agriculture Minister Joe Ludwig said Canberra would impose a six-month initial suspension on shipments to Indonesia. \\"A sustainable live cattle export industry must be built on the ability to safeguard the welfare of the animals. The trade to Indonesia will only recommence when we are certain industry is able to comply with that.\\" Lyn White, who filmed the graphic images, and is the campaign director for Animals Australia, welcomed the move. \\"There has been an extraordinary outpouring of rage that our cattle have been treated like this and have been supplied for such treatment. So this is a first step,\\" she told Australian television. An early indication that a blanket ban was about to come into effect came on Tuesday, when about 2,000 cattle were not allowed to board a ship in Western Australia that was about to set sail for Indonesia. Australia exports more than 700,000 cattle each year - the vast majority to Indonesia. Australian farmers have warned that a ban would destroy many rural livelihoods. Butchers have already reported that beef sales are down by up to 15%. But Luke Bowen from the Northern Territory Cattlemen's Association said he accepted the government's action, even though it would prove costly. \\"It is going to hurt, we know that,\\" he said. \\"There's tens of thousands of cattle in the supply chains now. But we have to stay focused on the animal welfare outcome, and we're very encouraged by the government's commitment to the trade in the long term.\\"","output":"An Australian news channel showed a video of animals being mistreated in Indonesian slaughterhouses. This made many people in Australia very upset and angry. They asked the government to do something about it. Last week, the government stopped sending animals to the places shown in the video.

Some people in Indonesia don't think this is fair, because they believe only a few places are treating animals badly, not all of them. But for now, Australia won't send any more animals to Indonesia. This might cause problems for Australian farmers, who were selling a lot of cattle to Indonesia, and for Indonesian people looking for other places to get their meat."},{"instruction":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran. Alexander Vershbow, a former deputy secretary general of NATO and former U.S. ambassador to Russia, told VOA Brzezinski's wisdom also guided U.S. and NATO policy in the post-Cold War period. “On one hand, listening to the appeals of countries like Poland, like Czechoslovakia, like Hungary, to become part of the Western family, which they were denied 70 years ago ... but also reaching out to Russia, and trying to help Russia become an integral part of the European family, the common European house, as [former Soviet leader Mikhail] Gorbachev described it,” Vershbow said. Following his work in the White House, Brzezinski continued to be an influential voice on foreign policy matters.

The paper that Randy wrote was worse than the paper of Christopher, since","output":"Randy's paper lacked several key elements that made Christopher's work stand out as superior. To begin with, the structure and organization of Randy's paper were poorly executed, causing the readers to have difficulty navigating through the various points and arguments presented. The absence of a clear introduction and conclusion section further complicated this issue, leaving the audience uncertain about the central idea and the overarching purpose of the paper. Conversely, Christopher's paper followed a logical progression and was well-organized, allowing the readers to easily comprehend different sections and ideas. The introduction effectively set the context and provided a concise thesis statement that guided the reader throughout the paper. Additionally, Christopher's conclusion was strong, leaving the audience with a clear understanding of the purpose of the paper and the implications of the findings. Another reason Randy's paper was worse than Christopher's was due to the inconsistent and weak references provided. Randy did not include pertinent research and evidence to support his arguments, which considerably weakened the credibility of his conclusions. Moreover, there were numerous instances where Randy's sources were outdated, of questionable reputation, or taken entirely out of context. These issues combined led to a paper that was undermined by its own inadequacies in terms of evidence and citations. On the other hand, Christopher's paper was carefully researched, and every claim made was substantiated by strong and relevant scientific sources. By doing this, Christopher not only boosted the credibility of his own work but also demonstrated an ability to synthesize information from various sources, displaying an in-depth understanding of the topic. Beyond referencing issues, Randy's paper underperformed in comparison to Christopher's because of the lack of critical analysis and original thought. Randy's paper primarily summarized existing literature and merely rehashed prevalent ideas with little effort to contribute novel insights or evaluate existing ones critically. This superficial approach meant that the paper lacked originality and substance, devaluing its overall significance. In contrast, Christopher's paper demonstrated a profound level of critical thinking, which allowed him to identify the gaps in existing research and to present his own unique perspective on the topic. By integrating recent and relevant findings, Christopher was able to weave an argument that addressed current debates in the field, effectively showcasing his aptitude for engaging complex issues and proposing innovative solutions. Lastly, Randy's writing style was convoluted and laced with grammatical errors, which detracted from the overall readability of his work. The lack of clarity and coherence in Randy's writing made it challenging for readers to engage with his ideas, diminishing potential connections and the impact of his arguments. In comparison, Christopher's paper was written with great care, in a clear and concise manner that navigated effortlessly between complex ideas. The polished writing invited the readers to engage with the work, making the paper more appealing and digestible. In conclusion, Randy's paper was worse than Christopher's for several reasons, including the lack of proper organization, inadequate referencing, minimal critical analysis, and poor writing quality. In contrast, Christopher's paper stood out as a well-crafted piece of work that showcased his research capabilities, critical thinking skills, and writing prowess. As a result, Christopher's work is the clear winner in this comparison, demonstrating that attention to detail, strong evidence, insightful analysis, and polished writing are essential components of a successful paper."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

On the previous evening,--March 12th,--the monotony of the camp had been unexpectedly disturbed by the arrival, from the direction of Salt Lake City, of a horseman completely exhausted by fatigue and cold, who proved to be no other than Mr. Kane, whose mission to the Mormons by way of California was at that time totally unknown to the army. The next morning he introduced himself to the Governor, was received as his guest, and remained in conference with him throughout the day. What was the character of their communication is unknown, except by inference from its results. When presented to Judge Eckels, on the following day, Mr. Kane exhibited to him the letters he bore from the President, and other letters, also, from Brigham Young, accrediting him as a negotiator in the existing difficulties. To General Johnston he showed nothing; nor did the Governor, to the knowledge of the camp, acquaint either that officer or any other person with the purport of his business.

Sentence 1: Had they any clue, or 103 would the whole thing remain in the category of undiscovered crimes?

Sentence 2: Did they seriously think it would remain under wraps? This sentence implies doubt about whether they believed the crime would stay hidden or not be discovered. Now, let's analyze the logical relationship between the two sentences: If the first sentence is true, it means that either they had a clue or the crime remains undiscovered. In both cases, the second sentence can be true, as it is asking about their belief regarding whether the crime would remain hidden. a) If they had a clue: They could still doubt whether the crime would remain under wraps. b) If the crime remains undiscovered: They could have thought that it might be discovered eventually, thus creating doubt about the crime staying under wraps.

With a 38-35 victory over the New York Giants at Giants Stadium Saturday night, the New England Patriots became the second team in the modern era of the National Football League to go undefeated (16-0) in the regular season. The only other team to have achieved this feat was the Miami Dolphins in 1972, who were 14-0 due to a different regular season structure at the time. Can we draw the following conclusion? The Patriots and the Dolphins played the same number of games.","output":"No, we cannot draw the conclusion that the New England Patriots and the Miami Dolphins played the same number of games when they had their respective undefeated seasons. It's true that both teams completed their regular seasons with undefeated win-loss records - the Patriots with 16-0, and the Dolphins with 14-0. However, the total number of games played by each team in their respective regular seasons is different. The Patriots played 16 games in their regular 2007 season, while the Dolphins played just 14 games in their regular 1972 season. This disparity is due to the different structures of the NFL regular season in each of those years. In 1972, when the Dolphins achieved their perfect season, the NFL regular season lasted just 14 games. The NFL later expanded the regular season to 16 games in 1978, which was the structure in 2007 when the Patriots had their undefeated regular season. Each team also played in playoff games, culminating with a Super Bowl victory for the Miami Dolphins in 1973 during Super Bowl VII. Comparatively, the New England Patriots advanced to the Super Bowl after their perfect 2007 regular season but lost to the New York Giants in Super Bowl XLII. The number of playoff games played varies based on how many games the team had to win to reach the Super Bowl, but that number is not reflected in the regular season record. In conclusion, although both the 1972 Miami Dolphins and the 2007 New England Patriots achieved the remarkable feat of going undefeated in their respective regular seasons, they did not play the same number of regular-season games due to differences in the NFL's regular-season structure at the time.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 19:24 EST, 20 October 2013 | UPDATED: 19:24 EST, 20 October 2013 A Catholic church has beensold to the Muslim community after a decline in worshippers. St Peter’s has closed its doors to Christian worshippers following the recent sale. Despite the sale, the church said that the local parish, Cobridge, in Stoke-on-Trent, would continue to exist and money from the sale will be used to benefit parishioners. A Catholic church in Stoke-on-Trent has been sold to the Muslim community after a decline in worshippers The identity of the buyers, who are part of the Muslim community, has not been disclosed. Churchgoers have declined in recent years, with the number of people attending","output":"St Peter's Catholic Church dropping significantly. This decline in attendance can be attributed to various factors, including the general trend of decreasing religiosity in the UK, an aging congregation, and the challenges posed by the modern world, such as busy schedules, social media, and the rise of secular values. Many have expressed mixed emotions at St Peter's closure and its subsequent repurposing as a place of worship for the Muslim community. Some parishioners mourn the loss of their long-standing spiritual home, while others welcome the opportunity to forge new interfaith relationships and find common ground with their Muslim neighbors. Furthermore, it is widely acknowledged that the sale of the church has ensured that the building will still serve a meaningful purpose as a place of worship, rather than being converted into a commercial or residential property. As for the local Catholic community of Cobridge, the sale of St Peter's has generated much-needed funds, which will be used to provide resources for the remaining members of the congregation. This will include investing in outreach programs designed to reinvigorate the faith of lapsed Catholics and attract new adherents to the church. Additionally, the funding will support ongoing maintenance to the parish's other facilities and charitable endeavors within the local community. The Muslim community, who will soon call St Peter's their own place of worship, have expressed their gratitude and eagerness to establish a warm and welcoming environment for all who wish to attend. They have emphasized their commitment to promoting understanding, tolerance, and respect between the different faith groups in Stoke-on-Trent and celebrating the city's diverse and multicultural heritage. In many ways, the story of St Peter's, while bittersweet for its longstanding Catholic congregation, is emblematic of a broader trend in post-industrial cities, such as Stoke-on-Trent, where dwindling resources and changing demographics have necessitated innovative solutions to repurpose underutilized religious buildings. Rather than seeing these transformations as a loss, it is important to view them as an opportunity for growth, progression, and unity among different faiths. Throughout history, religious institutions have played a crucial role in offering comfort, hope, and a sense of belonging to their adherents. It is essential that these institutions evolve and adapt to the needs of their communities, even if that means transitioning from one faith to another. The sale of St Peter's Catholic Church to the Muslim community demonstrates the possibility of fostering understanding, cooperation, and mutual support between different religious groups, ultimately showcasing how the power of faith can transcend individual beliefs and serve as a unifying force in society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: As Internet users become more dependent on the Internet to store information, are people remember less? If you know your computer will save information, why store it in your own personal memory, your brain? Experts are wondering if the Internet is changing what we remember and how. In a recent study, Professor Betsy Sparrow conducted some experiments. She and her research team wanted to know the Internet is changing memory. In the first experiment, they gave people 40 unimportant facts to type into a computer. The first group of people understood thatthe computer would save the information. The second group understood that the computer would not save it. Later, the second group remembered the information better. People in the first group knew they could find the information again, so they did not try to remember it. In another experiment, the researchers gave people facts to remember, and told them where to find the information on the Internet. The information was in a specific computer folder  . Surprisingly, people later remember the folder location   better than the facts. When people use the Internet, they do not remember the information. Rather, they remember how to find it. This is called \\"transactive memory  \\". According to Sparrow, we are not becoming people with poor memories as a result of the Internet. Instead, computer users are developing stronger transactive memories; that is, people are learning how to organize huge quantities of information so that they are able to access it at a later date. This doesn't mean we are becoming either more or less intelligent, but there is no doubt that the way we use memory is changing. Question: What can we learn about the first experiment? - Sparrow's team typed the information into a computer. - The two groups remembered the information equally well. - The first group did not try to remember the formation. - The second group did not understand the information. A:","output":"We can learn from the first experiment that the first group did not try to remember the information because they knew the computer would save it. On the other hand, the second group remembered the information better since they understood that the computer would not save it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Late on the next Sunday afternoon Gifford had gone for a country walk which he had arranged to bring him round in time for the evening service at the little village church of Wynford standing just outside the park boundary.  His way took him by well-remembered field-paths which, although towards the end of his walk darkness had set in, he had no difficulty in tracing.  The last field he crossed brought him to a by-road joining the highway which ran through Wynford, the junction being about a quarter of a mile from the church.  As he neared the stile which admitted to the road he saw, on the other side of the hedge and showing just above it, the head of a man.  At the sound of his footsteps the man quickly turned, and, as for a moment the fitful moonlight caught his face, Gifford was sure he recognized Gervase Henshaw.  But he took no notice and kept on his way to the stile, which he crossed and gained the road.  As he did so he glanced back.  A horse and trap was waiting there with Henshaw in it.

Donald took the lead in the musical instead of Ryan because","output":"Donald took the lead in the musical instead of Ryan because he showcased exceptional talent, dedication, and innate understanding of the role, ultimately impressing the director and earning him the coveted position. From the outset, it was clear that both Donald and Ryan were strong contenders for the lead role in the musical. However, there were significant differences in their personal qualities and skills that ultimately led to the director's decision. Here are some of the factors that tilted the balance in Donald's favor: 1. Acting skills: While both contestants were undoubtedly talented, Donald demonstrated a powerful stage presence and a rare ability to connect with the audience. His portrayal of the character was nuanced and believable, displaying a deep understanding of the character's emotions, motivations, and complexities. In contrast, Ryan's performance, although commendable, sometimes lacked the depth and authenticity required for the lead character. 2. Singing abilities: The musical demanded an actor with strong vocal prowess and a wide range. Donald exceeded these expectations by delivering soulful, pitch-perfect renditions of each song. He showed his adaptability and versatility in different music styles and genres. Ryan, although possessing a pleasant voice, was evidently less proficient in hitting challenging notes and maintaining their stability, which detracted from the overall impact of the performance. 3. Dancing expertise: In addition to their acting and singing capabilities, the lead role required a high level of mastery in dancing. Donald's performance revealed an extensive background in dance, as he navigated complex choreography with ease and grace, naturally embodying the role. On the other hand, Ryan struggled to keep up with the dance routines, and his movements lacked precision and fluidity. 4. Commitment and dedication: Throughout the audition process, Donald consistently proved his commitment to the role. He was the first to arrive at rehearsals, the last to leave, and always came prepared and eager to learn. He took constructive criticism well, made improvements based on feedback, and never hesitated to step up and help others when necessary. This level of dedication was unmatched by Ryan, who occasionally missed rehearsals and seemed less focused on refining his performance. 5. Professionalism and team spirit: A successful production requires a collaborative spirit among the cast and crew. Donald's congenial nature and willingness to support his fellow cast members made him the ideal candidate for the lead role. He was quick to offer assistance, share tips, and uplift his co-actors, engendering camaraderie and mutual respect within the group. Ryan, unfortunately, did not display the same warmth and collaboration, coming across as somewhat reserved and focused solely on his individual performance. 6. A better fit for the character: Ultimately, the director felt that Donald captured the essence of the lead character more accurately and authentically. He possessed an innate connection to the character's emotional journey and conveyed this through his performance, making him an ideal fit for the role. In conclusion, while both Donald and Ryan demonstrated talent and potential, Donald's exceptional acting, singing, and dancing skills, together with his unwavering dedication, professionalism, and strong collaborative spirit, set him apart as the clear choice for the lead role in the musical."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chinese civilisation is traditionally said to have originated in central China, by the Yellow River, when the first Xia Dynasty ruled the region around 4,000 years ago. But a separate, complex society may have originated around 2,400 years earlier in the north-east of the country and gradually spread south, a study has suggested. Until now the Hongshan culture had not been credited as being the source of Chinese civilisation because it was understood to have been a small, remote and self-contained culture miles away from the river. Chinese culture and civilisation is traditionally said to have originated by the Yellow River (pictured) when the first Xia Dynasty ruled the region, but new research suggests a complex civilisation not only originated around 2,400 years earlier, it may have been rooted across Inner Mongolia instead This would have made it an ideal environment for the OPTIONS: - China people to live. - Chinese people to live. - Hongshan people to live. - Inner Mongolia people to live. - Xia Dynasty people to live. - Yellow River people to live.","output":"Hongshan people to live. The presence of this advanced civilization in Inner Mongolia presented a unique perspective on the timeline and origins of Chinese civilization. As archaeologists and historians continue to excavate and interpret the findings, they began to unravel the mysteries surrounding the Hongshan culture and its potential impact on later dynasties. This revelation led to an internal debate among scholars and the Chinese people, challenging conventional wisdom on China's historical narrative. The expanded understanding of the Hongshan culture's role in Chinese civilization encouraged researchers to rethink their approach to the origins and progression of Chinese history. In the story's first ending, the Hongshan culture's strong influence on the formation of the Xia Dynasty and other subsequent dynasties is acknowledged. The Chinese people come to embrace this complex and ancient society as an integral part of their civilization and cultural heritage. This reevaluation of history bridges the regional divides between central China and the northeast, fostering a stronger sense of national unity. The Hongshan culture's advanced technologies and innovations spread throughout the region, providing a foundation for the flourishing of other Chinese dynasties. The influence of the Hongshan can be seen in various aspects of Chinese art, architecture, and rituals, reinforcing its status as a prominent force in Chinese history. The significance of the Yellow River to China's development remains intact, as both regions contribute to building a broader understanding of China's cultural roots. In the story's second ending, the Hongshan culture is recognized as a separate civilization parallel to the origin of the Xia Dynasty. The investigations and discoveries surrounding the Hongshan mystery lead to the conclusion that two distinct cultures blossomed independently. However, a certain degree of mutual influence between these two complex societies cannot be denied. As a result, both central China and Inner Mongolia come to appreciate their unique contributions to the tapestry of Chinese civilization. History enthusiasts and researchers delve into uncovering the intricacies of these parallel societies, their similarities, and differences, and the ways in which their respective histories intertwined. Regardless of which ending is chosen, the discovery of the Hongshan culture's significance serves as a testament to the rich and complex history of the Chinese civilization. Over time, the Chinese people accept the idea that their civilization may have multiple origins. The appreciation of multiple roots encourages a deeper understanding and respect for the diverse cultural expressions that exist in modern China. These endings invite the exploration of history through a multifaceted lens, allowing for a more nuanced perspective on the development of human societies. Additionally, the acceptance of diverse origins fosters an environment for the continued growth of knowledge and understanding, contributing to the thriving and dynamic culture of China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This rimfire cartridge, often abbreviated as .22 WMR or .22 Magnum, was introduced by Winchester in 1959. It offers greater performance than the traditional .22 Long Rifle cartridge, with higher bullet velocities and increased energy levels. The .22 WMR was initially loaded with a 40-grain (2.6 g) bullet weight, with velocities in the 2,000 feet per second (610 m/s) range from a rifle barrel. Nowadays, the cartridge is available with various bullet weights, ranging from 50 grains (3.2 g) at 1,530 feet per second (470 m/s) to 30 grains (1.9 g) at 2,200 feet per second (670 m/s).

In the common implementation, a gasoline engine is connected to a traditional transmission, which is in turn connected to an epicyclic gear system's planet carrier. An electric motor/generator is connected to the central \`\`sun'' gear, which is normally un-driven in typical epicyclic systems. Both sources of power can be fed into the transmission's output at the same time, splitting power between them. In common examples, between one-quarter and half of the engine's power can be fed into the sun gear. Depending on the implementation, the transmission in front of the epicyclic system may be greatly simplified, or eliminated completely. EVTs are capable of continuously modulating output/input speed ratios like mechanical CVTs, but offer the distinct benefit of being able to also apply power from two different sources to one output, as well as potentially reducing overall complexity dramatically. is the transmission and motor the same thing?

As voters headed to polls, accusations flew over Zahra Shahid Hussain's death. Sources said an execution-style attack on the eve of the election killed Hussain, a senior vice president of the Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI. The party made headlines after nationwide elections on May 11, alleging vote rigging in Karachi and elsewhere.

The most important thing to remember is to keep it short, detailed, and attention-grabbing.","output":"Step 1: Research the target audience Before creating the advertisement, research the target audience to understand their needs, preferences, and lifestyle. This step ensures that the advertisement effectively attracts potential pet owners.

They formed in 1985 and broke up in 1998 before reuniting in 2010, with various lineups since. As of 2016, they operate as a trio with Abrams, Calderon and Adam Emil. Kevin Thornton left the group in October 1998 to pursue the ministry. He became a licensed minister, and has since served as an evangelist, youth pastor and worship leader at his home church, Without Walls Church, in Fort Worth, Texas. He operates Kevin Thornton Ministries in Texas. In 2008, he released a solo album, Conversions, blending contemporary hip-hop/rap with gospel and soul music.  Sam Watters pursued a career as a record producer, achieving success producing for Jessica Simpson, Celine Dion, Fantasia, Anastacia, Natasha Bedingfield, Kelly Clarkson, 98 Degrees, Blake Lewis, and others. Watters is a member of the production/songwriting team The Runaways, which also includes Rico Love, Wayne Wilkins, Ryan Tedder, and Louis Biancaniello. He married R&B singer and former American Idol contestant Tamyra Gray in 2006.  Mark Calderon worked with artists such as Stevie Brock, whose 2002 remake of \\"All 4 Love\\" reached number 1 on the Disney charts; and with IPV, who is signed with Wright Entertainment and had songs played on the television series House and Knight Rider. In 1992, Calderon married Lisa Smedley-Calderon, who was formerly Color Me Badd's fashion stylist.  In 2001, Bryan Abrams released a solo album entitled Welcome to Me.

Available choices: A). yes B). it is not possible to tell C). no","output":"C). no Given the premise \\"I didn't know about this, I swear,\\" we can infer that the speaker is claiming to not have prior knowledge about the subject. Assuming this statement to be true, it directly conflicts with the hypothesis \\"I knew all about this.\\" Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis, and the answer would be C). no. The existence of opposing statements, in this case, between the premise and the hypothesis, helps build the foundation for a counter-argument against the hypothesis. As per standard rules of logic, one cannot simultaneously have complete knowledge and lack knowledge about the same subject. In this case, the speaker's insistence on not knowing about the subject would strengthen their opposition to the hypothesis. To elaborate further, let's break down the two statements: 1. Premise: \\"I didn't know about this, I swear.\\"  The speaker asserts that they were unaware of the subject, and they emphasize this claim by swearing. This suggests they feel strongly about ensuring that the listener understands that they had no prior knowledge of the matter. 2. Hypothesis: \\"I knew all about this.\\" The hypothesis, on the other hand, implies that the speaker had complete knowledge of the subject. This notion directly contradicts the premise, making it impossible for the premise to entail the hypothesis. In conclusion, given the true premise \\"I didn't know about this, I swear,\\" it does not entail the hypothesis \\"I knew all about this.\\" The nature of these opposing statements eliminates the possibility of the premise supporting the hypothesis, and therefore, the answer is C). no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - by themselves  - in fours  - in threes  - in pairs  A: Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question, I will research how sunspots occur and then select the most appropriate choice from the given options. Step 1: Research how sunspots occur. Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the surface of the sun that appear darker than the surrounding areas. They are caused by concentration of magnetic field lines which inhibits convection, resulting in reduced temperature compared to the surrounding area. Step 2: Identify which choice best represents how sunspots occur. Based on the research, sunspots occur due to magnetic field line concentration. Now, let's review the given choices and select the most appropriate one: - by themselves: This doesn't directly explain how sunspots are formed. - in fours: There is no evidence suggesting that sunspots specifically occur in groups of four. - in threes: There is no evidence suggesting that sunspots specifically occur in groups of three. - in pairs: Sunspots often occur in pairs, with one sunspot having a north magnetic pole and the other having a south magnetic pole. This configuration is a result of the concentrated magnetic field lines. Step 3: Choose the best answer based on the research. From the available options, the most appropriate answer is \\"in pairs\\", as sunspots frequently occur in pairs with opposite magnetic poles due to the concentration of magnetic field lines.

On his arrival he observes a group of hippies lead by George Berger (Treat Williams) begging for change from a trio of horseback riders. Later Claude catches the runaway horse the hippies have rented and uses it to show off his riding skills to one of the trio of strangers--an upper class débutante. While returning the horse to the hippies, Claude accepts their invitation to be shown around.In the course of an evening Claude gets stoned then is introduced to the race and class issues of the 1960's.

On July 10, 1973, in Rome, 'Ndrangheta kidnappers abducted Getty's 16-year-old grandson, John Paul Getty III, and demanded by telephone a 17 million payment (approximately 93.7 million in 2017) for the young man's safe return. However, \\"the family suspected a ploy by the rebellious teenager to extract money from his miserly grandfather.\\" John Paul Getty Jr. asked his father for the money, but was refused.  In November 1973, an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear arrived at a daily newspaper. The second demand had been delayed three weeks by an Italian postal strike. The demand threatened that Paul would be further mutilated unless the victims paid 3.2 million (approximately 17.6 million in 2017): \\"This is Paul's ear. If we don't get some money within 10 days, then the other ear will arrive. In other words, he will arrive in little bits.\\"  When the kidnappers finally reduced their demands to 3 million (approximately 16.5 million in 2017), Getty senior agreed to pay no more than 2.2 million (approximately 12.1 million in 2017) - the maximum that would be tax-deductible. He lent his son the remaining 800,000 (approximately 4.4 million in 2017) at 4% interest. Paul III was found alive in a Lauria filling station, in the province of Potenza, shortly after the ransom was paid. After his release Paul III called his grandfather to thank him for paying the ransom but, it is claimed, Getty refused to come to the phone. Nine people associated with 'Ndrangheta were later arrested for the kidnapping, but only two were convicted. Paul III was permanently affected by the trauma and became a drug addict. After a stroke brought on by a cocktail of drugs and alcohol in 1981, Paul III was rendered speechless, nearly blind and partially paralyzed for the rest of his life. He died 30 years later on February 5, 2011, at the age of 54.  Getty defended his initial refusal to pay the ransom on two points. First, he argued that to submit to the kidnappers' demands would immediately place his other fourteen grandchildren at the risk of copy-cat kidnappers. He added:  The second reason for my refusal was much broader-based. I contend that acceding to the demands of criminals and terrorists merely guarantees the continuing increase and spread of lawlessness, violence and such outrages as terror-bombings, \\"skyjackings\\" and the slaughter of hostages that plague our present-day world.

In November 1973, the kidnappers sent an envelope containing a lock of hair and a human ear to a daily newspaper, indicating that they had mutilated the young man.

The ailing president reached out to touch the swollen belly of his pregnant granddaughter, Jenna Bush Hager. “There’s death,” he said, “and there’s new life.” As it happened, the old life was not yet done. Bush rallied and eventually left the hospital. It was not his time. But two years later, his son has now essentially delivered the eulogy anyway in the form of a biography of the 41st president, one that extols the successes and treads lightly over the shortcomings of the aging patriarch of one of America’s most prominent political dynasties. Indeed, the younger Bush rushed to finish “41: A Portrait of My Father” to ensure it came out while his dad, now 90 and suffering from a condition similar to Parkinson’s disease, was still alive. The author makes no pretensions to objectivity and, in truth, this is more Hallmark card than biography. Bush’s conversational storytelling makes for engaging reading, even if the stories have been told before in interviews, profiles and books like “George Bush: The Life of a Lone Star Yankee,” by Herbert S. Parmet, and “The Bushes: Portrait of a Dynasty,” by Peter Schweizer and Rochelle Schweizer. That gives “41” the feel of a greatest-hits collection from family reunions at the famous oceanside compound in Kennebunkport, Me. The book takes readers through the familiar touchstones of an extraordinary life — the youngest Navy pilot for a time in World War II, shot down over the Pacific; the transplanted Texas-by-way-of-Connecticut oilman turned congressman and failed Senate candidate; the presidential courtier who served in quick succession as ambassador to the United Nations, Republican National Committee chairman, envoy to China and director of central intelligence; and finally, the loyal vice president to Ronald Reagan, patiently waiting his turn. Beyond his father’s well-known résumé, the book offers a sense of the toll a public life takes on a family, even one as accustomed to the spotlight as the Bushes. One day while the two men were fishing in Maine, the sitting president suddenly seemed ready to give it all up. “Son, I’m thinking about not running again,” he said. Asked why, he cited the unfavorable scrutiny of another son, Neil, who sat on the board of a failed savings and loan. “I know it’s tough,” George W. recalls telling his father, “but you’ve still got work to do and the country needs you.” The younger Bush was hardly immune to the pressure, even before taking office himself, and he tells a story harking back to his more hotheaded days. In a Dallas gym one day, he overheard a stranger evidently mistake him for Neil: “There’s the president’s son — he’s about to get indicted.” Bush marched over and confronted the man. “I’m not about to get indicted, and neither is my brother,” he told him, “and I’d appreciate it if you’d get your facts right instead of spreading gossip.” Getting the facts right, at least as he sees them, seems to be the reason for this book — facts not just about his father but about himself. He has said he wanted to write “41” to encourage a historical reassessment of his father’s presidency, and in the process seems to be seeking some of that for his own as well. The deep affection and respect for his father suffuses the narrative, but along the way, Bush dissects what he sees as mistakes and the lessons he drew for his own presidency. It was “shortsighted,” he says, not to defend more robustly the 1990 budget deal that broke the president’s “read my lips” anti-tax pledge, although he places the blame on “the White House” rather than on his father directly. From the elder Bush’s Supreme Court nominations of David Souter, who became one of the court’s most liberal justices, and Clarence Thomas, whose confirmation turned up an embarrassing sex scandal, Bush writes: “I learned that it is essential for a president to fully vet nominees.” When his father asked him to nudge out the White House chief of staff, John Sununu, Bush wondered why he did not do it himself. “The experience taught me a lesson,” he writes: When he was president he either made personnel changes himself or had “a close confidant (not a family member)” do it. Patrick Buchanan’s primary challenge to his father in 1992 taught him “the importance of consolidating the base,” and in 2004 he “reached out early” to “disgruntled factions of the party.” Some of this conveniently rewrites or omits parts of his own record, of course, and unsurprisingly, Bush admits to none of the father-son tensions that so many others have diagnosed over the years, which he so often scorns as psychobabble. As always, he dismisses the notion that he went to war in Iraq to finish what his father started and argues that 41 was right not to push on to Baghdad in 1991 just as he was right to do so 12 years later. He recycles scenes from his last book, “Decision Points,” telling us again that his father supported his decision to invade and that he did not ask for advice because the former president had not been briefed the way an incumbent president was. He does not reflect on his lifetime of efforts to prove himself by following in his father’s footsteps, nor does he dwell on any frustrations in trying to measure up. He even sands off the harsh edges of stories hinting at resentments that may have built up over time. When he recounts, for instance, the famous tale of his youthful drunken drive home, smashing into a neighbor’s trash can, he writes simply that his father said nothing and that was rebuke enough. Other versions of the episode over the years have suggested a more confrontational tenor, with the son challenging his father, “You want to go mano a mano right here?” For a deeper look into this fascinating relationship, we will probably have to wait for presidential historians, like Jon Meacham, the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer whose long-awaited biography of the elder Bush is due out next year, and Mark K. Updegrove, the director of the Lyndon B. Johnson Presidential Library, who is writing a book about the two Bush presidents. For now, we have a son’s loving testimonial. With the former president fading into winter, the younger Bush’s book feels like a release of sorts, finally getting rid of whatever baggage has been there for so long. A son sits at the hospital bed, at last coming to terms. George W. Bush has nothing more to prove. His argument at this point is not with his father but with history.

Summarize this article: A red flag is anything that could be a potential problem in the future. It’s easy to get caught up in the romance, but it might be best to take a step back and evaluate the person you are seeing for who they really are. Try thinking about all of the things that you know about them, and make note of anything that is questionable.  If he says he’s not ready for commitment, and that is something you are looking for, you should believe him and not try to change his mind. Red flags can also be things like a short temper, tumultuous relationships in his past, or indications of a substance abuse problem. Since you’re looking for a strong relationship, you should take your time getting to know them. The longer you spend with them, the better an idea you will have of who they really are. Don’t feel like you need to rush into something just because it feels good. One of the most exciting and fun parts of dating is getting to experience new things together. Pay attention to how your partner reacts to different situations and ask yourself if you’re comfortable with the way they handle different stressors or uncomfortable environments. For example, holidays are sometimes very high-stress situations and environments for people. How your partner acts in this environment might be a sign of how they’ll react in other high-stress situations. If you begin to feel uncomfortable, uneasy, or afraid in your relationship, don’t be afraid to leave immediately. Your partner should never threaten, hurt, or ignore you. Confide in someone you trust and cut all ties with anyone who is unhealthy for your mental and physical health. Summary:","output":"Red flags are potential problems in a relationship, and it's important to evaluate the person you're seeing before committing. Consider their readiness for commitment, temper, past relationships, and any signs of substance abuse. Invest time in getting to know them and observe their reactions in various situations.

My girlfriend (at the time) and I were planning to go on a day trip on a Saturday, and so the Friday night before, we decided to celebrate our mini vacation by having a few drinks at a local bar. It was a known hangout for bikers, and had a reputation of being a rowdy place, but I was on good terms with a few of the regulars, and felt safe enough. As the night wore on, I started getting out of control, and didn’t even realize it. I loved my girlfriend deeply, and had no desire to be with anyone else, but that night I was most definitely not myself. I was told that I openly flirted with the barmaid in front of my girlfriend, bet and lost on the pool table several times, and tried to start fights with some of the patrons, as I strongly suspected that someone had slipped something into my drink. At the time, I was a seasoned drinker, and the amount of alcohol I had consumed that night was pretty minimal in comparison, so naturally I was convinced that someone was messing with me. To this day I’m still not sure if my drinks were spiked, or it was just one of those nights. I do know that I hadn’t eaten prior to that, so I would tend to choose the latter culprit, even though it pained me to admit it. I woke up the next afternoon in my own bed, with no memory of the trip home, a screaming hangover headache, and no girlfriend. She eventually forgave me, and we were together off and on for a few more years before we grew apart. I haven’t set foot in that bar since, so I have no idea if I’m barred, or how the people there felt about me. I hope they’ve moved on, but I’m still too scared to find out. It’s an experience I never want to repeat, even though I didn’t actually experience anything. :/ According to the above context, answer the following question.

It is not clear how and when he became part of Atta's circle. He became particularly friendly with Binalshibh after meeting him at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, which Jarrah began attending regularly in late 1997. The worshippers at this mosque featured an outspoken, flamboyant Islamist named Mohammed Haydar Zammar. A well-known figure in the Muslim community (and to German and U.S. intelligence agencies by the late 1990s), Zammar had fought in Afghanistan and relished any opportunity to extol the virtues of violent jihad. Indeed, a witness has reported hearing Zammar press Binalshibh to fulfill his duty to wage jihad. Moreover, after 9/11, Zammar reportedly took credit for influencing not just Binalshibh but the rest of the Hamburg group. In 1998, Zammar encouraged them to participate in jihad and even convinced them to go to Afghanistan. Owing to Zammar's persuasion or some other source of inspiration, Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah eventually prepared themselves to translate their extremist beliefs into action. By late 1999, they were ready to abandon their student lives in Germany in favor of violent jihad. This final stage in their evolution toward embracing Islamist extremism did not entirely escape the notice of the people around them. The foursome became core members of a group of radical Muslims, often hosting sessions at their Marienstrasse apartment that involved extremely anti-American discussions. Meeting three to four times a week, the group became something of a \\"sect\\" whose members, according to one participant in the meetings, tended to deal only with each other. Atta's rent checks for the apartment provide evidence of the importance that the apartment assumed as a center for the group, as he would write on them the notation \\"Dar el Ansar,\\" or \\"house of the followers.\\" In addition to Atta, Binalshibh, Shehhi, and Jarrah, the group included other extremists, some of whom also would attend al Qaeda training camps and, in some instances, would help the 9/11 hijackers as they executed the plot: Said Bahaji, son of a Moroccan immigrant, was the only German citizen in the group. Educated in Morocco, Bahaji returned to Germany to study electrical engineering at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg. He spent five months in the German army before obtaining a medical discharge, and lived with Atta and Binalshibh at 54 Marienstrasse for eight months between November 1998 and July 1999. Described as an insecure follower with no personality and with limited knowledge of Islam, Bahaji nonetheless professed his readiness to engage in violence.  Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Zammar\\" correctly answer the question \\"Where is Dar el Ansar?\\"? pick from the following. (1). no. (2). yes.","output":"1. no. The response \\"Zammar\\" is not the correct answer to the question \\"Where is Dar el Ansar?\\" because Dar el Ansar is not a person, but a designation used by Atta to refer to their apartment at 54 Marienstrasse.

Here is a goal: How do I fold a plastic shopping bag to make it into fabric? How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of folding a plastic shopping bag into a fabric-like material, follow these step-by-step instructions: Step 1: Clean and dry the plastic bag Before starting the folding process, ensure that the plastic bag is clean and free of any dirt or moisture. This will make the final fabric more durable and easier to work with. Step 2: Flatten the plastic bag Lay the plastic bag on a flat surface and smooth it out. Remove any remaining air and ensure it's flat and wrinkle-free. Step 3: Trim the edges Using scissors, carefully cut off the handles and the bottom seam of the plastic bag. This will make it easier to fold and create a more uniform fabric in the end. Step 4: Fold the plastic bag in half Take one side of the plastic bag and fold it over to meet the other side. Press down on the fold to create a smooth edge. Step 5: Fold the plastic bag into a rectangular shape Starting from one edge of the plastic bag, fold it over about 1-2 inches (2.5-5 cm) towards the other edge. Continue to fold the bag in this manner, creating a rectangular, accordion-like shape. Step 6: Iron the folded plastic bag (optional) Place a piece of parchment paper (or non-stick baking paper) both under and on top of the folded plastic bag to prevent melting. Use the iron on a low heat setting and gently press down on the parchment-covered plastic bag to slightly melt the layers together. Be cautious not to use too much heat, as this can cause the plastic to completely melt and stick to the parchment paper. This step is optional, but it helps to create a stronger, more fabric-like material. Step 7: Unfold the plastic bag Once the plastic bag has cooled down, carefully unfold it. You should now have a flat, durable, fabric-like material made from the plastic shopping bag. These steps can be repeated with multiple plastic bags to create a larger piece of fabric, which can then be sewn or glued together as needed. Remember that working with hot materials and cutting tools can be dangerous, so always exercise caution and work in a well-ventilated area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The text indicates that the company's headquarters, located on an 11th floor, is crowded with young employees, described as \\"twentysomethings in jeans,\\" reflecting the casual, and likely fast-paced, millennial-driven work environment typically found in technology companies or startups. The employees at Varsity Group Inc are working in cramped conditions, as evidenced by the phrase \\"doubled and tripled up in small offices,\\" which means multiple people are sharing one office space, normally designed for just one or two individuals. It projects a picture of a thoroughly occupied and bustling office space where the company is possibly trying to accommodate an expanding workforce due to an increase in its operations. One of the striking details mentioned is about a rear wall that is about to be demolished to create more room. This suggests a physical expansion is imminently happening at the company's existing headquarters, probably triggered by the growing number of employees or the requirement of additional operational areas. The last line of the excerpt indicates that for the first time in four years, the e-commerce firm is \\"bursting at the seams\\", a metaphor typically used to convey that something in its current state is unable to accommodate its increasing size or volume. In this context, it indicates that the office space can no longer comfortably house all the employees or functions due to the company's growth. Overall, this text is about the apparent rapid growth of Varsity Group Inc., an e-commerce company, as manifested physically in its occupationally saturated and expanding office space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can I read deleted messages kik? Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"How to view older messages on Kik: Kik is a popular messaging app that allows you to send and receive messages instantly. While it doesn't have a built-in feature to view older messages, you can still follow these steps to access and read older messages in a conversation: 1. Open the Kik app on your device and sign in using your credentials. 2. Locate the chat where you want to view older messages and tap on it to open the conversation. 3. To view older messages, simply scroll up within the chat until the point you want to see. If the conversation has been ongoing for quite some time, the scrolling may take a while. 4. If you are using Kik on a smartphone, you might be able to use the search function to find specific keywords or phrases within the conversation. Tap the chat name at the top of the screen to access chat settings or options and then choose the Search feature if available. However, it is important to note that not all devices and Kik app versions might have this functionality. Now, addressing the second question about reading deleted messages on Kik: No, once a message is deleted in Kik, it cannot be retrieved or read again. Kik doesn't store messages on their servers and messages are stored on your device only. When you delete a message or a conversation, it is permanently removed from your device and cannot be restored. This means that you will not be able to read the deleted messages again. In conclusion, the two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is about viewing older messages that are still present in the chat, while the second question is about reading messages that have been deleted from the chat. Although both involve accessing messages in Kik, the processes and outcomes are different – older messages can still be viewed by scrolling up in the chat, while deleted messages cannot be recovered or read again."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

In Python, this can be done using slicing operation. Python list indexing starts from 0, so the range for slicing becomes [i:j+1] to include the jth element. The elements of A from index 1 to 16 are ['5853', '4805', '9907', 'v', 'X', '6495', 'R', '5311', 'm', '969', 'x', '4341', '6733', 'y', '623', 'z'].  Then, concatenate these elements.

The next step is to reverse this string. Strings in Python can be reversed using slicing with a step of -1.

Will foreign students studying in the USA be unwelcomed after Donald Trump is elected as president? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Possible answers:  (A). no;  (B). yes;","output":"If Donald Trump were to win a future election and become president again, the effects on Indian students and other international students studying in the United States could depend on several factors. While it is impossible to predict the exact outcome, we can consider potential scenarios and changes based on his policies and statements during his previous term in the office. Some of the potential effects of a Trump presidency on Indian students studying in the US might include: 1. Changes in visa regulations: During his previous term, President Trump took actions to change visa regulations, which affected Indian students and IT professionals. For instance, the suspension of premium processing for H-1B visas, increased scrutiny of visa applications, and proposed changes to the Optional Practical Training (OPT) program might have made it more challenging for Indian students to obtain and maintain visas, as well as gain employment in the US after completing their studies. If Trump were to get re-elected, it is possible that further changes to visa regulations could be introduced, potentially limiting the opportunities for Indian students and international students in general. 2. Reduced funding for higher education and research: President Trump's previous administration proposed cuts to several federal programs, impacting higher education and research in different fields. If Trump’s policies emphasize reduced funding for higher education and research, it might affect the opportunities available for Indian students in their respective fields of study. 3. Changes to work-study programs and internships: With President Trump's administration emphasizing the prioritization of American workers, policies and regulations may be introduced that limit access for international students to internships and work-study programs. 4. Impact on overall perception: While it's important not to generalize, some Indian students might feel unwelcome or face a more challenging environment due to the rhetoric and policies advocated by President Trump and his administration. This may include concerns about racism, discrimination, and cultural misunderstanding by certain sections of the society. Regarding the multi-choice problem, the answer is (B). yes; since both questions revolve around the potential impact of a Trump presidency on international students, specifically focusing on Indian students. While the first question asks about the potential effects on Indian students studying in the United States, the second question narrows down the focus to whether international students would feel unwelcome in the country.

Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? Rana amurensis can be found in Siberia.","output":"Yes, the next sentence follows and is consistent with the preceding text. Based on the text provided, Rana amurensis, also known as the Khabarovsk frog, Siberian wood frog, Heilongjiang brown frog, or Amur brown frog, is a species of true frog that can be found in various regions of northern Asia. One of these regions is western Siberia, corroborating the statement that Rana amurensis can be found in Siberia. Additionally, Rana amurensis can also be found in northeastern China, northeastern Mongolia, the northern Korean Peninsula, and on Sakhalin Island. Previously, the \\"Rana coreana\\" was considered a subspecies of Rana amurensis, which further emphasizes the extensive range of this species. These frogs are adapted to living in a variety of habitats, including forests, grasslands, and mountain regions. They are known for their ability to tolerate cold temperatures, which is a crucial characteristic for thriving in the cold climate of Siberia. The Siberian wood frog gets its name from the characteristic habitat it occupies, which may include areas with dense tree cover. They are known to breed in shallow, temporary pools of water created by snowmelt in the springtime. Regarding their diet, Rana amurensis primarily feeds on various invertebrates, such as insects, spiders, and small mollusks. They play a vital role in controlling the populations of these invertebrates within their ecosystems, making them an essential part of the food chain. In turn, this species serves as a food source for predators like birds and larger mammals. Although they are a relatively widespread and adaptable species, Rana amurensis populations are subject to disturbances caused by habitat destruction and pollution. Climate change could also potentially impact their distribution and abundance. Conservation efforts should focus on preserving the natural habitats and ecosystems in which these frogs reside to ensure their continued presence in Siberia and other parts of northern Asia."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries. And we’ve made a lot of progress today. We’ll see how it all works out.” In a subsequent sit-down meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said “the United States has had a very big trade deficit for many years with the European Union and we are working it out. And Emmanuel’s been very helpful in that regard.” Macron responded that he had a “very direct and open discussion” with Trump and \\"there is a critical path that is a way to progress all together.” Canada’s foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, confirms she met on Friday with U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer to discuss the tariffs and the fate of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). She said Canada, however, will not change its mind about the U.S. steel and aluminum tariffs which she termed “illegal.” Trump imposed the tariffs on the grounds that weak domestic industries could affect U.S. national security. America’s closest allies, Canada, Mexico and the European Union, are introducing retaliatory tariffs. Question: Why did Trump meet with Trudeau?

Question: Which storm in the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season reached the highest recorded wind speed? Passage:Tropical Storm Fay was a strong and unusual tropical storm that moved erratically across the state of Florida and the Caribbean Sea. The sixth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed from a vigorous tropical wave on August 15 over the Dominican Republic. It passed over the island of Hispaniola, into the Gulf of Gonâve, across the island of Cuba, and made landfall on the Florida Keys late in the afternoon of August 18 before veering into the Gulf of Mexico. It again made landfall near Naples, Florida, in the early hours of August 19 and progressed northeast through the Florida peninsula, emerging into the Atlantic Ocean near Melbourne on August 20. Extensive flooding took place in parts of Florida as a result of its slow movement. On August 21, it made landfall again near New Smyrna Beach, Florida, moving due west across the Panhandle, crossing Gainesville and Panama City, Florida. As it zigzagged from water to land, it became the first storm in recorded history to make landfall in Florida four times. Thirty-six deaths were blamed on Fay. The storm also resulted in one of the most prolific tropical cyclone related tornado outbreaks on record. A total of 81 tornadoes touched down across five states, three of which were rated as EF2. Damage from Fay was heavy, estimated at 560 million.","output":"The sixth named storm of the 2008 Atlantic hurricane season, Fay formed from a vigorous tropical wave on August 15 over the Dominican Republic."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

This article: John Michael Wright, who at the height of his career would interchangeably sign himself \\"Anglus\\" or \\"Scotus\\", is of uncertain origin. The diarist John Evelyn called him a Scotsman, an epithet repeated by Horace Walpole and tentatively accepted by his later biographer, Verne. However, writing in 1700, the English antiquarian Thomas Hearne claims Wright was born in Shoe Lane, London and, after an adolescent conversion to Roman Catholicism, was taken to Scotland by a priest.  A London birth certainly seems supported by a baptismal record, dated 25 May 1617, for a \\"Mighell Wryghtt\\", son of James Wright, described as a tailor and a citizen of London, in St Bride's Church, Fleet Street, London.What is known is that, on 6 April 1636, the 19-year-old Wright was apprenticed to George Jamesone, an Edinburgh portrait painter of some repute. The Edinburgh Register of Apprentices records him as \\"Michaell, son to James W(right), tailor, citizen of London\\". The reasons for this move to Scotland are unclear, but may have to do with familial connections (his parents may have been London Scots) or the advent of plague in London. During his apprenticeship, Wright is likely to have lodged at the High Street tenement near the Netherbow Gate that served as Jameson's workplace. The apprenticeship was contracted for five years, but may have been curtailed by Jameson's imprisonment in late 1639. There is no record of any independent work by Wright from this period (his earliest known painting being a small portrait of Robert Bruce, 1st Earl of Ailesbury, painted in the early 1640s during his time in Rome).It is also possible that Wright met his wife during his Scottish residency. Nothing is known of her, except from a statement of thirty years later which describes her as \\"related to the most noble and distinguished families of Scotland.\\" If this is accurate, it may explain how Wright was later able to find aristocratic patronage. All that is known for certain is that Wright had at least one child by her, a son, Thomas. contains an answer for the question: What is the full anglicized name of the person whose later biographer tentatively accepted the epithet of Scotsman coined by John Evelyn?, what is it ?

Lets imagine we're going on a fun learning adventure, like when we're learning to draw beautiful colors, right? But this time, instead of crayons we're going to use something called spray paint cans.  1. **Practice First**: You know how when you wanted to ride your bike, you first had to practice with training wheels? Spray painting is similar. You first need to practice how to use the can. You can practice spraying on an old cardboard or any surface you don't care much about. Just like when you learned to write your name, the more you practice, the better you'll get! 2. **Stretch**: Just like when we wake up and stretch our bodies so we feel really good for the day, stretching before spray painting is very important too. This helps you to get ready to make big movements with your arm and body, just like a grand dance. 3. **Shake Your Can**: Think of the can as a toy maraca. You know how you shake a maraca to make the sound? Well, you need to do the same thing with the can before spraying it. This mixes all the color inside so you get bright, pretty colors on your canvas! 4. **Put Your Spraying Cap On Well Away from Your Canvas**: Understand this like when you want to eat soup. It's too hot right after you make it, so you put it a little bit away to cool down. In the same way, you need to put the spraying cap on the can while you're away from the canvas to avoid any accidental spills. 5. **Experiment with Distance**: Remember how we play with toy cars? If we keep them close, they seem very big, and if we take them far, they seem very small. The same rule applies here. If you spray from close, the color will be very thick, and if you spray from far, the color will be very light. 6. **Move Quickly**: Move your arm quickly while you spray, just like when we play tag, you have to run quickly, otherwise, someone might tag you. If you move slowly with the spray, it might drip and ruin your painting. 7. **Be Choosy About Locations**: This is like when you find the perfect spot to build your sand castle at the beach. Painting with spray cans can be messy, so it's important to choose the right place where it will not spoil the surroundings. Plus, it should be a safe place where you won't get into trouble!

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: be calm  B: be shocked  C: be happy A:","output":"Based on the context, the most appropriate answer to the question of what will happen to Jesse is B: be shocked. When someone learns about a big secret that has been kept from them, it is reasonable to expect that they will experience a range of emotions - most likely starting with shock as they process this new information. Since the secret was being kept from Jesse, they might feel surprised and even betrayed, depending on the nature of the secret. While answer A: be calm is a possible reaction, it is not as likely as being shocked, especially if the secret is indeed a significant one. People may eventually become calm after processing the news, but their initial reaction is more likely to be shock. Answer C: be happy may not be an appropriate response either, as the context indicates that the secret has been kept from Jesse, suggesting it could be something that might not bring happiness to them. Additionally, happiness as the primary reaction depends heavily on the content of the secret and the relationship between Robin and Jesse.

First, the reviewer uses direct, unambiguous language to express their dissatisfaction, such as \\"stay away from the Aliante!!!!\\", where the exclamation marks amplify the intensity of the negative sentiment.  Second, the reviewer makes extensive use of negative adjectives and descriptions to characterize the hotel, its staff, and their overall experience. They state that \\"most of the people at the hotel are not very nice or helpful,\\" which is a clear expression of dissatisfaction.  Additionally, the reviewer explicitly characterizes their experience at the casino as \\"the worst time we have ever had in a casino,\\" thereby leaving no room for positive interpretation. They further explain that the casino personnel were \\"the rudest\\" and lacked \\"personality,\\" both of which are vehemently negative statements.  Moreover, the attempt to justify the host venue's low visitor turnout (\\"I now know why the casino was empty on Friday and Saturday night\\") indicates that the reviewer's bad experience does not seem to be an isolated incidence, rather a recurring issue that likely affects the experience of other visitors, too. Finally, even when describing the pleasant aspects of the hotel—i.e., \\"the hotel is nice and the rooms are nice\\"—the reviewer does so only as a precursor to a deluge of negative comments, thus reducing the impact of any positivity in these observations. The overall tone of the review is therefore overwhelmingly negative, culminating in the recommendation to avoid the hotel entirely.  Therefore, considering the aforementioned points, it is clear that this review is negative."},{"instruction":"Given an trivia question precisely answer the question with a word/phrase/name.

However, considering that we have to choose one sentiment between negative and positive, it may be reasonable to lean towards describing the sentiment as (b). positive. There are several reasons for this interpretation. Firstly, the text does not explicitly convey any negative emotions or complaints about going to work. It simply states that the individual is about to start their work. If the author had included any negative emotions, we could have considered the sentiment as negative, but that's not the case here. Secondly, one could argue that by sharing this information, the author is engaging with their followers and seems to be looking forward to their day. It is common for people to share their plans or daily routines on social media, even if they are mundane. This type of sharing can be considered a positive way to connect with others.

Your job is to generate the answer to the question by using the information provided. If there is no clear answer obtainable, output 'none'. Passage: Dissatisfied with the Interim decreed by Charles V at the 1548 Diet of Augsburg, the insurgents were full of resolution to defend Protestantism and–not least–their autonomy against the Imperial central authority. They agreed to establish contacts with the Catholic French king Henry II, disregarding his oppression of the Protestant Huguenots. In autumn Henry declared war against Charles V and prepared to march against the Empire up to the Rhine River. On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord with Maurice of Saxony and his Protestant allies, whereby the French conquests were legitimised ahead of time. The princes acknowledged the king's lordship as \\"Vicar of the Empire\\" over the Imperial cities of Metz, Toul and Verdun, as well as Cambrai \\"and other towns of the Empire that do not speak German\\". The insurgents in turn received subsidies and military assistance from the French, their troops moved into the Habsburg hereditary lands and laid siege to the emperor at Innsbruck, while his brother Ferdinand I entered into negotiations that led to the revocation of the Augsburg Interim by the 1552 Peace of Passau.  Link Information: On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord with Maurice of Saxony and his Protestant allies Question: How much time had passed between Henry II's declaration of war against Charles V and the signing of the Treaty of Chambord?","output":"The task is asking for a chronological analysis of the events mentioned in the given passage. The guidelines provided involve understanding the timeline mentioned in the passage and the linked information. Specifically, the task aims at understanding the time difference between two significant events. Step 1: Read the passage carefully. Identify the two events mentioned in the question - 'Henry II's declaration of war against Charles V' and 'the signing of the Treaty of Chambord'. Step 2: Highlight the occurrences of these events in the passage. Henry II declares war in the line: \\"In autumn Henry declared war against Charles V...\\" and the signing of the Treaty of Chambord is mentioned in the line: \\"On 15 January 1552, he signed the Treaty of Chambord...\\" Step 3: Understand the timeline. Henry II declared war in 'Autumn'. The actual year is not given, but considering that the declaration of war and the signing of the Treaty of Chambord both took place before the Peace of Passau in 1552, we can assume it was in the previous year, 1551. The signing of Treaty of Chambord clearly took place on 15 January 1552. Step 4: Calculate the time difference. Considering autumn as roughly starting in September, the time between Henry's declaration of war in Autumn (let's say September for estimation) 1551 and the treaty signing on 15 January 1552 would be about 4 months. So, the answer to the question \\"How much time had passed between Henry II's declaration of war against Charles V and the signing of the Treaty of Chambord?\\" would be approximately 4 months. This is assuming that he declared the war in the beginning of autumn. The exact time would depend on when during the autumn the declaration was made."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Confidence Movie plot: A group of grifters rip off their latest mark and celebrate, while the de facto leader of the group, Jake Vig (Edward Burns) narrates about the art of the con. When one of the four grifters is found shot to death, the other three learn that the latest money they stole actually belonged to a local L.A. crime lord called The King (Dustin Hoffman). Jake meets The King, who proposes that the grifters now go to work for him and steal money from Morgan Price, a rival who now owns a bank. The sociopathic King leaves them little choice in the matter.Having no options, Jake gets to work on developing a new con; he enlists the aid of his two remaining partners, Gordo and Miles, and also convinces an independent con artist named Lilly (Rachel Weisz) to round out their foursome. Unfortunately, The King, a wiry, manic man who suffers from ADHD, demands that one of his men, Lupus, also work on the con. The con involves bribing a vice president at the bank into wiring money offshore. The plan hits a major snag when Special Agent Gunther Butan (Andy Garcia) shows up in L.A., looking to finally bust Jake, whom he has followed for years. Agent Butan quickly forces two corrupt LAPD detectives into switching their allegiance from Jake to him.After hearing about Butan's arrival in town, a nervous Jake pulls the plug on the whole con, and screams at Lilly - making her walk out on the group. Lupus gets Jake to reconsider nixing the con, hinting that The King will torture and kill the grifters if the plan falls short. The con is back on, though now without Lilly's help. The plan starts smoothly enough, and the bribed bank VP wires the money to Gordo in Belize. Gordo brings the money to Ontario Airport, but he is met at the airport by both Agent Butan as well as The King and his men, as both sides are after the 5 million in a duffle bag. Butan arrests The King and confiscates the money. Gordo, who had the money taken from him, is nowhere to be found. Lupus, thinking the King now has the money, reveals he was the one who killed...

Q: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and an associated claim about its type, verify if the claim is true or not. The claim asks if the posts are historical or hypothetical. The posts are \\"HISTORICAL\\" when the author has already done something and they are \\"HYPOTHETICAL\\" when the author is considering doing something in the future. Say 'yes' if the claim is true otherwise say 'no' CLAIM : The following post is HISTORICAL. POST : So to give some background, I'm a senior in high school. I have a government class and my teacher got some new curriculum called Generation Citizen. The whole point of it is to have students vote to work on a local issue and then work towards talking to local politicians and people in power to make some sort of change happen. So. he divided us into groups a while and had us come up with an issue, then we would present each issue the groups came up with, and then collectively voted on that as a whole. In the end, we were about to do something regarding veterans, I don't really remember for sure what is was. But, as the very last group is going, this one student from their group goes up to the front of the class, and gives a whole testimony about how he is homeless. After his speech, most of the votes go to helping \\"youth homelessness\\". Let me drop some statistics here. In my school district in California, which has been known to have homeless problems, there is an estimated 3-5% of homeless students in my school district. I was thinking the whole time, \\"There's no way a tiny high school class is going to solve youth homelessness.\\" I did more research and found that a lot of millions of dollars have gone into helping with this issue along with multiple organizations in our area that are working on the issue 24/7. So, there's no way we can really solve the whole issue. Fast forward to the past 2-3 weeks. This student doesn't even show up to class anymore, and I mention this to other people and they felt that it's dumb that he came, changed a bunch of votes, and dipped. It's like he didn't even show up to his own pity party. So I'm assuming now that a lot of the people don't want to work on this issue anymore and probably want to change it. I recommended to my teacher that we do something that affects all students in the entire school district which was open campus. This means that any student can leave campus to go get food and as long as they come back before lunch ends, you wouldn't be in any trouble. But people already sneak out to get food anyways. My teacher's response was, \\"If we let students go during lunch to buy their own food, then people who can't afford to get food will feel bad or feel left out.\\" I responded with the fact that we have vending machines at our school, so wouldn't someone who couldn't afford something from the vending machine feel the same way? So it wouldn't even be different from that. The whole point of this is that we don't even want to work on this issue, and the only real change that my teacher made to this was to have a plan to create a \\"Youth Task Force for Homeless Youth\\" because who can relate to youth better than the youth. But nobody even wants to be a part of the task force. We feel a little forced to work on this issue now even though people voted how they wanted to after being swayed by the homeless student's speech. I didn't vote for it, but the majority of people did, and I'm sure they regret it. At this point, we collectively do not care about working on our issue as much anymore, and would rather do something else. &amp;#x200B; In conclusion...AITA for not caring about this issue and trying to protest it? A:","output":"The task asks you to: 1. Read a post about a real-life ethical situation. 2. Determine if the post is historical or hypothetical based on a claim. 3.

Problem:I have been searching for the perfect stylus and notes app since I purchased the very first iPad. The thing that you need to consider if you are looking for the same is that you really need to find the proper synergy between BOTH stylus and App. Especially when you are considering these active stylii that pair with the app, you need the app to support the sdk provided by the stylii manufacturer.<br /><br />Last year I settled on this Jot Script and the Goodnotes app. I primarily value a pairing that allows me to use it like a journal, and this pair works brilliantly. Initially the offset and lag of the Script did not allow for writing full screen with any precision, but over time both the SDK and the app have developed and now it works passably for full-screen note-taking, especially with the latest iOS update which supports the best palm rejection I have yet seen. Using the zoom box for writing is my preferred mode (even when I have a precise stylus - I actually think this is an improvement of pen and paper) and the Script works great for this. I have found that the currently best solution is to either pair the stylus with Goodnotes and use the Goodnotes Palm Rejection (which makes for more precision at the tip) or to just not pair the stylus at all (which I find has good enough precision and a bit less lag).<br /><br />This is still not a perfect device, but overall it is the best of the many options I have tried.

Khalid Sheikh Mohammed (sometimes also spelled Khalid Shaikh Mohammed; among at least fifty pseudonyms; born March 1, 1964) is an Islamist militant held by the United States at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp under terrorism-related charges. He was named as \\"the principal architect of the 9/11 attacks\\" in the 9/11 Commission Report. Sheikh Mohammed was a member of Osama bin Laden's al-Qaeda organization, leading al-Qaeda's propaganda operations from around 1999 until late 2001. He confessed to FBI and CIA agents to a role in many of the most significant terrorist plots over the last twenty years, but his interrogators' use of enhanced interrogation techniques has caused some to question certain aspects of his confessions. By the time the Bojinka plot was discovered, Mohammed had returned to Qatar and his job as a project engineer at the country's Ministry of Electricity and Water. He traveled in 1995 to Sudan, Yemen, Malaysia, and Brazil to visit elements of the worldwide jihadist community, although no evidence connects him to specific terrorist actions in any of those locations. On his trip to Sudan, he attempted to meet with Osama Bin Laden, who was at the time living there, aided by Sudanese political leader Hassan al-Turabi. After the US asked the Qatari government to arrest Mohammed in January 1996, he fled to Afghanistan, where he renewed his alliance with Abdul Rasul Sayyaf. Later that year, he formed a working relationship with Bin Laden, who had settled there.  Bin Laden and his colleagues relocated their operations to Afghanistan at this time. Abu Hafs al-Masri/Mohammed Atef, bin Laden's chief of operations, arranged a meeting between bin Laden and Mohammed in Tora Bora sometime in mid-1996, in which Mohammed outlined a plan that would eventually become the quadruple hijackings of 2001. Bin Laden urged Mohammed to become a full-fledged member of Al Qaeda, but he continued to refuse such a commitment until around early 1999, after the 1998 U.S. embassy bombings in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam.  Mohammed moved his family from Iran to Karachi, Pakistan, in 1997. That year, he tried unsuccessfully to join mujahideen leader Ibn al-Khattab in Chechnya, another area of special interest to Mohammed. Unable to travel to Chechnya, he returned to Afghanistan. He ultimately accepted bin Laden's invitation to move to Kandahar and join al-Qaeda as a full-fledged member. Eventually, he became leader of Al Qaeda's media committee. Did Khalid work with anyone else in his planning?","output":"Yes, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed did not single-handedly plan and execute the acts of terrorism credited to him. He worked with numerous other individuals as part of the larger Al-Qaeda organization, an international terrorist group founded by Osama bin Laden. Mohammed was a central figure in Al-Qaeda, working closely with Osama Bin Laden and Ayman al-Zawahiri, who were the leaders of the organization. Together, they orchestrated several large-scale terrorist attacks, including the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon. In the specific instance of the 9/11 attacks, Mohammed worked with a group of individuals who eventually carried out the operation. This group included the 19 hijackers who took control of the four airplanes used in these attacks. Among these hijackers were Mohammed Atta, the ringleader, and the pilots Marwan al-Shehhi, Ziad Jarrah, and Hani Hanjour. Furthermore, during the early planning stages of the 9/11 attacks, Mohammed collaborated with Riduan Isamuddin, commonly known as Hambali, who was a senior member of the Jemaah Islamiyah terrorist organization with links to Al-Qaeda. Abu Hafs al-Masri, also known as Mohammed Atef, was another crucial figure in Mohammed's network. Atef was said to have arranged the pivotal meeting in mid-1996 between Bin Laden and Mohammed, in which Mohammed first proposed what would eventually become the 9/11 plan. Also worth noting is Ramzi Yousef, another Al-Qaeda operative, who, along with Mohammed, hatched the failed Bojinka plot to simultaneously detonate bombs on twelve U.S. airliners over the Pacific Ocean in 1995. Yousef is also believed to be a nephew of Mohammed. Beyond these specific individuals, Mohammed was supported by a broader network of Al-Qaeda operatives who provided logistics, funding, training, and other supports. As part of a well-structured organization like Al-Qaeda, he was able to rely on a wide array of resources and individuals in his planning and operational work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s opening statement today, a fiery, scorched-earth speech that may well have salvaged his bid for the Supreme Court, was not only aimed at the Senate Judiciary Committee. It carried an even bigger goal: to keep President Donald Trump from losing faith in his nomination.      Kavanaugh was being urged by some — including old friends from Bush world — to take a softer approach today. But in the end, he tuned out the advice, and sat down to write a speech with a sole aide. An overarching goal: please Trump and, in turn, circle the conservative wagons behind him, an official close to the process said.      Two White House officials said that while the President never seriously considered asking Kavanaugh to withdraw, he did discuss the idea — publicly and privately — that he would quickly announce another nominee and use the rejection of Kavanaugh to rally conservatives in the mid-term elections.      It didn’t come to that, but there were “incredibly tense moments” in the White House after Christine Blasey Ford finished her testimony. A White House official said the president found Ford “compelling” and “very credible” and had serious questions about how Kavanaugh would perform.      “He didn’t disappoint. He exceeded every expectation,” a White House official said.      The President was publicly silent throughout the day, but his hand was guiding nearly every pivotal move – from Sen. Lindsey Graham’s boisterous speech to the decision to shut down the Republican-selected special prosecutor. ||||| READ: Christine Blasey Ford's Opening Statement For Senate Hearing      Enlarge this image toggle caption J. Scott Applewhite/AP J. Scott Applewhite/AP      Christine Blasey Ford has accused Supreme Court nominee Judge Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were in high school in the early 1980s. On Thursday the psychology professor is testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Read her opening statement below.      Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Feinstein, Members of the Committee. My name is Christine Blasey Ford. I am a Professor of Psychology at Palo Alto University and a Research Psychologist at the Stanford University School of Medicine.      I was an undergraduate at the University of North Carolina and earned my degree in Experimental Psychology in 1988. I received a Master's degree in 1991 in Clinical Psychology from Pepperdine University. In 1996, I received a PhD in Educational Psychology from the University of Southern California. I earned a Master's degree in Epidemiology from the Stanford University School of Medicine in 2009.      I have been married to Russell Ford since 2002 and we have two children.      I am here today not because I want to be. I am terrified. I am here because I believe it is my civic duty to tell you what happened to me while Brett Kavanaugh and I were in high school. I have described the events publicly before. I summarized them in my letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, and again in my letter to Chairman Grassley. I understand and appreciate the importance of your hearing from me directly about what happened to me and the impact it has had on my life and on my family.      I grew up in the suburbs of Washington, D.C. I attended the Holton-Arms School in Bethesda, Maryland, from 1980 to 1984. Holton-Arms is an all-girls school that opened in 1901. During my time at the school, girls at Holton-Arms frequently met and became friendly with boys from all-boys schools in the area, including Landon School, Georgetown Prep, Gonzaga High School, country clubs, and other places where kids and their families socialized. This is how I met Brett Kavanaugh, the boy who sexually assaulted me.      In my freshman and sophomore school years, when I was 14 and 15 years old, my group of friends intersected with Brett and his friends for a short period of time. I had been friendly with a classmate of Brett's for a short time during my freshman year, and it was through that connection that I attended a number of parties that Brett also attended. We did not know each other well, but I knew him and he knew me. In the summer of 1982, like most summers, I spent almost every day at the Columbia Country Club in Chevy Chase, Maryland swimming and practicing diving.      One evening that summer, after a day of swimming at the club, I attended a small gathering at a house in the Chevy Chase/Bethesda area. There were four boys I remember being there: Brett Kavanaugh, Mark Judge, P.J. Smyth, and one other boy whose name I cannot recall. I remember my friend Leland Ingham attending. I do not remember all of the details of how that gathering came together, but like many that summer, it was almost surely a spur of the moment gathering. I truly wish I could provide detailed answers to all of the questions that have been and will be asked about how I got to the party, where it took place, and so forth. I don't have all the answers, and I don't remember as much as I would like to. But the details about that night that bring me here today are ones I will never forget. They have been seared into my memory and have haunted me episodically as an adult.      When I got to the small gathering, people were drinking beer in a small living room on the first floor of the house. I drank one beer that evening. Brett and Mark were visibly drunk. Early in the evening, I went up a narrow set of stairs leading from the living room to a second floor to use the bathroom. When I got to the top of the stairs, I was pushed from behind into a bedroom. I couldn't see who pushed me. Brett and Mark came into the bedroom and locked the door behind them. There was music already playing in the bedroom. It was turned up louder by either Brett or Mark once we were in the room. I was pushed onto the bed and Brett got on top of me. He began running his hands over my body and grinding his hips into me. I yelled, hoping someone downstairs might hear me, and tried to get away from him, but his weight was heavy. Brett groped me and tried to take off my clothes. He had a hard time because he was so drunk, and because I was wearing a one-piece bathing suit under my clothes. I believed he was going to rape me. I tried to yell for help. When I did, Brett put his hand over my mouth to stop me from screaming. This was what terrified me the most, and has had the most lasting impact on my life. It was hard for me to breathe, and I thought that Brett was accidentally going to kill me. Both Brett and Mark were drunkenly laughing during the attack. They both seemed to be having a good time. Mark was urging Brett on, although at times he told Brett to stop. A couple of times I made eye contact with Mark and thought he might try to help me, but he did not.      During this assault, Mark came over and jumped on the bed twice while Brett was on top of me. The last time he did this, we toppled over and Brett was no longer on top of me. I was able to get up and run out of the room. Directly across from the bedroom was a small bathroom. I ran inside the bathroom and locked the door. I heard Brett and Mark leave the bedroom laughing and loudly walk down the narrow stairs, pin-balling off the walls on the way down. I waited and when I did not hear them come back up the stairs, I left the bathroom, ran down the stairs, through the living room, and left the house. I remember being on the street and feeling an enormous sense of relief that I had escaped from the house and that Brett and Mark were not coming after me.      Brett's assault on me drastically altered my life. For a very long time, I was too afraid and ashamed to tell anyone the details. I did not want to tell my parents that I, at age 15, was in a house without any parents present, drinking beer with boys. I tried to convince myself that because Brett did not rape me, I should be able to move on and just pretend that it had never happened. Over the years, I told very few friends that I had this traumatic experience. I told my husband before we were married that I had experienced a sexual assault. I had never told the details to anyone until May 2012, during a couples counseling session. The reason this came up in counseling is that my husband and I had completed an extensive remodel of our home, and I insisted on a second front door, an idea that he and others disagreed with and could not understand. In explaining why      I wanted to have a second front door, I described the assault in detail. I recall saying that the boy who assaulted me could someday be on the U.S. Supreme Court and spoke a bit about his background. My husband recalls that I named my attacker as Brett Kavanaugh.      After that May 2012 therapy session, I did my best to suppress memories of the assault because recounting the details caused me to relive the experience, and caused panic attacks and anxiety. Occasionally I would discuss the assault in individual therapy, but talking about it caused me to relive the trauma, so I tried not to think about it or discuss it. But over the years, I went through periods where I thought about Brett's attack. I confided in some close friends that I had an experience with sexual assault. Occasionally I stated that my assailant was a prominent lawyer or judge but I did not use his name. I do not recall each person I spoke to about Brett's assault, and some friends have reminded me of these conversations since the publication of The Washington Post story on September 16, 2018. But until July 2018, I had never named Mr.      Kavanaugh as my attacker outside of therapy.      This all changed in early July 2018. I saw press reports stating that Brett Kavanaugh was on the \\"short list\\" of potential Supreme Court nominees. I thought it was my civic duty to relay the information I had about Mr. Kavanaugh's conduct so that those considering his potential nomination would know about the assault.      On July 6, 2018, I had a sense of urgency to relay the information to the Senate and the President as soon as possible before a nominee was selected. I called my congressional representative and let her receptionist know that someone on the President's shortlist had attacked me. I also sent a message to The Washington Post's confidential tip line. I did not use my name, but I provided the names of Brett Kavanaugh and Mark Judge. I stated that Mr. Kavanaugh had assaulted me in the 1980s in Maryland. This was an extremely hard thing for me to do, but I felt I couldn't NOT do it. Over the next two days, I told a couple of close friends on the beach in California that Mr. Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted me. I was conflicted about whether to speak out.      On July 9, 2018, I received a call from the office of Congresswoman Anna Eshoo after Mr. Kavanaugh had become the nominee. I met with her staff on July 11 and with her on July 13, describing the assault and discussing my fear about coming forward. Later, we discussed the possibility of sending a letter to Ranking Member Feinstein, who is one of my state's Senators, describing what occurred. My understanding is that Representative Eshoo's office delivered a copy of my letter to Senator Feinstein's office on July 30, 2018. The letter included my name, but requested that the letter be kept confidential.      My hope was that providing the information confidentially would be sufficient to allow the Senate to consider Mr. Kavanaugh's serious misconduct without having to make myself, my family, or anyone's family vulnerable to the personal attacks and invasions of privacy we have faced since my name became public. In a letter on August 31, 2018, Senator Feinstein wrote that she would not share the letter without my consent. I greatly appreciated this commitment. All sexual assault victims should be able to decide for themselves whether their private experience is made public.      As the hearing date got closer, I struggled with a terrible choice: Do I share the facts with the Senate and put myself and my family in the public spotlight? Or do I preserve our privacy and allow the Senate to make its decision on Mr. Kavanaugh's nomination without knowing the full truth about his past behavior?      I agonized daily with this decision throughout August and early September 2018. The sense of duty that motivated me to reach out confidentially to The Washington Post, Representative Eshoo's office, and Senator Feinstein's office was always there, but my fears of the consequences of speaking out started to increase.      During August 2018, the press reported that Mr. Kavanaugh's confirmation was virtually certain. His allies painted him as a champion of women's rights and empowerment. I believed that if I came forward, my voice would be drowned out by a chorus of powerful supporters. By the time of the confirmation hearings, I had resigned myself to remaining quiet and letting the Committee and the Senate make their decision without knowing what Mr. Kavanaugh had done to me.      Once the press started reporting on the existence of the letter I had sent to Senator Feinstein, I faced mounting pressure. Reporters appeared at my home and at my job demanding information about this letter, including in the presence of my graduate students. They called my boss and coworkers and left me many messages, making it clear that my name would inevitably be released to the media. I decided to speak out publicly to a journalist who had responded to the tip I had sent to The Washington Post and who had gained my trust. It was important to me to describe the details of the assault in my own words.      Since September 16, the date of The Washington Post story, I have experienced an outpouring of support from people in every state of this country. Thousands of people who have had their lives dramatically altered by sexual violence have reached out to share their own experiences with me and have thanked me for coming forward. We have received tremendous support from friends and our community.      At the same time, my greatest fears have been realized – and the reality has been far worse than what I expected. My family and I have been the target of constant harassment and death threats. I have been called the most vile and hateful names imaginable. These messages, while far fewer than the expressions of support, have been terrifying to receive and have rocked me to my core. People have posted my personal information on the internet. This has resulted in additional emails, calls, and threats. My family and I were forced to move out of our home. Since September 16, my family and I have been living in various secure locales, with guards. This past Tuesday evening, my work email account was hacked and messages were sent out supposedly recanting my description of the sexual assault.      Apart from the assault itself, these last couple of weeks have been the hardest of my life. I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world, and have seen my life picked apart by people on television, in the media, and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me. I have been accused of acting out of partisan political motives. Those who say that do not know me. I am a fiercely independent person and I am no one's pawn. My motivation in coming forward      was to provide the facts about how Mr. Kavanaugh's actions have damaged my life, so that you can take that into serious consideration as you make your decision about how to proceed. It is not my responsibility to determine whether Mr. Kavanaugh deserves to sit on the Supreme Court. My responsibility is to tell the truth.      I understand that the Majority has hired a professional prosecutor to ask me some questions, and I am committed to doing my very best to answer them. At the same time, because the Committee Members will be judging my credibility, I hope to be able to engage directly with each of you.      At this point, I will do my best to answer your questions. ||||| READ: Brett Kavanaugh's Opening Statement For Senate Hearing      Enlarge this image toggle caption Drew Angerer/Getty Images Drew Angerer/Getty Images      On Thursday, Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh will appear before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on a sexual assault allegation by Christine Blasey Ford, who is also testifying. Read Kavanaugh's opening statement below, submitted to the panel on Wednesday.      Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Feinstein, and Members of the Committee: Eleven days ago, Dr. Ford publicly accused me of committing a serious wrong more than 36 years ago when we were both in high school. I denied the allegation immediately, unequivocally, and categorically. The next day, I told this Committee that I wanted to testify as soon as possible, under oath, to clear my name.      Over the past few days, other false and uncorroborated accusations have been aired. There has been a frenzy to come up with something—anything, no matter how far-fetched or odious—that will block a vote on my nomination. These are last-minute smears, pure and simple. They debase our public discourse. And the consequences extend beyond any one nomination. Such grotesque and obvious character assassination—if allowed to succeed—will dissuade competent and good people of all political persuasions from serving our country.      As I told this Committee the last time I appeared before you, a federal judge must be independent, not swayed by public or political pressure. That is the kind of judge I am and will always be. I will not be intimidated into withdrawing from this process. This effort to destroy my good name will not drive me out. The vile threats of violence against my family will not drive me out. I am here this morning to answer these allegations and to tell the truth. And the truth is that I have never sexually assaulted anyone—not in high school, not in college, not ever.      Sexual assault is horrific. It is morally wrong. It is illegal. It is contrary to my religious faith. And it contradicts the core promise of this Nation that all people are created equal and entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Allegations of sexual assault must be taken seriously. Those who make allegations deserve to be heard. The subject of allegations also deserves to be heard. Due process is a foundation of the American rule of law.      Dr. Ford's allegation dates back more than 36 years, to a party that she says occurred during our time in high school. I spent most of my time in high school focused on academics, sports, church, and service. But I was not perfect in those days, just as I am not perfect today. I drank beer with my friends, usually on weekends. Sometimes I had too many. In retrospect, I said and did things in high school that make me cringe now. But that's not why we are here today. What I've been accused of is far more serious than juvenile misbehavior. I never did anything remotely resembling what Dr. Ford describes.      The allegation of misconduct is completely inconsistent with the rest of my life. The record of my life, from my days in grade school through the present day, shows that I have always promoted the equality and dignity of women.      I categorically and unequivocally deny the allegation against me by Dr. Ford. I never had any sexual or physical encounter of any kind with Dr. Ford. I am not questioning that Dr. Ford may have been sexually assaulted by some person in some place at some time. But I have never done that to her or to anyone. I am innocent of this charge. |||||Summary:","output":"In his opening statement during the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Judge Brett Kavanaugh delivered a strong and passionate speech in defense of himself and his nomination. The statement served not only to address the committee but also to reassure President Donald Trump and solidify conservative support for his Supreme Court nomination. While some advised Kavanaugh to take a softer approach, he ultimately chose to deliver a forceful speech. After Christine Blasey Ford's testimony, there were concerns in the White House over Kavanaugh's performance, but after hearing his opening statement, they felt that he exceeded their expectations. Throughout the entire process, President Trump's hand guided key decisions and actions, keeping a close eye on the proceedings. Despite the challenging circumstances, Kavanaugh remains determined to uphold the principles of the American rule of law and continue to pursue his nomination to the Supreme Court."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

An ecosystem consists of all the living and nonliving components of the habitat. Whereas nutrients and certain elements are recycled through ecosystems, energy moves in just one direction. Many interactions among species within an ecosystem are centered around the flow of energy. The formation of ecosystems, from new land to current habitats, is usually based on the pioneer species, and these species are able to live in an area due to the nonliving factors, such as the climate, the soil and the amount of rainfall, of that area. The populations within an ecosystem also determine the stability of the system. Recent tremendous increases in the human population have raised many important ecological issues.

Analyze the severity of the behavior. Check the frequency of the harassment. Check if others find the behavior off-putting. Talk with a lawyer. Take next steps.\\"","output":"Title: Addressing Harassment: A Comprehensive Guide A safe and respectful environment is a basic human right, acting as the underpinning for fruitful, harmonious relationships, be it in the workplace, education, or any social scenarios. Yet many individuals grapple with hostile experiences in these areas. Harassment - the unwelcome conduct based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information– is an unfortunate reality that is faced by many people globally.  The first step in dealing with harassment – and incidentally, one of the most vital – is to ask if you welcomed the conduct. This might seem like an obvious point, but it's crucial to quickly identify and accept that if the action makes you feel uncomfortable, violated, or negatively impacted, it is unwelcome. Consciously acknowledging this fact is the preliminary step in your journey against harassment. Next, it is essential to analyze the severity of the behavior. The weight of the harassment often determines the subsequent course of action. For instance, a single, minor instance might warrant a conversation with the offender while repeated or extreme actions may necessitate stronger measures, such as involving legal authorities or higher-ups in the organization. Reflecting on experience's gravity is thus the second step in responding to harassment. Moreover, the frequency of the harassment is another quintessential variable to consider. Is the incident a one-time occurrence or a repetitive act? Frequent, continual harassment can have a more damaging impact on psychological health and overall wellbeing. This step of checking the frequency helps establish the depth of the situation and aids in formulating a response. Then, seek insight from your peers or those surrounding you. Check if others also find the behavior off-putting. This is not about seeking validation for your feelings but more about gaining a broader perspective of the situation. Sometimes, the offender might be unaware of the negative impact of their behavior until multiple individuals express their discomfort. This step might also lead to a collective effort to combat such behavior. After accumulating a comprehensive understanding of the issue, speaking with a lawyer can be a wise move. Depending on the severity and frequency of the incidents, consulting a professional on your legal rights can provide valuable reassurance. They will advise you on how to document instances, possible retaliation laws, and potential actions for resolution, making you more equipped to deal with the situation. Finally, it is time to take the next steps. Armed with knowledge, legal advice, and an assessment of the severity and frequency of the incidents, you can decide on an action plan. This could involve reporting the behavior to your organization's HR department or even pressing charges if the offensive actions constitute a legal violation. Remember, everyone deserves to feel safe and respected in their surroundings. Taking these steps can help you move from a place of fear or discomfort to empowered action, a pivotal stride towards a healthier environment. Addressing harassment can be a daunting task. Yet, by asking if you welcomed the conduct, analyzing the behavior's severity, checking the frequency of the instances, seeking others' opinions, consulting with a lawyer and finally deciding on subsequent steps, you equip yourself to face this challenge with determination and courage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Her previous success in uncovering and dismantling a global criminal network has earned her accolades and trust. This time, her objective lies in investigating suspicious activities at the American Yokota Air Base in Japan. A series of mysterious events have taken place on the base, causing the government and military to become increasingly concerned. Classified information and advanced technology have gone missing, and a threatening cyber-attack that jeopardizes military operations originates from within the base. With no leads and even less time to resolve the situation, Saya is dispatched with the utmost urgency. Act 2: Saya infiltrates the American Yokota Air Base by posing as a technological consultant hired to enhance the base's cybersecurity. As she familiarizes herself with the facility and starts to build relationships with the personnel, she notices the strained dynamics between various high-ranking officers. Our protagonist quickly discovers a web of conspiracies and secrets that composes a far more complex and dangerous situation than she anticipated. As she delves deeper into the investigation, she uncovers a rogue faction within the military that seeks to leverage advanced military drone technology to conduct a coup in collaboration with an extremist organization. Simultaneously, Saya finds an unexpected ally in Jay, a skilled but disgraced aircraft mechanic, who previously lost his position due to his involvement in a controversial whistleblower case. Together, they must navigate through the intricate web of deception and betrayal and identify the mastermind behind the conspiracy. Act 3: As Saya and Jay's investigation progresses, they eventually trace the group's leader, an influential yet unsuspected figure within the military. Facing threats and danger at every turn, Saya and Jay demonstrate exceptional teamwork and cunning strategy, ultimately exposing the leader and thwarting the rogue faction's plans. In a final fast-paced and adrenaline-pumping sequence, the duo foils an attempt to hijack a newly developed, top-secret drone. Saya faces off against the rogue leader in hand-to-hand combat, while Jay prevents the drone from becoming a deadly weapon. Act 4: Saya delivers the evidence against the rogue faction to her superiors, ensuring the arrest and indictment of the guilty parties. As a result, the organization is dismantled, and peace is restored to the Yokota Air Base. Jay's reputation is cleared, and he is reinstated to his rightful position, gaining the respect of his peers once more for his bravery and dedication. Finally, Saya and Jay part ways - their friendship forged in a shared mission.

Answer:","output":"Title: Echoes of Madness Genre: Horror, Thriller, Mystery Act 1: A Mundane Beginning The movie begins by introducing our five high school protagonists, who are in their senior year, living in a quiet, suburban town. Though they come from different walks of life, Jen (the honor student), Mark (the jock), Will (the artistic loner), Samantha (the social butterfly), and Linda (the class clown) have grown increasingly tired of their mundane everyday routines. One day, while discussing their shared boredom during their lunch break, Mark reveals that he overheard a few older students discussing an allegedly haunted abandoned psychiatric hospital, just on the outskirts of their town. Curiosity piqued, the group unanimously decides to cut class the following day and explore the mysterious decaying facility. Act 2: Unraveling the Dark Secrets Equipped with flashlights and makeshift tools, the group arrives at the enormous, decrepit hospital, which has been abandoned for almost two decades. As they venture deeper into the building, they find signs of illicit activities and graffiti littering the walls, adding an eerie and unwelcoming ambiance.  The farther they get from the entrance, the more the group begins to feel the building's unnerving atmosphere. They uncover old patient records, reports of inhumane psychiatric practices, and newspaper clippings that detail violent riots, mysterious patient disappearances, and a series of unexplained deaths that led to the facility's eventual closing. Act 3: Disturbing Encounters As they explore, the friends start to notice subtle, inexplicable occurrences that unsettle their nerves. First, it's Mark's flashlight mysteriously dying, then Will seeing a fleeting shadow at the end of a long hallway. These strange occurrences escalate, with the group hearing faint whispers and catching glimpses of ghostly figures. Faced with these sinister supernatural events, the group becomes increasingly desperate to leave the hospital but realizes that they're lost and trapped. Panic begins to set in. During their frantic escape attempts, they stumble upon a hidden underground basement, where evidence of the hospital's darkest secrets - horrific experiments and the mistreatment of patients - are laid bare. Act 4: Unleashing the Dark Past As night falls, the supernatural phenomena intensify, and the group uncovers a shocking connection between the spirits they've encountered and the hospital's sinister past. The tortured patients, who were subjected to ghastly experiments, are seeking vengeance. It becomes clear that these vengeful spirits want to expose their suffering to the world and find closure by seeking justice against their tormentors - even if it means putting the group's lives at risk. As the protagonists face these tormented souls, they must confront their own insecurities, fears, and past traumas to gain the strength needed to survive this harrowing ordeal. Act 5: A Chilling Climax In their final attempt to escape the haunted hospital, the once-disparate group now works cohesively to face the malicious spirits; Jen uses her intelligence to decipher messages left by the spirits, Mark relies on his strength, Will employs his intuition, Samantha exhibits bravery, and Linda channels her humor. The movie reaches its climax as the group confronts the most powerful antagonistic spirit, the vengeful leader of the tormented souls. Overcoming their own traumas and insecurities, the group manages to strike a deal with the spirit; the friends vow to share the stories of the hospital's dark past and tortured patients, seeking justice and bringing the long-lost truth to light. With the promise made, the spirit releases the group, leaving them battered but forever bonded. They make their way back to the town, their lives irrevocably changed by this harrowing experience. As the final credits roll, the audience senses that the group won't abandon their promise to the spirits, and the fight for justice is just beginning. \\"Echoes of Madness\\" would be a chilling, thought-provoking examination of human resilience, the power of friendship, and the importance of uncovering dark truths to expose injustices.

Gradually, it became evident that Dennis was struggling with both feelings of betrayal and regret for letting go of someone he had once deeply cared for. In his attempt to sabotage Joel and his ex-girlfriend's budding romance, Dennis resorted to various manipulative tactics and mind games, while also trying to convey his lingering affections towards his former lover. As the situation escalated, the ex-girlfriend found herself in an extremely difficult position, torn between the love and trust she was developing for Joel, and the complex history she shared with Dennis. This led her to question the authenticity of Dennis's feelings and his real motives for interfering in her new relationship, causing her emotional turmoil and confusion. At the same time, Joel started to pick up on the increasing tension between himself and Dennis, as well as his girlfriend's growing uneasiness and uncertainty in their relationship. With the mounting pressure and attempts by Dennis to reconnect with his ex and break them apart, Joel was forced to take a hard look at his own motivations for pursuing this new romance which had consequences for both his personal and professional life. He started questioning if the initial attraction he felt for Dennis's ex-girlfriend stemmed from his genuine feelings towards her, or if it was merely sparked by his competitive nature and desire to prove a point to his former friend. As the stakes grew higher, Joel was compelled to confront the consequences of his actions and realized that his pursuit for validation and rivalry with Dennis might have led him down a path of heartache and broken relationships.

Lauren Moss, 22, was reported missing out of Seaside, Calif., in mid-November, according to Monterey County Sheriff’s Office Cmdr. John Thornburg.      Her body was found in a parked car in a Walmart parking lot in Salinas, Calif., last week, according to authorities.      While toxicology results are still pending, it’s believed that the cause of death was likely a suicide.

The direct review process is a typical legal appeal. An appellate court examines the record of evidence presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether the decision was legally sound or not. Direct review of a capital sentencing hearing will result in one of three outcomes. If the appellate court finds that no significant legal errors occurred in the capital sentencing hearing, the appellate court will affirm the judgment, or let the sentence stand. If the appellate court finds that significant legal errors did occur, then it will reverse the judgment, or nullify the sentence and order a new capital sentencing hearing. Lastly, if the appellate court finds that no reasonable juror could find the defendant eligible for the death penalty, a rarity, then it will order the defendant acquitted, or not guilty, of the crime for which he/she was given the death penalty, and order him sentenced to the next most severe punishment for which the offense is eligible.

Article:","output":"Title: Earthquakes May Happen More on the East Coast, New Survey Says Hey kids, do you know what an earthquake is? It's when the ground shakes because of the movement of the Earth's plates. Well, a new study from some really smart people called geologists says that some parts of the United States might be more likely to have earthquakes. Guess what? It's the east coast! The geologists, who are like Earth detectives, did a big study called a \\"US Geological Survey.\\" They looked at many parts of the country and tried to figure out where earthquakes might happen. They discovered that the east coast of the United States has a higher chance of experiencing earthquakes compared to some other parts of the country. But why is this happening? The Earth's surface is made up of big pieces called plates. These plates can move and sometimes bump into each other. When they bump, it can cause the Earth to shake, which is an earthquake. It turns out that the plates on the east coast are moving in a way that makes earthquakes more likely. Now, you might wonder if this is something to be scared of. The good news is that although the risk of earthquakes is higher on the east coast, it's still pretty low compared to other places around the world. So, while we should always be prepared for an emergency, there's no need to worry too much. In conclusion, the new US Geological Survey shows that the east coast has a higher chance of experiencing earthquakes. But don't worry too much — it's important to always be prepared, and the good news is that the risk is still low compared to many other places in the world.

Step 1: Combine the terms with t on the right side of the equation:  17*t - 72 = -3*t + 38*t Since -3*t + 38*t has a common variable t, you can add the coefficients -3 and 38: -3 + 38 = 35 So the right side of the equation simplifies to: 17*t - 72 = 35*t Step 2: Now, we want to get all t terms on one side of the equation and all constant terms on the other side. To do this, subtract 17*t from both sides of the equation: 17*t - 72 - 17*t = 35*t - 17*t This simplifies to: -72 = 18*t Step 3: Now, we need to isolate t. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of t, which is 18: (-72) / 18 = (18*t) / 18 This simplifies to: -4 = t So, the solution to the equation 17*t - 72 = -3*t + 38*t is t = -4."},{"instruction":"Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The expression of an organism's genotype is called its phenotype .

And, to be honest, that's about the only thing we can agree on. In the 24 hours since GQ released its January profile of Robertson and his family, who draw millions to A&E with their reality show \\"Duck Dynasty,\\" social media has seen more than its typical overuse of exclamation points and excessive capitalization. The back-and-forth has gotten so extensive, we wouldn't be surprised if you've forgotten what you're even arguing about. I don't see a distinction between the two,\\" said another","output":"user, referring to the blurred lines between Robertson's personal beliefs and his reality TV persona. \\"It's just a TV show. Why are people getting so worked up over it?\\" The big debate stems from Robertson's controversial comments concerning homosexuality, race, and religion during his GQ interview. Some lauded the \\"Duck Dynasty\\" patriarch for expressing his opinions openly, while others were appalled by the remarks and called for his suspension from the reality show. A&E initially suspended Robertson, but later reinstated him after facing backlash from fans and supporters. As a result, the situation erupted into a conversation about freedom of speech versus the consequences of expressing certain beliefs. Celebrities, politicians, and everyday people alike joined the discussion, weighing in on whether Robertson's comments should have been met with punishment or if his right to free speech was violated. The heart of the matter, though, lies in the age-old struggle between differing perspectives and beliefs. As a society, we still grapple with the question of how to balance our eagerness for open dialogue with the need to hold individuals accountable for their words. On one hand, many argue that the beauty of free speech is the ability to express one's beliefs without fear of reprisal. By imposing consequences on someone like Robertson, are we stifling our own progress in fostering a culture of openness and understanding? On the other hand, critics of Robertson's comments assert that this is not just about freedom of speech. It's about responsibility and the impact such divisive language can have on marginalized populations. They assert that those in the public eye have a unique platform and should be held to a higher standard when it comes to using their voice. The conversation spurred by the Phil Robertson controversy is far from over, and likely won't be resolved any time soon. Instead, it serves as a microcosm of the larger issues society continuously grapples with – freedom of speech, responsibility, and the ongoing battle for equal rights and understanding among all. In the end, let us remember that it is vital to engage in respectful conversations about these difficult topics, but it is also crucial to forgive and learn from our mistakes. Furthermore, we should make a conscious effort not to let emotions and opinions divide us; rather, let them spark meaningful discussions that lead to greater understanding and unity. That is the only way true progress and harmony can be achieved. What the long-term consequences of the \\"Duck Dynasty\\" incident will be, or how Robertson's views may evolve, remains uncertain. However, one thing is clear: as long as we remain open to discussions and strive for empathy, growth, and unity, we will continue to learn more about not just each other, but ourselves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Last Friday, the President granted commutations to 42 convicted nonviolent offenders, bringing the total so far in his presidency to 348 commutations — more than any president has in nearly half a century. His predecessor, George W. Bush granted clemency in just 11 cases. It's not just Obama pushing for reform. Top Republicans and Democrats in Congress also support relaxing the sentencing laws that have tripled the federal and state prison populations in the last 30 years, reaching more than 1.56 million inmates at the end of 2014. However in Congress, the main legislative effort for sentencing changes, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015, has failed to pass either chamber of Congress. The bill would reduce long mandatory minimum sentences for many nonviolent drug crimes, give judges more control over the terms of punishment and provide inmates with more opportunities to get out early by participating in rehabilitation programs. Failing congressional help, Obama has in recent months relied on his presidential powers to commute the sentences of non-violent offenders. Under the Constitution, the president has the power to grant “pardons for offenses against the United States” or to commute federal sentences. A pardon is an act of presidential forgiveness and wipes away any remaining legal liabilities from a conviction. A commutation reduces a sentence but does not eliminate a conviction or restore civil rights lost as a result of the conviction. The American Bar Association has joined Obama's push and put its support behind the Clemency Project 2014, a national effort by multiple justice groups to help inmates who meet U.S. Department of Justice...

I believed that when the weight disappeared, it would take old wounds, hurts and rejections with it. Many weight-conscious people also mistakenly believe that changing our bodies will fix _ . Perhaps our mistake is believing that being thin equals being loved, being special, and being cherished. We fantasize   about what it will be like when we reach the long-awaited goal .We work very hard to realize this dream. Then, at last, we find ourselves there. But we often gain back what we have lost. Even so, we continue to believe that next time it will be different. Next time, we will keep it off. Next time, being thin will finally fulfill its promise of everlasting happiness, self-worth, and, of course, love. It took me a long time to realize that there was something more for me to learn about beauty. Beauty standards vary with culture. In Samoa a woman is not considered attractive unless she weighs more than 200 pounds. More importantly, if it's happiness that we want, why not put our energy there rather than on the size of our body? Why not look inside? Many of us strive hard to change our body, but in vain. We have to find a way to live comfortably inside our body and make friends with and cherish ourselves. When we change our attitudes towards ourselves, the whole world changes.

Help as much as you can. When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others. Long, singular focus, handheld shots were also used to enhance the sense of voyeuristic glimpses. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Process:  - Rain falls on wood - The rain seeps into the wood surface - It permeates the wood - When rain evaporates it leaves the wood - It takes the finish of the wood with it - The wood begins to lose it's luster - It begins to look bad - It has pieces of paint missing from the rain - It gets worse when it rains - It eventually will have no paint left.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a monsoon is in the area happens, how will it affect less rain falls.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The introduction of a monsoon or heavy rainfall to the area indeed has an effect on the process of rain damaging the wood and its finish. With a monsoon, there will be significantly more rain, which can lead to the following consequences: 1. Accelerated damage: With increased rain, the wood is subjected to a greater amount of water seeping into its surface. As a result, the deterioration of the wood's finish will occur at a faster pace than it would under normal rainfall conditions. 2. Higher moisture content: The high volume of rain from a monsoon will saturate the wood, increasing its moisture content. This can cause wood to swell and potentially lead to structural damage, depending on its location and components. 3. Increased likelihood of mold and mildew growth: The higher moisture content in the wood, coupled with the humid conditions created by a monsoon, can promote mold and mildew growth, which further deteriorates the wood and may pose health risks to occupants if the wood is part of a building structure. 4. Longer drying times: Due to the excessive rain, it will take longer for the wood to dry out after the monsoon ends. This prolonged period of dampness can deepen the deterioration of the finish and increase the risk of further damage to the wood and its paint. 5. Weakened paint adhesion: As more rain seeps into the wood's surface, more finish will be removed when the water evaporates, leading to an overall weakening of the paint adhesion. This can make the wood appear worse and result in a more rapid loss of its protective coating. In conclusion, the perturbation of a monsoon in the area can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of rain damaging wood and its finish. The increased rain and humidity can accelerate the damage, increase the moisture content, promote mold and mildew growth, and weaken the paint adhesion, ultimately hastening the deterioration of the wood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Incorrect or insufficient tagging: Quora relies heavily on tags to enable users to find questions that match their areas of expertise. Ensure that you tag your questions properly so that they reach your desired audience. 6. Expertise of the users: It could be that the users who have viewed your question simply do not have the knowledge or experience to provide a satisfactory answer. 7. Engagement with the community: Building an active presence on the platform can increase your chances of getting answers. Engage with others on Quora by answering questions, upvoting valuable answers, and adding comments. 8. Patience and persistence: Sometimes, it takes a while for questions to gain momentum and receive answers. It is crucial to be patient and persistent in your quest for answers on Quora. To increase your chances of receiving answers, you can: 1. Improve the quality and clarity of your questions. 2. Post questions at different times of the day to determine peak engagement. 3. Ensure proper tagging of questions to reach the appropriate audience. 4. Make your questions unique, interesting, or relevant to current trends. 5. Participate actively in the Quora community to build a more extensive network of potential answerers. 6. Keep an eye on the questions you post and update them if necessary, to refine their content or keep them in line with current trends.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia. The differences were remarkable in terms of overall well-being and health.  But I can use this background: The primary role of red blood cells in the circulatory system is to transport oxygen to the tissues. The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness.  What is an answer for this question: Which patient had fewer red blood cells, Dan or Jim? A:","output":"Jim, the patient with sickle-cell anemia, likely had fewer red blood cells than Dan, the normal patient. Sickle-cell anemia is a genetic disorder that affects the production and function of red blood cells. The crescent-shaped, or \\"sickle\\" red blood cells in individuals with this condition do not function as efficiently as normal cells in transporting oxygen, and they can break apart more easily, leading to a decrease in the overall number of red blood cells in the body. This results in a lower red blood cell count for Jim compared to Dan, who has a normal number of red blood cells."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Mordred or Modred (Medrod, etc.) is a character in the Arthurian legend, known as a notorious traitor who fought King Arthur at the Battle of Camlann, where he was killed and Arthur fatally wounded. Tradition varies on his relationship to Arthur, but he is best known today as Arthur's illegitimate son by his half-sister Morgause, though in many modern adaptations Morgause is merged with the character of Morgan le Fay. In earlier literature, he was considered the legitimate son of Morgause, also known as Anna, with her husband King Lot of Orkney. His brothers or half-brothers are Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and Gareth. The name (from either Old Welsh Medraut, Cornish Modred, or Old Breton Modrot) is ultimately derived from Latin \\"Modertus\\".  - Sir Gareth (Old French: Guerrehet) was a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian legend. He is nicknamed \\"Beaumains\\" in Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\". He was the youngest son of Lot and of Morgause, King Arthur's half-sister, thus making him Arthur's nephew, as well as brother to Gawain, Agravain, Gaheris, and half-brother to Mordred.  - Lot or Loth is the king of Lothian in the Arthurian legend. He is best known as the father of Sir Gawain. Such a ruler first appeared late in the 1st millennium's hagiographical material concerning Saint Kentigern (also known as Saint Mungo), which feature a \\"Leudonus\\", king of \\"Leudonia\\", a Latin name for Lothian. In the 12th century, Geoffrey of Monmouth adapted this to Lot, king of Lothian, in his influential chronicle \\"Historia Regum Britanniae\\", portraying him as King Arthur's brother-in-law and ally. In the wake of Geoffrey's writings, Lot appeared regularly in later romance.  - The Eagle is the final novel in the A Dream of Eagles series ( published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles ) . The Eagle follows the continuing story of Clothar ( Lancelot ) from when he meets Arthur Pendragon , to , and possibly after , King Arthur 's death . It also is noted for having a sympathetic portrait of Mordred . The novel was released on November 19 , 2005 in Canada and was released in the United States in 2007 .  - Jack Whyte (born 1940) is a Scottish-Canadian novelist of historical fiction. Born and raised in Scotland, Whyte has been living in Canada since 1967. He resides in Kelowna, British Columbia.  - A civil war, also known as an intrastate war in polemology, is a war between organized groups within the same state or country, or, less commonly, between two countries created from a formerly united state. The aim of one side may be to take control of the country or a region, to achieve independence for a region or to change government policies. The term is a calque of the Latin \\"bellum civile\\" which was used to refer to the various civil wars of the Roman Republic in the 1st century BC.  - A Dream of Eagles is a historical novel series written by the Canadian author Jack Whyte. It was published in the United States as the Camulod Chronicles.  - Sir Lancelot du Lac (meaning Lancelot of the lake, baptised as Galahad) was one of the Knights of the Round Table in the Arthurian legend. He typically features as King Arthur's greatest companion, the lord of Joyous Gard and the greatest swordsman and jouster of the age  until his adultery with Queen Guinevere is discovered, causing a civil war exploited by Mordred which brings about the end of Arthur's kingdom.  - Morgause is a character in later Arthurian traditions, appearing in Thomas Malory's 15th-century text \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\" as the mother of Gawain and Mordred, both key players in the story of King Arthur and his downfall. Mordred is the offspring of Arthur's inadvertent incest with Morgause, the king's estranged half-sister. She is also a sister of Morgan le Fay and the wife of King Lot of Orkney, as well as the mother of Gareth, Agravain, and Gaheris.  - Sir Galahad (sometime referred to as Galeas or Galath ), in Arthurian legend, is a knight of King Arthur's Round Table and one of the three achievers of the Holy Grail. He is the illegitimate son of Sir Lancelot and Elaine of Corbenic, and is renowned for his gallantry and purity. Emerging quite late in the medieval Arthurian tradition, Sir Galahad first appears in the LancelotGrail cycle, and his story is taken up in later works such as the Post-Vulgate Cycle and Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\".  - Sir Agravain (sometimes spelled Agravaine) is a Knight of the Round Table in Arthurian Legend. In Chrétien de Troyes, the Vulgate, Post-Vulgate cycles and Thomas Malory's \\"Le Morte d'Arthur\\", he is the second eldest son of King Lot of Orkney with Anna/Morgause/Morgan (Arthur's sister), thus nephew of King Arthur, and brother to Sir Gawain, Gaheris, and Gareth, and half-brother to Mordred.

Although Detroit's center field situation is still pretty murky, it would take an uncharacteristically strong spring from Lough for him to supplant Tyler Collins, Mikie Mahtook, or JaCoby Jones for big-league playing time. Hypothesis: It will be tough for Lough to jump to big league playing time.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, the hypothesis stating that it will be tough for Lough to jump to big league playing time appears to be true. There are several reasons supporting this hypothesis: 1. Lough's performance: He was released from the Phillies in August due to his sub-.700 OPS (On-base Plus Slugging) performance both in the majors and with Triple-A Lehigh Valley. This suggests that he has had recent struggles in his performance, which may be a hindrance in securing big-league playing time. 2. Competition: The paragraph mentions that Detroit's center field situation is still pretty murky, but there are already other players like Tyler Collins, Mikie Mahtook, and JaCoby Jones in contention for big-league playing time. This indicates that Lough will face stiff competition to find a spot in the lineup. 3. Uncharacteristic spring performance required: To have any chance of supplanting his competitors for a regular spot, Lough would need to deliver an uncharacteristically strong spring performance. This means he has to outperform not only his recent history but also the performance of his competitors, which could be difficult. In conclusion, given Lough's recent subpar performance, the strong competition he faces, and the need for an exceptional spring performance, the hypothesis that it will be tough for Lough to jump to big league playing time is true."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea.

He finds a boy there, George, an orphan who was raised by the dead priest, and taught English. The boy is the same age as the schoolgirls. Soon a group of flamboyant prostitutes arrive at the cathedral, seeking refuge by hiding in the cellar. Pretending to be a priest, Miller tries to keep everyone safe while trying to repair the convent's truck to use for an escape. After an incident when rogue Japanese forces assault the cathedral (who are then killed by the dying effort of a lone Chinese Major), Japanese Colonel Hasegawa promises to protect the convent by placing guards outside the gate, and requests that the schoolgirls sing a chorale for him. Several days later, he hands Miller an official invitation for the schoolgirls to sing at the Japanese Army's victory celebration. Fearing for the safety of the virginal schoolgirls, Miller declines. Hasegawa informs him that it is an order and that the girls are going to be picked up the next day. Before they leave, the Japanese soldiers count the schoolgirls and erroneously include one of the prostitutes (who has strayed from the cellar), totalling 13. When the de facto leader of the schoolgirls, Shu Juan (Xinyi), convinces them that they are better off committing suicide by jumping off the cathedral tower, they are saved at the last moment when the de facto leader of the prostitutes, Yu Mo (Ni), convinces her group to protect the schoolgirls by taking their place at the Japanese party. As there are only 12 prostitutes, George, the dead priest's adoptive son,... The answer to this question is:","output":"After the Japanese leave, Miller hides the girls in the cellar of the Western-run Roman Catholic cathedral. The cellar is also where the group of flamboyant prostitutes initially sought refuge. Miller pretends to be a priest and tries to keep everyone safe while working on repairing the convent's truck for a potential escape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Subject: The subject of the sentence is not explicitly mentioned. However, it is implied that the person being addressed is the subject. In an imperative sentence like this, the subject is often left implied, making it understandable. 2. Verb: \\"Write\\" is the main verb in the sentence, and it's in the imperative form. This instructs the subject of the sentence, typically the listener or reader, to perform the action (writing in this case). 3. Direct Object: \\"a letter\\" is the direct object in the sentence, as it is the thing being acted upon by the verb (write). 4. Prepositional Phrase: \\"to Anne Elliott.\\" The preposition \\"to\\" shows the relationship between the direct object (a letter) and the recipient (Anne Elliott). The proper noun \\"Anne Elliott\\" serves as the object of the preposition, or the person receiving the letter.

Since the tower was not yet finished, the bell was mounted in New Palace Yard but, during testing it cracked beyond repair and a replacement had to be made. The bell was recast on 10 April 1858 at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry as a 131⁄2 ton (13.76-tonne) bell. The second bell was transported from the foundry to the tower on a trolley drawn by sixteen horses, with crowds cheering its progress; it was then pulled 200 ft (61.0 m) up to the Clock Tower's belfry, a feat that took 18 hours. It is 7 feet 6 inches (2.29 m) tall and 9 feet (2.74 m) diameter. This new bell first chimed in July 1859; in September it too cracked under the hammer. According to the foundry's manager, George Mears, the horologist Denison had used a hammer more than twice the maximum weight specified. For three years Big Ben was taken out of commission and the hours were struck on the lowest of the quarter bells until it was repaired. To make the repair, a square piece of metal was chipped out from the rim around the crack, and the bell given an eighth of a turn so the new hammer struck in a different place. Big Ben has chimed with a slightly different tone ever since, and is still in use today with the crack unrepaired. Big Ben was the largest bell in the British Isles until \`\`Great Paul'', a 163⁄4 ton (17 tonne) bell currently hung in St Paul's Cathedral, was cast in 1881. Is the following statement correct based on the text has big ben got a crack in it","output":"Yes, sweetie, that's right! Big Ben has a crack in it. The bell we call Big Ben developed a crack soon after it first chimed in 1859, but instead of replacing the bell again, a small piece of metal was removed from the rim of the bell where the crack was. Then, they simply turned the bell a little so the hammer would hit it in a new spot. So, Big Ben is still working with that crack today.

But although Europe's style may be more muted, what's been achieved in the dark reaches of space far beyond Mars is remarkable by any standards. You could almost feel the sense of relief in the corridors that, after managing a 10-year trek through space with extraordinary accuracy, and after investing more than one billion euros, all has gone so well. The signal took nearly 23 minutes to reach us and, when it came, it was a dip in a line on a graph. But this showed that the final burn to reach the comet had finished and this key moment was the trigger for a wave of pride rather than jubilation. Getting a spacecraft to match the speed of a comet and effectively ride alongside it is a landmark in space exploration. But the hard work starts now. Just trying to comprehend the weird structure and shape of the comet is difficult enough, according to many here. As one scientist put it, it's like driving along the motorway for hours and then turning off into a busy town where everything is confusing. The next batches of pictures, taken from just 100km away, should provide some answers. Another challenge is coping with the slight but irregular pulls of the comet's gravity - Rosetta is now just close enough to feel them. The plan is to fly around the comet in a series of loops, and managing that task will take real care. One of many puzzles is why the first readings of the surface temperature are not colder, an indicator that there might not be as much ice as expected.

Question: Information:  - Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Following initial infection, a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza-like illness. Typically, this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms. As the infection progresses, it interferes more with the immune system, increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis, as well as other opportunistic infections, and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems. These late symptoms of infection are referred to as AIDS. This stage is often also associated with weight loss. HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating those who are infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after infection is 11 years. In 2015 about 36.7 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 1.1 million deaths. Most of those infected live in sub-Saharan Africa. Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39 million deaths worldwide. HIV/AIDS is considered a pandemica disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading. HIV is believed to have originated in west-central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century. AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention...  - Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\" (MTB). Tuberculosis generally affects the lungs, but can also affect other parts of the body. Most infections do not have symptoms; in which case it is known as latent tuberculosis. About 10% of latent infections progress to active disease which, if left untreated, kills about half of those infected. The classic symptoms of active TB are a chronic cough with blood-containing sputum, fever, night sweats, and weight loss. The historical term \\"consumption\\" came about due to the weight loss. Infection of other organs can cause a wide range of symptoms. Tuberculosis is spread through the air when people who have active TB in their lungs cough, spit, speak, or sneeze. People with latent TB do not spread the disease. Active infection occurs more often in people with HIV/AIDS and in those who smoke. Diagnosis of active TB is based on chest X-rays, as well as microscopic examination and culture of body fluids. Diagnosis of latent TB relies on the tuberculin skin test (TST) or blood tests. Prevention of TB involves screening those at high risk, early detection and treatment of cases, and vaccination with the bacillus Calmette-Guérin vaccine. Those at high risk include household, workplace, and social contacts of people with active TB. Treatment requires the use of multiple antibiotics over a long period of time. Antibiotic resistance is a growing problem with increasing rates of multiple drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). One-third of the world's population is thought to be infected with TB. New infections occur in about 1% of the population each year. In 2014, there were 9.6 million cases of active TB which resulted in 1.5 million deaths. More than 95% of deaths occurred in developing countries. The number of new cases each year has decreased since 2000. About 80% of people in many Asian and African countries test positive while 510% of people in the United States population tests positive by the tuberculin test....  - A diagnosis of latent tuberculosis (LTB), also called latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) means a patient is infected with \\"Mycobacterium tuberculosis\\", but the patient does not have active tuberculosis. Active tuberculosis can be contagious while latent tuberculosis is not, and it is therefore not possible to get TB from someone with latent tuberculosis. The main risk is that approximately 10% of these patients (5% in the first two years after infection and 0.1% per year thereafter) will go on to develop active tuberculosis. This is particularly true, and there is added risk, in particular situations such as medication that suppresses the immune system or advancing age.  - Vaccination is the administration of antigenic material (a vaccine) to stimulate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen. Vaccines can prevent or ameliorate morbidity from infection. When a sufficiently large percentage of a population has been vaccinated, this results in herd immunity. The effectiveness of vaccination has been widely studied and verified; for example, the influenza vaccine, the HPV vaccine, and the chicken pox vaccine. Vaccination is the most effective method of preventing infectious diseases; widespread immunity due to vaccination is largely responsible for the worldwide eradication of smallpox and the restriction of diseases such as polio, measles, and tetanus from much of the world. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that licensed vaccines are currently available to prevent or contribute to the prevention and control of twenty-five preventable infections.  - Miliary tuberculosis ( also known as \`\` disseminated tuberculosis '' , \`\` tuberculosis cutis acuta generalisata '' , and \`\` Tuberculosis cutis disseminata '' ) is a form of tuberculosis that is characterized by a wide dissemination into the human body and by the tiny size of the lesions ( 1 -- 5 mm ) . Its name comes from a distinctive pattern seen on a chest radiograph of many tiny spots distributed throughout the lung fields with the appearance similar to millet seeds -- thus the term \`\` miliary '' tuberculosis . Miliary TB may infect any number of organs , including the lungs , liver , and spleen . Miliary tuberculosis is present in about 2 % of all reported cases of tuberculosis and accounts for up to 20 % of all extra-pulmonary tuberculosis cases .  - Sputum is mucus and is the name used for the coughed-up material (phlegm) from the lower airways (trachea and bronchi). This process is known as sputilization. In medicine, sputum samples are usually used for naked eye exam, microbiological investigations of respiratory infections and cytological investigations of respiratory systems. It is critical that the patient not give a specimen that includes any mucoid material from the interior of the nose. Naked eye exam of sputum can be done at home by a patient in order to note the various colors (see below). Any hint of yellow color suggests an airway infection (but does not indicate between the types of organisms causing it). Such color hints are best detected when the sputum is viewed on a very white background such as white paper, a white pot, or a white sink surface. The more intense the yellow color, the more likely it is a bacterial infection (bronchitis, bronchopneumonia, or pneumonia).  - A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and keep a record of it so that the immune system can more easily recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters. Vaccines can be prophylactic (example: to prevent or ameliorate the effects of a future infection by any natural or \\"wild\\" pathogen), or therapeutic (e.g., vaccines against cancer are being investigated).

And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If you had someone break up with you, one of your first thoughts might be that of revenge, especially if you didn’t see the breakup coming.  You may think that getting revenge on the person who broke up with you might make you feel better, or at the very least give you a sense of justice, but it won’t.  Revenge will just end up making you feel worse.  Don’t make any decisions after a break up until you are calm and rational.  Give yourself time to heal before you ‘do’ anything. You most likely want revenge because you feel your trust has been broken, but getting revenge is not going to help to restore any of that trust. Whether you were the one who initiated the break-up, or someone broke up with you, you need to let go of any regret you may harbour.  If someone broke up with you, you likely had little or no control over the event, so it is a waste of your time to dwell on what might have been.  If you broke up with someone, you probably had a good reason.  Remind yourself of that good reason when you start to feel regretful in order to demonstrate to yourself why you shouldn’t be upset you broke up with someone.  Regardless of what happened, take the time to look at what weaknesses you might have that lead to the breakup. Whether you discover weaknesses or mistakes, realize that this is your change you learn from them.  How can you do things differently in the future? Focus on things you can control and change.  Try not to worry about the things out of your control. Whether you broke up with someone, or someone broke up with you, it is really easy to think of all the negative things that came from the breakup — things like feeling depressed and lonely.  Try not to focus on these negative things, instead look at all the good and positive things that can (or have) come from the breakup.  Write your feelings in a journal.  Write specifically about the positive things that have happened because of the breakup. These positive things might be things you learned while in the relationship, or they may be the good reasons why the breakup was necessary.  They can also include the positive outcomes that have resulted because of the breakup. Before you started to date this person you probably had a routine that you followed regularly.  That routine was probably dropped or changed once you started dating.  Now that you no longer have anyone else to worry about, get back into your routine.  Start up your normal exercise routine again.  Get back into the shape you were before the relationship. Spend more time working on extra work or home projects, anything you put aside during your relationship because you had no time. Plan and cook healthy meals regularly. Schedule and attend any missed or delayed appointments such as the dentist or the eye doctor. When in a relationship you always have two people on the top of your priority list — you and your partner.

Will iron left out in a dry area such as a desert, or iron left in a damp area like a rain forest corrode faster?  Two sailors, Jim and Eric decide to buy boats. The boats they buy ave a decent amount of iron in the construction and will be exposed to water almost constantly. Jim decides to coat his boat in a protective seal that seals out water and air. Eric thinks this is unnecessary and does not buy the protective seal.  Hint: Iron is first oxidized to iron(II) ions by oxygen. In the second step, the iron(II) ions are further oxidized and combine with water and oxygen gas to produce a hydrated form of iron(III) oxide known as rust. Rusting is one of many example of corrosion. Corrosion is the deterioration of metals by redox processes. Corrosion causes enormous amounts of damage to buildings, bridges, ships, cars, and other objects. It has been estimated that corrosion costs the U.S. economy over 100 billion dollars each year.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: Two sister cities were both situated on plate boundaries, close to volcanoes, on different continents. Red city was 10 miles from a volcano, while Tree city was 60 miles away. Red city experienced many earthquakes, Tree city few and far between.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city experienced the release of energy that was stored in the rocks less often?

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What band is Black Francis the frontman for? from the following article ?  Following their 2004 reunion, the Pixies felt that recording a new song would \\"break the ice\\" between band members after their acrimonious split in 1993. As the band were announcing dates for their reunion world tour, DreamWorks contacted manager Ken Goes to enquire whether they would be interested in recording a song for the title sequence of Shrek 2. The band agreed, and frontman Black Francis and Deal began composing riffs for a song aimed at children. Deal had been experimenting with a chord progression for a while, and since her band The Breeders were then inactive, she decided to donate her new composition to the Pixies. The Pixies chose Deal's riff, as it was a \\"poppier, more kid-friendly thing,\\" and Francis agreed to let her sing lead vocals and write the new song; significantly, Francis is relegated to backing vocals on the track. Francis' move was meant to warm the previously cold relations between the two—in the previous two Pixies studio albums, Bossanova (1990) and Trompe le Monde (1991), Francis, the band's principal songwriter, had not let Deal contribute any songs or sing lead vocals. This became one of the reasons for the Pixies' 1993 split. However, the two appeared at the time to have resolved their differences: Francis praised \\"Bam Thwok,\\" as \\"a really good song.\\" despite joking in interviews about how he planned to remove as many of her compositions as possible from a hypothetical new album. However, Deal eventually left the band in June 2013, before the release of the band's next album, Indie Cindy.
