Aaron Cresswell's first goal for West Ham handed them victory over Newcastle. CLICK HERE see the stats behind the game with our Match Zone. Eventually, when it came to Newcastle conceding a goal, there was little they could do about it. Eight hours and eight minutes had lapsed on the watch, their net having been safely guarded for almost two months, when Aaron Cresswell sensed trouble as everybody else stood and watched. Cheikhou Kouyate sent a hopeless volley towards goal, Cheick Tiote failed to react and the full-back, signed from Ipswich in the summer, crept up behind him and thrashed home past goalkeeper Rob Elliot, who was deputising for the injured Tim Krul. They may look at these three points and wonder of the significance because, make no mistake, OPTIONS: - Aaron Cresswell were second best for long spells. - Alan Pardew were second best for long spells. - Boleyn Ground were second best for long spells. - Cheick Tiote were second best for long spells. - Cheikhou Kouyate were second best for long spells. - Hammers were second best for long spells. - Ipswich were second best for long spells. - Match Zone were second best for long spells. - Moussa Sissoko were second best for long spells. - Newcastle were second best for long spells. - Premier League were second best for long spells. - Rob Elliot were second best for long spells. - Tim Krul were second best for long spells. - Tranmere Rovers were second best for long spells. - West Ham were second best for long spells.","output":"They may look at these three points and wonder of the significance because, make no mistake, West Ham were second best for long spells. Despite Aaron Cresswell's heroics, the Hammers struggled to maintain control throughout the game, often ceding possession and territory to a persistent Newcastle side.  In the first half, Newcastle showed dominance with a string of attacks and near misses that had West Ham's fans on the edge of their seats. The superior ball control and movement by Newcastle players like Moussa Sissoko and Cheick Tiote seemed to hint at a reversal of fortunes for the struggling team. However, West Ham's defense proved resilient, and a key moment in the match swung in their favor when Cresswell capitalized on Tiote's momentary lapse of concentration with an instinctive strike. Despite being on the back foot for much of the game, West Ham's ability to make the most of their opportunities and shut down Newcastle's attackers in crucial moments allowed them to clinch a narrow victory. West Ham manager Alan Pardew will undoubtedly be pleased with the result, but he will also be aware that there is much room for improvement—even in victory, his side was often overshadowed by their determined opponents. Still, the result is vital for West Ham as it moves them up the Premier League table, and though they may not have been the dominant force for much of the match, the old adage rings true: the important thing in football is not how well you play, but whether you can secure the three points when the final whistle blows. On this occasion, the Hammers' grit, determination, and clinical finishing from Cresswell proved to be the decisive factors in a hard-fought victory that will likely be remembered for its significance rather than its beauty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Are the following two questions the same? Is a person with bipolar disordes considered mentaly ill? What does a long landing mean?","output":"No, the two questions are not the same as they refer to distinct topics. Let me provide you with detailed answers for each question to clarify the difference between the two inquiries: 1. Is a person with bipolar disorders considered mentally ill? Bipolar disorder, previously known as manic-depressive illness, is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings which include emotional highs, known as mania or hypomania, and lows, known as depression. These mood shifts are far more intense than normal ups and downs experienced by most people and can seriously impact an individual's daily life, relationships, and ability to function effectively. Mental illnesses are health conditions involving changes in emotion, thinking, or behavior (or a combination of these) that causе distress and difficulty in functioning. While there is a wide range of mental illnesses, they share some common characteristics, such as affecting a person's thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. Since bipolar disorder involves significant changes in mood and functioning, it falls under the category of mental illnesses. It is important to recognize that having bipolar disorder or any other mental illness is not a personal failing, nor does it suggest weakness or moral shortcomings. Mental health conditions are medical issues that can be effectively treated and managed with appropriate care, medication, and therapy. 2. What does a long landing mean? A long landing refers to an aviation scenario in which an aircraft touches down significantly farther down the runway than intended, thus using up more runway length than necessary for a safe landing. This can be caused by various factors, such as pilot error, adverse weather conditions, or inaccurate estimation of the aircraft's speed or altitude on approach. When an aircraft makes a long landing, it may lead to potential safety risks or complications, including: - Reduced stopping distance: As a result of the long landing, there may be insufficient runway distance remaining for the aircraft to come to a complete stop. This increases the risk of a runway overrun, which may cause damage to the aircraft and pose a threat to the safety of passengers and crew members. - Compromising subsequent takeoffs and landings: The long landing may disrupt the schedule of other aircraft operating at the airport, as the aircraft must remain on the runway until it has safely slowed down and cleared the active runway. - Increased wear and tear on the aircraft: Long landings often lead to increased utilization of the aircraft's brakes, which can result in additional wear and subsequently increase maintenance costs. To avoid long landings, pilots undergo rigorous training to accurately judge the approach and landing parameters of their aircraft, taking into account weather conditions, aircraft weight, and other factors. Additionally, modern aviation technology, such as advanced flight control systems and approach aids, plays a crucial role in ensuring that pilots can safely land in various conditions and minimize occurrences of long landings. In summary, the first question deals with mental health, specifically bipolar disorder, while the second question is concerned with aviation and the concept of long landings. These two questions are not the same and address entirely different subjects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 1: Review the original question. Question: Why is Liaoning not assigned to any of China's operation fleets? Step 2: Research about Liaoning and its current status. Before responding to the question, I looked into the current status of the Liaoning aircraft carrier. Liaoning is China's first aircraft carrier, commissioned in 2012, and is a training vessel used to gain experience in aircraft carrier operations.  Step 3: Determine the answer. From my research, although Liaoning is considered a training vessel, it has also played a role in the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy's (PLAN) operations. It is part of the PLAN's North Sea Fleet, serving as an essential component for naval training exercises and expanding China's naval capabilities.  Step 4: Compare the answer from my research with the original answer. Comparing my findings with the original answer, it seems that the original answer is partially correct. While it is true that Liaoning's primary purpose is for training, it is assigned to a fleet - PLAN's North Sea Fleet. Step 5: Answer the question based on my research and justify my choice from the options provided. According to my research, Liaoning is assigned to the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy's North Sea Fleet.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Not as a nurse, but as a patient. I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform.

Introduction: The recent burial of Osama Bin Laden, conducted by the U.S. administration on the USS Carl Vinson, has sparked various discussions and debates on whether the process adhered to Islamic requirements or not. Body: An administration official has stated that the burial of Osama Bin Laden conformed to Islamic requirements. The religious rites for the notorious terrorist leader were conducted aboard the USS Carl Vinson shortly after his death in 2011. Bin Laden's body was wrapped in a white sheet, laid on a board, and tipped into the sea. This was done to ensure that the burial procedure conformed to Islamic tradition. However, a religion professor with expertise in Islamic studies believes that while some requirements were indeed followed, there are lingering questions around the overall conformity of the burial process. It is important to note that proper Islamic burial includes a series of intricate religious rites which can vary from one Islamic community to another. In order to be considered in accordance with Islamic requirements, the body must first be washed and shrouded in a clean cloth, preferably white. The burial should also include a funeral prayer, typically led by an Imam or a knowledgeable person in the community. Following the respectful disposal of the body, it is crucial to provide a proper burial plot in which the body is placed facing Mecca, the holy city of Islam. The administration has argued that burying Bin Laden at sea fulfilled these obligations, as there was no available burial plot on land and no country or community willing to claim his body. The sea burial allowed for a swift and respectful disposal, thus being in line with Islamic requirements. While the white sheet and tipping into the sea seem to validate their claims, the act of performing the required funeral prayer and correctly positioning the body remain uncertain. Conclusion: The exact conformity of Osama Bin Laden's burial to Islamic requirements remains open for interpretation, with opposing views from administration officials and religious experts. While some aspects of the burial appear to have adhered to Islamic tradition, other questions regarding the funeral prayer and body positioning continue to divide opinions. Further investigation might be needed to fully determine the extent of compliance with Islamic religious rites."},{"instruction":"Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: New Yorkers are gradually getting used to more bicyclers on those hot blue City Bikes.But what about local bike shops?

Even if a language has the same alphabet as yours, that does not mean that the pronunciation is always the same.   It will help to learn IPA, the International Phonetic Alphabet, as most dictionaries use it.  The Foreign Service Institute offers free online language learning materials, which include audio recordings which help with learning pronunciation. The Duolingo app and BBC Languages also offer various languages and useful pronunciation tips. This is probably the most important part of the language besides the vocabulary. \\"Paul want Mary go store\\" may communicate an idea, but it is not at all correct English.

Answer this: In a large forest with many animals, there are only a small number of bears. Which of these most likely limits the population of bears in the forest?","output":"To determine which factors most likely limit the population of bears in the forest, we need to consider the key factors that influence a bear population's growth and sustainability. Here is a step-by-step process for identifying the most likely primary factor: 1. Identify the species of bear: Different bear species have different habitat requirements, prey availability, and population densities. Knowing the species can help narrow down specific limiting factors. 2. List the potential limiting factors: Some potential limiting factors for bear populations might include food availability, habitat quality, mating opportunities, predation, hunting, and disease. 3. Analyze each factor individually:    a) Food availability: A bear's diet can be primarily plant-based with some animal tissue like berries, nuts, fish, smaller mammals, and insects. If any of these food sources are in short supply, that can limit the bear population.        b) Habitat quality: Bears typically prefer large, undisturbed forests with ample denning sites for hibernation. Habitat fragmentation, loss, or insufficient space can negatively impact their success and limit their population.        c) Mating opportunities: If the forest's bear population is too sparse or male-female ratios are skewed, this could impact reproduction opportunities and limit population growth.        d) Predation: While bears have few natural predators, hunting by humans or other large predators could impact their numbers.        e) Hunting: If hunting is allowed in the area and the bear population is not well managed, it may lead to overharvesting, affecting the overall population.        f) Disease: Bear populations can be affected by diseases and parasites, which may limit their population growth if the prevalence is high. 4. Identify the most likely factor: Considering the above factors in the context of a large forest with many animals, food availability, and habitat quality most likely contribute to the limitation of the bear population. The presence of other animals suggests there might be competition for food resources, while the large forest may not necessarily provide optimal habitat or protection for bears. Therefore, the most likely limiting factor for the bear population in the large forest with many animals is a combination of food availability and habitat quality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a speech to the National Association of Manufacturers in Washington, Trump promised to deliver on a “giant, beautiful, massive, the biggest ever in our country, tax cut.” Trump is eager to move past setbacks on health care reform and the results of a Republican Senate primary Tuesday in Alabama where he found himself on the losing side. The president and his administration also have been on the defensive over hurricane recovery efforts in Puerto Rico. Senate Republicans put off a vote on a plan to repeal and replace Obamacare after it became clear they did not have enough votes to pass the measure, thanks to a handful of Republican defectors. Democrats expressed relief they had beaten back another attempt to undo former President Barack Obama’s signature achievement, the Affordable Care Act. “The reason this bill failed is because millions of Americans didn’t want it,” Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told reporters at the Capitol. On the same day, Christian conservative and former judge Roy Moore easily won a Republican Senate primary in Alabama, defeating incumbent Luther Strange, whom Trump had supported. “We are put here on Earth for a short time, and for that short time our duty it to serve almighty God,” Moore said in his victory speech. Moore has made controversial statements on a number of issues in the past, but he is considered the favorite in a race against Democrat Doug Jones in a general election Dec. 12. Trump had appeared with Strange the week before at a rally in Alabama, but even some analysts said his heart did not appear to be in it. “Trump was campaigning for Luther Strange, but you could tell he was having some second thoughts about that,” said Republican strategist John Feehery.

Please answer the following question: Two groups of people were part of a nutrition study that lasted 2 years. Group A had a normal diet, while group B consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for 2 years. Group B gained lots of weight.  Which group had more people with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0??  Hint: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the scenario and the hint, we can infer that Group B inevitably had more individuals with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0. Here's why: Step 1: Understand the task. In this task, I need to determine which group of people had more people with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0 from a nutrition study where one group had a normal diet (Group A) and the other (Group B) consumed an extra 1000 calories a day for a span of 2 years. Step 2: Analyze the provided information. Taking into consideration the hint, it's implied that consuming extra food energy than needed causes the body to store this as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in about half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. Obesity occurs when the B.M.I. is 30.0 kg/m^2, or greater. Step 3: Apply the information to the scenario. Given that Group B members consistently consumed an extra 1000 calories per day for 2 years, they consumed much more energy than they needed daily. This extra energy was stored as fat in their bodies, causing them to gain weight. Step 4: Make the final conclusion. Therefore, from the information provided and considering the condition concerning inactive additional Calories being stored as fat, leading to obesity (B.M.I. greater than 30), we deduce that Group B, the group consuming an extra 1000 calories per day for two years, had a higher likelihood of having more people with a B.M.I. greater than 30.0.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What's the boat the smuggler sails named for? from the following article ?  After booking a boat trip to attend a rave to an island located off the coast of Seattle named \\"Isla del Morte\\" (\\"Island of Death\\"), two college students, Simon and Greg meet up with three girls: Alicia, Karma and Cynthia. Karma has a crush on Simon, Simon has a crush on Alicia, and Cynthia is Greg's girlfriend. When the five arrive at the dock, they find that they are late and the boat that is supposed to take them to Isla del Morte has already left. A boat captain named Victor Kirk and his first mate Salish offer them a ride on their boat, the Lazarus V (named after the biblical man raised from the dead). As they leave, a policewoman named Jordan Casper tries to stop them from leaving, knowing of Kirk's past as a smuggler, but fails. Arriving at Isla del Morte, they find the rave site messed up and deserted. Alicia, Karma and Simon leave the site to go find anybody around while Cynthia and Greg stay behind. As Greg and Cynthia are about to make out in a tent, the former leaves to urinate. Alone in the tent, Cynthia is killed by a group of zombies. Meanwhile, Alicia, Karma and Simon find a derelict house and as they attempt to investigate the place, they discover Rudy, Liberty and Hugh, who inform them of a zombie attack during the rave. Alicia and Rudy used to date and Liberty was a dancer at the rave. The six leave the house to fetch Greg and Cynthia. Meanwhile, the zombies kill Salish when he is alone in the forest.

Chill With A Cerveza By The Coup Two days ago, Honduran military forces surrounded the country's presidential palace in Tegucigalpa, ousting President Manuel Zelaya. A day later, the U.S. State Department issued a statement warning Americans not to travel to the country, as it has an \\"unstable political and security situation.\\" But that's no reason to write off Honduras' neighbors to the north and south. For tourists in the rest of Central America, it's business as usual. No paramilitary, just piña coladas--not to mention low prices. According to Kelly Grumbach, travel expert for personal concierge service Quintessentially, the average round-trip airline ticket to Central America is about 500. Partly for this reason, she notes, tourists aren't staying away from Central America due to the turmoil in Honduras. Grumbach says she's only seen increases in travel to Panama City recently, and they have yet to level off. \\"With the current state of the economy, Panama City has seen a large increase in tourism and incoming travel requests,\\" says Kelly Anne Walsh, head of Quintessentially's Panama office. \\"We are a relatively inexpensive destination with great nightlife, beaches and culture.\\" John Clifford, president of luxury travel consulting firm International Travel Management, suggests trying for a reservation at the Bristol Panama, \\"a European style, five-star boutique hotel located in the Marbella district.\\" The deluxe room rate for the Panama City hotel is only 249 per night, including a butler service. For a quieter spot, try the archipelago of Bocas del Toro, with its crystal-clear waters perfect for snorkeling and diving. In fact, nature is the main draw in nearly all of Central America, not just Panama. Costa Rica, renowned for its eco-tourism, hosts about 2 million visitors a year. Most of them steer clear of the busy capital city of San Jose, nestled in the middle of the country, and instead opt for any of several coastal oases. For vacation spots on the coast Clifford suggests Quepos, a town on the Pacific coast and the gateway to the Manuel Antonio National Park. Though the park is the smallest in the country, there's no shortage of adventure there, from hiking to biking to getting close to nature. One can catch a glimpse of a rare brown-throated three-toed sloth in the luscious forests as well as as scuba dive within feet of playful dolphins. Adventures also abound in Belize, on the Atlantic side of Central America. The Belizean territory consists of more ocean than land, and just offshore is Ambergris Cay island, home of the Mata Chica Resort. Costing 249 per night during the just-begun low season, the resort is right on the Belize Great Barrier Reef, the second-largest reef in the world. For those wishing to stay on the mainland, Clifford recommends the Blancaneaux Lodge on Belize's southern coast, a resort owned by film director Francis Ford Coppola. \\"It's a jungle sanctuary overlooking a creek complete with rapids and a stunning waterfall,\\" Clifford says. Just the sort of thing that makes it easy to forget there's a government upheaval occurring right nearby.

In 1937 he composed his first major liturgical work, the Mass in G major for soprano and mixed choir a cappella, which has become the most frequently performed of all his sacred works. Poulenc's new compositions were not all in this serious vein; his incidental music to the play La Reine Margot, starring Yvonne Printemps, was pastiche 16th-century dance music, and became popular under the title Suite française. Music critics generally continued to define Poulenc by his light-hearted works, and it was not until the 1950s that his serious side was widely recognised.In 1936 Poulenc began giving frequent recitals with Bernac. At the École Normale in Paris they gave the premiere of Poulenc's Cinq poèmes de Paul Éluard. They continued to perform together for more than twenty years, in Paris and internationally, until Bernac's retirement in 1959. Poulenc, who composed 90 songs for his collaborator, considered him one of the \\"three great meetings\\" of his professional career, the other two being Éluard and Landowska. In Johnson's words, \\"for twenty-five years Bernac was Poulenc's counsellor and conscience\\", and the composer relied on him for advice not only on song-writing, but on his operas and choral music.Throughout the decade, Poulenc was popular with British audiences; he established a fruitful relationship with the BBC in London, which broadcast many of his works. With Bernac, he made his first tour of Britain in 1938. His music was also popular in America, seen by many as \\"the quintessence of French wit, elegance and high spirits\\". In the last years of the 1930s, Poulenc's compositions continued to vary between serious and light-hearted works.

I loved the new art at the hospital instead of the old design, because the  OPT:  (A). art was terrible..  (B). design was terrible..","output":"I loved the new art at the hospital instead of the old design, because the design was terrible. It is essential to understand the importance of a well-thought-out and aesthetically pleasing design when it comes to the interiors and exteriors of buildings, especially in places like hospitals, where people are going through difficult and challenging moments in their lives. The previous design of the hospital was dull and dreary, characterized by monotonous colors and unimaginative patterns. The walls were covered in shades of beige and gray, giving the space a worn-out, tired appearance. This could easily lower patients' spirits and make them feel even more miserable than they already were. Moreover, the lack of any inviting or comforting visuals often left patients anxious and overwhelmed. The old design also lacked any cohesive theme or sense of identity. The artworks, if any, were haphazardly placed without any thought being given to their ability to impact patients positively. The decorations mostly consisted of stock prints of landscapes and abstract shapes, which failed to resonate with patients and their families, as they served more as generic placeholders than thought-provoking conversation starters. Fortunately, the hospital administration recognized the shortcomings of their existing design and took decisive action to revamp their premises with an entirely new and innovative artistic direction. They not only sought input from professional designers and artists but also consulted with patients, their families, and hospital staff on what they would like to see around them. This collaborative approach resulted in a remarkable transformation of the hospital's interiors. The new design incorporated various colors, textures, and materials that encouraged warmth, tranquility, and serenity, allowing patients to feel more comfortable in their surroundings. The walls were adorned with modern murals, abstract paintings, and uplifting messages that spoke to people from all walks of life, making the atmosphere more welcoming and eliciting a sense of belonging among the community. Another key aspect of the new design was the attention paid to the spatial layout and planning. Open spaces, indoor gardens, and natural sunlight were prioritized, fostering a sense of interconnectedness between the indoors and outdoors. Well-defined walkways and seating areas were added for the convenience of patients, families, and staff, making it easy to navigate the building and find places to rest and gather. Art also extended beyond the walls, with local sculptors being commissioned to create unique pieces for the outdoor landscaping. These stunning installations sparked curiosity, wonder, and admiration while staying true to the hospital's mission of promoting health and wellness. The hospital's artistic transformation demonstrates the power of creative expression and the significant impact it can have on people's well-being. The new and improved design bridges the gap between functionality and beauty, providing spaces that not only address patients’ physical needs but also cater to their emotional and mental well-being. As a result, the hospital has become a place where patients and their families can draw strength, support, and hope in trying times, and where staff find renewed motivation to continue their essential work in healing and nurturing those who need it most."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cosmo Kramer, usually referred to as simply \\"Kramer\\", is a fictional character on the American television sitcom Seinfeld (1989-1998), played by Michael Richards. The character is loosely based on comedian Kenny Kramer, Larry David's ex-neighbor across the hall. Kramer is the friend and neighbor of main character Jerry, residing in Apartment 5B, and is friends with George and Elaine. Of the series' four central characters, only Kramer has no visible means of support; what few jobs he holds seem to be nothing more than larks. In \\"The Trip\\", Kramer admits that a man in a park exposed himself to him when he was a young boy. In \\"The Big Salad\\" Kramer reveals to Jerry that he grew up in a strict household where he had to be in bed every night by 9:00PM. In \\"The Letter\\", Kramer tells two art patrons that he ran away from home at age seventeen and stowed away aboard a steamer bound for Sweden.  Kramer never completed high school; however, it is made clear in \\"The Barber\\" that Kramer has a GED.  Kramer was estranged for a long period from his mom, Babs Kramer, who works as a restroom matron at an upscale restaurant. Unlike George and Jerry, Kramer's character does not have a well-developed network of family members shown in the sitcom. He is the only main character on the show whose dad never makes an appearance; however, in \\"The Chinese Woman\\", Kramer mentions that he is the last male member of his family, implying that his father had died. He also mentions in \\"The Lip Reader\\" that he has or had a deaf cousin, from whom he learned fluent American Sign Language, but when Kramer tries to communicate in ASL, he speaks complete gibberish and cannot correctly translate the ASL he sees others using. He also apparently has no biological children, although he adopted mile 114 of the Arthur Burkhardt Expressway in \\"The Pothole\\".  During an opening discussion, Kramer reveals to Jerry that in 1979 he was struck on the head by a falling air conditioner while walking on the sidewalk. Jerry asks if that was when Kramer lived in Greenwich Village, to which Kramer replies that he cannot remember. This is discussed in the beginning of \\"The Little Kicks\\".  In \\"The Strong Box\\", it is revealed that Kramer spent a brief time in the Army, although info about this time is \\"classified\\".

(CNN) -- A Christian evangelical group said Thursday that a Bible school -- backed by American evangelist Franklin Graham -- was destroyed in the latest bombing raid to hit South Kordofan, an oil-rich Sudanese province that borders the newly created independent country of South Sudan. At least eight bombs were dropped in the area Wednesday during the school's first day of classes, according to a statement by Samaritan's Purse, Graham's Christian humanitarian group, which supports the school. Two bombs landed inside the compound -- located in the region's Nuba Mountains -- destroying two Heiban Bible College buildings and igniting grass fires across the area, the group said in a statement No injuries were reported. \\"It was a miracle that no one was injured,\\" the statement added. Graham, who has called on the international community to take out Sudan's air assets and establish a no-fly zone in the region, said in a statement Thursday that he blamed Sudan's air force for the strike. At least four churches have been destroyed since August, the group said. \\"We are deeply concerned for the welfare and lives of the people of South Kordofan and we condemn the bombing of churches and Christian facilities,\\" added Graham, son of the famed Rev. Billy Graham. More than 78,000 people have fled South Kordofan and Blue Nile states since August of last year after an armed rebellion took root, the United Nations reported. The Sudanese government is thought to have responded to the rebellion by conducting sustained air raids with the use of Russian-made Antonov bombers, which have raised concerns over civilian casualties. Decades of civil war between the north and south, costing as many as 2 million lives, formally ended with a U.S.-brokered peace treaty in 2005.

Question: \\"When did the Indus valley civilization begin to thrive?\\"  Context: \\"The history of the area that now constitutes Himachal Pradesh dates back to the time when the Indus valley civilisation flourished between 2250 and 1750 BCE. Tribes such as the Koilis, Halis, Dagis, Dhaugris, Dasa, Khasas, Kinnars, and Kirats inhabited the region from the prehistoric era. During the Vedic period, several small republics known as \\"Janapada\\" existed which were later conquered by the Gupta Empire. After a brief period of supremacy by King Harshavardhana, the region was once again divided into several local powers headed by chieftains, including some Rajput principalities. These kingdoms enjoyed a large degree of independence and were invaded by Delhi Sultanate a number of times. Mahmud Ghaznavi conquered Kangra at the beginning of the 10th century. Timur and Sikander Lodi also marched through the lower hills of the state and captured a number of forts and fought many battles. Several hill states acknowledged Mughal suzerainty and paid regular tribute to the Mughals.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Indus Valley Civilization began to thrive around 2250 BCE, as mentioned in the context provided. This places its development during the time when the area of present-day Himachal Pradesh was also inhabited by various tribes such as the Koilis, Halis, Dagis, Dhaugris, Dasa, Khasas, Kinnars, and Kirats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They look like two typical fans posing in front of Kayne West as he performs at the wedding of the favourite grandson of Kazakh dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev. But the pair with their eyes on Kim Kardashian's boyfriend are two eligible Kazakh 'princesses', from enormously powerful clans in the oil and gas rich ex-Soviet state made famous by Sacha Baron Cohen mocking film starring TV reporter 'Borat'. On the left is Venera Nazarbayeva, 23,  the tyrant's granddaughter, whose Sandhurst-educated brother Aysultan, a Kazakh military intelligence officer, was celebrating his wedding with West's 3 million gig. Controversial: Venera Nazarbayeva, left, and Shynar Nematova, right, are two eligible Kazakh 'princesses' from enormously powerful clans in the oil and gas rich ex-Soviet state. Concert: Kanye West with Shynar Nematova, the daughter of Kazakhtan's Deputy Prime Minister. On the right is Shynar Nematova, 22, a graduate of University College, London, and daughter of ambitious deputy premier of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov, a close Nazarbayev crony. Other pictures posted on the web by guests at the lavish celebration in Almaty were captioned as showing glamorous Shynar and West on the dance floor together. Aysultan, 23, is being groomed as a possible successor of the 73 year old president, say some sources in Kazakh capital Astana, though fierce battles between influential clans mean it is hard to predict what will happen when he goes. Nazarbayev - widely criticised for human rights abuses and rigging elections - employs Tony Blair as an advisor  in an £8 million a year consultancy deal. Ironically, one of Nazarbayev's most implacable foes is Rakhat Aliyev, ex-husband of his daughter Dariga, and father of both Aysultan and Venera. Aliyev, once head of Nazarbayev's secret services, now lives in exile in Europe where he fears he could be seized by Kazakh spies and forced to face 'political' charges in his homeland. 'Kayne West should have thought twice before performing in Kazakhstan for the Nazarbayev family,' said an opposition source. Connections: West dances with Shynar Nematova. Criticism: West has found himself embroiled in controversy after the rapper raked in a reported 3 million to perform at the wedding. 'Kim should have warned him about the truth behind these glamorous people he was singing and dancing for.' West has found himself embroiled in controversy again after the rapper raked in a reported 3 million to perform at the wedding, according to TMZ. President Nazarbayev, who is. reportedly worth billions, is a controversial figure and has been at the. centre of claims of violating human rights and corruption. Singer Sting previously refused a similar invitation because of his record on human rights. The bash took place at the Hotel Royal. Tulip in Almaty, the capital of Kazakhstan, the country memorably. lampooned by Sacha Baron Cohen in his 2006 movie Borat. Payday: Kanye West reportedly raked in 3 million to perform at the wedding of controversial Kazakhstan President Nursultan Nazarbayev’s grandson on Saturday. Controversy: Nursultan Nazarbayev, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan,. addressing the 62nd session of the United Nations General Assembly at. the UN in New York in 2007. Expensive tastes: Kanye and his girlfriend Kim Kardashian (pictured at the Met Ball in May) like to splash out on the finer things in life. Kanye performed a selection of his hits. including Can't Tell Me Nothing and part of his set was captured on. video by a wedding guest, who posted it on Instagram. In. 2011, Sting pulled out of an arranged concert for the president over. claims of human rights violations on oil workers in the Central Asian. country. He said at the time, ‘Hunger strikes,. imprisoned workers and tens of thousands on strike represents a virtual. picket line which I have no intention of crossing. ‘The. Kazakh gas and oil workers and their families need our support and the. spotlight of the international media on their situation in the hope of. bringing about positive change.’ David Mepham, director of Human Rights. Watch has said: 'Kazakhstan's serious and deteriorating human rights. situation includes \\"credible allegations of torture, the imprisonment of. government critics, tight controls over the media and freedom of. expression and association, limits in religious freedom, and continuing. violation of workers' rights\\".' Kazakh. website Tengrinews wrote that the party celebrated the nuptials of. Aysultan Nazarbayev and Alima Boranbayeva. Aysultan, 23, is the youngest. son of President Nazarbayev's eldest daughter. He is a graduate of Sandhurst, and now works for the country's ministry of defence. Meanwhile his bride Boranbayeva, 20, reportedly attends London's Courtauld Institute of Art. Kanye is worth millions, but he and girlfriend Kim are well known for their expensive taste. The couple who recently welcomed their first child North West, have splashed out a whopping 750,000 on four gold-plated toilets for their new home.

Bush also used solar energy to help power a maintenance building on the White House grounds, and to assist in heating the swimming pool there.      The announcement comes on the one-year anniversary af an executive order signed by the president that called on the federal government to lead in the establishment of a clean energy economy. ||||| FILE - This file photo released by Solar Design Associates shows the solar thermal system produced by the Harvard, Mass., company, installed on the roof of the White House pool cabana in Washington during...

(Associated Press)      FILE - In this June 20, 1979, file photo President Jimmy Carter, center, is surrounded by reporters and photographers as he inspected new White House solar hot water heating system located on the roof... (Associated Press)      The most famous residence in the United States, which has already boosted its green credentials by planting a vegetable garden, plans to install solar panels atop the White House's living quarters. The solar panels are to be installed by spring 2011, and will heat water for the first family and supply some electricity.      Energy Secretary Steven Chu announced the plans Tuesday in Washington at a conference of local, state, academic and nonprofit leaders aimed at identifying how the federal government can improve its environmental performance.      Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George W. Bush both tapped the sun during their days in the White House. Carter in the late 1970s spent 30,000 on a solar water-heating system for West Wing offices. Bush's solar systems powered a maintenance building and some of the mansion, and heated water for the swimmint pool.      Obama, who has championed renewable energy, has been under increasing pressure by the solar industry and environmental activists to lead by example by installing solar at the White House, something White House officials said has been under consideration since he first took office.      The decision perhaps has more import now after legislation to reduce global warming pollution died in the Senate, despite the White House's support. Obama has vowed to try again on a smaller scale.      Last month, global warming activists with 350.org carried one of Carter's solar panels _ which were removed in 1986 _ from Unity College in the state of Maine to Washington to urge Obama to put solar panels on his roof. It was part of a global campaign to persuade world leaders to install solar on their homes. After a meeting with White House officials, they left Washington without a commitment.      Bill McKibben, the founder of the 350.org group, said Tuesday the administration did the right thing.      \\"If it has anything like the effect of the White House garden, it could be a trigger for a wave of solar installations across the country and around the world,\\" McKibben said in a statement.      What was unclear Tuesday was how much the White House solar project will cost, and how much fossil fuel-based electricity it would displace, since the system is not yet designed and the White House will not disclose how much energy is needed to keep the president's lights turned on.      Based on available roof space, administration officials expect the photovoltaic system will include between 25 to 75 panels and will convert sunlight into 19,700 kilowatt hours of electricity a year. That would save a typical household 2,300 on its electricity bill, based on commercial rates in Washington. The solar hot water heating system, based on government estimates, could save an additional 1,000 a year.      But the White House is far from a typical house, noted Danny Kennedy, the founder of California-based solar energy provider Sungevity, which offered to put solar panels on the White House for free earlier this year as part of a campaign called SolarontheWhiteHouse.      Kennedy estimates that outfitting Obama's home with solar would cost about 100,000 if paid out of pocket. But the money would be earned back with savings on the electric bill in the first five years, he said in an interview from the Maldives, where he is installing 48 solar panels on President Mohammed Nasheed's private residence.      Kennedy said his calculations were based on a 5,000 square-foot (464 sq. meter) California home, which uses 60,000 kilowatt hours of electricity annually. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Energy Secretary Steven Chu has announced plans to install solar panels and a solar hot water heater at the White House. The solar panel system is set to be installed by next spring and will convert sunlight directly to electricity. The solar hot water heater will have a solar collector facing the sun to heat water for use in the White House residence. A competitive procurement process will be used to select the company that will make the installations. Former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George W.

It also said there would be unspecified back office cuts at other UK sites. AstraZeneca announced a fall in pre-tax profits for the three months to the end of December to 2.05bn (??1.32bn) compared with 2.28bn in 2010. Profit for the financial year was up to 12.37bn, from 10.97bn the year before. The UK's second-largest drugs firm has 61,000 staff globally, of which 8,000 are in the UK. The GMB union said shedding R&D jobs would damage the UK economy. \\"These cutting edge R&D [research and development] jobs are both well paid and essential for a thriving UK economy,\\" said Allan Black from the GMB. The latest cuts are part of the third restructuring programme the company has carried out since 2007, and is designed to save 1.6bn a year by 2014. By James GallagherHealth and science reporter, BBC News There are still large profits being made by pharma, but there are pressures on the whole industry. Huge costs in developing new drugs are paid for with huge profits while the company has exclusive rights to manufacture the medication. However, when patents expire, anyone can manufacture the drug and profits plummet. Many money-spinners are reaching the end of their lifespans and there are concerns that not enough new drugs are coming in to replace them. One of the problems with drug research is that the obvious drugs have already been made. Analysis: Pharmaceutical woes The aim is to release funding to invest in research and development and \\"the UK remains strongly positioned to compete for those R&D dollars,\\" Stephen Whitehead, chief executive of the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry told BBC News. He said the job losses at AstraZeneca were a result of changes to the the R&D process that had become \\"more complex and much more expensive\\". \\"Increasingly there has been externalisation of R&D, collaboration with universities, with research charities, with academia... So that means that you don't necessarily employ people [directly].\\" In its first round of restructuring AstraZeneca cut 12,600 positions between 2007 and 2009. It began a second programme in 2010, which the firm said would lead to the loss of 9,000 jobs by 2012. It has sites around the UK at Alderley Park, in Cheshire, Avonmouth near Bristol, Brixham in Devon, and London, and employs staff through affiliated companies in Liverpool, Cambridge and Luton. The Alderley Park site is the company's largest, employing about 3,000 people. AstraZeneca blamed increased competition for the fall in fourth quarter profits. \\"Disciplined execution of our strategy has delivered a good performance in 2011, in the face of intensified pricing pressure and generic competition,\\" said chief executive David Brennan. \\"While the further expected losses of market exclusivity make for a challenging 2012 outlook, we remain committed to a long-term, focused, R&D based strategy and today have announced further steps to drive productivity in all areas,\\" he added. The company is also facing the loss of patents on some of its products such as anti-psychotic treatment Seroquel, and has not yet released alternative money earners. \\"That's really why AstraZeneca are in the position there are now, they don't see anything coming through soon enough to have an impact,\\" said David Phillips from the Royal Society of Chemistry. \\"It's a fact that the easy targets, in the body, for the production of drugs have, essentially, all been used up,\\" he added. AstraZeneca's attempts to develop new drugs have run into trouble. In December, it scrapped an ovarian cancer drug and took a significant loss on an experimental antidepressant.

The answer is:","output":"Title: The Lurking Shadows Genre: Psychological Thriller/Mystery Plot: Act 1: Setup Dr. Jeremy Renfield, a brilliant yet reclusive scientist, is convicted of a series of grisly murders of fellow scientists. He is sent to the high-security Graymoor Asylum for the Criminally Insane, where the most dangerous minds are kept. Despite maintaining his innocence, no one believes him. At Graymoor, Renfield is assigned to a cell adjacent to Victor Rowan, an enigmatic inmate and former illusionist with a dark past. The two men form an uneasy bond over their shared conviction that they've been wrongly imprisoned. Victor, intrigued by Renfield's case, finds his illusions and expertise in escapology useful in getting information about the other inmates and staff. Renfield, on the other hand, starts putting together a plan for an impossible escape from the cell that he believes will clear his name. Act 2: Confrontation After weeks of planning, Renfield confides in Victor about his escape plan. He has discovered an underground network of tunnels beneath the asylum, constructed during the Cold War as a fallout shelter. He believes he can access these tunnels through a hidden entrance in his cell, and then navigate through them using his acute sense of direction. He believes that once he is free, he can gather evidence to exonerate himself. Victor, meanwhile, has become increasingly fascinated with the \\"Lurking Shadows\\", mysterious figures in dark shrouds he claims to have seen roaming the corridors of the asylum. He also shares his belief that these beings are behind the murders that landed them both in Graymoor. Together, Renfield and Victor put their plan into motion, managing to break through the hidden entrance in Renfield's cell and enter the subterranean tunnels. They navigate through the dark maze, encountering forgotten relics of the past along with mounting evidence of the true culprits behind the murders. However, as they delve deeper into the labyrinth, they also start to unveil the disturbing truth about the Lurking Shadows. Act 3: Resolution Renfield and Victor realize that the Lurking Shadows are not supernatural beings, but a secret organization operating within the asylum. They are an elite group of medical doctors, scientists, and businessmen, conducting unethical experiments on the inmates in order to advance their own careers and influence. It is then revealed that Renfield was framed because his research on human consciousness threatened to expose their activities. Dr. Gregory Lamarck, the head psychiatrist at the asylum and secret leader of the organization, is desperate to capture the two escapees before they make their way out of the tunnels. The thrilling climax of the story follows Renfield and Victor as they outwit and evade the Lurking Shadows and the corrupt staff of Graymoor. Ultimately, Renfield and Victor manage to contact the outside world and bring down the organization, uncovering the truth about their innocence in the process. Dr. Lamarck and the rest of the Lurking Shadows members are arrested for their horrendous crimes. The movie ends on a bittersweet note, as Renfield is exonerated and released from Graymoor, while Victor is left to complete his sentence for his real past misdeeds. The two exchange an emotional farewell, acknowledging the bond they formed through their shared struggle against an invisible enemy. As Renfield walks away from the asylum, he resolves to start a new chapter in his life, dedicated to advocating justice for the wrongfully accused and standing up against corruption within the system."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up. And in stage C he cooled the gas down.  Answer this question please: Would stage B see increased of decreased pressure than stage C? Answer:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the given information step by step and justify each step. Step 1: Understand the initial conditions and the effect of temperature on gas pressure From the background information provided, we know that: - A gas at room temperature (300 K) has a certain pressure. - When the temperature of the gas is doubled (from 300 K to 600 K), the kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, causing more forceful collisions with the container walls, and as a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Step 2: Apply this understanding to Rob's experiment Rob's experiment consists of three stages: - Stage A: The gas is at room temperature. - Stage B: The gas is heated up. - Stage C: The gas is cooled down. Step 3: Determine the pressure changes between stages Based on the initial conditions and the effect of temperature on gas pressure, we can infer the following: - Since the gas is heated up in stage B, its temperature increases, which results in an increase in gas pressure. - In stage C, the gas is cooled down, which implies a decrease in temperature and therefore a decrease in gas pressure. Step 4: Compare the pressure in stage B and stage C Considering the above pressure changes in both stages, we can now conclude that: Answer: The pressure in stage B would be higher than the pressure in stage C, as heating the gas results in increased pressure, whereas cooling the gas results in decreased pressure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The official title of the character played by James Frain on the TV series \\"The Tudors\\" was Thomas Cromwell, 1st Earl of Essex. In the critically acclaimed historical fiction television series \\"The Tudors\\" (2007-2010), English actor James Frain portrayed the character of Thomas Cromwell, a prominent statesman who served as King Henry VIII's chief minister from 1532 to 1540. Thomas Cromwell was a key figure in the English Reformation during the reign of King Henry VIII. He rose to prominence through his extraordinary ability to manipulate legal and political mechanisms, ultimately becoming one of the most influential men in the Tudor court.  Cromwell's significant achievements include the dissolution of the monasteries, the annulment of King Henry VIII's marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and the establishment of the Church of England as a separate entity from the Roman Catholic Church. Cromwell also played a vital role in arranging King Henry VIII's subsequent marriages to Anne Boleyn and Jane Seymour. His efforts to consolidate the King's power contributed to the development of a robust centralized government, thus leaving a lasting impact on England's political landscape. However, Cromwell's eventual downfall came in 1540 when he fell out of favor with King Henry VIII due to the King's unhappy marriage with Anne of Cleves, which Cromwell had arranged. He was arrested for treason and heresy, and subsequently executed on July 28, 1540. Shortly after Cromwell's execution, King Henry VIII posthumously stripped him of his titles, resulting in his official designation as the 1st and last Earl of Essex during his lifetime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Louise Boyle PUBLISHED: 13:51 EST, 4 December 2013 | UPDATED: 20:07 EST, 4 December 2013 A military couple whose engagement ring was secretly bought by actor Paul Walker came forward today after finally having their suspicions confirmed that the star was behind the act of amazing generosity. Soldier Kyle Upham and his new wife Kristen were in a Santa Barbara jewellery store in 2004 looking for a diamond ring shortly before he was sent on his second deployment back to Iraq. The couple quickly realized that the other shopper in the store was Fast And The Furious star Walker and struck up a conversation. Kyle revealed to the actor that he had just come back from a tour of duty in Iraq.","output":"The couple expressed their admiration for Walker's work in the Fast And The Furious franchise, and the conversation soon turned to their reason for visiting the jewelry store – selecting an engagement ring to treasure during Kyle's upcoming deployment. While browsing through the collection, Kristen fell in love with a beautiful diamond ring that was, unfortunately, beyond their budget. The young couple reluctantly decided to settle for a less expensive option. Little did they know that Walker had overheard their conversation and had been moved by the bravery and dedication of Kyle, who was about to risk his life again in the service of his country. However, the actor didn't want to make a scene or draw unnecessary attention to himself. Instead, he secretly approached the store's manager and insisted on buying the very ring that had caught Kristen's eye. He paid the full amount for the ring, which was reportedly around 9,000, and made the manager promise not to reveal his identity. After finalizing the purchase, the manager discreetly handed the engagement ring to Kyle and Kristen, saying that it had been paid for by an anonymous benefactor. The couple was initially overwhelmed with disbelief and gratitude, but they suspected that it might be the work of the actor they had just met. Their suspicions ran high, but without any solid proof, they kept the story to themselves, cherishing the secret and the auction of love and kindness. Almost a decade later, in December 2013, following the tragic and untimely death of Paul Walker, stories of his selfless acts and philanthropic work started surfacing in the media. It was then that the jewelry store manager finally broke his silence, revealing the story of the actor's generous act to the public. This confirmation allowed the Upham couple to finally share their story and to express their gratitude towards the man who had made their engagement truly unforgettable. In various interviews following the revelation, Kyle and Kristen spoke about how the kind gesture had impacted their lives, not only by providing them with a beautiful, everlasting symbol of their love but also inspiring them to give back to their community and help others in need. Even years after the unforgettable encounter, they felt a deep connection to the late actor and appreciated his support for military personnel through his many charitable endeavors. Paul Walker's unexpected act of generosity towards the Upham couple is a powerful testament to the actor's humble nature and genuine desire to make a difference in people's lives. The story serves as an example of compassion, empathy, and the value of extending a helping hand to those who serve our country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: If the tool is part of a larger machine, such as a table saw, disassemble your unit. Wash all of the tools or parts to be treated for rust in a mixture of grease-cutting dish detergent and warm water to remove the oils and dirt. You can use a plastic container, pot, or tub, as long as it’s large enough to submerge the tools. Choose a container that you can set aside for one to three days. White vinegar is acidic, so it will cut through the rust, making it easier to remove. While the amount of white vinegar will vary depending on how many tools you are cleaning and how big they are, track how much you add to the container so that you can properly measure your salt. You should add roughly ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of salt for each quart (1 liter) of vinegar. The salt will increase the acidity of the vinegar so that the solution dissolves the rust quicker. Spread the salt evenly over the vinegar soak. The vinegar and salt need time to break down the rust so that it can be scrubbed from the tools. The longer you allow your tools to remain in the vinegar, the easier it will be to remove the rust.  Place the container in a secure location so that children and animals won’t get into it. For example, you could lock it in your garage or shed. Pull out any tools with hinges or moving parts occasionally to move them around. This helps work out the rust from the crevices. After you remove the tools from the vinegar solution, vigorously rub your tools to buff away the rust. Continue to scrub the tools until they are completely free of rust.  If the rust is thick, use a metal bristle brush.  Use a small, firm toothbrush in circular motions for hard to reach areas. Pour out the vinegar solution and wash out the tub. Fill the tub with enough clean water to match the amount of vinegar solution that you’d used. The baking soda will neutralize the acid from the vinegar so that it doesn’t remain on your tools. Use about ¼ cup (60 milliliters) of baking soda for each quart (1 liter) of water. Mix the baking soda into the water to create a solution. Make sure that your tools are submerged in the baking soda solution. Allow the tools to soak for ten minutes before removing them. Dry them well with a clean towel. Use 0000 steel wool to buff the tools and remove any remaining spots. Your tools should be free of rust. Apply denatured alcohol to a clean cloth and rub it onto the tools. The alcohol will help you make sure that no water remains on your tools. Water could cause more rust. Polish the tool with camellia oil to prevent more rust. Summary:","output":"To clean rusty tools, take them apart and wash them in soapy water. Then, soak the tools in a mixture of white vinegar and salt for one to three days. The vinegar and salt help remove the rust. After soaking, scrub the tools with a brush to get rid of the rust. Next, soak the tools in a baking soda and water solution to neutralize the vinegar.

Well-wishers from around the world are opening their wallets to a homeless man who returned a diamond engagement ring to its rightful owner, after she accidentally dropped it in his donation cup. \\"I actually feel like I'm especially lucky to have this ring now. I loved it before. I loved it so much, but I love it so much more now. I feel like it has such great karma,\\" Sarah Darling told CNN's \\"Starting Point with Soledad O'Brien.\\" Darling, who is from Kansas City, Missouri, said she was devastated when she realized she'd lost her ring. She almost never takes it off, but it was giving her a bit of a rash so she did, zipping it in her coin purse for safe keeping. Later, she absentmindedly emptied the contents of that purse into the collection cup of Billy Ray Harris, who is homeless and often stays under a bridge in Darling's hometown. It wasn't until the next day that she realized her ring was gone. \\"It was horrible. It was such a feeling of loss,\\" Darling said. \\"It meant so much to me beyond just the financial value.\\" She went back to look for Harris, but he was gone. She returned the next day and found him. \\"I asked him ... 'I don't know if you remember me, but I think I gave you something that's very precious to me,' and he says, 'Was it a ring? Yeah, I have it, I kept it for you,'\\" Darling said. To show their appreciation, Darling and her husband set up an online fundraiser for Harris. The donations and praise have poured in. \\"In life what goes around comes around... Billy - your sweet actions, despite being in dire straits yourself, prove that there is humility in the world... you are one shining example. Lots of love from across the pond,\\" wrote Chris and Mel, from Brentwood, England, on the giveforward.com site, which is collecting money.

Its never too late. God Bless and thanks for never loosing your character in tough times,\\" he wrote. So far, in about a week, more than 3,400 donations have been made, totaling nearly 95,000. The money will be given to Harris at the end of a 90-day campaign. In an update Saturday, Darling's husband, Bill Krejci, called the response \\"unreal.\\" Krejci met with Harris to tell him about the flood of donations and to get to know him better.

This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself.

White House officials on Wednesday laid out plans to send National Guard troops to the United States’ southern border with Mexico, as part of President Donald Trump’s efforts to confront what he says is a growing problem with illegal immigrants. The decision to deploy the U.S. military to the border represents a major new aspect of Trump’s wide-ranging immigration crackdown. But major parts of the move are unclear, including how many troops will be sent, when they will deploy, or what exactly they will do. “It will take time to have the details in place, but we are beginning today and are moving quickly,” said Kirstjen Nielsen, secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. “We are anxious to have this support.” In the U.S., the active duty military is generally restricted from domestic law enforcement functions, which would include apprehending border crossers. However, U.S. presidents have deployed the National Guard to the border to act in support roles. Nielsen said the National Guard troops will help with border surveillance and other “support functions.” She declined to say how large the force would be, but she did say it would include “as many (troops) as is needed to fill the gaps today.” A senior Trump administration official declined to say whether the National Guard troops will be armed, saying those details are still being worked out. But the official said the force would be effective. “Suffice it to say, for individuals looking to pay a smuggler to get in the United States right now, that would be a very unwise investment,” the official said. Trump signed a proclamation authorizing the move Wednesday evening. But states must also approve the decision before deploying their guard members.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Donald Trump Bets Increase Just Like Brexit: Bookmakers Donald Trump’s odds to win the U.S. presidential election may not match that of bookmaker’s favorite Hillary Clinton, but a late surge of bets have been placed on the Republican candidate ahead of the final presidential debate on Wednesday. British-based bookmakers William Hill have launched their list of bets for the final debate, with Clinton placed at 1-3 to win the final televised showdown and Trump at 9-4. Overall, Clinton remains the hot favorite to win the presidency, whereas Trump now has a 20% chance of winning compared with 15% before the weekend. However, the Trump campaign doesn’t seem to have dissuaded bettors looking for a last-minute gamble, as William Hill’s latest figures show that 65% of bets on the market have been placed on Trump with the remaining 35% placed on Clinton. As to why punters might be backing Trump at this stage, Hill spokesman Graham Sharpe said, “It may be because the race has reached a level now where people thought it might be worth taking a chance, or just as with the E.U. referendum, people just don’t believe the opinion polls.” Bookmakers have responded by cutting the odds on Trump to win in a betting pattern reminiscent of the run-up to the E.U. referendum in Britain earlier this year. “It was the case that consistently throughout the E.U. referendum campaign, some two-thirds of the money gambled was for Remain, but in terms of individual bets, it was around two-thirds for Leave,” said Sharpe. “In straight bookmaking terms we have to be big Trump supporters as he currently represents a six-figure loss in our overall market.” In terms of stakes, Hall’s figures said 71% of the total money bet on the U.S. election has been placed on a Clinton win, including a record-breaking bet of over 610,000 placed on the Democratic candidate earlier this month.","output":"People are betting on who will be the next President of the United States, and lately, more people have been betting on Donald Trump to win.

She successfully \\"crossed over\\" to pop music and was one of the most influential, successful, and acclaimed vocalists of the 20th century. She died at age 30 in the crash of a private airplane. Cline was known for her rich tone, emotionally expressive and bold contralto voice, and her role as a country music pioneer. Patsy Cline was born Virginia Patterson Hensley on September 8, 1932 in Winchester, Virginia, in the city's Memorial Hospital. She was the eldest child of seamstress Hilda Virginia (nee Patterson, 1916-1998) and blacksmith Samuel Lawrence Hensley (1889-1956). She had a brother Samuel Jr. (1939-2004) and a sister Sylvia. The family moved often before finally settling in Winchester, Virginia when Patsy was 16. Sam Hensley deserted his family in 1947, but the children's home was reportedly happy nonetheless.  When Patsy was 13, she was hospitalized with a throat infection and rheumatic fever. She later said, \\"The fever affected my throat and when I recovered I had this booming voice like Kate Smith.\\"  Cline enrolled at John Handley High School but never attended classes. To help her mother support their family, she worked as a soda jerk at Gaunt's Drug Store and a waitress at the Triangle Diner. She watched performers through the window at the local radio station, and she asked WINC (AM) disc jockey Jimmy McCoy if she could sing on his show. Her performance in 1947 was well received and she was asked back. This led to appearances at local nightclubs wearing fringed Western outfits that her mother made from Patsy's designs.  Cline performed in variety and talent shows in the Winchester and Tri-State areas, and she gained a large following through the shows and local radio appearances.

Rick Scott said Wednesday he supports expanding Medicaid and funneling billions of federal dollars to Florida, a significant policy reversal that could bring health care coverage to 1 million additional Floridians.      \\"While the federal government is committed to pay 100 percent of the cost, I cannot, in good conscience, deny Floridians the needed access to health care,\\" Scott said at a hastily called news conference at the Governor's Mansion.      Scott, a former hospital executive, spoke with unusual directness about helping the \\"poorest and weakest\\" Floridians — a stunning about-face for a small-government Republican who was one of the loudest voices in an aggressive, and ultimately unsuccessful, legal strategy to kill a law he derided as \\"Obamacare.\\"      Throughout his 2010 campaign for governor, as Scott sought support from tea party members, he called the law a \\"job killer\\" that would hurt Florida.      On Wednesday, he called the proposed Medicaid expansion, at least for an initial period, \\"common sense.\\"      Tea party activists bitterly criticized Scott's declaration.      \\"This is just another example of Republicans lying to Floridians,\\" said Everett Wilkinson of Palm Beach Gardens, calling Scott \\"the Benedict Arnold to the patriot and tea party movement in Florida.\\"      Scott was careful to point out that the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature will ultimately decide whether or not his proposal is worth implementing. That is far from certain, particularly in the more partisan House.      \\"Gov. Scott has made his decision, and I certainly respect his thoughts,\\" said House Speaker Will Weatherford, R-Wesley Chapel. \\"However, the Florida Legislature will make the ultimate decision. I am personally skeptical that this inflexible law will improve the quality of health care in our state and ensure our long-term financial stability.\\"      \\"I respect the governor for staking out a clear position,\\" added Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, who chairs a Senate committee studying the health care law. He said senators would reach their own conclusions likely in early March.      Scott said he would support an initial three-year expansion of Medicaid but made clear he would not twist legislators' arms to make it happen. He reiterated that his top priorities are a 2,500 pay raise for teachers and a sales tax break for manufacturers' equipment purchases.      Under the governor's proposal, after three years the Legislature would have to vote to reauthorize the program to keep it going.      \\"It is not a white flag of surrender to government-run health care,\\" he said, as if anticipating a political backlash from his most conservative supporters.      Part of his self-described \\"new perspective\\" came from the death of his mother, Esther, last year, he said.      \\"A few months ago, my mother passed away, and I lost one of the only constants in my life,\\" Scott said. \\"Losing someone so close to you puts everything in new perspective . . . especially the big decisions.\\"      For weeks, Scott has said the debate on expanding Medicaid was directly tied to the state's application for waivers it needs to allow private companies to run the program.      His endorsement of the expansion came hours after the federal government agreed to grant Florida a conditional waiver to privatize Medicaid statewide for the state's more than 3 million current recipients, more than half of which are children or people under age 21.      Scott and GOP lawmakers have repeatedly warned that Medicaid's roughly 21 billion annual costs were consuming Florida's budget and proposed the managed care plan to save money and improve care.      The privatization expands on a five-county pilot program that has been rife with problems. Critics worry for-profit providers are scrimping on patient care and denying medical services to increase profits. Some doctors have dropped out of the pilot program, complaining of red tape and that the insurers deny the tests and medicine they prescribe. Patients have complained they struggled to get doctor's appointments.      Several health plans also dropped out of the pilot program, saying they couldn't make enough money. Patients complained they were bounced from plan to plan with lapses in care. Nearly half of the 200,000 patients enrolled in the pilot have been dropped from at least one plan, federal health officials noted at one point during negotiations.      Lawmakers say they have fixed the pilot program's shortcomings, with provisions including increased oversight and more stringent penalties, including fining providers up to 500,000 if they drop out. The measures also increase doctors' reimbursement rates and limit malpractice lawsuits for Medicaid patients in hopes of increasing doctor participation in the program.      Medicaid, a joint state-federal, government-run health care program, is voluntary for states. But every state participates, in part because of the good financial terms. The federal government covers about 55 percent of all Medicaid costs in Florida and covered about 68 percent in recent years with additional stimulus funding.      The health care law tried to entice states to expand eligibility to Medicaid by raising income eligibility limits. To do so, the federal government agreed to fund 100 percent of the cost for states to expand Medicaid for three budget years. The federal government would then cover 95 percent of the costs in 2017, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond.      Recent polls conducted by the American Cancer Society's Cancer Action Network and the Florida Hospital Association indicated that most Floridians supported the Medicaid expansion.      Scott said Wednesday that he had to look past his long-standing opposition to the health care law to reach his decision.      \\"It doesn't matter what I believe. It doesn't matter what anybody believes,\\" Scott said. \\"The Supreme Court's already made their decision. We had an election in the fall, and the public made their decision.\\"      Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.            The story      .

Rick Scott — a fierce foe of Obamacare who fought it all the way to the Supreme Court — on Wednesday announced that he would accept the Medicaid expansion under the health law.      He is the seventh GOP governor to do so — and arguably the biggest political symbol of grudging Republican acceptance that Obamacare is the law of the land.      Text Size -      +      reset      Scott had campaigned against the health legislation even before he began running for office, and Florida led the 26 states that fought it in court.      On Wednesday, that changed as he agreed to take the federally financed expansion that would cover more than 1 million people — at least for the first three years.      “While the federal government is committed to paying 100 percent of the cost of new people in Medicaid, I cannot in good conscience deny the uninsured access to care,” he explained in a speech late Wednesday.      But Scott’s Medicaid endorsement comes with a caveat no other governor has proposed. He said he’ll push legislators to support just a three-year expansion of the program — which is after the end of his first term. That forces the state to re-evaluate the expansion before getting locked in for a longer-term commitment.      “This is a commonsense solution to dealing with this for the next three years,” Scott said. “It’ll give us time to think about how we can improve the system.”      Democrats and advocates of the health law were jubilant — but annoyed that it took so long.      \\"Three years of staunch opposition and tens of thousands of taxpayer dollars later, embattled Gov. Rick Scott today flip-flopped on the central issue which has defined his political career,” said Florida Democratic Party Chairwoman Allison Tant.      “This stunning about-face is merely the latest move to repackage a governor whose approval rating with Floridians remains as toxic as his tea party agenda,” she added.      The road from Obamacare foe to Medicaid expander was a long and strange journey for Scott, a former hospital executive who spent millions four years ago in a failed attempt to derail the health care bill in Congress.      From there, he launched a gubernatorial bid in Florida, took office in 2011 and quickly aligned himself with Govs. Rick Perry of Texas and Bobby Jindal of Louisiana — outspoken conservatives who have refused to lift a finger to implement Obamacare.      A few days after Obama won reelection, Scott gave a surprising interview to The Associated Press hinting a softening in his stalwart opposition. Amid unfavorable polls at home, Scott talked about wanting to work with the feds on the health law.      Scott’s Obamacare diplomacy led to a high-profile early January meeting with HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, after which both sides expressed a commitment to keep working together. It also became apparent that Scott was trying to win concessions from HHS on how to design Florida’s Medicaid program. He won approval of two waivers — and the announcement came just hours after the second one.

Medicaid is a program that helps people who don't have a lot of money get medical care, and now, more people in Florida can get help from it. The government will pay for most of the costs, so Governor Scott believes it is a good idea. This decision is a big change for him because, in the past, he didn't agree with the plan. Some people are still not sure if it's the best idea, but Governor Scott thinks it will help many people in Florida get the health care they need."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Have you ever noticed how busy our roads are becoming? Every year more and more cars are using them. Already in such countries as America, almost every family has a car. Many accidents happen because cars are now made to travel very fast. Also, people waste time and money every day as long lines of cars move slowly into towns and cities. In most big towns it is very hard to find parking spaces. Wide, smooth  , straight   roads must be built now in place of the old and narrow roads. These roads must not pass through towns and cities. They must not be crossed by other roads. Today such roads are being built  in many countries in the world. These roads have at least two lanes , one for slow-moving traffic and the other for fast-moving traffic. These roads do not pass through town and cities; horses and bikes are not allowed on them. Accidents do not usually happen. Cars can travel hundreds of miles without having to stop. But these modem roads often cannot be built in towns and cities. Before a road in a town can be made wider, many buildings have to be pulled down. Some people feel that more car-parks should be built outside a city, then the drivers should leave their cars and catch a bus or take a taxi to their offices.

Write a summary based on this article: LAS VEGAS A mortar explosion at a Army munitions depot in Nevada killed seven Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and injured eight other service members during a live-fire training exercise, military officials said on Tuesday.      A Marine Corps official said a 60mm mortar round exploded prematurely on Monday night during training at the Hawthorne Army Depot in western Nevada. The cause was under investigation.      \\"The Marines were conducting live fire and maneuver training at the Hawthorne Army depot,\\" Brigadier General Jim Lukeman told a news conference in North Carolina. \\"A mortar round exploded in the mortar tube, causing the deaths of seven. ... We don't know yet what caused this malfunction.\\"      The blast was among the deadliest such training accidents on U.S. soil in recent years. In February 2012, seven Marines were killed when two helicopters collided during an exercise along the California-Arizona border.      The Marines killed on Monday had been undergoing training for the past month at the Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center in Bridgeport, California, and at Hawthorne.      \\"This type of training is really the type of training that we do to be able to be that force of readiness. It is what's required of our nation's military, to do the things this nation asks us to do,\\" Lukeman said, adding the training was not linked to preparations for a specific impending deployment.      The Marines ordered a blanket suspension of the use of 60mm mortars pending a review after the blast, Marine Corps spokeswoman Captain Kendra Motz said in a statement.      The blast victims were airlifted to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno with injuries that included penetration trauma, fractures and vascular injuries, said Stacy Kendall, a spokeswoman for the medical center.      Seven Marines and a Navy sailor were wounded. Of those, six were in serious or very serious condition, including the sailor, while a seventh suffered minor injuries and an eighth was treated and released, the Marines said in a statement.      NIGHTTIME ACCIDENT      The explosion occurred close to 10 p.m. PDT (0500 GMT Tuesday) during an exercise at the Hawthorne depot, about 92 miles southeast of Reno, said facility manager Russ Collier. The Marines described the mortar involved as lightweight, and said it was typically fired from a stationary position.      The identities of the dead, all from the 2nd Marine Division, and injured had not been made public, but will be released after their families are notified.      U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel was receiving updates on the accident, Pentagon spokesman George Little said, adding the incident struck a nerve with Hagel, himself an infantry veteran of the Vietnam War.      \\"This brought back memories of a training accident when he was in the U.S. Army when two soldiers were killed in a training accident, so he takes these incidents very much to heart,\\" Little said.      Hawthorne Army Depot is a 147,000-acre (60,000-acre) site used for the storage and destruction of demilitarized ammunition. Its location in Nevada's isolated high desert is also considered an ideal training environment for Special Operations forces preparing for deployments to Southwest Asia, according to a U.S. military website.      The facility was established as a naval staging area for bombs, rockets and ammunition, and was used by the Navy during most of World War Two. It was transferred to the Army in 1977.      The accident came a week after a U.S. military plane assigned to a Washington state Naval Air Station crashed during a routine training flight, killing all three crew members on board.      (Reporting by Chris Francescani in New York, David Alexander in Washington, and Cynthia Johnston in Las Vegas; Writing by Chris Francescani and Steve Gorman; Editing by Leslie Gevirtz and Peter Cooney) ||||| Updated 10:11 p.m. ET      HAWTHORNE, Nev. A mortar shell explosion killed seven Marines and injured several more during mountain warfare training in Nevada's high desert, prompting the Pentagon to immediately halt the use of the weapons until an investigation can determine their safety, officials said Tuesday.      The explosion occurred Monday night at the Hawthorne Army Depot, a sprawling facility used by troops heading overseas, during an exercise involving the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Lejeune, N.C. Several Marines from the unit were injured in the blast, authorities said.      The Marines were practicing firing mortars, reports CBS affiliate KTVN-TV in Reno, when one of the rounds exploded while still inside the tube.      Brig. Gen. Jim Lukeman said investigators were trying to determine the cause of the malfunction.      The Pentagon expanded a temporary ban to prohibit the military from firing any 60 mm mortar rounds until the results of the investigation. The Marine Corps said Tuesday a \\"blanket suspension\\" of 60 mm mortars and associated firing tubes is in effect.      The Pentagon earlier had suspended use of all high-explosive and illumination mortar rounds that were in the same manufacturing lots as ones fired in Nevada.      It was not immediately clear whether more than a single round exploded, a Marine Corps official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because the official wasn't authorized to speak about an ongoing investigation.      The Marine Corps said early Tuesday that seven Marines were killed. Eight men under the age of 30 were taken to Renown Regional Medical Center in Reno. One of them died, four were in serious condition, two were in fair condition and another was discharged, said spokesman Mark Earnest.      The identities of those killed won't be released until 24 hours after their families are notified.      \\"We send our prayers and condolences to the families of Marines involved in this tragic incident,\\" said the force's commander, Maj. Gen. Raymond C. Fox. \\"We mourn their loss, and it is with heavy hearts we remember their courage and sacrifice.\\"      The rescue was complicated by the remoteness of the site, which is favored because the harsh geography simulates conditions in Afghanistan.      The 60 mm mortar is a weapon that traditionally requires three to four Marines to operate, but it's common during training for others to observe nearby. The firing tube is supported in a tripod-like design and fires roughly a 3-pound shell, some 14 inches in length and a bit larger than 2 inches in diameter.      The mortar has changed little since World War II and remains one of the simplest weapons to operate, which is why it is found at the lowest level of infantry units, said Joseph Trevithick, a mortar expert with Global Security.org.      \\"Basically, it's still a pipe and it's got a firing pin at the bottom,\\" Trevithick said. Still, a number of things could go wrong, such as a fuse malfunction, a problem with the barrel's assembly, or a round prematurely detonating inside the tube, he said.      The Marine Corps official said an explosion at the point of firing in a training exercise could kill or maim anyone in or near the protective mortar pit and could concussively detonate any mortars stored nearby in a phenomenon known as \\"sympathetic detonation.\\"      The official said a worldwide moratorium after such an accident is not unusual and would persist until the investigation determines that the weapon did not malfunction in ways that would hurt other Marines or that mortar shells manufactured at the same time as the one involved in the accident were safe.      The official said it would be normal to warn other U.S. military branches that use 60 mm mortars, such as the Army, about the Marines warning. The moratorium could last for weeks or months.      The investigation will focus on whether the Marines followed procedures to properly fire the weapon, or whether there was a malfunction in the firing device or in the explosive mortar shell itself, the official said.      The Hawthorne Army Depot stores and disposes of ammunition. The facility is made up of hundreds of buildings spread over more than 230 square miles, and bunkers dot the sagebrush-covered hills visible from the highway.      no previous page      next ||||| Summary:","output":"A mortar explosion at the Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada during a live-fire training exercise killed seven Marines from Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, and injured eight other service members.

Putting up wallpaper is not just about aesthetic appeal, it also involves a good amount of skill, patience, and an eye for detail. He started by choosing a wallpaper that suits the room in terms of color, pattern, and texture. Perhaps he opted for a striking, colorful print to add a touch of personality or maybe a neutral tone for a calming ambiance. Armed with his measuring tape, adhesive, and utility knife, among other tools, he began the process of cutting the wallpaper into strips that fit the height of the wall. He made sure to add a few extra inches to account for any incidental shortages or unexpected discrepancies in wall dimensions. His focus was on getting the measurements just right, to ensure that each strip of wallpaper would align perfectly with the wall corners, window frames, and ceiling line. After completing the measurements, the next step was to apply adhesive on the back of the wallpaper. He smeared it evenly across the surface, making sure to cover every inch to prevent any empty spaces that could lead to bubbles or loosening over time. He also paid close attention to the adhesive's drying time to guarantee its correct and effective adhesion. Slowly and carefully, he started to affix the wallpaper on the wall, beginning from the top and smoothing down towards the floor. He used a smoothing brush to eliminate any bubbles and wrinkles that could ruin the final look. Having a keen eye, he ensured the patterned wallpaper matched at the seams, creating a seamless look. In the process of wallpapering, he encountered some obstacles like outlets and light switches. However, with a quick precision cut with his utility knife, he managed to neatly trim around these areas, maintaining the wallpaper’s continuity and the room's aesthetics. After installing each strip, he used a seam roller to firmly secure the edges of the wallpaper strips together. This smoothed out the seams and ensured a tight bond, keeping the wallpaper attractive and durable for years. He continued this process, repeating the measuring, cutting, pasting, and applying until every wall in the room was covered. Then, he stepped back to review his work. He scrutinized every inch of the wallpapered walls, looking for any imperfections or inconsistencies. If he noticed any areas that needed attention - a small bubble or a loose edge - he swiftly attended to it, keen to ensure the finished job was as perfect as possible. In conclusion, while wallpapering a wall may seem like a simple task, this man puts a significant amount of attention, care, and precision into every step of the process to ensure the best possible end result. His work reflects not only his skills but also his standards and dedication to perfection in his work."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What are the different types of computer viruses?","output":"Yes, these two questions essentially have the same meaning as both are inquiring about the various types of computer viruses. While the phrasing is slightly different, the goal of each question is to obtain information about the different categories or kinds of computer viruses that currently exist or have existed in the past. Computer viruses are malicious programs capable of self-replication and spreading to other computers or networks, causing harm to the infected systems, software, and user data. The purpose of most computer viruses is to disrupt normal computer operations or to extract sensitive information. There are many types of computer viruses, but some of the most common ones include: 1. Resident viruses: These viruses embed themselves in a computer's memory and operate silently while the computer is running. Resident viruses can interfere with system processes, corrupting files or system functions. 2. Non-resident viruses: Unlike resident viruses, non-resident viruses are stored in files on the infected computer's hard drive. They typically spread by attaching themselves to other files or programs when executed. 3. Boot sector viruses: These viruses specifically target the boot sector of a computer's hard drive, which is responsible for starting the operating system. By infecting this part of a computer, a boot sector virus can cause the system to become inoperable. 4. Macro viruses: These viruses are written in macro languages, such as Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), and are primarily found in documents or files created by software like Microsoft Office. Macro viruses have the ability to spread easily across different applications and platforms. 5. File infector viruses: These viruses attach themselves to executable files (.exe or .com) and infect the system when the user launches the infected file. They can overwrite or modify the original file, causing system malfunctions or data corruption. 6. Polymorphic viruses: Polymorphic viruses change their code each time they replicate, making it difficult for antivirus software to detect them. By using encryption and constantly altering their code, these viruses can often evade detection and removal. 7. Multipartite viruses: These viruses can infect a system in multiple ways, such as targeting both the boot sector and executable files. Multipartite viruses are versatile and can spread quickly through a computer network. 8. Worms: Worms are a type of virus that can self-replicate without needing to attach themselves to other files. They can quickly exhaust system resources, such as memory and processing power, causing the computer to slow down or crash. 9. Trojans: Trojans are malicious programs that disguise themselves as legitimate software. While they don't self-replicate, they can cause damage to the infected system, such as creating backdoors for hackers to access or take control of the computer. 10. Ransomware: This type of malware encrypts user's files or locks access to the computer, demanding a ransom payment from the victim to restore their data. Ransomware has become increasingly common in recent years, with high-profile attacks on businesses and government agencies. Although the two questions are phrased differently, both seek to understand the various types of computer viruses that can cause harm to computer systems, software, and sensitive information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Local students between 6 and 14 years old, along with children from military families, were invited to celebrate Halloween on the North Lawn. The president and first lady, along with Mrs.Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, spent about 30 minutes passing out goodie bags.Obama wished each child a happy Halloween as he distributed the treats, pausing occasionally for hugs or to comment on costumes. Later, the military families continued the celebration inside the White House. The first couple joked to assembled reporters about children walking the long driveway in order to work off   the snacks.\\"This is the Let's Move method of trick-or-treating  ,\\" Obama said, referring to Mrs.Obama's campaign to combat childhood obesity  . The goodie bags contained a box of White House M&Ms, a cookie made by pastry chef   Bill Yosses, and dried fruit. As they made their way across the lawn, the children meet a vast range of costumed characters ranging from a spooky Frankenstein (,<<>> ) to the Scarecrow from \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Music from a jazz band dressed in pirate gear rang out across the White House grounds. Multicolored pumpkins and gourds lined the driveway -- individually, in gravity-defying stacks and as part of a large mound over 5 feet tall.Pumpkin-headed scarecrows   made of cornstalks loomed over the path with menacingly raised arms.Under the White House portico, a mobile resembling bats flying through clouds fluttered around a lantern. Some of the local trick-or-treaters were students at Bancroft Elementary, which helps tend the first lady's White House garden, and Tubman Elementary, which has a relationship with the White House chefs. After trick-or-treating ended, the Obamas stood near the front door, welcoming the military families inside, helping children climb the short flight of steps and thanking parents for their service.

Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers  and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".  In the song Mudride, the band's guitars were said to have \\"growled malevolently\\" through its \\"Cro-magnon slog\\".  Guess a valid title for it!

The Domesday Survey of 1086 does not directly mention Ashton, perhaps because only a partial survey of the area had been taken. However, it is thought that St Michael's Church, mentioned in the Domesday entry for the ancient parish of Manchester, was in Ashton (also spelt Asheton, Asshton and Assheton). The town itself was first mentioned in the 12th century when the manor was part of the barony of Manchester. By the late 12th century, a family who adopted the name Assheton held the manor on behalf of the Gresleys, barons of Manchester. Ashton Old Hall was a manor house, the administrative centre of the manor, and the seat of the de Ashton or de Assheton family. With three wings, the hall was \\"one of the finest great houses in the North West\\" of the 14th century. It has been recognised as important for being one of the few great houses in south-east Lancashire and possibly one of the few halls influenced by French design in the country. The town was granted a Royal Charter in 1414, which allowed it to hold a fair twice a year, and a market on every Monday, making the settlement a market town.According to popular tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was lord of the manor in the mid-14th century and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each Easter Monday and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first recorded occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.The manor remained in the possession of the Assheton family until 1514 when its male line terminated. The lordship of the manor passed to Sir George Booth, great-great grandson of Sir Thomas Ashton, devolving through the Booth family until the Earls of Stamford inherited it through marriage in 1758. The Booth-Greys then held the manor until the 19th century, whose patronage, despite being...

Which species' traits would be less common, species A or species B?  David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number.  Hint: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. A:","output":"Based on the theory of evolution by natural selection, species A's traits would be more common in the population because they have helpful traits for survival and reproduction. Species B's traits would be less common due to their harmful traits, leading them to be less \\"fit\\" for survival in the environment and less likely to pass on those traits to subsequent generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Second question: What are the most common clichés in fiction writing? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: [-] no; [-] yes;","output":"First question: What are narrative conventions and how they used to write a story? Step 1: Understanding the term 'narrative conventions' Narrative conventions are elements and techniques employed by authors to craft a compelling story. These conventions include, but are not limited to, plot, setting, point of view, character development, and dialogue. Step 2: Explaining how narrative conventions are used in writing a story Narrative conventions are used by authors to create a well-structured and engaging story. They function together to develop the plot, explore themes, and create believable, relatable characters. These elements provide a foundation on which the writer can construct a unique and creative narrative while still adhering to the rules, traditions, or practices of storytelling. Second question: What are the most common clichés in fiction writing? Step 1: Defining 'clichés' in the context of fiction writing Clichés are overused phrases, ideas, or elements in writing that have lost their originality and power to surprise or engage the reader due to repetition and overuse. Step 2: Listing the most common clichés in fiction writing 1. The chosen one: A character destined to save the world or solve a great problem. 2. Love triangle: A romantic relationship where three people are involved, often causing conflict and drama. 3. Amnesia: A character loses their memory and must rediscover their past or identity. 4. The evil villain with no redeeming qualities: A one-dimensional antagonist whose sole purpose is to oppose the protagonist. 5. Damsel in distress: A helpless female character who requires rescuing by a male protagonist. 6.

I was a published and paid writer. I showed it to my teacher and fellow students. They laughed. \\"Just plain dumb luck,\\" the teacher said. I tasted success. I'd sold the first thing I'd ever written. That was more than any of them had done and if it was just dumb luck, that was fine with me. During the next two years I sold dozens of poems, letters, jokes and recipes. By the time I graduated from high school, with a C minus average, I had scrapbooks filled with my published work. I never mentioned my writing to my teachers, friends or my family again.

Over the weekend, brokerages and fund managers vowed to buy stocks, helped by a state-owned margin finance firm, which in turn would be helped with liquidity from the central bank. Despite this, the Shanghai Composite was down 1.5% at 3,732.13 on Tuesday. That comes despite signs of heavy money flows into Shanghai's blue chip stocks.

About 57 mutual fund houses were also reported to have started buying equities using 2.16bn yuan of their own money. However, the significant downtrend in the market is raising concerns about whether policymakers have the ability to stabilise the market.

A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners.

The Jays defeated the highly competitive Braves in six games, securing their first championship. Toronto clinched the title on October 24, 1992, with a final game score of 4-3. This victory marked the first time that a team outside the United States had won the World Series. The Blue Jays' exploits in the 1992 season also made them the first team in Major League Baseball (MLB) expansion history to win the title within 20 years. The Blue Jays continued their winning streak by conquering the 1993 World Series against the Philadelphia Phillies. Under manager Cito Gaston, they bested the Phillies in a six-game series. The championship-clinching match took place on October 23, 1993, with a dramatic walk-off home run by Blue Jays designated hitter Joe Carter in the bottom of the ninth inning. This memorable moment led to a final game score of 8-6, earning them back-to-back titles. These triumphant years for the Toronto Blue Jays placed them among the list of dominating teams in the early 1990s.

Bobby Darin (born Walden Robert Cassotto; May 14, 1936 - December 20, 1973) was an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and actor in film and television. He performed jazz, pop, rock and roll, folk, swing, and country music. He started his career as a songwriter for Connie Francis. Born Walden Robert Cassotto in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York City, Bobby Darin was reared by his maternal grandmother, whom he believed was his mother. Darin's birth mother, Vanina Juliette \\"Nina\\" Cassotto (born November 30, 1917), became pregnant with him in the summer of 1935 when she was 17. Presumably because of the scandalous nature of out-of-wedlock pregnancies in that era, Nina and her mother hatched a plan to pass her baby off as Nina's younger brother. Years later, when Nina finally told Darin the truth about his upbringing, she refused to reveal the identity of his biological father, and kept the secret to her death in 1983. Darin's maternal grandfather, Saverio Antonio \\"Big Sam Curly\\" Cassotto (born January 26, 1882), was of Italian descent and a would-be mobster who died in prison from pneumonia a year before Darin's birth. His maternal grandmother, Vivian Fern Walden (also born in 1882), who called herself Polly, was of English ancestry and a vaudeville singer. From his birth, Darin always believed Nina to be his older sister and Polly his mother. But in 1968, when he was 32, Nina told Darin the truth, reportedly devastating him.  By the time he was a teenager, Darin could play several instruments, including piano, drums, and guitar. He later added harmonica and xylophone.  Darin moved to the Bronx early in his life (with a rented summer home in Staten Island) and graduated from the prestigious Bronx High School of Science. In later years he attributed his arrogance to his experiences there, where he was surrounded by brighter students who teased him. He then enrolled at Hunter College and soon gravitated to the drama department. After only two semesters, he dropped out to pursue an acting career.

Summarize this article: The mother of Modern Family starfiled an incident report with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department after she allegedly caught her 14-year-old daughter engaged in a sexual act with an 18-year-old man.      The police filing — obtained exclusively by Celebuzz — details “suspicious circumstances, possible unlawful sex with minor,” according to the officer who spoke to Chris Workman, Winter’s mother, on October 6.      Celebuzz has chosen not to name Winter’s boyfriend, who was identified by the young star’s mother and told to law enforcement.      “On 09-24-12, at approximately 2200-hours, she walked in the guest bedroom of her home and found her daughter, Ariel Winter Workman, in bed with boyfriend, [Name Redacted],” the three-page report claims.      Workman told the Sheriff explicit details about what she saw when she walked into the room at her Montrose, Calif. home. Celebuzz has chosen not to report the full recollections of Workman because of the graphic account.      “The informant (Workman) said the guest bedroom door was left wide open when she walked in,” Workman told police.      “According to the informant, Ariel and [Name Redacted] have been boyfriend/girlfriend for approximately 5 months. She has attempted to break them up because of their age difference.”      Winter nor the boyfriend have not responded to a request for comment from Celebuzz.      In an earlier statement on Thursday, Workman claimed her teenage daughter’s relationship with the man, four years her senior, was the real reason behind the young actress’ decision to ask a judge to temporarily place her in her sister’s care.      According to court papers, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge put Winter, who plays teenager Alex Dunphy on the Emmy-winning TV comedy, under the temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray.      Workman told Celebuzz she “caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand.”      “I put a stop to it immediately,” Workman said.      “I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment.      “I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die.”      In the incident report, the officer noted that he had been unable to speak with Winter and her guardian, Gray.      “I was not able to contact Ariel because she is currently living with her older sister, Shanelle Gray, somewhere in Studio City,” the Sheriff wrote.      “The informant does not have much of a relationship with her daughter Shanelle and does not have her address or telephone number. In addition, Ariel recently changed her cellular number. She did not give her number to the informant.”      The officer said he also tried to call the boyfriend and his mother but was unable to make contact with either of them.      “The informant mentioned that on 10-03-12, Ariel contacted The Department of Child and Family Services (DCFS). Ariel alleged that her mother (Informant) abused her. The informat has not yet been contacted by DCFS.      The officer added: “I asked the informant why she did not report the incident when it occurred. She said, at the time she was uncertain as to what she wanted to do. She wanted to seek advice from her friends and her attorney. She was advised by her attorney to notify law enforcement.”      – Additional Reporting by Andrea Simpson      Winter’s family is divided after the claims hit headlines on Thursday — as this Celebuzz video explains, below.

Chris Workman, Winter’s mother, told Celebuzz in an exclusive statement that she “caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand.”      “I put a stop to it immediately,” Workman added, revealing she pressed charges against the unknown male teenager. It is not known what charges were filed, or with what law enforcement agency.      “I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment,” Workman told Celebuzz. The mother did not elaborate further about what the alleged “behavior” was between the pair.      “I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die,” Workman said.      According to court papers filed on October 3, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge put Winter, who plays teenager Alex Dunphy on the Emmy-winning TV comedy, under the temporary guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray.      Workman was alleged to have slapped and emotionally abused her daughter, according to the website TMZ.      Winter was removed from her mother’s home and her sister will retain guardianship until a November 20 court hearing.      In her emotional statement, Workman said Winter’s sister came “out of the woodwork” once it was announced the cast were to receive substantial salary increases. The Modern Family cast filed a lawsuit in a bit to better their deals to appear on ABC’s top-rated comedy.      Said Workman: “She has only seen her little sister maybe ten times in the last fourteen years.      “They have no relationship and her motives are not out of love, but out of spite. She had problems as a child and she and I have maybe seen each other a dozen times in the last twenty years.      “I made a conscious decision years ago to distance her from the family because of the lies she told on me so many years ago.      “I never wanted her unstableness to effect Ariel or anyone else in the family.”      The distraught mother of the promising starlet added: “My biggest nightmare is now being played out in the public arena for people to make judgments on me and my daughter and our family. I only hope that as quickly as this blew up, that it will go away just as fast and Ariel will come home and we can move forward with love as a family.”      Workman’s full statement to Celebuzz reads as follows:      “I love my daughter very much. I would never abuse her in anyway and I have always tried my best to always protect her and do what is right for her. My daughter is in a business that requires you to grow up fast. It’s hard enough being a teenage girl, but it’s even harder when you are in the public eye. However, because you are in the public eye, it doesn’t mean you are no longer in need of good parenting. My fourteen year old daughter has been dating a eighteen and half year old man and when I caught them engaging in behavior that I feel my daughter is too young mentally and physically to understand and fully grasp I put a stop to it immediately. Being a teenager “in love” I thought she would cry and sulk and eventually her broken heart would heal. I would have never of dreamed, that she would take it to this level. Yes, I filed charges against him because legally he is an adult and if he wants to engage in adult behavior with a minor than he should also be ready to suffer adult consequences for his actions and poor judgment. I will not apologize for protecting my daughter, as she means the world to me and I will always be there for her and I will always protect her to the best of my ability until the day I die.” “As for my estranged daughter, who has come out of the woodwork once it was announced that the kids on the show got a big raise recently, I will only say this, she has only seen her little sister maybe ten times in the last fourteen years, they have no relationship and her motives are not out of love, but out of spite. She had problems as a child and she and I have maybe seen each other a dozen times in the last twenty years. I made a conscious decision years ago to distance her from the family because of the lies she told on me so many years ago. I never wanted her unstableness to effect Ariel or anyone else in the family.

TMZ has learned -- because they think the mother is making up stories of an illicit sexual relationship to save face after she was stripped of custody.TMZ broke the story ... a judge determined allegations thatwas physically and emotionally abusing Ariel were so serious, he awarded temporary custody to Ariel's older sister -- and ordered Chrystal to stay 100 yards away from her young daughter.Law enforcement sources tell us they're not buying Chrystal's claim Ariel was involved in a sexual relationship with an 18-year-old boy, largely because the mom never went to cops until AFTER she lost custody on October 3 -- even though she claims the affair's been going on since the beginning of summer.Court sources tell us the first time Chrystal mentioned ANYTHING about an illicit relationship was during the guardianship hearing last month ... when she began ranting in court and called the guardianship lawyer a \\"moron.\\"We're told she testified about a specific incident on Sept. 24, saying ... \\"I caught my daughter with her boyfriend in bed -- she's 14. He's 18 and I threw him out and I broke them up.\\"Due, in no small part, to the timing of Chrystal's testimony ... one law enforcement source tells us they don't believe there was ever a sexual relationship between Ariel and the boy. ||||| There's nothing funny about Modern Family funnygal Ariel Winter's family travails.      The 14-year-old has been removed from her mother's care following allegations in court documents of physical and emotional abuse, and now the star's adult sister is seeking permanent guardianship over her sibling.      Police have confirmed to E! News that an active investigation is under way but declined to provide additional details. E! News has also learned that the detective handling the case is with the special victims bureau.      Herewith, a guide to the key players in Ariel's family drama. ||||| It’s the real-life Modern Family feud that has turned ugly.      In yet another twist in the allegations of parental abuse involving young star Ariel Winter, the family’s pediatrician has signed a letter defending the woman accused of delivering years of emotional and physical abuse, Chris Workman      “There has never been any evidence of an abusive relationship in regards to Ariel,” John Rodarte, M.D. wrote a letter dated Oct. 18, 2012, two weeks after the 14-year-old asked a Los Angeles Superior Court judge to place her under the guardianship of her older sister, Shanelle Gray.      The doctor added, “Ariel ‘Winter’ Workman has been a patient of ours since 1998. Her mother has always been conscientious in bringing Ariel to her appointments.”      As Celebuzz exclusively reported, Workman has claimed the real reason her daughter went to court was because she attempted to break-up her daughter and her older boyfriend.      Indeed, Winter’s mother filed an incident report with the Los Angeles Sheriff’s Department allegedly caught her 14-year-old daughter engaged in a sexual act with an 18-year-old man, who Celebuzz has decided not to name.      A missive from a second pediatrician was also provided to police and the court to defend Workman against claims she abused Shanelle Gray, too.      Virginia-based pediatrician Carl Hanfling, M.D. wrote, in a a letter dated May 27, 1994, that he “never observed… negligence or child abuse.”      “Shanelle Workman has been a patient of mine since birth,” Hanfling said.      “I or my staff have never observed any suggestion of negligence or child abuse. On the contrary, both parents have always demonstrated extraordinary concern and have been loving, caring mother and father.”      According to court papers filed Oct. 3, Winter claimed her mother subjected her to “ongoing physical abuse (slapping, hitting, pushing) and emotional abuse (vile name-calling, personal insults about minor and minor’s weight, attempts to ‘sexualize’ minor, deprivation of food, etc.) for an extended period of time”.      Faced with the allegations, a judge not only granted temporary custody but also ordered Workman not to come within 100 yards of her daughter.      A representative for Winter did not want to comment about the case or the police filing when approached late on Thursday.      In the incident report we obtained, police noted “suspicious circumstances, possible unlawful sex with minor,” following the interview with Winter’s mother on October 6 — three days after the minor went to court.      “On 09-24-12, at approximately 2200-hours, she walked in the guest bedroom of her home and found her daughter, Ariel Winter Workman, in bed with boyfriend, [Name Redacted],” the three-page report claims.      Workman told the Sheriff explicit details about what she saw when she walked into the room at her Montrose, Calif. home. Celebuzz has chosen not to report the full recollections of Workman because of the graphic account.      “The informant (Workman) said the guest bedroom door was left wide open when she walked in,” Workman told police.      “According to the informant, Ariel and [Name Redacted] have been boyfriend/girlfriend for approximately 5 months. She has attempted to break them up because of their age difference.”      The next court hearing involving Winter and her mother is scheduled to be heart on Nov. 20.      – Additional Reporting by Dylan Howard      Celebuzz Editor in Chief Dylan Howard joins ‘The Daily Buzz’ host Hyla to break down the latest developments in the Ariel Winter case, below.

While at work his work computer does not need modern  capabilities. So, he still uses Windows 2000 at his office computer. At home it's a complete different ball game. He plays so much computer games at home that he needs a better computer. In his home computer he  installed the latest version of Windows. Now, there is no lag in his system.  and a hint : In Windows 2000 and later the threads in the System Idle Process are also used to implement CPU power saving. The exact power saving scheme depends on the operating system version and on the hardware and firmware capabilities of the system in question. For instance, on x86 processors under Windows 2000, the idle thread will run a loop of halt instructions, which causes the CPU to turn off many internal components until an interrupt request arrives. Later versions of Windows implement more complex CPU power saving methods. On these systems the idle thread will call routines in the Hardware Abstraction Layer to reduce CPU clock speed or to implement other power-saving mechanisms.  Please answer this question : In which computer the idle thread will not run a   loop of halt instructions, office computer or home   computer?

The Knesset is responsible for making and passing laws, as well as electing the President and approving the government led by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister is the head of government in Israel and holds significant executive powers.

Assuming that the atmospheric pressure is standard, the temperature will rise steadily until it reaches 100°C. At this point, the added energy from the heat will cause the liquid to begin to vaporize. As with the previous state change, the temperature will remain at 100°C while the water molecules are going from the liquid to the gas or vapor state. Once all the liquid has completely boiled away, continued heating of the steam (remember the container is closed) will increase its temperature above 100°C.

I got to know people by the flowers they planted that I had to remember not to cut down, by the things they lost in the grass or struck in the ground on purpose. I reached the point with most of them when I knew in advance what complaint was about to be spoken, which request was most important. And I learned something about the measure of my neighbors by their preferred method of payment: by the job, by the month--or not at all. Mr. Ballou fell into the last category, and he always had a reason why. On one day, he had no change for a fifty, on another he was flat out of checks, on another, he was simply out when I knocked on his door. Still, except for the money apart, he was a nice enough guy, always waving or tipping his hat when he'd seen me from a distance. I figured him for a thin retirement check, maybe a work-related injury that kept him from doing his own yard work. Sure, I kept track of the total, but I didn't worry about the amount too much. Grass was grass, and the little that Mr. Ballou's property comprised didn't take long to trim  . Then, one late afternoon in mid-July, the hottest time of the year, I was walking by his house and he opened the door, mentioned me to come inside.

Today, we're going to learn about a fun event that happened in Sheffield. Do you know who Jarvis Cocker is? He's a very famous man who sings songs and talks on the radio too! He is the frontman of a band called Pulp, which means he's the main person who sings in the band. They made lots of fun and popular songs that many people enjoy listening to. And guess what? He recently did something exciting with trams in Sheffield! Trams are like long buses with lots of wheels that run on tracks, like a train. They go around the city taking people to different places, like school or the shops. In Sheffield, where Jarvis Cocker is from, they have special announcements that play on the tram to let people know where they are going. These announcements are usually made by a recorded voice, so everyone can hear clearly and know when to get off the tram. Now, Jarvis Cocker has used his cool voice to re-record those announcements for the Sheffield trams! That means that instead of hearing the old voice telling them where they are going, people on the trams will hear Jarvis Cocker's voice instead. Doesn't that sound fun? Imagine hearing your favourite singer's voice when you're on the tram going to a fun place in the city! Why do you think Jarvis Cocker did this? It's because he loves his city Sheffield and wanted to make people smile as they travel on the trams. It's a special way of showing that he cares about the people who live there, and he wants to make sure they have a good day, just like you do when you help your friends or family! So next time you're on a tram or a bus, listen carefully to the announcements and remember how Jarvis Cocker used his talent to make people happy on their daily journeys! And who knows, maybe one day you can do something just as amazing and bring smiles to the faces of people in your city too!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. You are given a new situation: Two farms were growing food for several nearby cities. Vole farm grew organic produce and produced organic milk, while Anthill farm did not possess the USDA organic certification.  and a hint : As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary.  Please answer this question : Which farm had more antibiotic resistant pathogens? A:","output":"Vole Farm (organic) or B: Anthill Farm (non-organic) Based on the given information, it is likely that: B: Anthill Farm (non-organic) had more antibiotic-resistant pathogens. The reasoning behind this is that organic farming practices, as followed by Vole Farm, do not permit the use of antibiotics as a preventative measure. This results in fewer antibiotic-resistant pathogens on organic farms. On the other hand, Anthill Farm, which practices non-organic farming, may use antibiotics more frequently, leading to an increased likelihood of antibiotic-resistant pathogens."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Crew members moved Suchilin to the plane's bathroom and tried to mask the smell with air freshener, but the pilots eventually decided it would be best to land.

The difference in temperature between the chilly open air and the warm tunnel under the English Channel caused the trains to break down.      Eurostar will be running a reduced service Saturday daytime due to the snowy conditions, the spokesman said, urging passengers to reconsider travelling if their journey was not urgent.      \\"Because of the weather, the snow and the extreme cold, we have severe problems with our trains,\\" the Eurostar spokesman told AFP.      \\"At the moment we have three trains stuck in the tunnel and we are trying to get them out with a rescue locomotive.\\"      The three trains, all from Paris to London, were in the same tunnel. Two further trains from Brussels and Paris heading for the tunnel had turned back, the spokesman said.      The high-speed passenger trains stuck in the tunnel were fairly full, he added.      \\"It's really technical problems due to the bad weather and the snow.

Three primary eruption periods in the history of the massif have been identified: ancestral, older and present. During the ancestral period between one million to two million years ago, a complex of large stratovolcanoes was created. Between 1.0 million and 0.8 million years ago, they partially collapsed, forming large (5–10 km wide) calderas. During the older period, which lasted from 0.8 million to 0.2 million years ago, a new complex of large stratovolcanoes developed (including Older Ruiz, Tolima, Quindio, and Santa Isabel). Once again explosive summit calderas formed from 0.2 million to 0.15 million years ago.The present period began about 150,000 years ago and involved the development of the present volcanic edifice through the emplacement of lava domes made of andesite and dacite (igneous rocks) inside older calderas. During the past 11,000 years, Nevado del Ruiz passed through at least 12 eruption stages, which included multiple slope failures (rock avalanches), pyroclastic flows and lahars leading to partial destruction of the summit domes. During the past several thousand years, eruptions of the volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif have mostly been small, and the pyroclastic flow deposits have been much less voluminous than during the Pleistocene. Since the volcano's earlier eruptions are not recorded, volcanologists have used tephrochronology to date them.During recorded history, eruptions have consisted primarily of a central vent eruption (in the caldera) followed by an explosive eruption, then lahars. Ruiz's earliest identified Holocene eruption was about 6660 BC, and further eruptions occurred in 1245 BC ± 150 years (dated through radiocarbon dating), about 850 BC, 200 BC ± 100 years, 350 AD ± 300 years, 675 AD ± 50 years, in 1350, 1541 (perhaps), 1570, 1595, 1623, 1805, 1826, 1828 (perhaps),[b] 1829, 1831, 1833 (perhaps),[b] 1845, 1916, December 1984 – March 1985, September...

Little did they know that they were about to witness an extraordinary act of camaraderie and sportsmanship, as runner Matthew Rees stopped just short of the finish line to help a fellow competitor in need. As the 26.2-mile race drew to a close, Rees, a member of the Swansea Harriers running club, spotted his fellow runner struggling to continue just a few hundred meters from the finish line. Realizing that the fellow marathoner was in distress, Rees made the selfless decision to sacrifice his own race time in order to help the ailing runner. Ignoring the physical and mental exhaustion from running for hours, Rees slowed down and went over to the struggling competitor, whose legs were buckling beneath him. With arm over his shoulder, Rees valiantly supported the exhausted runner, helping him to continue forward toward the finish line. In an exceptional display of team spirit and empathy, Rees guided and encouraged his impromptu teammate every step of the way. As they inched closer to the finish line, the crowd erupted into cheers and applause, touched by the genuine compassion and selflessness that they were witnessing. Rees was not focused on his personal achievement; instead, he prioritized the well-being and success of a fellow athlete, who happened to be a complete stranger. The inspiring scene was captured on camera and quickly went viral on social media. Countless people across the globe were moved by Rees’ kindness and sportsmanship, proving that in today's fast-paced and competitive world, emphatic acts like these are valued and cherished. In a post-race interview, Rees humbly downplayed his actions, saying that he simply wanted to ensure that his fellow competitor was able to finish the race safely. His magnanimity and humility further endeared him to the hearts of people worldwide. The storyline of the 2017 London Marathon will forever be remembered for the remarkable sportsmanship and humanity displayed by Matthew Rees. His act of kindness transcended the boundaries of competition and exemplified the true spirit of marathon running – one of solidarity, perseverance, and unity. Rees’ decision to help a struggling competitor poignantly echoes the words of legendary British marathoner Richard Nerurkar: “A marathon is a shared experience, and the camaraderie that develops between runners who face the same challenge is incredibly strong.” Indeed, Rees became a shining example of the sportsmanship, selflessness, and compassion that prevail across the running community. As the world continues to grapple with division and strife in various arenas, the iconic image of Rees helping a fellow runner across the finish line serves as a powerful reminder of the unity and empathy that can exist within us all if we choose to embrace it. As we strive to create a kinder, more compassionate world, we can look to the example set by Matthew Rees, who in his moment of choice on a sunny Sunday in London, opted to uplift and support a fellow human in need."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"Removing excess fat from baked potato wedges primarily deals with prevention. It's easier to reduce the amount of fat used in preparing potato wedges than it is to try and remove the fat after they've been cooked. Here are some steps you can follow to accomplish this. 1. Choose the Right Potato: The type of potato you choose can have a significant impact on the fat content of your wedges. Some potatoes, like russets, are naturally low in fat and high in fiber. They also have a nice, fluffy texture when baked. 2. Preparing the Potatoes: Soaking the potato wedges in cold water for an hour or so before baking can help reduce the amount of oil needed to bake them. The soaking process removes excess starch which results in a crispier wedge without the need for extra oil. 3. Reducing the Oil: One of the key reasons why potato wedges can be high in fat is because of the amount of oil used to bake them with. Instead of drowning your wedges in oil, try using an oil spray to lightly coat them, or lightly brush them with oil. Make sure every edge is marginally coated, this will provide you with crispy wedges without unnecessary oil. 4. Use Alternative Cooking Methods: Instead of baking, you can try air frying your wedges. Air fryers cook food by circulating hot air around it, so you'll need less oil to get the same crispy texture.  5. Roasting on A Rack: When baking, try putting your potato wedges on a wire rack on top of your baking tray. Any excess oil will drip down onto the tray, away from your wedges. 6. Make Use of Spices: Enhance the flavor of your potato wedges by using a variety of spices instead of added oil or fats. Herbs like rosemary and thyme, or spices like chili powder and cumin, can boost the flavor of your wedges without any added fat. 7. Avoid Adding Extra Fat: Resist the urge to add extra fats like cheese or cream-based dips. If you're craving a dip, opt for lower-fat options like salsa or a homemade yoghurt-based dip. 8. Eat in Moderation: Ultimately, potato wedges can be a part of a healthy diet if eaten in moderation. This is particularly important if you're trying to cut back on your overall fat intake. On the other hand, if you're looking to remove oil from already baked potato wedges, options are limited. You can place the hot wedges on paper towels right after baking, which should soak up some of the oil. However, this method isn't perfect and a significant amount of oil will still be left in the wedges.  That's why focusing on reducing the amount of fat in the preparation and cooking process is the best way to remove excess fat from baked potato wedges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: At a course, the Old Course at St. Andrews, where Tiger won a British Open by eight shots 15 years ago, there was a time during the second round of this British Open when he was already 15 shots off the lead. So it has come to that for the guy who used to be the biggest star we had in sports. Of course we have found out over the past several years in sports how fast and how far our stars can fall. We have seen it with Alex Rodriguez and have seen it from Lance Armstrong, who now rides in charity events on the Tour de France course and probably wishes he had a team to take him back the way the Yankees took Rodriguez back, even before they — or he — knew he could still hit the way he has this season, all the way through that go-ahead home run he hit the other way against the Mariners on Friday night at the Stadium. FOLLOW THE DAILY NEWS SPORTS ON FACEBOOK. \\"LIKE\\" US HERE But mostly we keep seeing it from Tiger Woods, who can’t make the cut now at major golf championships as he moves up on his 40th birthday. And if you’re expecting big things from him in majors the rest of the way, go check out how even the most famous golfers who ever played have done in golf major championships after their 40th birthdays. The other day I was talking to Tom Kite, a major champion at the U.S. Open in Pebble Beach in 1992 and who finished second to Tiger at the ’97 Masters, by 12 shots that year. It was the year, by the way, when Kite famously described himself as having won the “first flight” championship at Augusta National. Kite was breaking down Tiger’s new swing, which isn’t the new swing he got from Sean Foley, and isn’t the new swing he got from Hank Haney, and certainly isn’t the old swing he had when Butch Harmon, the best coach there is, was in charge of quality control. Kite was talking about the injuries Tiger has had to his knees, and the problems he now has with his left side as he attacks a golf ball. “From what I see, he’s just getting ahead of himself,” Kite said after a lot of analysis a lot more technical than that. But it is more than just his swing, which looks like something that has had way too much cosmetic surgery. So many commentators who finally watched Woods put some good rounds together at the Greenbrier, where he was back in the 60s and finished a half-dozen shots out of a playoff, and who watched his practice rounds at St. Andrews (where he won another British Open in 2005) were amazed at how once again Woods was such a complete failure taking his practice-round swing and practice-tee swing to the first tee of a major championship. He started chunking balls on the first hole and shot 40 on the front nine, and you thought he was on his way to another 80 in a major. He finished with a 76, and then at one point on Friday when a Brit named Danny Willett was in the lead at 9-under, at a time when so many golfers had gone low at the Old Course, Woods really was 15 behind and looking at missing the cut in Scotland the way he had at Chambers Bay. So no, it isn’t just all the surgeries he has had, to his knees and back. This is Woods, who won everything for a while and had the Tiger Slam if not the traditional Grand Slam in golf that Jordan Spieth is chasing, being confronted by the same enemies that have confronted golfers who never came close to knowing the success that he did as he was sprinting to 14 majors and chasing Jack Nicklaus. Those enemies are age and injury and nerves and fear and choking, especially choking at majors right now, with a driver in his hands or a putter or even a wedge. The wonderful CBS commentator Gary McCord was telling me once about what happens in golf when you start missing putts. McCord said that before long there’s a ripple effect from all the short putts and birdie putts that don’t fall that runs through your entire game. “And then,” McCord said, “it’s in your DNA.” It’s in Tiger’s DNA right now, even just a couple of years from when he was still good enough to win five tournaments in a year, and even with him telling us, every time he does shoot a good score and perhaps reads the hero-worship coverage he still gets sometimes, how close he is to being back to what he used to be. He can’t drive it straight and though he can get hot with the putter sometimes, he looks nothing at all like the guy who made everything he looked at for 10 years. It doesn’t mean he won’t win again. There are plenty of stories about aging golfers surprising us all. There was a time just recently when three over-40 golfers in a row won British Opens, Darren Clarke and Ernie Els and Phil Mickelson. There was a time when the great Tom Watson, hitting the ball as well as he ever did, went through nearly a decade of putting yips. Somehow Watson, because of the force of his athletic character, found his way to the other side of that, and won a lot of big senior tournaments. And nearly won his sixth British Open at the age of 59 at Turnberry six years ago. But for now, and for a while now, this has been as stunning a fall for a sports champion, and a sports star like this, as we have ever seen. Once, he was the athlete after Michael Jordan retired we most wanted to watch. We still want to watch him when he’s on television. But it’s like a bad reality show these days, built around really bad golf. All we are saying is give Spieth a chance, Wright or wrong & Serena rocks.... -- It would be a tremendous thing for golf if Jordan Spieth wins the third leg of the Grand Slam. But I’m rooting for Dustin Johnson to win the British Open, if they ever finish it, that is. Having watched in person as Tom Watson won British Opens in Scotland, watching him take that walk on the 18th at St. Andrews on Friday was one of the most unforgettable scenes in the history of the tournament, and of the place. We’re not on our way to the Canyon of Heroes because the Knicks played well in the summer league, but you have to admit, the Latvian Mamba looked pretty good, didn’t he? And if you’re wondering how much Knicks fans are starving for any kind of good news, look at the play Mr. Porzingis got for throwing one back on Jahlil Okafor. Curtis Strange and Paul Azinger are still as good at golf commentary as you can find anywhere. Those “nightmares” LeBron James says he’s been having since the NBA Finals ended — did they start before or after we saw him on those banana boats in the Bahamas with his special basketball friends? We are about to find out, before the trade deadline in baseball, how much of a chance the Mets really think they have against the Washington Nationals, or how much they’re willing to give up to compete all the way for the second wild card in the National League. -- Everybody knows how much I like David Wright, and how hard I am rooting for him to come back and be the old David Wright for the Mets, instead of just an old David Wright. He is as nice as anyone, and that includes Yogi, I have ever covered in a New York baseball clubhouse. But there can be no Franchise Four list of New York Mets that doesn’t have Doc Gooden on it. I’m not sure, when you add everything up, that Mike Piazza deserves to be on that list more than Darryl Strawberry, or even Gary Carter. And when you look at the whole grand scheme of things, I happen to think you can make a case that William Hayward (Mookie) Wilson could have made the cut, too. After some pretty dark times in New York sports, it wasn’t such a terrible thing to have the Yankees in first place at the All-Star Break and the Mets in second, all of that happening in the shadow of the run the Rangers made in the spring. When I turned on the British Open Saturday morning, I was waiting for the flying cow from “Twister” to come by when one of the golfers was trying to mark his ball. -- I’m so happy that Mark Cuban and Steve Ballmer were able to work things out without couples counseling. Seriously? Is there anything more difficult to watch than billionaires with relationship issues? My favorite thing this week was listening to all this hand-wringing from pundits in Cable America about a deal with Iran none of them had read. Even our guy Trump, as he was killing the deal, sounded like he was working off Cliffs Notes. -- What we are witnessing from Serena Williams is one of the great finishing kicks in the history of her sport or any sport. She has now won as many major championships after the age of 30 as Jimmy Connors and Andre Agassi won in their entire careers. And as for the other player who won Wimbledon last weekend, just know this about Novak Djokovic: He came along at the time when both Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal were in their primes, before Federer turned 30 himself, and on their way to winning 31 majors between them. Now Djokovic has whipped them both. Somehow, even on the way to those 17 majors, Federer couldn’t beat Nadal, at least not nearly enough. In his twilight, in so many big moments, now he can’t beat Djokovic. I thought Caitlyn Jenner’s speech at the ESPY Awards was terrific. But somebody has to explain to me why some reaction shots of Brett Favre turned him into some sort of public enemy on social media. What, he’s a bad guy because he didn’t weep? Four games for Tom Brady? I still don’t think he’s going to accept four minutes. -- The mayor of New York City sounds as upset about Uber as he did about horse-drawn carriages in Central Park. The big guy better watch it, because if he gets rid of Uber, people all over town are going to start being as late for stuff as he is. “Lupica” can be heard Monday through Friday at 1 p.m. and Sunday at 9 a.m. on ESPN 98.7.

The production values on this one are pretty bad and the acting is atrocious. The brother of the anchorwoman werewolf from part one wants to find out what happened to his sis'. The \\"scene\\" from the first film was badly re-created. A skinny plain looking woman accompanies bro' (Reb Brown) to the old country (Romania) to uncover the mystery to her sister's murder/transformation/death. Christopher Lee appears and disappears over now and then as sort of a sage/guide to the two. Sybil Danning and her two biggest assets appear as Stirba, the head werewolf of the Romania. She also suffers from a bad case of morning face, ewww! Bad movie. There's nothing good about this stinker. I'm surprise Philippe Mora directed this picture because he's usually a good film-maker.

We are in the front room of Saif al-Islam al-Gaddafi's mansion in Hampstead Garden Suburb, recently expropriated by activists working in alliance with Libyan exiles. An hour earlier, I had passed through an open window near some ugly imported ferns belonging to Muammar al-Gaddafi's son, having been invited to meet the members of the new Free Libyan Embassy.      We drink stewed tea from Saif's best china and eat cheese sandwiches using his silver cutlery, while the young man, Abdulla, tells me about how his uncle was \\"disappeared\\" by Saif's father. \\"In Libya, people disappear all the time. There was a prison massacre where 1,200 people died. They poured cement over the bodies.\\" Abdulla nervously adjusts his glasses. \\"It's important that people know we're not creating a civil war for no reason.\\"      Nearly every room in this enormous house boasts a large, flat-screen television. The occupiers have set each one to al-Jazeera, for rolling coverage of the people's revolutions that are sweeping the Arab world. Televised gunfire echoes in the marble hallway as Jay, 25, explains how activists from the London squatter movement took over the Gaddafi mansion, moving in secretly and putting up notices declaring their intention to hold the empty house under English common law. \\"We wanted to show our solidarity the best way we know how,\\" he says.      “It's a symbolic and practical reclamation of private property that belongs to the Libyan people. It's about their struggle, which is why the place has been handed over to the Libyans as a place to organise and a safe space for refugees,\\" Jay says. \\"People have been arriving in support from all over the UK.\\" The tabloids have portrayed the occupiers as drunken anarchists but this is, in Jay's words, \\"total bollocks\\". \\"On the first night, people came down thinking there would be a squat party and we turned them away. They didn't seem to realise how seriously we're taking this,\\" he explains.      “At first, we were elated that we'd managed to pull it off. Then the Libyans turned up and they were elated. But once they started to get reports about family and friends being killed, the atmosphere changed. We were watching Zawiyah burning on al-Jazeera and someone saw his own house. It was terrible.\\"      Jay takes me on a tour over four floors of hushed opulence, each several times the size of an ordinary London flat. \\"It's worth nearly £11m,\\" he says. Under the kitchen is a cosy entertainment complex, complete with pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and a private cinema done out in suede, the pews so thick and warm you could sleep on them – which people have been doing. On the corner of one aisle a bare duvet lies, neatly folded. Everything here is white, bright and glistening: white leather sofas, marble floors, silver candlesticks adorning pristine white walls. The only note of colour is in one of the guest bedrooms, where a Libyan flag has been draped over the TV.      Fuelling anger      Fearing the spectacle of bailiffs dragging Libyans out of the private property of a Gaddafi, at a time when the UK government is desperately downplaying its erstwhile support for the dictator, the authorities have kept their distance. But that doesn't mean that there have been no attempts to get the occupiers to leave.      “Last night, at about four in the morning, someone came to the door,\\" Jay says. According to Abdulla, \\"It was a well-dressed Arab person, [wearing] nice clothes and gold. When I asked him what he was doing here so late, he said, 'I want to make you an offer.' He told us: 'I have £40,000 in cash. You can have it if you leave immediately.' No amount of money could make us leave this house. It's not a financial issue.\\"      On the sofa opposite, a quiet man called Ambarak suddenly speaks up in Arabic. \\"What's a life worth?\\" he says, as Abdulla translates softly. \\"What are 100,000 lives worth?\\" Ambarak perches on the edge of the sofa, looking out of place in his keffiyeh and scuffed trainers. \\"I'm talking about people being shot by snipers in the street. I'm talking about family members selling dry bread to live.      “They ask what the west should do, but they've known about [Muammar] Gaddafi for years,\\" he continues in broken English. \\"They did nothing. The petrol . . .\\" – he rubs his fingers together in a \\"money\\" gesture, grinning without humour. \\"My brother has disappeared in the fighting. We haven't heard from him, we have no way of contacting him.\\" Ambarak goes very quiet. \\"Excuse me, please. I must go and pray.\\"      \\"The resources that come out of Libya should belong to the people but that petrol money goes somewhere else,\\" says Abdulla. \\"All those close to Gaddafi have places like this to live. There are some who are heartless and will do anything for a comfortable life.\\"      Ambarak's family is in Misurata, where fierce fighting continues. \\"They say on the phone that they can hear shooting and tanks are coming down the street. My cousin has died, [as have] my friend, my neighbours.\\"      An influx of neighbours bearing food terminates the interview. A young man wearing a Libyan flag like a cape takes the cups politely to the sink. He is a long way from home. \\"We all want to go home,\\" says Abdulla. \\"But not to Libya as it is now.\\"      The Libyans involved in this article wanted their names to be known; other names have been changed.

There are over 600 known species of Oak, with 55 found in the continental United States. Because there is such a wide variety of oak trees in the world, it can be hard to find characteristics that unite them all. However, they do exist:   Acorns are the easiest way to spot an oak tree. If the tree produces acorns, it's an oak.  Lobed leaves are leaves that have rounded or pointed knobs extending out from the center line. While a few oaks do not have lobes, all of the leaves are generally symmetrical around a clear median line.  Small, scaly bark. Bark on oak trees is variable, but it is generally made up of small, hard, and scaly bits of bark. This is unlike the large, flaky chunks of pines or the wallpaper-like bark on birch trees, and is much more cracked and grooved. Lobes are the bits of leaf that extend out to each side from the center of the leaf, like points on a star. White oaks have rounded lobes while red oaks have pointed ones. This is an important distinction that will cut the number of potential trees you're trying to identify in half. On red oaks, the vein of the leave extends all the way out to the edge, creating this point. Each area has its own assortment of oak species, which is often drastically different from other areas. The species of oak you will encounter changes great depending on where you are in the world, as it is rare for an oak found on the east coast to be found in the west, a southern oak in the north, etc. You can generally figure out your region with a few criteria (examples here are for Continental US):  General location -- Northeast, Southeast, Midwest, Northwest, Southwest Inland or coastal. Mountainous or flat terrain. The lobes are the sections that extend out from the center of the leaf's stem on both sides. If possible, compare multiple leaves to find the average number of lobes. A few species such as the willow oak have no lobes at all, but most oaks have multiple lobes. Count at least 4-5 leaves when identifying, as this will help when you turn to the field guide. Look at the area between the lobes and determine whether the indentations are deep or shallow. White oak leaves often have variable indentations that alternate randomly between shallow and deep, where red oaks can have dramatic, sharp indentations or none at all. The leaves of evergreen oaks are shiny and dark green all year, but most oaks will turn colors in autumn. Some oaks, such as scarlet oak (Quercus coccinea), sport brilliant colors in the fall. White oaks and chestnut oaks are often a dull brown when color comes around. If it's summer, look at whether the leaves are dark green or light green, and whether they're shiny or not, to help determine the species. Evergreen oaks and a couple red oaks such as scrub oak have smaller leaves while most red oaks and nearly all deciduous white oaks have much larger leaves (at least 4 in.). This is one of the more important distinguishing features between similar species of oak. Using the data you've collected, identify your oak tree using a tree manual or field guide. There are dozens and dozens of oak trees out there, and you can't he expected to know them all by heart. Use the above criteria to narrow down your choices, then use the guide to find what oak you're looking at. You can look through the collection of common oak trees below, or consult a Field Guide, found through the US Forestry Service.  Turn to the appropriate section. Most guides are divided into a red oak section and a white oak section Narrow your selection down to the oaks specific to your area. A good guide should have distribution maps for each species. Once you have a list of possibilities, look at the pictures for each one to determine your tree. Summary:","output":"Oak trees are special types of trees found in many places around the world. There are lots of different kinds of oak trees, but they all share some things in common. They make acorns, which are little nuts that fall from the tree. Oak leaves have special shapes called lobes that stick out from the middle of the leaf. Oak tree bark is usually rough and scaly. There are two main groups of oak trees: white oaks and red oaks. White oaks have rounded lobes on their leaves, while red oaks have pointy ones. To identify an oak tree, look at its leaves, bark, location, and the shape and color of its leaves.

I gained patience when I lost my freedom. I knew that I would eventually get it back in time. I was locked up in prison for a period of six years because at 19 years old I was playing with a handgun and I accidentally shot and killed my friend. The first couple of years was the hardest.I was always stressed out about everything.Time was dragging by because I was always paying attention to it.While I was locked up,Tom who I talked to helped put this virtue in me.He told me that it was possible that he would never make it home but that being patient and believing that one day he would was what had made him feel better.After a while I realized why he said a lot of things to me.Once I stopped paying attention to the days and just kept in mind that I would get freedom,it seemed that my time passed quickly. Now I am home and can see that patience paid off for me. I now use this virtue in my daily activities. I know that sometimes life gets hard and that it will pay in the end to stay patient and not to get discouraged.

Here is an article: In Cuba, it is legal to own fighting cocks, it is legal to train them, and it is legal to put them to fight, but one detail – all forms of betting and gambling are strictly forbidden since 1959, when the Cuban Revolution started. And the sole reason to fight cocks is to bet on them. It is an activity so popular among Cubans that stopping it would pose a huge challenge for the authorities and would be counterproductive. I spoke to a man named Yurien, who said, “President Raul likes cockfighting, our commanders Ramiro and Guillermo also like it, and we like it. Cockfighting is a part of Cuba so we do it with order and discipline. It is unstoppable. There are also a few legal arenas set up by the state, and even in those betting exists, but in a quiet and discreet way.” The most impressive site used for illegal cockfighting I visited was a military anti-aircraft shelter built into the side of a hill on the outskirts of a Cuban city, reachable after a short trek through thick bush. It struck me as a place in the middle of nowhere. The site was full of people enjoying an afternoon with their favorite pastime, cockfighting. As I arrived a man quickly came over with the entry tickets, in a highly organized manner. The fights were on and the cocks were safe, very safe, in the shade of the underground bunker. When I was leaving the bunker I met a boy carrying his injured fighting cock through the bush. His bird had lost the fight that day and he was sad. He said, “We will be back to win. I will cure my bird, and he will be back, even if now he only has one eye.” To reach the fight arena you have to know exactly where you are going, and when the fights are to take place. There are not signs, no announcements. This site and others are always concealed and hidden away down a dirt road lane and in the bush on the outskirts any Cuban city. Curiously, the steep paths or the bits of the lane on which car wheels skid in mud when it rains, are paved, yes, paved with asphalt. Money has been invested to ensure that participants and spectators make it to the site even if it rains. After the adventure of finding the site, suddenly in the middle of nowhere one finds people milling around and dozens of cars, many of them the typical pre-1959 models that have been restored and look like from their best times, tractors, horse-drawn carts, motorbikes and trucks all parked in a proper parking lot with a guard. There is electricity in the air and excitement everywhere. It is the day. A checkpoint manned by three or four men marks the entrance, and after paying a fee, you realize it is a serious place for serious business. But the whole thing can be quickly dismantled, loaded on trucks and set up elsewhere, in only a few hours. The sites are always practical and well built wooden structures covered with a thatched roof or tarpaulins to cater to hundreds of people. Apart from the main fight arena, other thatched structures surround the place as kiosks offering food, drinks, tobacco and other amenities for the spectators. There are cold drinks, roast pork, rice and beans, sandwiches and other snacks being offered. If you need to go to the toilet you just walk into the bush. There are dozens of these set-ups around Cuba where thousands of dollars are won and lost. A front row position can cost up to 10, or one further back can go for 4. Money flows freely as people go around holding huge wads of notes. There are also always tables to play cards, and bets are placed on the cocks before and during the fights. Each proud owner carries his animal with pride. Some birds can easily sell for 1,000. There are cocks of breeds from India, Mexico, Spain and many other countries. It is a very specialized trade and they enter the country in the form of a fertilized egg to be incubated in Cuba, since importing live animals is prohibited. Before the fights start, cock owners mill around the weigh-in point, and the birds are officially weighed and assigned a category. Once that’s completed, the different fights are arranged. The fighting cocks are the real stars of the show. After long months of training they are given pedicures, fitted with a sharp claw, endure sessions of feather-dressing, grooming and extreme clipping. The feathers on their legs and body are clipped, giving them a strange semi-human, semi-chicken look. The birds are treated like kings as they are carried in special boxes, and they are fed special food. To breed fighting cocks is a fine and very specialized occupation done by only a few. When I watched my first cockfight I realized that the birds use their back claw to kill each other in a very fast movement. All I could see was a ball of feathers swirling around, so during the fights I began to watch other interesting elements at the event – the bird owners and the crowd. It struck me that for the first time I was observing human beings turning into fighting roosters. The owners of the cocks are allowed to stand beside their animals like a coach along a boxing ring. They continuously dance around their birds, chuckling like excited cocks, salivating and sweating profusely. They literally enter a into a semi-trance with their eyes rolling. Some of them move their arms and legs as if they are the birds themselves, and don’t stop cooing and chuckling. Between rounds, they pick up their roosters as if they were wounded children, and lovingly lick their wounds. I saw one of them furiously blowing spit on his bird’s behind after chuckling into its ear and kissing and licking its beak. A truly surreal sight. There is a boiling frenzy as the fight starts, and it continues right to the end, with many people shouting bets furiously at the same time, waving their fat wads of money, moving their arms, legs, heads and whole bodies. The wooden structure bends and moves, and the air is so dense with excitement it is difficult to describe. Everyone knows that it is all an illegal activity, and that makes it even more exciting. A lot money has been placed on the birds; the outcome will leave losers with dead or severely injured birds and winners with more money in their pocket. Photography is absolutely not allowed, but in Cuba nothing and everything is possible. It all depends on how a photographer approaches the challenge. It is a question of first of all becoming part of the woodwork, which takes some time, and choosing very carefully when and what to shoot. Obviously big professional cameras are not much help in this kind of scene. To do the pictures for this story I used cellphones, a Gopro Hero 2, a Panasonic Lumix DMC-LX3 and the Canon EOS 5D Mark II, depending on the situation. Write a title for it.","output":"Cuba's Underground World of Illegal Cockfighting"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Sourav Chandidas Ganguly ( pronunciation ; born 8 July 1972), affectionately known as Dada (meaning \\"elder brother\\" in Bengali), is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national team, Currently, he is appointed as the President of the Cricket Association of Bengal and President of the Editorial Board with Wisden India. During his playing career, Ganguly established himself as one of the world's leading batsmen and also one of the greatest captains of the national cricket team. While batting, he was especially prolific through the off side, earning himself the nickname God of the Off Side for his elegant strokeplay square of the wicket and through the covers. Sourav Ganguly is one of the four members of the Indian Premier League's Governing Council, responsible for all the functions of the tournament. Sourav Ganguly was born on 8 July 1972 in Calcutta, and is the youngest son of Chandidas and Nirupa Ganguly. Chandidas ran a flourishing print business and was one of the richest men in the city. Ganguly had a luxurious childhood and was nicknamed the 'Maharaja', meaning the 'Great King'. Ganguly's father Chandidas Ganguly died at the age of 73 on 21 February 2013 after a long illness.  Since the favourite sport for the people of Calcutta was football, Ganguly was initially attracted to the game. However, academics came in-between his love for sports and Nirupa was not very supportive of Ganguly taking up cricket or any other sport as a career. By then, his elder brother Snehasish was already an established cricketer for the Bengal cricket team. He supported Ganguly's dream to be a cricketer and asked their father to get Ganguly enrolled in a cricket coaching camp during his summer holidays. Ganguly was studying in tenth grade at that time.  Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so he could use his brother's sporting equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he was enrolled in a cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under-15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were beneath his social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it beneath his social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: how was his early life?","output":"Sourav Ganguly's early life was quite comfortable and luxurious, as he was born into a wealthy family in Calcutta.

Toronto School Bans Footballs, Soccer Balls And Baseballs From Playground TORONTO – A Toronto school angered students and parents when it banned soccer balls, baseballs, footballs, tennis balls and volleyballs from the school grounds, the Toronto Star reported. Students at Earl Beatty Public School were sent home carrying letters stating that nobody could bring any of the balls to the junior and senior schools after a \\"few serious incidents\\" in which staff and students were struck in the playground. The temporary ban means only Nerf balls or sponge balls can be used by students at the school for now. School trustee Sheila Cary-Meagher told the newspaper that the most serious incident involved a parent who was hit in the head by a soccer ball, suffering a concussion. \\"I think the principal is reacting in a rational way. You don't want anyone to be injured,\\" she said. But some parents and students object to the ban, arguing that it is excessive. Chris Stateski said his six-year-old son Jacob was \\"crushed\\" when he learned about the ban. \\"He [Jacob] said, 'Daddy, what am I going to do with all my friends?'

Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is the eighth studio album by English rock band the Beatles. Released on 26 May 1967 in the United Kingdom and 2 June 1967 in the United States, it was an immediate commercial and critical success, spending 27 weeks at the top of the UK albums chart and 15 weeks at number one in the US. On release, the album was lauded by the vast majority of critics for its innovations in music production, songwriting and graphic design, for bridging a cultural divide between popular music and high art, and for providing a musical representation of its generation and the contemporary counterculture. By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger\\". The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The polite and restrained Japanese audiences shocked the band, because the absence of screaming fans allowed them to hear how poor their live performances had become. By the time that they arrived in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting the First Lady Imelda Marcos, the group had grown unhappy with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary.  After the Beatles' return to London, George Harrison replied to a question about their long-term plans: \\"We'll take a couple of weeks to recuperate before we go and get beaten up by the Americans.\\" His comments proved prophetic, as soon afterwards Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a miserable US tour in August that was marked by half-filled stadiums and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes:  To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.  Upon the Beatles' return to England, rumours began to circulate that they had decided to break up. Harrison informed Epstein that he was leaving the band, but was persuaded to stay on the assurance that there would be no more tours. The group took a three-month break, during which they focused on individual interests. Harrison travelled to India for six weeks to study the sitar under the instruction of Ravi Shankar and develop his interest in Hindu philosophy. Having been the last of the Beatles to concede that their live performances had become futile, Paul McCartney collaborated with Beatles producer George Martin on the soundtrack for the film The Family Way. Lennon acted in the film How I Won the War and attended art showings, such as one at the Indica Gallery where he met his future wife Yoko Ono. Ringo Starr used the break to spend time with his wife Maureen and son Zak.  In November 1966, during a return flight to London from Kenya, where he had been on holiday with Beatles tour manager Mal Evans, McCartney had an idea for a song that eventually formed the impetus of the Sgt. Pepper concept. His idea involved an Edwardian-era military band, for which Evans invented a name in the style of contemporary San Francisco-based groups such as Big Brother and the Holding Company and Quicksilver Messenger Service. In February 1967, McCartney suggested that the Beatles should record an entire album that would represent a performance by the fictional band. This alter ego group would give them the freedom to experiment musically. He explained: \\"I thought, let's not be ourselves. Let's develop alter egos.\\" Martin remembered:  \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" itself didn't appear until halfway through making the album. It was Paul's song, just an ordinary rock number ... but when we had finished it, Paul said, \\"Why don't we make the album as though the Pepper band really existed, as though Sergeant Pepper was making the record? We'll dub in effects and things.\\" I loved the idea, and from that moment on it was as though Pepper had a life of its own.  In 1966, the American musician and bandleader Brian Wilson's growing interest in the aesthetics of recording and his admiration for both record producer Phil Spector's Wall of Sound and the Beatles' album Rubber Soul resulted in the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds LP, which demonstrated his production expertise and his mastery of composition and arrangement. The author Thomas MacFarlane credits the release with influencing many musicians of the time, with McCartney in particular singing its praises and drawing inspiration to \\"expand the focus of the Beatles' work with sounds and textures not usually associated with popular music\\". McCartney thought that his constant playing of the album made it difficult for Lennon to \\"escape the influence\\", adding: \\"It's very cleverly done ... so we were inspired by it and nicked a few ideas.\\" Martin stated: \\"Without Pet Sounds, Sgt. Pepper never would have happened ... Pepper was an attempt to equal Pet Sounds.\\"  Freak Out! by the Mothers of Invention has also been cited as having influenced Sgt. Pepper. According to the author Philip Norman, during the Sgt. Pepper recording sessions McCartney repeatedly stated: \\"This is our Freak Out!\\" The music journalist Chet Flippo states that McCartney was inspired to record a concept album after hearing Freak Out!, considered the first rock concept album.  Sgt. Pepper, according to American musicologist Allan F. Moore, is composed mainly of rock and pop music, while Michael Hannan and Naphtali Wagner both believed it is an album of various genres; Hannan said it features \\"a broad variety of musical and theatrical genres\\". According to Hannan and Wagner, the music incorporates the stylistic influences of rock and roll, vaudeville, big band, piano jazz, blues, chamber, circus, music hall, avant-garde, and Western and Indian classical music. Wagner felt the album's music reconciles the \\"diametrically opposed aesthetic ideals\\" of classical and psychedelia, achieving a \\"psycheclassical synthesis\\" of the two forms. Musicologist John Covach describes Sgt. Pepper as \\"proto-progressive\\".  Concerns that some of the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper refer to recreational drug use led to the BBC banning several songs from British radio, such as \\"A Day in the Life\\" because of the phrase \\"I'd love to turn you on\\", with the BBC claiming that it could \\"encourage a permissive attitude towards drug-taking.\\" Although Lennon and McCartney denied any drug-related interpretation of the song at the time, McCartney later suggested that the line was deliberately written to ambiguously refer to either illicit drugs or sexual activity. The meaning of \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\" became the subject of speculation, as many believed that the song's title was code for the hallucinogenic drug LSD. The BBC banned the track on those grounds. They also banned \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!\\" because of the lyric, which mentions \\"Henry the Horse\\", a phrase that contains two common slang terms for heroin. Fans speculated that Henry the Horse was a drug dealer and \\"Fixing a Hole\\" was a reference to heroin use. Others noted lyrics such as \\"I get high\\" from \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"take some tea\\" - slang for cannabis use - from \\"Lovely Rita\\" and \\"digging the weeds\\" from \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\".  The author Sheila Whiteley attributes Sgt. Pepper's underlying philosophy not only to the drug culture, but also to metaphysics and the non-violent approach of the flower power movement. The musicologist Oliver Julien views the album as an embodiment of \\"the social, the musical, and more generally, the cultural changes of the 1960s\\". The American psychologist and counterculture figure Timothy Leary contends that the LP \\"gave a voice to the feeling that the old ways were over ... it came along at the right time\\" and stressed the need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda. The album's primary value, according to Moore, is its ability to \\"capture, more vividly than almost anything contemporaneous, its own time and place\\". Whiteley agrees, crediting the album with \\"provid[ing] a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love\\". Several scholars have applied a hermeneutic strategy to their analysis of Sgt. Pepper's lyrics, identifying loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions as the most prominent themes. What was important about the lyrics?","output":"The lyrics of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band were important for several reasons. First, they represented the album's embodiment of the social, musical, and cultural changes of the 1960s. The album expressed a need for cultural change based on a peaceful agenda and captured the spirit of the times, including the flower power movement, metaphysics, and the drug culture. It provided a historical snapshot of England during the run-up to the Summer of Love. Second, the lyrics in several songs led to speculation about their connection to recreational drug use. The BBC banned some songs from British radio due to concerns that the lyrics either directly or ambiguously referred to drug use or promoted a permissive attitude towards drug-taking. Some examples include \\"A Day in the Life,\\" \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,\\" \\"Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!,\\" \\"With a Little Help from My Friends,\\" \\"Lovely Rita,\\" and \\"When I'm Sixty-Four\\". Despite the denials of John Lennon and Paul McCartney at the time, McCartney later admitted that some lyrics were deliberately ambiguous. Lastly, the lyrics in Sgt. Pepper explored various themes, including the loss of innocence and the dangers of overindulgence in fantasies or illusions. These themes contributed to the album's ability to capture its own time and place, making it a landmark work in popular music history. This is further highlighted by the fact that several scholars have applied hermeneutic strategies to analyze the album's lyrics, demonstrating the importance of the album both for its time and its continued relevance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Tim Warden, a boy with autism, has supposedly witnessed his parents' double murder. Jake Rainer, a former child psychiatrist turned therapist, is called on to probe the child's mind in order to solve the case. The psychological drama is provided by the fact that not even Jake can entice Tim to communicate what he has or has not seen regarding the crime. Tim's sister, Sylvie, is protective of him. She eventually warms to Jake's efforts, but is concerned when she learns he was implicated in the suicide of another young child who was under his care. Jake gradually befriends Tim. At first, Jake thinks that Tim is trying to communicate by cutting up playing cards, but Sylvie reveals that Tim is good at mimicking voices. Jake is able to trigger Tim's memory so that Tim mimics the voices he heard on the night of the murder by using the trigger phrase \\"God Damn,\\" which were the first words Tim heard from the murder. He attempts to piece together the chronology of the murder, suspecting that Tim interrupted a fight between his parents and an intruder. Sheriff Mitch Rivers threatens to use drugs to get Tim to talk about the murder and Dr. Rene Harlinger successfully hypnotizes Tim into breaking down a locked door. The police chief, seeing this as proof of Tim's strength, concludes that Tim was the murderer, after finding photographs showing that Tim's father was molesting him. That night, Sylvie plans to take Tim away and attempts to convince Jake to run away with them. She fails, and instead paralyzes Jake and throws him into an icy lake to drown him.

Answer: Escort aircraft carriers, such as USS Bogue, were sometimes purpose-built, but most were converted from merchant ships as a stop-gap measure to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"To answer the question in a satisfactory fashion, we must also discuss advantages of light carriers over escort carriers. Here's a revised answer: Light carriers had several advantages over escort carriers: 1. Speed: Light carriers were faster than escort carriers, allowing them to keep up with the main fleet and respond more quickly to threats or changing conditions. 2. Aircraft capacity: Light carriers could carry more aircraft than escort carriers, providing a more substantial air wing for offensive and defensive operations. 3. Combat capabilities: Light carriers were typically more sturdily built and better equipped for combat situations, possessing better armor and more powerful defensive weaponry. 4. Operational range: Light carriers had a greater range of operations than escort carriers, enabling them to project power and support missions at a greater distance from their home bases. In comparison, escort carriers were usually converted from merchant ships or, in some cases, purpose-built as stop-gap measures to provide anti-submarine air support for convoys and amphibious invasions. They were smaller, slower, and generally less capable than light carriers, but served an important role in naval operations due to their ability to quickly bolster air presence in a variety of situations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Inferno Context: During a trip to the Mojave Desert, millionaire Donald Carson III, having broken his leg falling off his horse, has been abandoned and left to die by Geraldine, his adulterous femme fatale wife, and mining engineer Joe Duncan, a man she's known for just a few days. Gerry and Joe leave the injured man a blanket, a canteen and a gun before driving off, supposedly to seek medical aid. As the hours go by and Carson realizes the truth of his predicament, he vows to live long enough to exact revenge against his wife and her accomplice. Carson is reported missing to police lieutenant Mike Platt and to Dave Emory, who is Carson's lawyer and business manager. Gerry doesn't mention the broken leg and claims her husband wandered off. Emory isn't yet too concerned because Carson is a temperamental alcoholic who has acted irresponsibly more than once. The lovers fly to Carson's mansion in Los Angeles knowing that Carson is a good 60 miles from where they told the police to look. They expect him to succumb to the desert heat or to shoot himself with the gun. Far more resourceful than they anticipated, Carson manages to make a splint, then crawl his way to an abandoned mine, where he uses timber for a makeshift crutch. He finds sustenance from the meat of a cactus and attempts in vain to shoot a rabbit with the gun. When it rains, after Carson has been gone a week, Gerry and Joe are relieved because it has permanently covered any tracks they left. Carson is presumed dead by the law. Joe flies a plane over the region, just in case, and spots a fire Carson has made. Knowing now he's alive, Joe finds it necessary to drive back into the desert and finish off Carson once and for all. Gerry waits in the car while Joe stalks his prey. Just as he aims his gun, Joe is startled by the sight of Carson being found by an old prospector driving a jalopy. Returning to his own car, Joe discovers that Gerry has run it into a rock. He realizes that she'd intended to drive off and leave him there. Joe angrily walks away, leaving Gerry to fend...

The explosion happened at Phramongkutklao Hospital, which is used by serving and retired members of the military and their families. It took place on the third anniversary of the 2014 coup which brought the military government to power. Police said it was not clear who was behind the blast, which happened in a waiting room by a pharmacy. \\"We found pieces of a circuit and a battery, as well as some wires. We'll investigate further but initially we found the explosive had a range of 2-3 metres,\\" the Bangkok Post quoted Deputy National Police Chief General Srivara Rangsibrahmanakul as saying. Officials said most people had minor wounds from flying glass. \\"Eight people were admitted to hospital to observe their condition... among them is one woman who needed surgery because of shrapnel buried in her jaw,\\" AFP quoted hospital director Saroj Keokajee as saying. Thai newspaper The Nation said Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha had ordered an immediate investigation into the attack at the hospital, which also treats civilians. Three years after the armed forces seized power in Thailand, they rule almost unchallenged; the few who have dared oppose the government openly have been detained and charged. But there have been occasional small bombs, presumed to be in protest against the military. One went off last week close to the royal palace, where preparations are still under way for the elaborate cremation of the late King Bhumibol, who died last October. The military has succeeded in maintaining order and stability through a sensitive royal succession; but it has done little to address the political divisions underlying the conflicts which preceded the coup. Three years ago to the day the military ousted an elected government following months of street protests. Since then, Thailand's military leaders have clamped down on critics, political opponents and free speech. An election is due by the end of next year. It will be held under a new military-drafted constitution that critics claim only allows for a partial, guided democracy. Thailand has faced a power struggle since Thaksin Shinawatra was ousted by the military as prime minister in 2006. He and his sister (who led the government ousted in 2014) have strong support in rural areas, but they are hated by a military-backed urban elite who accuse them of corruption.

Most of the injuries were minor, resulting from flying glass, though eight people were admitted to the hospital, including a woman who required surgery for shrapnel in her jaw. The incident occurred amidst ongoing political tension in the country, with Thailand's military leaders having restricted freedom of speech and political dissent since seizing power.

She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, \\"Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue.\\" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended  to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, \\"How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too.\\" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue. Convinced  that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped  and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur.

The longstanding bad blood between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq boiled Monday amid another round of attacks: the killing of 25 people and wounding of dozens more in five car bombings. Four of the blasts occurred in the Shiite heartland in the southern region of Iraq. Two car bombs exploded near a busy outdoor market in Amara, killing 13 people and wounding 24 others. A bomb went off near an outdoor market in Diwaniya, killing six people and wounding 20 others. And two people died and 11 others were wounded in a bombing at a commercial area in Karbala. Another blast occurred in Mahmoudiya, a predominantly Sunni area just south of Baghdad. Four people were killed and 14 others were wounded in that attack. Iraq pulls plug on 'misleading' TV networks. No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, nor was it clear whether they were related. But the fighting has prompted fears among Iraqi leaders and international powers that the tensions between Sunnis and Shiites could escalate and bring a return of the full-blown sectarian war that raged last decade. Since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government last decade, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized and Shiites, who represent a majority of Iraqis, have emerged with more power. There have been protests for months by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. The anger has escalated since a confrontation last week between police and protesters in Hawija. The International Crisis Group last week said that the \\"failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a genuinely representative political system in Baghdad risks turning Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle.\\" \\"The most urgent task today is to tamp down the flames, and the burden for this lies above all with the government,\\" the Belgium-based think tank said in a report. \\"The country is at a crossroads,\\" said Martin Kobler, U.N. special representative in Iraq. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"This article highlights the ongoing sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shiites in Iraq, which resulted in series of car bombings that killed 25 people and wounded dozens more. These attacks have raised concerns among Iraqi leaders and international powers, fearing a return to a full-blown sectarian war as seen in the previous decade. The article also mentions that since the overthrow of Saddam Hussein's government, Sunni Arabs have been politically marginalized, while Shiites have gained more power. This has led to growing resentment and protests by Sunni Arabs against the Shiite-led government and its prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki. Furthermore, the International Crisis Group warns that the failure to integrate Sunni Arabs into a representative political system might turn Iraq's domestic crisis into a broader regional struggle. The think tank states that the most urgent task is to control the situation, with the burden of responsibility falling on the government. Lastly, the UN special representative in Iraq, Martin Kobler, declares that the country is at a crossroads, signifying the critical nature of the current situation and the need to address the underlying issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Czech is closely related to Slovak, Polish, and Sorbian, and it uses the Latin alphabet with additional diacritics for pronunciation. The sentence you provided translates to: \\"Bushka turned pale with anger, but remained silent.\\" Czech is known for its complex grammar system, including complicated consonant clusters and a rich case system. The language is characterized by its relatively free word order, which is influenced by an extensive system of inflection. There are seven cases in Czech, reflecting different syntactic roles of nouns, pronouns, and adjectives within a sentence: nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental. Czech vocabulary is derived mainly from the common Slavic language, which existed around the 6th and 7th centuries AD. But it has also borrowed words from other languages such as Latin, German, and English. The Czech language has not only played an important role in the cultural life of the Czech Republic, but it also has considerable influence in other Slavic countries as well. The works of the Czech historical figures like religious reformer Jan Hus, the educator and philosopher Jan Amos Komenský (known as Comenius in English), as well as the contributions of Nobel Prize-winning Czech authors such as Jaroslav Seifert and Bohumil Hrabal, have all added to the language’s rich history and global presence."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Thuringia: Some reordering of the Thuringian states occurred during the German Mediatisation from 1795 to 1814, and the territory was included within the Napoleonic Confederation of the Rhine organized in 1806. The 1815 Congress of Vienna confirmed these changes and the Thuringian states' inclusion in the German Confederation; the Kingdom of Prussia also acquired some Thuringian territory and administered it within the Province of Saxony. The Thuringian duchies which became part of the German Empire in 1871 during the Prussian-led unification of Germany were Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt and the two principalities of Reuss Elder Line and Reuss Younger Line. In 1920, after World War I, these small states merged into one state, called Thuringia; only Saxe-Coburg voted to join Bavaria instead. Weimar became the new capital of Thuringia.

First, we will process the first element, which is 47. Since 47 is an odd number, we apply the rule: multiply by 3 and add 1, so 47 * 3 + 1 = 142. 2. Next, we will process the second element, which is 87. Since 87 is an odd number, we apply the rule: multiply by 3 and add 1, so 87 * 3 + 1 = 262. 3. Now, we will process the third element, which is 196. Since 196 is an even number, we apply the rule: divide by 2, so 196 / 2 = 98. 4. Then, we will process the fourth element, which is 149. Since 149 is an odd number, we apply the rule: multiply by 3 and add 1, so 149 * 3 + 1 = 448. 5. Finally, we will process the fifth element, which is 23. Since 23 is an odd number, we apply the rule: multiply by 3 and add 1, so 23 * 3 + 1 = 70.

Until the mid 1980s this was only practical with the brush-type DC motor, although such DC can be supplied from an AC catenary via on-board electric power conversion. Since such conversion was not well developed in the late 19th century and early 20th century, most early electrified railways used DC and many still do, particularly rapid transit (subways) and trams. Speed was controlled by connecting the traction motors in various series-parallel combinations, by varying the traction motors' fields, and by inserting and removing starting resistances to limit motor current. Q: What is speed limit for railways?","output":"The speed limit for railways varies depending on the type of train, track conditions, and the country or region where the railway is located. Generally, speed limits for trains are imposed to ensure safety, efficiency, and the operational performance of the railway systems. Here, we will take a look at different types of train systems and some examples of their speed limits: 1. Conventional passenger trains: Conventional trains, also known as non-high-speed trains, usually operate at speeds between 70 km/h (45 mph) and 160 km/h (100 mph). For instance, in the United States, the speed limit for conventional passenger trains is typically around 120 km/h (75 mph). However, some regions, such as Europe, have introduced higher speed limits ranging from 160 km/h (100 mph) to 200 km/h (124 mph) on specific routes. 2. Freight trains: Freight trains usually have lower speed limits than passenger trains because of their heavier loads and the need for braking distance. In general, freight trains in the United States can operate at maximum speeds of 80 km/h (50 mph) to 112 km/h (70 mph). In Europe, the average speed limit for freight trains is about 100 km/h (62 mph). 3. High-speed rail: High-speed rail systems operate at significantly higher speeds than conventional trains, ranging from 200 km/h (124 mph) to 350 km/h (217 mph) or even higher. For example, the Japanese Shinkansen operates at speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph); the French TGV achieves speeds of up to 320 km/h (199 mph) or 350 km/h (217 mph) on some lines; and the Chinese CRH trains can reach up to 350 km/h (217 mph) on their dedicated high-speed lines. Speed limits on high-speed rail tracks are determined by factors such as the quality and maintenance of the track, signaling systems, and train design and capabilities. 4. Urban rapid transit and trams: Urban rapid transit systems like subways, light rail, and trams usually have lower speed limits than intercity trains. For instance, speed limits on many subway systems typically range from 50 km/h (31 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph), while for light rail or trams, the limits may vary from 30 km/h (19 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph), depending on the type of track and the environment they operate in. Ultimately, the speed limit for railways depends on a multitude of factors, such as train design, track conditions, signaling systems, and regional regulations, all of which influence the safe and efficient operation of railway networks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, I want to tell you something about a very good golfer named Mickelson. He plays a game called golf, where he hits a small ball with a stick, called a club, into a small hole very far away. Well, something surprising is happening! This year, Mickelson won't be playing in a big golf event called the FedEx Cup play-offs finale. This is the first time in his whole career that he won't be playing in this big event! Mickelson didn't do so well in a recent golf game, where he scored six-over-par 76. In golf, a lower number is better. This score left him in the seventh to last place among 68 players. It's like when we play a game, and sometimes we don't win, right?

Generate a detailed description of this data. Sentence:","output":"This data provides in-depth information about 10 Hygiea, an object in our solar system, as observed at a specific time frame known as an epoch, in this case, the date being June 27, 2015.  Hygiea, or more formally known as 10 Hygiea due to its status as the tenth minor planet in the Solar System to be discovered, is the fourth-largest asteroid in the Asteroid Belt and a potentially fascinating subject of astronomical study. In regards to its movement around the sun, 10 Hygiea has an orbital period of 5.57 days. The orbital period is essentially the time that it takes for any celestial body, such as planets, asteroids, or comets, to complete one full orbit around its primary star, which in Hygiea's case is the Sun. An orbital period of 5.57 days means that 10 Hygiea completes one full orbit around the Sun in that time frame. The data also provides information about the escape velocity of 10 Hygiea, which stands at 0.21 kilometres per second. The escape velocity is basically the minimum velocity an object must have in order to escape the gravitational influence of a particular planet or other body. In simpler terms, if a rocket or any other object were to leave 10 Hygiea and to not fall back, it would need to travel at least at a speed of 0.21 kilometres per second. 10 Hygiea has a surface area of 837,080.744 square kilometres, akin to the surface area of a country on Earth, making it one of the larger bodies in the asteroid belt. The term 'apoapsis' refers to the point of greatest distance from the center of a celestial body's orbit around its orbiting body. For 10 Hygiea, the apoapsis is approximately 523,951,582.33968 kilometres. This means that at its farthest orbital point, 10 Hygiea is over half a billion kilometres away from the Sun.  In summary, the provided data is a detailed astronomical profile of the asteroid 10 Hygiea, giving precise figures on its orbital period, escape velocity, surface area, and apoapsis. This information can be crucial to astronomers and scientists studying the properties and behaviour of different celestial bodies in our solar system. It helps in understanding not only the specific characteristics and conditions of 10 Hygiea itself, but also provides wider insights about the asteroid belt and our solar system's dynamics as a whole."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: On a day it celebrated 50 years of giving free legal advice, Southern Arizona Legal Aid announced it has received two grants totaling more than 7 million. One of the grants includes the creation of a Web site with legal advice for the poor. A three-year grant worth 6.6 million and a separate technology grant were announced at a press conference and dinner held Thursday at Evo. A. DeConcini Federal Courthouse, 405 W. Congress St. Deconcini was one of the organization's early board members. Thursday's celebration was the first public even held at the courthouse. About 100 members of the legal community attended, including state Attorney General Janet Napolitano and Arizona Supreme Court Justice Thomas Zlaket. Both grants come from the Legal Services., a private, nonprofit corporation established by Congress in 1974 to offer poor people equal access to the justice system. It's funded through congressional appropriation. The 6.6 million grant will pay for staffing operations. The Web site, which will be created with a 50,000 grant, is intended to offer legal advice to poor people across Arizona, said Paul Julian, chief executive officer of Southern Arizona Legal Aid. He said he wants every poor person in Arizona to have legal help. \\"This is another step in trying to realize that. We feel like we do a pretty good job of helping people who find us,\\" Julian said. Julian said that though most people do not own computers, they can still access them at libraries, schools, and courthouses. He said the Web site will help bridge the \\"digital divide\\" that keeps the poor from using the Internet as a resource. Southern Arizona Legal Aid was founded in 1951 as the Legal Aid Society of the Pima County Bar Association. It offered free legal advice on civil matters including disputes in small claims court, divorce proceedings and obtaining Social Security benefits.

Incorrect Product Delivered: The reviewer highlights that they have ordered the product three times and each time, they have received the wrong product (T603 instead of T605). This indicates that the seller might have a consistent issue with their inventory management and delivery process that could affect my order too. 2. Lack of A2DP streaming: The primary reason for the disappointment in the review is the absence of A2DP streaming in the delivered product. A2DP is an important feature for many customers who want to stream high-quality audio wirelessly. If this feature is not available in the product delivered, it would not meet my expectations and requirements, providing less value for the purchase. 3. Questionable Seller Intent: The reviewer suggests that the seller is shipping the wrong product \\"on purpose.\\" This raises concerns about the credibility and integrity of the seller. As a potential buyer, this claim would make me question the overall trustworthiness of the seller and consider looking for alternative products or sellers with more reliable reviews. 4. Return Process: Although the reviewer mentions that the return process was handled promptly, having to go through the hassle of returning a product multiple times is not ideal. It leads to wasted time, effort, and potential frustration, which are factors I would want to avoid when making a purchase. In summary, considering the issues highlighted in the review, including the wrong product being delivered and the lack of a required feature, the review would substantially decrease my chances of buying the product.

During his career just after World War I, he won 20 of 21 races and 249,465 (equal to 3,047,451 today) in purses. He was the unofficial 1920 American horse of the year and was honored with Babe Ruth as the outstanding athlete of the year by The New York Times. He was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in 1957. Man o' War was a chestnut horse with a white star and stripe on his forehead. He was foaled at Nursery Stud near Lexington, Kentucky. He was bred by August Belmont, Jr., whose father's accomplishments were recognized through the naming of the Belmont Stakes in 1867. Belmont Jr. was an equally notable horseman who served as the chairman of The Jockey Club from 1895 until his death in 1924. Belmont Park was named in the family's honor when it opened in 1905.  Man o' War was sired by Fair Play, a multiple stakes winner who finished second in the 1908 Belmont Stakes to the undefeated Colin. Man o' War was the second foal out of Mahubah, a lightly raced mare by English Triple Crown Champion Rock Sand. Not long after the colt was foaled on March 29, 1917, Belmont Jr. joined the United States Army at age 65 to serve in France during World War I. While he was overseas, his wife named the foal \\"Man o' War\\" in honor of her husband. Originally, the Belmonts intended to race Man o' War themselves. However, in the summer of 1918 with the ongoing war effort, they decided to liquidate their racing stable. At the Saratoga yearling sale, Man o' War was sold at a final bid of 5,000 (equivalent to 81,000 in 2017) to Samuel D. Riddle, who brought him to his Glen Riddle Farm near Berlin, Maryland. The underbidder at the auction was Robert L. Gerry, Sr., who is reported to have said to his wife, \\"Forty-five hundred is enough to spend for any yearling.\\" Two years later in 1920, Riddle declined an offer of 400,000 for the horse.  At maturity, Man o' War stood 16.2 1/2 hands (66.5 inches, 169 cm), with prominent withers and a high croup, but was sometimes faulted for a dipped back that grew more pronounced with age. He had virtually flawless legs and solid bone, traits he passed on to his offspring. He had a slightly Roman nose and notably high head carriage. His nickname was \\"Big Red\\", though his coat had tinges of yellow and gold. An energetic, spirited horse, he is often pictured standing very still and gazing off into the distance, described as the \\"look of eagles\\". His stride was measured at 28 feet, believed to be the longest of all time.

Charles Percy, a prominent Illinois Republican who served in the Senate for nearly 20 years and became chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, died Saturday, said a spokesman for Sen. Jay Rockefeller, a relative. He was 91. Percy, a one-time rising star in the Republican Party who was once considered a potential presidential candidate, was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1966 and served until 1985. His daughter, Sharon, the wife of Rockefeller (D-West Virginia), spoke publicly in 2009 of her father experiencing Alzheimer's disease. She made those remarks before the National Alzheimer's Association. Born in Florida and raised in Chicago's far north neighborhood of Rogers Park and the well-to-do suburb of Winnetka, Percy was regarded a business wunderkind who rose to become the president, CEO and board chairman of Bell & Howell, a manufacturer of made home-movie cameras and electronic consumer products. He became president at age 29. He was appointed as President Dwight Eisenhower's personal representative to presidential inaugurations in Peru and Bolivia with the rank of special ambassador in 1956. After an unsuccessful run for governor of Illinois in 1964, he successfully ran for the U.S. Senate two years later. While campaigning in 1966, Percy's other daughter, Valerie, Sharon's twin, was murdered at age 21 in the family's Kenilworth, Illinois, home, a crime that shocked Illinois and the nation. The murder is unsolved, but remains a vivid memory for many residents of Chicago and Illinois who knew Percy. While in the Senate, Percy emerged as an antagonist to President Richard Nixon, also a Republican, when Percy called for a special prosecutor to investigate Watergate, the political scandal that eventually culminated in Nixon's resignation. Percy considered running for the 1976 presidential nomination, but he backed off after Nixon resigned in 1974 and after Vice President Gerald Ford became the new president and decided to seek the 1976 nomination himself. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Former U.S. Senator Charles Percy was a celebrated figure in Illinois and a key member of the Republican party who served in the Senate from 1966 to 1985. Although he was once considered a potential presidential candidate, circumstances led him to back out of the race. Percy's political journey began with him taking on the role of President Dwight Eisenhower's personal representative to presidential inaugurations in Peru and Bolivia as a special ambassador in 1956. Before his political career, Percy, considered a business prodigy, was appointed president of Bell & Howell, a company manufacturing consumer electronic products and home-movie cameras, at the young age of 29. Born in Florida and brought up in Chicago's Rogers Park neighborhood and the affluent suburb of Winnetka, Percy demonstrated his exceptional skills and talents from an early age. His political journey wasn't without dramatic moments though. In 1964, Percy's first run for governor of Illinois ended unsuccessfully, but he learned from the experience and successfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 1966. However, his campaign was overshadowed by a tragedy that struck his family prematurely. Percy's 21-year-old daughter, Valerie, was murdered in their family home, a crime that remains unsolved. The incident shocked Illinois and the entire country, leaving a vivid memory in the minds of those who knew Percy. Despite the personal tragedy, Percy continued his political journey in the Senate. He made a significant stand against President Richard Nixon, a member of his own party, calling for a special prosecutor to investigate the Watergate scandal. This controversy played a significant role in Nixon's eventual resignation from presidential office. In 1974, after Nixon's resignation, Vice President Gerald Ford assumed presidency and Percy considered running for the 1976 Presidential nomination. However, when Ford decided to seek the nomination himself, Percy decided to hold off from further competitive political pursuits.  Percy’s daughter, Sharon, made the revelation in 2009 that he had been struggling with Alzheimer's disease. He passed away in 2011 at age 91, leaving a remarkable legacy in public service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

News article: US military admits it mistakenly targeted and killed loyalist Syrian forces The US military has formally admitted fault in a major September airstrike in eastern Syria that killed at least 15 fighters loyal to the regime of dictator Bashar al-Assad. US Central Command (Centcom), which both conducted and investigated the 17 September strike, said the attack stemmed from a “good faith” mistake that led targeters to believe the Syrian fighters, whom Centcom said did not wear uniforms, were Islamic State (Isis) militants. British, Australian and Danish warplanes also participated in the attack and released their weapons on the mistaken target, according to US air force Brig Gen Richard Coe, the investigating officer. Coe stopped short of apologizing to the Syrian government, saying such a statement was beyond the purview of his six-week investigation. The strikes occurred in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, where the US bombs Isis fighters and positions almost every day, and where known regime loyalists are relatively few. Due to the lack of observable insignia, Centcom would not say definitively that it had killed Syrian soldiers. “We made an unintentional, regrettable error, based on several factors in the targeting process,” Coe told reporters on Tuesday, who said he found “no intent to target Syrian [government] forces”. Coe’s investigators were unable to access the scene of the strike, a few kilometers north of the Deir ez-Zor airfield, and the Russian military – which is supporting Assad’s campaign against Isis and rebel opposition forces – did not participate in the inquiry. An initial report on the incident by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights suggested that 83 people had been killed. Coe said that on the basis of contemporaneous video evidence and interviews, he could only definitively determine 15 dead regime loyalists, but added that the death toll was likely to be higher. Soon after the incident on 17 September, Centcom said that it had halted airstrikes in progress in Deir ez-Zor after speaking to Russian officials on a channel established to deconflict the two countries’ air campaigns over Syria. In that conversation, the Russians informed their US counterparts that the targets of the strike were probably “part of the Syrian military”. The conversation turned out to be crucial. A US military officer misidentified the coordinates of the targeted area, and presumed from the lack of Russian objection that there was no problem with the intended strike. But Centcom said on Tuesday that the Russians made a “critical delay” before informing the US of the mistake, waiting 27 minutes for a “familiar US counterpart” to be reached. During that time, 15 of the total 32 airstrikes occurred. Coe gave the Russians a measure of credit: “Without that call from the Russians, the strikes would have continued for longer than they did.” Coe described the planning process for the strike unfolding over at least two days with “multiple, multiple” shift changes “in different parts of the globe” contributing to human error. The intended strikes were substantial: warplanesand drones released 34 guided weapons and 380 rounds of 30mm ammunition on what Coe described as “defensive fighting positions, vehicles, tents, bed-down locations, tunnels and personnel”. The presence of a tank tipped at least one intelligence analyst to conclude that the target was not Isis, but Coe said the analyst’s assessment was neither widely distributed nor fully accurate, as earlier airstrikes against Isis had hit tanks commandeered from the Syrian regime. The tank appears to have convinced strike planners that they had located a major Isis target, and what began as a deliberate strike expanded, blurring targeting procedures, as officers and analysts became convinced they had a major target of opportunity in their crosshairs. “Constantly challenging our own conclusions in these processes is something we need to do every time,” Coe said. The admission of fault by the US military is the latest potential sign that the US under Donald Trump will acquiesce to a Syria under Assad’s rule. Since his election, speculation has mounted that Trump will drop Barack Obama’s calls for Assad to relinquish power. Trump has expressed respect for Assad’s patron, President Vladimir Putin of Russia, and portrayed US support for the anti-Assad opposition forces as a disaster. Earlier this month, Trump told the Wall Street Journal that “Syria is fighting Isis”, indicating a lack of appetite for the US to undermine the enemy of its enemy. Trump is unlikely to arm the Syrian opposition – a policy advocated by David Petraeus, whom Trump is considering for secretary of state – because “we have no idea who these people are”. He acknowledged to the paper: “I’ve had an opposite view of many people regarding Syria.” Assad has sounded cautiously enthusiastic since Trump’s victory, describing the president-elect as “a natural ally” to Portuguese television. The US admission of error comes as Assad, backed by the Russian air force, is poised for a critical victory in the northern city of Aleppo, a former center of manufacturing that years of war have turned into a graveyard. Tens of thousands of civilians are fleeing Aleppo in advance of a final bombardment that Russian leaflets reportedly describe as a pending “annihilation”. Coe’s investigation also provided a new level of detail into the US-Russian “deconfliction” channel, established last year after the Russian air force entered the war on Assad’s behalf. During the 17 September conversation with the Russians, the US delivered highly precise but ultimately mistaken coordinates for the intended attack, as an analyst miscommunicated. Coe said it was the “first time” that the US had called the Russians in advance of a strike with such precise location information. “We would have a large number of aircraft operating in that small airspace for an extended period of time and we wanted to obviously notify the Russians so they’d be aware of our activities there,” Coe said. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The US military has admitted responsibility for an airstrike in eastern Syria in September that killed at least 15 Syrian fighters loyal to the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Although the US Central Command (Centcom) stated that the attack was based on a “good faith” mistake that led planners to think the targeted fighters were ISIS militants, the admission serves as further evidence that the Trump administration could be prepared to accept Assad's continued rule of Syria. The strikes occurred in the eastern province of Deir ez-Zor, where US forces had noted the presence of relatively few regime loyalists.⟩"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What country backed the Karposh's Rebellion in 1689? ?  The Ottomans were employed as mercenaries by the Byzantines in the 1340s but later became invaders in their own right. Sultan Murad I took Adrianople from the Byzantines in 1362; Sofia fell in 1382, followed by Shumen in 1388. The Ottomans completed their conquest of Bulgarian lands in 1393 when Tarnovo was sacked after a three-month siege and the Battle of Nicopolis which brought about the fall of the Vidin Tsardom in 1396. Sozopol was the last Bulgarian settlement to fall, in 1453. The Bulgarian nobility was subsequently eliminated and the peasantry was enserfed to Ottoman masters, while much of the educated clergy fled to other countries.Christians were considered an inferior class of people under the Ottoman system. Bulgarians were subjected to heavy taxes (including devshirme, or blood tax), their culture was suppressed, and they experienced partial Islamisation. Ottoman authorities established a religious administrative community called the Rum Millet, which governed all Orthodox Christians regardless of their ethnicity. Most of the local population then gradually lost its distinct national consciousness, identifying only by its faith. The clergy remaining in some isolated monasteries kept their ethnic identity alive, enabling its survival in remote rural areas, and in the militant Catholic community in the northwest of the country.As Ottoman power began to wane, Habsburg Austria and Russia saw Bulgarian Christians as potential allies. The Austrians first backed an uprising in Tarnovo in 1598, then a second one in 1686, the Chiprovtsi Uprising in 1688 and finally Karposh's Rebellion in 1689. The Russian Empire also asserted itself as a protector of Christians in Ottoman lands with the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774. The Western European Enlightenment in the 18th century influenced the initiation of a national awakening of Bulgaria. It restored national consciousness and provided an ideological basis for the liberation struggle, resulting in the 1876 April Uprising. Up to 30,000 Bulgarians were killed...

According to the most recent data from the Census of India, around 25% of Indians speak Dravidian languages.  In delivering this response, I am assuming that the user wants to know the percentage of Dravidian language speakers in India because the statistics about Indo-Aryan language speakers were presented in the question. I am basing this data around recent census information, which provides a highly accurate representation of current language distribution in India."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Title: Useful, but Needs Improvement Review: I recently downloaded the org.mysociety.FixMyStreet app, and I must say, the concept behind it is genuinely great. The idea of being able to report local issues like potholes, broken streetlights, and other problems directly to the council seems like a game-changer. However, there are a few issues with the app that prevent me from giving it a higher rating.  Firstly, the user interface could use a good redesign. The navigation can be a bit confusing at times, and the overall look seems a bit outdated. Step-by-step guidance on how to report an issue to the council is needed to help users avoid any unnecessary confusion. A more modern and simplified interface would make the app more user-friendly and visually appealing. Secondly, the app can be a bit slow to load information, especially while using location services to find nearby issues. In the age of fast internet and instant gratification, users are more likely to give up on an app that doesn't provide quick results. Optimizing the app's performance would make the user experience much smoother. Lastly, there is a noticeable lack of communication from the council regarding the status of reported issues. An update system, where users receive notifications about the progress of their reports, would be a great addition to the app, giving users a sense of accomplishment and confidence in the app's impact. In conclusion, the org.mysociety.FixMyStreet app is a useful tool that empowers citizens to report and fix issues in their local communities. However, some improvements are needed to make it more user-friendly, fast, and efficient. Right now, I would rate the app three stars out of five, but I believe it has the potential to reach five stars with these suggested enhancements."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: President Obama has ordered a top-to-bottom review of how the U.S. government tries to win the release of Americans held hostage by terrorist groups overseas, The Daily Beast has learned. The review, which will include a specific emphasis on how the U.S. treats hostages’ family members, follows criticism that current hostage-negotiation operations are plagued by bureaucratic infighting and a lack of leadership, particularly by the White House.      The review was prompted “as a result of the increased frequency of hostage-taking of Americans overseas,” Christine Wormuth, the undersecretary of Defense for policy and one of the Pentagon’s most senior officials, informed Rep. Duncan Hunter (R-CA) in a letter last week (PDF). Hunter sits on the House Armed Services Committee and has been pressing the administration to do more to free Americans held by ISIS and other terrorist groups. Wormuth said the president had ordered the review “recently,” but she didn’t specify when.      On Sunday, ISIS released its latest video showing the beheading of one of its American captives, Peter Kassig. The group is holding one more American, a 26-year-old woman who was kidnapped in Syria last year while delivering aid to Syrians affected by the country’s civil war. The brutal series of beheading videos has been a persistent reminder that the U.S. faces an implacable enemy, even as it steps up airstrikes on ISIS positions in Syria and Iraq. President Obama took heat for playing a round of golf on Martha’s Vineyard after the first video showing the beheading of journalist James Foley aired in August.      Wormuth said the review will include a “specific emphasis on examining family engagement, intelligence collection, and diplomatic engagement policies.” The emphasis on the families of hostages is particularly noteworthy; the parents of Americans murdered by ISIS have criticized the White House for threatening them with potential criminal prosecution if they were to pay a ransom.      Family members have also complained that the administration didn’t follow up on leads that they provided about where ISIS might be holding the Americans. Several groups of parents have banded together in efforts to locate their children but say they’ve run up against a wall at the White House. Foley’s parents reportedly told Obama in a phone call after their son was shown murdered that the government had “failed” him by not trying harder to win his freedom. It was during that phone call that Obama told the Foleys an earlier mission by the military had failed to extract the hostages from Syria.      While not overtly acknowledging the complaints of family members and critics of the U.S. bureaucracy, Wormuth said the review would seek to “improve interagency coordination and strengthen the whole of government approach,” code for putting a stop to turf wars and getting the various corners of the government on the same page. Recent efforts to free ISIS prisoners have put the White House and the State Department at odds with the FBI, which has long sought more creative ways for getting Americans out of terrorists’ clutches, including facilitating ransom payments.      Wormuth replied to Hunter after an earlier letter in which he urged the president to put someone in charge of all the government’s efforts to free Americans. In the letter, sent after the video of Foley’s beheading appeared, Hunter said he was “very concerned” that the government is not “adequately pursuing and exhausting opportunities” to bring Americans home.      “The administration’s goal has always been to use every appropriate resource within the bounds of the law to assist families to bring their loved ones home. In light of the increasing number of U.S. citizens taken hostage by terrorist groups overseas and the extraordinary nature of recent hostage cases, this summer President Obama directed relevant departments and agencies, including the Departments of Defense and State, the FBI, and the intelligence community, to conduct a comprehensive review of how the U.S. government addresses these matters,” said Alistair Baskey, a spokesman for the National Security Council. “While we are not in a position to detail every effort or every tool we are using to try to bring American hostages home, we will continue to bring all appropriate military, intelligence, law enforcement, and diplomatic capabilities to bear to recover American hostages. Those efforts continue every day.” ||||| WASHINGTON—The Obama administration is undertaking a review of how it handles cases of U.S. citizens held captive by extremists abroad, according to a letter from a top Pentagon official made public Monday, a move that follows criticism from some relatives of slain Americans.      The review, according to the Pentagon letter, is designed to improve interagency coordination in hostage cases and will examine intelligence-collection efforts... |||||Summary:","output":"President Obama has asked for a complete check of how the U.S. government tries to free Americans who are captured by bad people in other countries. This is because some people have said that the current ways of talking to get the hostages free have problems and lack direction. This became important because more Americans are being captured in other countries. President Obama wants to focus on how the U.S. helps the families of these hostages too. For instance, the families who have lost their loved ones to a really bad group called ISIS have said that the U.S. government didn't help them enough when they tried to find and free their children. President Obama wants all parts of the government to work together better to free Americans who are captured."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.

Question: \\"Excerpts of this work by Strauss are often used commercially.\\"  Context: \\"Certain staples of classical music are often used commercially (either in advertising or in movie soundtracks). In television commercials, several passages have become clichéd, particularly the opening of Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra (made famous in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey) and the opening section \\"O Fortuna\\" of Carl Orff's Carmina Burana, often used in the horror genre; other examples include the Dies Irae from the Verdi Requiem, Edvard Grieg's In the Hall of the Mountain King from Peer Gynt, the opening bars of Beethoven's Symphony No. 5, Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries from Die Walküre, Rimsky-Korsakov's Flight of the Bumblebee, and excerpts of Aaron Copland's Rodeo.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra, a tone poem composed in 1896, has indeed been prominently featured in various commercial settings. As mentioned in the context provided, the piece owes much of its fame to its appearance in Stanley Kubrick's science fiction masterpiece 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968). The iconic opening fanfare, famously titled \\"Sunrise,\\" has become a symbol of grandeur and a harbinger of mighty revelations since its association with the portrayal of the dawn of man and the cosmic mysteries explored in the film. This association has led to the widespread commercial use of this particular excerpt from Strauss' work. The effectiveness of Also sprach Zarathustra in capturing the attention of audiences stems from its powerful and enigmatic musical themes. The opening fanfare features a bold C-G-C motif played by the brass section, punctuated by timpani and accompanied by a sustained low C on the organ. This pattern is contrasted with the serene, ascending melody played by the woodwind section, creating a sense of awe and wonder. As the piece progresses, the orchestration becomes even more lavish and colorful, and the musical themes are developed and transformed. The commercial appeal of Also sprach Zarathustra is further bolstered by the work's fascinating programmatic content. Strauss drew inspiration from Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical novel of the same name, in which the prophet Zarathustra proclaims the death of God and advocates for the creation of new values to upend conventional morality. The music evokes the spirit of this bold endeavor with its tumultuous dynamics and harmonies, reflecting both the triumph and tragedy of humankind's quest for meaning and enlightenment. In the world of advertising, the use of the opening fanfare from Also sprach Zarathustra has become almost a cliché, heard in numerous commercials to convey a sense of grand achievement or momentous discovery. For instance, it has been used by companies introducing revolutionary products or technologies, as well as by automotive manufacturers to underscore the power and luxury of their vehicles. The piece has also been featured in numerous film trailers, particularly for movies that aspire to epic or profound themes. Beyond commercials, the \\"Sunrise\\" fanfare and other excerpts from Also sprach Zarathustra can be found in various forms of popular culture, such as television, film, and sporting events. In these contexts, the music serves a similar function, drawing upon its inherent sense of majesty and awe, as well as its associations with revolutionary breakthroughs and transcendental experiences. In conclusion, the enduring appeal and success of Richard Strauss' Also sprach Zarathustra in commercial settings can be attributed to a combination of its powerful musical language, its provocative programmatic content, and its established cultural associations with the exploration of unknown frontiers and the unfolding of cosmic mysteries."},{"instruction":"Q: I heard that Jesse produced Austin's result successfully.

When an alarm is tripped, the Jester sacrifices himself to allow Luthor to escape and kills J'edd J'arkus and Angelique (alternate versions of Martian Manhunter and Hawkgirl respectively) with a bomb. Luthor is nearly captured by the remaining Syndicate members (Ultraman, Superwoman, Power Ring, Johnny Quick and Owlman) but escapes to the Earth of the heroic Justice League by activating a dimensional travel device. Luthor locates a police station but is mistaken for the evil Luthor. The Justice League is summoned and Superman's x-ray vision confirms Luthor's reversed organs indicate that he is from a parallel Earth and that the evil Luthor is still incarcerated at Stryker's Island. The Justice League take the alternate Luthor to the Watchtower, where they learn of the Syndicate threat. As the Justice League debates the matter, Luthor hides the Quantum Trigger on the satellite. With the exception of Batman, the rest of the Justice League (Superman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Flash and Martian Manhunter) travel to Luthor's Earth.

Ask them what goth means today, and you get an answer much like black-clad kids have been giving for the past — wow, nearly 40 years. Goth is realism, says Martin Willis, 23, who is wearing a black leather jacket and black lipstick, and whose green eyes are rimmed for an undead look. “I see how the world is, and I just want to cry to no end,” he says. Goth is remarkably hardy, a subculture that’s established itself as a kind of permanent Other, the dark yin to our country’s relentlessly optimistic yang. After its emergence in the late 1970s, its ethos of despair and decay traveled around the world, colonizing places as diverse as Germany, Mexico and Japan, and setting up permanent camp in the United States, where the question of “what is goth?” has lately become fraught. Or maybe it always was. For example: Is Kylie Jenner goth? Journalists have casually tagged the Kardashian sibling as such, now that she is hawking black lipsticks in shades called “Dead of Knight” and “Kymajesty Metal Matte.” This is the sort of thing that sends actual goths into fits of apocalyptic frenzy, since they consider their subculture so much more than a fleeting summer beauty look. Indeed, the idea of mainstream absorption is regarded as a kind of existential threat by many goths, who as a result tend to be Talmudically precise about what they are, and what they aren’t. “I blame Hot Topic,” says Janice Mallardi, Willis’s sister, who at 25, married and with a kid, has aged out of calling herself goth but still seems to carry it in her heart. “There’s a serious dilution of what had been traditional goth culture,” says her husband, Malcolm, 36. “Like the classic vampire film! The ‘Twilight’ films have kind of killed the classics for me.” If you ask a goth academic — because of course there are goth academics — it’s this constant process of questioning and defining that keeps the subculture vibrant. On this, the third and final night of the Cure’s sold-out Madison Square Garden run, there are many people wearing their inner darkness for all to see. There’s a mother-and-daughter punk-goth pair (the daughter has epic black eye makeup and feels a strong emotional connection to bats), and there’s a guy in a Kylo Ren costume — the dark side of the Force, you know. There are also plenty of normals, because plenty of kinds of people enjoy the Cure’s music, which ranges from gloomy to eerily atmospheric to playful pop. God willing, there will always be kids like Martin Willis, who considers himself an anarchist, and a bit of a nihilist, who finds wandering old graveyards comforting, and describes Marilyn Manson songs as “cheery” because they prove he’s not alone in his melancholy. There’s something about goth that feels like a necessary critique of Americanness, no less urgent for being in middle age. “I think ‘normal’ is a fad that should go away, honestly,” Willis says. After nearly four decades, goth lumbers on, zombielike in its relentless opposition to whatever counts as mainstream at the moment. The gothic rock sound, as the press and music insiders termed it, emerged in late-1970s Britain, giving rise to the post-punk subculture that became known as goth. It drew on a “discordant bricolage of hyperromantic elements,” as the scholarly text “Goth: Undead Subculture” puts it: vampires, Mary Shelley, Nosferatu, druids, pagans, Bettie Page, absinthe-fueled readings of Edward Gorey and so on. It served as a door into cultural subversion and also as a refuge for intellectuals and depressives, outcasts and downcasts, the quiet and misunderstood. Kids alienated from football-and-cheerleader culture found solace in goth; kids who liked old poetry and old tombstones; kids who loved Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and Bauhaus. As goths, they could band together and eschew their mundane given names for something like Drusilla or Hades. The ’80s and ’90s were a good time for goth, until, with the Columbine school shootings, they weren’t. Some media reports claimed the two shooters were obsessed with the subculture, and goths were put on the defensive, forced to explain that their love of moody music and Doc Martens had nothing whatsoever to do with homicidal atrocities. There’s still the occasional scare, such as when a group of “men dressed in black” walking along a Muscatine County, Iowa, roadside triggered a police report. But the public image has softened; a 2004 Edmonton Journal headline proclaimed the finding that “Goth subculture of outcasts surprisingly gentle, polite.” (“Bizarre dress,” the headline went on to explain, is merely a “welcoming signal to like-minded.”) Other music-based subcultures have flashed and faded — grunge, mods, Teddy boys, hair metal — but goth persists, despite the fact that the bands most associated with it made their names decades ago. The scene has spawned a ton of subtypes, including trad goths, vamp goths, rivetheads, romantigoths, cyber goths, nu goths, gothic Lolitas (they started in Japan, naturally) and corp goths (for those who grew up and became paralegals). As “Goth: Undead Subculture” points out, the goth look can mean chunky boots or high-heeled ones, cravats or riding crops or top hats, piercings, whiteface, fangs . . . all for a look that “may evoke high chic, antique, retro-kitsch, punk, fetish, second-hand trash,” or something else altogether. Goth expert Liisa Ladouceur wrote an entire “Encyclopedia Gothica” in an attempt to answer the question of what goth is. (Short answer: It’s complicated.) Lee Meadows, who is known as DJ Cruel Brittania, says the Internet saved goth, just when it should have logically gone extinct. Dispersed online, it became a refuge for all the sad kids of the world who felt that no one in their small towns understood them. In 2009, Meadows co-founded World Goth Day, and now Mexico and Brazil — those sunny, happy places — are among the most avid participants; festivals in England and Germany draw thousands as well. In the United States, the scene appears to be steady, neither growing nor shrinking. Some goths age out; young’uns come along. Between 6,000 and 7,000 people this year attended Bats Day in the Fun Park, an annual goth convention that takes place in and around Disneyland. In Denver, there was recently a “goth prom” that drew 500 people, with a special appearance by enthusiasts of the Denver Hearse Association. In D.C., a monthly dance party known as the Coven and designed for queer “witchy” women, attracts 300 people every month. Goth girls still seek goth guys on Craigslist. Goth seems to stay in people’s souls, even when they grow up and get jobs and have kids and stop dressing quite as outrageously as they once did. It is an outlook, a refuge, a dark corner made friendly by the presence of others. Hence: elder goths. “They told me it was too hot today to wear all black and I said, ‘Screw ’em,’ ” says Judy Miller Silverman, a music publicist who turned goth as an ’80s teenager and once scandalized her Jewish mother by wearing a cross (goths love crosses), and recently tweeted out her joy at the introduction of the new black heart emoji. The identity has such enduring appeal to those who see themselves as lifers that it has spawned not one, but two goth-themed cruises. One of them, called GothCruise, is celebrating its 13th year with a trip to Maine, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The theme: “Disasters and Apocalypses.” And now, goth is enduring another crossover moment. The fashion magazine Nylon reports that “goth style is more mainstream than ever” — Katy Perry, the Olsen twins and all your favorite celebs are wearing it! “Gothic glamour” was on display at runway shows by Marc Jacobs and Rodarte, and in the collaboration between Rihanna and Puma. Kylie Jenner is pushing those black lipsticks while older sister Kendall recently starred in a dystopian fashion shoot with Marilyn Manson, who is himself having a mini-moment. (He’s due to appear in the third season of “Salem,” as a bloodletting barber/surgeon, naturally.) According to celebrity chroniclers, Taylor Swift was for a time channeling her “inner goth” — a notion that is like matter meeting antimatter and the universe exploding. “We’re certainly in a phase where people do wear black lipstick,” says Ladouceur, who recently released a delightful short video called “Forty Years of Goth Style.” “I’m not sure why. We wear it to be unpretty. . . . It’s fascinating to me when pretty people start to wear our weird stuff.” Other things Ladouceur and her friends like to wear: Corsets. Fishnets. Platform heels. Fascinators. Parasols. Various items made of rubber. “If you’re going to go out in August wearing a velvet cape you can’t be upset when people stare,” Ladouceur says. “The average person would never go out wearing the stuff that me and my friends wear. They would feel ridiculous. And I love that. It takes a commitment.” Perhaps all this fashionable darkness is linked to a gloomy strain that’s been bubbling up in our culture. The science of death is big right now, as are mortality-themed gatherings such as Death Cafes. Last year, New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art had an exhibit on the last century of mourning attire. The Cure’s North American tour has absolutely blown up. The poet Melissa Broder, who tweets her dark humor to 367,000 followers under @SoSadToday, has a new book of personal essays. (Sample: “I’m not emotionally dead I just want to be.” And: “bringing another person into this world isn’t very nice of you.”) Lynne Zacek Bassett, who curated the recent show “Gothic to Goth: Romantic Era Fashion & Its Legacy” at the Wadsworth Atheneum Museum of Art in Hartford, Conn., says that both goth and retrofuturistic steampunk — which offers a mock Victorian vision of sci-fi, complete with bustles, brass goggles and world-touring dirigibles — trace their roots to the romantic era of the first half of the 19th century, which was itself an idealization of a rural past that emerged during the Sturm und Drang of the Industrial Revolution. Bassett argues that this kind of looking back crops up during times of social and economic anxiety. But what will hopefully save goth is that there’s a limit to how mainstream it can become. Its unprettiness is transgressive, as is the confusing way it mixes sexiness and decay. Goth’s androgyny, its embrace of eyelinered men in long skirts, isn’t easily appropriated by a masculinized culture, argues Michael Bibby, an English professor at Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania who co-edited “Goth: Undead Subculture,” and its music isn’t easily used in commercials — how do you sell something as downbeat as death? It functions as both a way of life and as an artful pose, a critique of ­“happy-happy culture,” as Bibby calls it. If it makes normals uncomfortable, that’s the point. Perhaps we always needed goth. Perhaps we always had it. “Before people started calling themselves goth, there were goths,” says Bob Westphal, who runs the aforementioned GothCruise. “Where did the Addams Family come from? Where did the Munsters come from? Where did dark humor come from? Could that retroactively be called goth? Has goth always existed?” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about the enduring appeal of the goth subculture, which is about 40 years old now. The goth style has more mainstream appeal than ever before, with celebrities like Katy Perry and the Olsen twins embracing the dark look. The goth subculture started in the late 1970s and has an ethos of despair and decay. Its unprettiness and transgressive nature make it less likely to be fully absorbed by the mainstream, keeping its unique identity.

Some species of wood-decay fungi attack dead wood, such as brown rot, and some, such as Armillaria (honey fungus), are parasitic and colonize living trees. Excessive moisture above the fibre saturation point in wood is required for fungal colonization and proliferation.[1] Fungi that not only grow on wood but permeate its fibrous structure and actually cause decay, are called lignicolous fungi. In nature, this process causes the breakdown of complex molecules and leads to the return of nutrients to the soil.[2] Various lignicolous fungi consume wood in various ways; for example, some attack the carbohydrates in wood and some others decay lignin. The rate of decay of wooden materials in various climates can be estimated by empirical models.[3]  The mycologist wanted to move to a rural area, to further his research, and found these two villages situated 10 miles from each other. The interesting fact about these villages was that while both villages had a forest nearby, one presented more signs of water saturation than the other, so that the rate of decay in wood was greater in Peak Forest. More fungi were present in Peak Forest. The Valley Forest was dryer, although the rain amounts were similar, partially because of a drainage system composed of ditches, that were dug by the locals. The rate of wood decay continued to increase in the Peak Forest, while being significantly reduced in the Valley Forest.  Which forest will have more wood-decay fungi? Answer:","output":"The Peak Forest will have more wood-decay fungi, as it has more signs of water saturation, leading to a greater rate of decay in wood and the presence of more fungi in comparison to the Valley Forest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Who stole the footage? Movie title: The China Syndrome Movie plot: While visiting the (fictional) Ventana nuclear power plant outside Los Angeles, television news reporter Kimberly Wells (Fonda), her cameraman Richard Adams (Douglas) and their soundman Hector Salas witness the plant going through an emergency shutdown (SCRAM). Shift Supervisor Jack Godell (Lemmon) notices an unusual vibration while grabbing his cup of coffee which he had set down. He then finds that a gauge is misreading and that the coolant is dangerously low (he thought it was overflowing). The crew manages to bring the reactor under control and can be seen celebrating and expressing relief. Richard surreptitiously films the incident, despite being requested to not film the control room for security purposes. Kimberly's superior at work (Donat) refuses to permit her to report what happened or show the film, disgusting Richard, who steals the footage. He shows it to experts, who conclude that the plant came perilously close to the China Syndrome in which the core would have melted down into the earth, hitting groundwater and contaminating the surrounding area with radioactive steam. During an inspection of the plant before it is brought back online, Godell discovers a puddle of radioactive water that has apparently leaked from a pump. Godell pushes to delay restarting the plant, but the plant superintendent denies his request and appears willing to let nothing stand in the way of the scheduled restart of the plant. Godell investigates further and finds that a series of radiographs supposedly taken to verify the integrity of welds on the leaking pump are identical - the contractor simply kept submitting the same picture. He believes that the plant is unsafe and could be severely damaged if another full-power SCRAM occurs. He tries to bring the evidence to plant manager Herman DeYoung (Brady), who brushes off Godell as paranoid and states that new radiographs would cost at least 20 million. Godell confronts D.B. Royce, an employee of Foster-Sullivan, the construction company who built the plant, as it was...

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Given the following context:  From 1916, Nielsen taught at the Royal Academy where he became director in 1931, shortly before his death. He also had private students in his earlier days in order to supplement his income. As a result of his teaching, Nielsen has exerted considerable influence on classical music in Denmark. Among his most successful pupils were the composers Thorvald Aagaard, remembered in particular for his songs, Harald Agersnap, both a conductor and orchestral composer, and Jørgen Bentzon who composed choral and chamber music mainly for his folk music school (Københavns Folkemusikskole). Among his other students were the musicologist Knud Jeppesen, the pianist Herman Koppel, the academy professor and symphony composer Poul Schierbeck, the organist Emilius Bangert who played at Roskilde Cathedral, and Nancy Dalberg, one of Nielsen's private students who helped with the orchestration of Aladdin. Nielsen also instructed the conductor and choirmaster Mogens Wöldike, remembered for his interpretations of Baroque music, and Rudolph Simonsen, the pianist and composer who became director of the Academy after Nielsen's death.The Carl Nielsen Society maintains a listing of performances of Nielsen's works, classified by region (Denmark, Scandinavia, Europe apart from Scandinavia and outside Europe) which demonstrates that his music is regularly performed throughout the world. The concerti and symphonies feature frequently in these listings. The Carl Nielsen International Competition commenced in the 1970s under the auspices of the Odense Symphony Orchestra. A four-yearly violin competition has been held there since 1980. Flute and clarinet competitions were later added, but these have now been discontinued.

Background: Titas (Portuguese pronunciation: [tSi'tas]) are a rock band from Sao Paulo, Brazil. Though they basically play pop/alternative rock, their music has touched a number of other styles throughout their 30-year career, such as new wave, punk rock, grunge, MPB and electronic music. They are one of the most successful rock bands in Brazil, having sold more than 6,3 million albums as of 2005 and having been covered by several well-known Brazilian artists and a couple of international singers. They were awarded a Latin Grammy in 2009 and have won the Imprensa Trophy for Best Band a record four times. Context: On February 12, 2010, Titas announced in their official website that drummer Charles Gavin would leave the band for personal reasons. Gavin later stated that he was physically and mentally exhausted because of the tours and album releases. The quartet continued their performances of the Sacos Plasticos tour with drummer Mario Fabre, who is still with the band as of 2018, though not as an official member. Fabre was suggested by Gavin himself. When asked about the status of Fabre in the band, Bellotto explained that \\"he is the official drummer! He's the drummer of Titas! But he isn't one of Titas, because our history began long ago, at Greek mythology... \\"  During an interview, keyboardist Sergio Britto said the band was planning to start recording a new album in 2011. Nothing else was said since then, until March 2013, when they revealed they were starting to work on a new album, to be released in the second half of 2013. The album would be self-produced, and, according to Britto, it would be \\"a mixture between Cabeca Dinossauro and O Blesq Blom.  In January 2012, the band announced a live performance in company of ex-members Arnaldo Antunes, Nando Reis and Charles Gavin.

Understand the sentence: The given sentence states that Adam needs to avoid someone named Kenneth for the sake of his psychological health. It implies that there is something about Kenneth that threatens Adam's mental well-being. 2. Evaluate each option:      (A). Adam was very vulnerable.     (B). Kenneth was very vulnerable. Option (A) suggests that Adam's psychological health could be under threat due to his own vulnerability. This makes sense in the context of the first part of the sentence and provides a reason for why Adam might need to distance himself from Kenneth. Option (B) suggests that Kenneth was the vulnerable one. However, this does not logically explain why Adam needs to avoid Kenneth for the sake of his own psychological health. Between the two options, option (A) fits the sentence more logically because the sentence is setting up an explanation for why Adam needs to avoid Kenneth.

Answer based on context: Upper Austria had been rebellious for centuries, with 62 known uprisings between 1356 and 1849, 14 of which occurred in the 16th century. However, the Peasants' War of 1626 was the costliest in terms of human life and damage to livestock and property. The war caused Martin Aichinger to lose his farm and begin roaming the country. He eventually became a religious leader who led a popular revolt against aristocratic rule. His revolutionary ideas frightened the rulers so much that they tried to arrest him, leading to another series of uprisings that ended in the Battle on the Frankenberg  in 1636. All of Aichinger's followers were slaughtered during the battle, including the remaining women and children who had been in hiding. How many uprisings occurred outside of the 16th century?","output":"In order to determine how many uprisings occurred outside of the 16th century, we must first look at the total number of known uprisings, which is 62. Since there were 14 uprisings in the 16th century, we need to subtract that number from the total uprisings. 62 uprisings (total) - 14 uprisings (16th century) = 48 uprisings Thus, there were 48 uprisings in Upper Austria outside of the 16th century between 1356 and 1849."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: Where is a good place to keep many a pencil?

Tämä päätös on herättänyt paljon kohua ja kiistoja ympäri maailmaa, ja Vilvoorden tapaus on lisännyt siihen entisestään. Teollisuudenalalla tehdassulkemiset ovat valitettavan yleisiä, mutta jokainen niistä tuo mukanaan omanlaisensa seuraukset niin työntekijöille, ympäröiville yhteisöille kuin koko taloudellekin. Vilvoorden tehdassulkeminen ei ole vain paikallinen ongelma, vaan se heijastaa laajempaa teollisuuden muutosta, jossa yritykset pyrkivät minimoimaan kustannuksia ja tehostamaan toimintaansa usein työpaikkojen menetyksen kustannuksella. Tämä taas johtaa taloudelliseen epätasa-arvoon ja sosiaalisiin ongelmiin, joihin yhteiskuntien tulee löytää kestäviä ratkaisuja. Myös globalisaatio ja teknologinen kehitys ovat osasyyllisiä tehtaiden sulkemisiin. Yritykset voivat siirtää tuotantolaitoksiaan maapallon toiselle puolelle, missä työvoimakustannukset ovat alhaisemmat ja säännöstely vähemmän tiukkaa. Samalla automaatio ja teknologinen kehitys voivat vähentää tarvetta inhimilliselle työvoimalle, mikä voi johtaa tehtaiden sulkemisiin ja irtisanomisiin. Vilvoorden tapaus on toki erityisen kohutuksi nousseen päätöksen takia noussut laajemman huomion kohteeksi. Tämä osoittaa, kuinka tärkeää on parantaa elinkeinorakenteita ja tarjota koulutusta sekä tukea työntekijöille uusien työmahdollisuuksien löytämiseksi.

Tulevaisuudessa tärkeintä olisi löytää tasapaino taloudellisen kasvun ja kestävän keikkansa välillä niin, että myös yhteiskunnan heikommassa asemassa olevien ryhmien etuja ja oikeuksia kunnioitetaan eikä työntekijöitä käytetä vain pelinappuloina yritysten voittojen maksimoinnissa. Vilvoorden tehtaan sulkeminen on jälleen yksi varoitusmerkki siitä, että muutosta tarvitaan ennen kuin tilanne käy kestämättömäksi."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water. This will usually lead to convection currents.[3]  Paragraph: Ryan explored two lakes; Big lake, and Arrow lake to the south.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who admires the Prime Minister? from the following article ?  In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles. Charles persuades the khedive to accept Myers' cheque in exchange for the shares, also proving his own worth to Clarissa.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Can Obama Escape the Alberta Tar Pit? President Obama is in a situation right now somewhat akin to that facing the creatures that once prowled the edges of the La Brea tar pits — a sticky trap that caught and consumed the least wary or agile members of many species. For Obama, the physical tar pit lies far away in northeastern Alberta province, Canada, but a rhetorical one surrounds him in Washington as the fight to shape his position on an oil pipeline draws toward a climax. He has a way out, but it’s a tricky path. Here’s the situation: Later this year Obama needs to decide if it is in the nation’s interest to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would be able to carry more than half a million barrels a day of a tarry oil precursor from Saudi-scale deposits in Alberta to American fuel refineries. (The administration’s approval is required because the pipeline crosses an international border.) There are signs that, despite impassioned opposition by environmentalists who were once important Obama allies, he will give the project the green light. Passion isn’t matched by response, in part, because environmental concerns cannot compete as an issue with persistent economic stagnation and joblessness. The most recent evidence was the White House decision Friday to hold off on tightening standards for air pollutants that form smog. The most visible protest on the pipeline plan has been a weeks-long demonstration outside the White House that culminated on Saturday. In the action, more than 1,200 campaigners, scientists (including NASA’s Jim Hansen), students and other concerned citizens — mainly brought there by the project’s climate impacts — sat down and waited for handcuffs: You can read reams of valuable context on the issues surrounding the Alberta resource and the pipeline in Foreign Policy (a particularly illuminating new tour of North American energy prospects by Charles Homans) The Times, The New Yorker, The Economist and more reams of blog and editorial commentary. (The Times editorial board has repeatedly criticized the pipeline plan.) I also encourage you to read analysis by the Canadian economist Andrew Leach for help in distinguishing hype from fact. My views are close to those of Michael Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations, who’s been providing analysis of the climate, security and economic issues since 2009 and who leans toward Obama approving the pipeline while pursuing energy and climate policies that would, in the end, render it insignificant and uneconomical. For me the pipeline, in isolation, is not in the national interest if we have any interest in not contributing, through our driving habits, to the despoliation of far-flung parts of the planet. This method of extracting petroleum leaves an unholy mess, even as conveyed by a libertarian writer like Ronald Bailey visiting the Alberta oil-sands mines on a junket paid for by oil companies. Consider his recent description of the vast amounts of residual material that persist for decades: Mature fine tailings are the big problem for oil sands extraction. They consist of a gel-like suspension of very fine clay, which for chemical reasons refuses to solidify in less than 30 years. Consequently, oil sands mines are surrounded by vast tailings ponds…. The ponds shimmer with a oily sheen since not all bitumen can be extracted from the sand. But that’s my stance on the project outside of broader contexts. Overall, I think Obama should not stand in the way of the pipeline. While it’s a potent symbol and convenient rallying point for campaigners, it’s a distraction from core issues and opportunities on energy and largely insignificant if your concern is averting a disruptive buildup of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The pipeline plan doesn’t exist in isolation. With the economy in its own tar pit and a presidential election approaching, it’s very much in the national interest for Obama to avoid saddling himself with an unnecessary issue that would be easy for his foes to distort into an Obama anti-jobs position. This particular pipeline has a good chance of dying on the vine in any case if and when easier, less expensive sources of transportation fuel come online, including domestic oil and natural gas (and there are competing pipeline options and routes). The greenhouse impact of the oil sands is also far less significant than some claims, particularly given the reality that oil consumption rates are what matters — not the amount of gigatons of carbon sitting in deposits of this sort in the ground. Environmentalists’ statements about the massive greenhouse impact from oil-sand carbon don’t mention that it would take a millennium or more, even at a breath-taking rate of extraction of, say, 5 million barrels a day, for that CO2 impact to be fully realized (as if no new energy options, or methods for sopping up CO2, will arise in the future), as pointed out by Andrew Leach last June: In the fight against climate change, every bit counts, but to make an argument that is based on a leverage ratio of somewhere between 90 and 500 times the actual damage caused by a particular project is not the right way to go about it…. [I]f you want deep cuts to [greenhouse gas] emissions, you need a broad-based policy, not a hopelessly leveraged argument against a single project. In my opinion, those are the arguments most likely to be ignored as alarmist. I think that Americans are eager for a serious American energy policy that could both erode the economics of this pipeline and marginalize the “drill baby drill” crowd as childish and irresponsible. If Obama cast all of this the right way, such a policy would incorporate the need for more domestic energy exploration and development (done responsibly) with a long-term plan that also stresses conservation, efficiency and innovation. These same issues arose when Obama faced the BP gusher in the Gulf. Read my 2010 post on “Obama’s Oil and Energy Opportunity” to get my view of a sustainable policy path. In an interview taped earlier this summer, I discussed some of the core issues related to oil sands on The Agenda, the Canadian public affairs program. The interview ran last week as part of a five-day package focused on global energy issues and opportunities: In a post on Friday, Michael Levi wrote of the limited significance of the Keystone XL pipeline and the primacy of policies that curb demand for oil: Slash oil demand and oil sands development goes away; keep oil demand on its current trajectory and we’ve got huge climate problems regardless of whether Keystone XL is approved. I agree completely. Levi, who has exposed overstatements on both sides of the polarized debate, sees the pipeline as meriting approval mainly because its impact on climate — whether approved or denied — would be minimal when placed in global context. Levi and I discussed the pipeline on Friday via Skype. Here are some highlights: One of his points in our chat was that a reduction in demand kills the economics that make such marginal and expensive sources of fuel remotely feasible: The goal of climate policy should be to reduce demand for fossil fuels and if we do that the oil sands will become superfluous. In an e-mail before our exchange, I asked him the core question facing Obama: Is the pipeline in the national interest. Here’s Levi’s reply: I’ve been studiously avoiding coming down one way or the other on the national interest issue, in part because I’m pretty ambivalent, but I guess it’s time to get off the fence. I think that approval is ultimately in the U.S. national interest, so long as U.S. regulators ensure that the pipeline is operated safely. I do not buy the argument that the pipeline would be a massive windfall for U.S. security. I also think that climate change needs to be taken seriously. That said, reducing emissions by blocking the pipeline would likely be far more costly (primarily in terms of higher world oil prices but also, potentially, in terms of reduced Bakken production) than almost any other emissions-cutting approach that serious people contemplate. Let’s focus on those other approaches. (Targeting oil sands production also has very limited potential, since total oil sands production emissions are a tiny fraction of total U.S. emissions.) There is no realistic scenario where the oil sands are the difference between success and failure in addressing climate change. [ACR: I added the Bakken link for context.] I recognize that Bill McKibben, Jim Hansen and others see this particular project as crossing their moral line in the (tar) sand. I respect their decision to pursue civil disobedience. But I haven’t joined them because — while I would love to see America and the world cut oil appetites – I see more promising routes to meaningful progress on that front. And once the appetite is cut, there is less pressure to push the limits of oil extraction, both toward dirty, hard-to-extract deposits like Alberta’s, the deep-sea bed, the Arctic and elsewhere. I also think Bryan Walsh and Michael Grunwald at Time Magazine are right in pointing out the perils that could come if environmental groups keep beating up on Obama. As Walsh wrote a week ago: If greens want to sit out the election and help a President Rick Perry or a President Michele Bachmann become a reality, go ahead. It might even feel good. But the consequences would be far, far, far worse than any single pipeline. In the meantime, the Tar Sands Action organizers are poised to announce phase two of their movement.","output":"President Obama faces a critical decision on whether to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which would transport over half a million barrels of oil per day from deposits in Alberta, Canada, to American fuel refineries.

Some analysts argue that the pipeline is not in the nation's interest if the goal is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels. However, others believe that focusing on reducing oil demand through a comprehensive energy policy that emphasizes conservation, efficiency, and innovation would make projects like the Keystone XL pipeline economically unfeasible, thus addressing climate concerns more effectively."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to when did women's hockey became an olympic sport??","output":"Women's hockey became an Olympic sport during the 1998 Winter Olympic Games, which were held in Nagano, Japan. This monumental event marked a significant milestone for women's hockey and the promotion of gender equality in sports. The journey toward including women's hockey in the Olympics began much earlier, though. Women's ice hockey has been played since the early 20th century, with the first recorded women's game taking place in 1921 in Ottawa, Canada. Over the years, the popularity of women's hockey grew as various leagues and championships were established across different countries, particularly in North America and Europe. In the late 1980s, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) made a conscious effort to promote gender equality in Olympic sports and began considering the inclusion of women's ice hockey in the Winter Olympic program. In 1991, the proposal to include women's ice hockey as a medal event finally gained enough support to go through, making its debut in the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics marked the beginning of a new era for women's hockey as six teams competed for the inaugural gold medal. The participating countries were the United States, Canada, Finland, Sweden, China, and Japan. The tournament was played in a round-robin format, followed by a knockout stage to determine the medal winners. The United States claimed the first gold medal in women's Olympic hockey by defeating Canada in the final, and Finland won the bronze medal by beating China. Since then, women's hockey has remained a fixture at the Winter Olympics, attracting increased attention and competitiveness. The number of participating teams expanded to eight in the 2002 Winter Olympics held in Salt Lake City, ensuring more opportunities for female hockey players from various countries to compete on the world stage. The inclusion of women's hockey in the Olympics has not only raised the global profile of the sport but has also led to increased participation and development within the women's hockey community. With dedicated athletes, burgeoning leagues, and growing fan bases, women's hockey continues to flourish and break barriers, inspiring future generations of female athletes to pursue their dreams and excel in the sport they love."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Abrams, meanwhile, tends toward a cinematographic trope that looks, at first glance, like a screw-up -- lens flare -- i.e. intentionally flooding the camera frame with light to deliberately wash out or obscure the imagery on-screen. His 2011 sci-fi thriller “Super 8” is packed with hazy flashes of light, as is the filmmaker’s 2009 “Star Trek” movie reboot. But what was once the cinematic equivalent of a nervous tic has become a full-blown body tremor. And critics say the director needs a lens flare intervention. Abrams’ presumed summer blockbuster “Star Trek Into Darkness,” which arrives in theaters May 17, features so much hazy blue light bombarding the starship Enterprise's flight deck that audience members would be forgiven for mistaking the lens flares (rendered even more vivid in 3-D) for incoming photon torpedoes. With the movie opening earlier this month across Europe, Asia and Australia, early reviewers, most of whom like the movie, nevertheless have taken the director to task for showcasing so many diffuse bursts of light rather than leaving them on the editing bay floor where they say they belong. “In ‘Star Trek Into Darkness,’ [Abrams] does his best to ensure gratuitous use of lens flare will live long and prosper,” Luke Buckmaster wrote on Crikey, an Australian media blog. “Only the most ambitious film critics profess to interpret why he does this, other than to observe that the effect looks kind of cool.” In the Guardian UK, critic Andrew Pulver puts the convention within context of a notorious music video vixen, noting that “ ‘Into Darkness’ is slathered in so much lens flare it looks like a Kylie Minogue video.” In his “Into Darkness” review, Shadowlocked.com’s Lewis Bazley seems to resign himself to Abrams’ continuing abuse of the light flare treatment. “… if you tease [Abrams] for his love of lens flare, he’ll just double his efforts to obscure some of every shot with refracted light,” Bazley writes. Abrams’ over-reliance on lens flare prompted the wags at Boy Genius Comedy to lampoon the director with a short called “Lens Flare: The Movie” featuring a group of young people who fear alien invasion but are rendered too blind by lens flash trickery to do anything about it. For his part, at a 2009 news conference for “Star Trek,\\" Abrams admitted having his cinematographer employ flashlights and mirrors to achieve lens flare -- and getting a little carried away with the visual technique. “I wanted a visual system that felt unique,” the filmmaker said. “I know there are certain shots where even I watch and think, ‘Oh that’s ridiculous, that was too many.’ But I love the idea that the future was so bright it couldn’t be contained in the frame.” L.A.

In 1954, the Corsica pit was shut down. Workers were told that the shutdown was temporary because the demand for that particular type of ore had declined. The pit was allowed to flood, and Pickands Mather officially conceded that \\"temporary\\" might stretch into quite a long time, although the mine would perhaps \\"eventually\\" be reopened. A year later, Pickands Mather and Company, manager of the mines at Elcor and the land on which the houses rested, ordered residents to vacate the property. By edict of the mining company, the remaining families were forced out so that the company could reclaim the land.Sources differ on why the order was issued, speculating that the company wanted the land for a dump site, no longer wanted to tend to the town's maintenance, or decided it was not economical to own houses anymore. No one in authority revealed what was to become of the land.Residents of the company-owned houses were given the option to buy the structures at bargain prices, provided they moved them out of town. For many, it took much of their life savings to relocate elsewhere, taking their homes in caravans along the highways and leaving behind empty foundations. Most Elcor residents purchased lots in the surrounding communities, trying to beat land speculators. In the few months after  Elcor's fate became official, land prices skyrocketed. Lots that had originally been priced at 75 were sold for as much as 500. Most of the remaining families moved about two miles west to Gilbert, although other homes were replanted in nearby McKinley. The last vestiges of the old mining community were gone by 1956. Every building was torn down or removed. All that remained for some years after were old foundations, sidewalks, rusting stoves, pipes, bottles, and yard shrubbery, formerly visible from the old section of Minnesota State Highway 135 between Gilbert and Biwabik. A rusted fire hydrant adorned what was once a street corner, and a porcelain toilet bowl remained bolted to a concrete floor. An abandoned rail line for the...

Tintin and I recently aired as an episode of PBS's P.O.V. series. It's based on a taped interview of Georges Remi a.k.a. Herge, Tintin's creator, from 1971 in which in discusses his various experiences publishing his popular character, first in a Catholic newspaper, then in his own series of comic books. Awesome sweeping views of various comic pages and surreal images of Herge's dreams. I first encountered Tintin in the pages of Children's Digest at my local elementary school library reading The Secrets of the Unicorn. My mom later got a subscription to CD and I read the entire Red Rackham's Treasure every month in 1978. I remember seeing some Tintin comic books in a local book store after that but for some reason I didn't get any probably because I was 12 and I thought I was outgrowing them. I do have Breaking Free, a book written and drawn by J. Daniels, published in 1989, six years after Herge's death. Haven't read it yet. This film also covers the artist's personal life as when he left his first wife after his affair with a colorist in his employ (whom he later married). Her name is Fanny and she is interviewed here. If you love Tintin and his creator, this film is definitely worth a look. Update: 9/4/07-I've now read Breaking Free. Tintin and The Captain are the only regular characters that appear here and they are tailored to the anti-capitalist views of Mr. Daniels with Tintin portrayed as a rabble rouser with a chip on his shoulder who nevertheless cares for The Captain who he's staying with. The Captain here is just trying to make ends meet with a wife and daughter that he loves dearly. They and other construction workers vow to strike after a fellow employee dies from a faulty equipment accident. The whole thing takes place in England with working-class cockney accents intact. Not the kind of thing Herge would approve of but an interesting read nonetheless. Oh, yes, dog Snowy only appears in the top left corner of the cover (which has Tintin running over the police!) and the dedication page. Is the sentiment of this review positive or negative?","output":"The sentiment of this review appears to be generally positive. Here are the steps I followed to make this determination: 1. It starts with the excitement and reminiscing of the user about their past experiences with Tintin's stories, which evoke a nostalgic, positive tone.

Elävien eläinten kuljetuksessa suurissa laivoissa on tärkeää taata niille parhaat mahdolliset olosuhteet ja huolehtia niiden hyvinvoinnista koko matkan ajan. Tämä voidaan varmistaa kuuntelemalla asiantuntijoiden neuvoja ja noudattamalla sovittuja laatustandardeja, kuten kansainvälisiä eläinsuojelusäännöksiä. Alusten suunnittelussa ja rakentamisessa on otettava huomioon elävien eläinten tarpeet. Tämä tarkoittaa esimerkiksi riittävän tilan, ilmanvaihdon, lämpötilan, puhtauden ja valaistuksen järjestämistä eläinten käyttöön. Lisäksi on varmistettava, että eläimet saavat riittävästi ravintoa ja vettä matkan aikana, ja niitä on seurattava säännöllisesti voidakseen puuttua tarvittaessa mahdollisiin ongelmiin. Suurten laivanrakennusprojektien yhteydessä on tärkeää kiinnittää erityistä huomiota työntekijöiden koulutukseen ja osaamiseen, jotta heillä on asiantuntemusta ja kykyä huolehtia elävien eläinten kuljetukseen liittyvistä erityiskysymyksistä. Lisäksi on syytä muistuttaa laivan henkilökunnalle, että eläimet vaativat erityistä huolenpitoa ja kunnioitusta ja että niiden asianmukainen hoitaminen on eettisesti ja laillisesti velvoittavaa. Eläinkuljetusten valvonnan ja sääntelyn parissa toimivien viranomaisten on oltava valppaina ja monitoroitava säännöllisesti eri toimijoiden toimintaa sekä toteutettava tiukkoja tarkastuksia alusten olosuhteiden ja kansainvälisten standardien noudattamisen varmistamiseksi. Tarvittaessa heidän on ryhdyttävä toimiin puutteiden korjaamiseksi ja sanktioiden määräämiseksi niille, jotka eivät noudata sääntöjä.

Earl\\", 281 U.S. 111 (1930) . \\"Horst\\" is the leading case that applies the assignment of income doctrine to income from property. Hypothesis: The \\"Horst\\" case is leading in application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property.","output":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the \\"Horst\\" case is leading in the application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property, based on the given context. To provide further insight into the matter, let us discuss the context, the cases mentioned, the assignment of income doctrine, and how they form the basis for this hypothesis. Context: The context introduces two influential United States Supreme Court cases: \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" (1940) and \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" (1930). Both cases have significantly impacted tax law in the United States and shed light on the way income is attributed to taxpayers. \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" (1930): In \\"Lucas v. Earl,\\" the U.S. Supreme Court established the famous \\"fruit-and-tree\\" metaphor. The Court held that income is attributed to the individual who earns it and cannot be assigned to another taxpayer in an attempt to decrease the tax burden. The person who earns the income in this metaphor is represented by the tree, while the income derived is represented by the fruit. This landmark decision laid the groundwork for subsequent income tax jurisprudence in the United States. \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" (1940): Approximately a decade later, \\"Helvering v. Horst\\" further developed and applied the \\"fruit-and-tree\\" metaphor from \\"Lucas v. Earl.\\" In \\"Horst,\\" a father gifted his son an interest coupon, which provided the son with income from the bond. The Court established that the father (the tree) continued to own the bond (the tree) and was responsible for the income taxes on the interest earned (the fruit). The Court applied the assignment of income doctrine to affirm that the income should be taxed to the individual who controls the property generating the income. Assignment of Income Doctrine: The assignment of income doctrine is a fundamental principle in United States tax law, which aims to prevent taxpayers from artificially reducing the burden of tax liability by assigning their income to other individuals or entities. This doctrine holds that income must be attributed and subsequently taxed to the individual who earned it, regardless of any assignment or agreement made to transfer that income to another person. The Hypothesis: Based on the context provided and the examination of these cases, we can conclude that the \\"Horst\\" case is indeed leading in the application of the assignment of income doctrine to income from property. \\"Horst\\" took the foundation established in \\"Lucas v. Earl\\" and expanded it to cover income generated from property. It has since become a precedent for cases involving the assignment of income concerning property-related income and thus lends credence to the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

All of these descriptions highlight different yet crucial aspects of Addison's personality regarding social interactions and her approach to including others in events, such as a birthday party. Firstly, Addison can be considered quite friendly. This description emphasizes the fact that she is actively reaching out to Lee and Jordan, as opposed to a more passive approach, such as waiting for someone to reach out to her or hoping that they found out about the party through someone else. Addison's proactivity in reaching out to invite her friends conveys a strong sense of her sociability and ability to initiate and maintain social connections. Secondly, Addison's actions also depict her as very inviting. By inviting Lee and Jordan to the party, she ensures that they feel included and welcomed. This demonstrates her thoughtfulness, as well as her desire to share experiences with others. The inclusion of the word \\"very\\" emphasizes the extent of her openness and warmth towards others in her social circle. Lastly, the term \\"friendly\\" serves as a general summary of the previous descriptions. It underscores the fact that Addison has a positive disposition, which makes it easier for her to maintain strong relationships and enjoy social gatherings. While it may be a more concise adjective compared to the other two descriptions, it still perfectly encapsulates Addison's nature when it comes to her interactions with her friends. In conclusion, Addison can be described as quite friendly, very inviting, and friendly based on her efforts to reach out to and include Lee and Jordan in the birthday party. These descriptions offer various perspectives on her sociability and demonstrate her warm, pleasant, and proactive nature in engaging with others.

Today, we are going to talk about something important - it's about helping children who need extra care and support. In a place called Somerset, there are people who work to make sure that children are safe and happy. These helpers are called \\"Child Protection Services\\". They are kind of like superhero friends for children who are in trouble or need somebody to help them. To make sure that these helpers are doing their best job, there is a group called Ofsted who checks on them. Ofsted is like a teacher who grades your tests to see if you are learning well. They look at how well the helpers in Child Protection Services are keeping the children safe and how much the children are happy with their help. Unfortunately, Ofsted recently said that the Child Protection Services in Somerset are not doing a very good job. They gave them the lowest rating, which is called \\"inadequate\\". It's like getting an \\"F\\" on your test. The people in Somerset are not happy about this and want to make things better for kids who need help. They will try to improve the Child Protection Services, so children can feel safe and happy again. And just like when we get a bad grade on a test, it's important to learn from our mistakes and do better next time. It takes a lot of hard work, but we can always improve and make things better for those who need our help. Remember, we all need a little help sometimes, whether we are children or grown-ups.

It is also referred to as temporal frequency, which emphasizes the contrast to spatial frequency and angular frequency. The period is the duration of time of one cycle in a repeating event, so the period is the reciprocal of the frequency. For example, if a newborn baby's heart beats at a frequency of 120 times a minute, its periodthe time interval between beatsis half a second (that is, 60 seconds divided by 120 beats).

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Willie Nelson was born in Abbott, Texas on April 29, 1933, during the Great Depression, to Myrle Marie (nee Greenhaw) and Ira Doyle Nelson. He was born on April 29, but his birth was recorded by doctor F. D. Sims on April 30. He was named Willie by his cousin Mildred, who also chose Hugh as his middle name, in honor of her recently deceased younger brother. His parents moved from Arkansas in 1929, to look for work. Nelson has been arrested several times for marijuana possession. The first occasion was in 1974 in Dallas, Texas. In 1977 after a tour with Hank Cochran, Nelson traveled to The Bahamas. Nelson and Cochran arrived late to the airport and boarded the flight without luggage. The bags were later sent to them. As Nelson and Cochran claimed their luggage in the Bahamas, a customs officer questioned Nelson after marijuana was found in a pair of his jeans. Nelson was arrested and jailed. As Cochran made arrangements to pay the bail, he took Nelson a six-pack of beer to his cell. Nelson was released a few hours later. Inebriated, he fell after he jumped celebrating and was taken to the emergency room. He then appeared before the judge, who dropped the charges but ordered Nelson to never return to the country.  In 1994, highway patrolmen found marijuana in his car near Waco, Texas. His requirement to appear in court prevented him attending the Grammy awards that year. While traveling to Ann W. Richards' funeral in 2006, Nelson, along with his manager and his sister, Bobbie, were arrested in St. Martin Parish, Louisiana and charged with possession of marijuana and hallucinogenic mushrooms. Nelson received six months probation.  On November 26, 2010, Nelson was arrested in Sierra Blanca, Texas, for possession of six ounces of marijuana found in his tour bus while traveling from Los Angeles back to Texas. He was released after paying bail of US2,500. Prosecutor Kit Bramblett supported not sentencing Nelson to jail due to the small amount of marijuana involved, but suggested instead a US100 fine and told Nelson that he would have him sing \\"Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain\\" for the court. Judge Becky Dean-Walker said that Nelson would have to pay the fine but not to perform the song, explaining that the prosecutor was joking. Nelson's lawyer Joe Turner reached an agreement with the prosecutor. Nelson was set to pay a US500 fine to avoid a two-year jail sentence with a 30-day review period, which in case of another incident would end the agreement. The judge later rejected the agreement, claiming that Nelson was receiving preferential treatment for his celebrity status; the offense normally carried a one-year jail sentence. Bramblett declared that the case would remain open until it was either dismissed or the judge changed her opinion.

He had some trouble with the law because he was caught with a plant called marijuana, which is illegal in many places.

Translate to French: Its neighbours also need to make their move in this direction.","output":"Ses voisins doivent également faire leur mouvement dans cette direction. To provide a more detailed and long answer, here is the translation of the sentence along with some context and explanation: The sentence refers to an action or change that the neighbors must undertake in a specific direction, possibly to adapt to a new situation, achieve a goal, or improve in some way. Here is the sentence broken down into its components: 1. \\"Its neighbours\\" - \\"Ses voisins\\": This part of the sentence uses the possessive pronoun \\"its\\" to indicate that the neighbors belong or are related to something, likely a country or region previously mentioned. \\"Voisins\\" means neighbors and \\"Ses\\" means its in French. 2. \\"also\\" - \\"également\\": This adverb indicates that the action or change is not only required for whatever the sentence was initially discussing but is also essential for the neighbors. It adds a sense of inclusivity to the statement, making it clear that the entire group or region should take the same course of action. 3. \\"need to make their move\\" - \\"doivent faire leur mouvement\\": This part of the sentence emphasizes the necessity for these neighbors to engage in a particular action or path. \\"Doivent\\" indicates a strong obligation, similar to the English \\"must\\" or \\"need to.\\" The phrase \\"faire leur mouvement\\" can be understood as taking a step or making a decisive action in a specific direction, often to illustrate progress or transformation. 4. \\"in this direction\\" - \\"dans cette direction\\": This phrase reveals that the action or change to be undertaken by the neighbors should be following a particular path or direction. This direction could involve socio-economic growth, infrastructural improvements, diplomatic actions, or any other topic where progress is expected. Thus, the translated sentence emphasizes the need for not only an original subject but also its neighbors to take an active or decisive step towards a specific direction, which could be related to various topics, depending on the context of the discussion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Does \\"Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy.\\" correctly answer the question of In what areas of philosophy did Hume become a major figure?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"Hume became a major figure in the skeptical philosophical and empiricist traditions of philosophy\\" correctly and succinctly addresses the question of in what areas of philosophy Hume became a major figure but it can be expanded upon to give a more comprehensive understanding of Hume's contributions and influence in philosophy.  David Hume was a Scottish philosopher and historian who became a central figure in the 18th-century philosophical movement known as the Scottish Enlightenment. He is best known for developing a philosophical position known as Humean empiricism, which argues that all knowledge comes from sensory experience. He was also a significant figure in the Western tradition of skepticism, where he cast doubt on concepts often taken for granted such as causation, self-identity, and the existence of an external world. Hume's philosophical approach can be described as empirical and skeptical. Empiricism is a school of philosophy that insists that knowledge comes only or primarily from sensory experience. It rejects the idea of innate ideas or knowledge derived from reason alone. For Hume, our knowledge is limited to the scope of our sense experience and memory. He insisted on the idea that causal relationships between events, for instance, could not be known absolutely but only as a habit or custom of thought. Hume's skepticism, on the other hand, questioned the reliability of these perceptions, going as far as to question the very notion of self or identity over time. He cast doubt on a wide array of philosophical concepts and challenged the very foundations upon which philosophy often is built. His concept of skepticism has been influential in various branches of philosophy, particularly in epistemology. Additionally, Hume was a highly influential figure in the field of ethics, where he promoted the theory of ethical sentimentalism. He posited that moral judgments are rooted in our sentiments or feelings, in contrast to the rationalist approaches prevalent during his time. He conceived of morality as more rooted in our human nature and emotions rather than as a result of rational deliberation. In the realm of political philosophy, Hume was instrumental in promoting a form of classical liberalism and famously critiqued the social contract theory of political legitimacy. Hume's philosophical writings profoundly influenced subsequent generations of philosophers, and his ideas continue to be studied, debated, and developed. Whether in epistemology, metaphysics, ethics, or political philosophy, Hume's empiricism and skepticism represent crucial developments in the history of philosophy. Thus, he is rightfully considered a major figure in these areas of philosophy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

They have released five studio albums and six extended plays. The band is composed of vocalist Liam Cormier, guitarist Scott Middleton, drummer Mike Peters and bassist Jaye R. Schwarzer. Cancer Bats take a wide variety of influences from heavy metal subgenres and fuse them into hardcore and punk rock, and also include elements of Southern rock. Cancer Bats was founded in May 2004 by singer Liam Cormier and guitarist Scott Middleton, a former member of Toronto heavy metal band At the Mercy of Inspiration. The two wanted to form a project that combined their favorite parts of bands like Entombed, Refused, Black Flag, Led Zeppelin and Down, among others. The lineup was completed with the addition of Andrew McCracken on bass and Joel Bath on drums, with Cormier moving to vocals. The four-piece wrote and recorded songs for a self-released demo that saw light in January 2005, and led to Canadian independent record label Distort Entertainment signing the band.  The story is that the band considered the names Cancer Bats and Pneumonia Hawk after deciding that a combination of illness and animal name would give the best band name. Soon after, Mike Peters replaced Bath on the drums and the band began playing throughout Southern Ontario, playing live shows with bands like Billy Talent, Every Time I Die, Nora, Alexisonfire, Haste the Day, It Dies Today, Bane, Comeback Kid, Buried Inside, Attack in Black, Misery Signals, This Is Hell, Rise Against, The Bronx and Gallows.

They've arrived at the section of Avengers comics, and this sparks a friendly debate on who their favorite Avenger is. ----- Mike: (grinning) Hey Harrison, I bet you can't guess my favorite Avenger. Harrison: (smirking) Oh, that's easy - Black Panther, right? Mike: (impressed) You got it! T'Challa's intelligence, prowess, and leadership skills make him the best Avenger. Plus, he's the king of Wakanda - a highly advanced and technologically superior nation in Africa. How badass is that? Harrison: (nodding) Yeah, I agree that Black Panther has a lot going for him, and Wakanda is an incredible nation. But my favorite Avenger is still Captain America. Mike: (leaning against the shelf) Captain America? The super soldier with a vibranium shield? How come he's your favorite? Harrison: (smiling) It's because of Steve Rogers' character - his unfaltering moral compass, exceptional courage, and remarkable leadership skills. Plus, he's got a long history that dates back to World War II, giving him a rich narrative in the comics. Mike: (scratching his head) But, isn't Captain America a bit outdated? I mean, he was a product of the Super Soldier Serum experiment back in the '40s. And considering current science and technology, he seems a bit old school, don't you think? Harrison: (raising an eyebrow) Well, Mike, I think it's important to consider the values that people from that time embraced. They believed in the idea of duty, honor, and selflessness. Steve Rogers embodies those ideals, in a way serving as an inspiration for others. Besides, his experiences from WWII give him a unique perspective, enabling him to make wise decisions in the fight against evil. Mike: (crossing his arms) Alright, I get your point, but Black Panther brings more to the table. Think about it: he's a scientist with access to the most advanced technology on the planet. It's even said that the technology of Wakanda makes Tony Stark's look like child's play. Harrison: (grinning) Tony Stark would probably be offended, but it's true, Wakanda's technology is an asset to the Avengers. However, let's not forget Captain America's incredible tactical mind. That, along with his vast experience, makes him a vital strategist for the team. Mike: (putting his hands on his hips) Well, Black Panther is not just a strategist; he's a king. He knows how to make difficult decisions and stand up for what he believes in. I think that definitely gives T'Challa an edge. Harrison: (nodding) It's true, being a king comes with unique responsibilities and experiences. But we cannot ignore the fact that Steve Rogers has been leading the Avengers since their inception. His ability to unite a diverse group of superheroes cements his status as an excellent leader. Mike: (smirking) I guess we'll have to agree to disagree on this one, Harrison.  Harrison: (smiling) Yeah, it seems so. No matter what though, both Black Panther and Captain America bring great strengths to the Avengers team. Mike: (laughing) Agreed. Let's keep browsing and find some more treasures in this comic book store. Harrison: (grinning) Let's do it. ----- Scene fades out, as the two friends continue browsing, still discussing the merits of their favorite characters and sharing their love for the world of Marvel Comics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Description:FlowerheadofCommonToadflax Please segment the words.","output":"The phrase you provided can be segmented into the following words:  Flower head of Common Toadflax. Now, let me provide you with a detailed and long answer about the flower head of Common Toadflax. The Common Toadflax (Linaria vulgaris) is a perennial herbaceous plant belonging to the Plantaginaceae family, which is native to Europe and parts of Asia. It has been introduced to North America and other regions as an ornamental plant and is now considered invasive in some areas. Commonly known as Yellow Toadflax, Butter-and-Eggs, or Wild Snapdragon, this plant is easily recognized by its beautiful and unique flower head. The flower head of the Common Toadflax consists of a cluster of bright yellow, snapdragon-like flowers with an orange-brown lower lip. The flowers are bilaterally symmetrical and tubular in shape, measuring approximately 1 to 1.5 inches (2.5 to 3.8 cm) in length. They are typically arranged in dense, terminal spikes atop unbranched, erect stems that are up to 3 feet (0.9 meters) tall. The flower head can contain as many as 25 individual flowers. The Common Toadflax flowers from June to October, attracting various pollinators, including bees and butterflies. The plant's nectar-rich flowers are particularly favored by long-tongued bumblebees, which can access the nectar at the base of the tubular flowers. The flowers are self-fertile, meaning that they can produce seeds without the need for fertilization from another plant, ensuring the plant's survival and spread. As for the foliage, Common Toadflax has thin, linear leaves that are arranged in opposite pairs along the stems. These leaves are grayish-green in color and can grow up to 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) long. The plant has a shallow and spreading root system, and it can propagate both sexually through seeds and asexually through its creeping rhizomes. The seeds of the Common Toadflax are tiny and black, with each flower head capable of producing up to 300 seeds. This prolific seed production contributes to the plant's invasive nature, as the seeds are quickly dispersed by wind, water, and animals. While often considered a weed, the Common Toadflax has been used in traditional medicine and herbal remedies, primarily as a diuretic and laxative. However, caution is advised when using this plant for medicinal purposes, as it contains toxic compounds called quinolizidine alkaloids that can be harmful if ingested in large quantities. In summary, the flower head of the Common Toadflax is a striking feature of this perennial herb, characterized by its bright yellow, tubular flowers with a distinctive orange-brown lower lip. While admired for its ornamental value, the plant's ability to spread quickly and its potential toxicity should be taken into consideration when deciding whether to introduce it into your garden or natural landscape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: One day, a man found the cocoon   of a butterfly and he brought it home. A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid  from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! Question: What does the writer want to tell us?

Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame. But the real villain is Leverett, who bribed Walsh and organized the Apache raid. A guilty conscience causes Walsh to write a confession. Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes.

Context: Stephen Báthory ; 27 September 1533 - 12 December 1586) was Voivode of Transylvania , Prince of Transylvania , from 1576 Queen Anna Jagiellon's husband and jure uxoris King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania . The son of Stephen VIII Báthory and a member of the Hungarian Báthory noble family, Báthory was a ruler of Transylvania in the 1570s, defeating another challenger for that title, Gáspár Bekes. In 1576 Báthory became the third elected king of Poland. He worked closely with chancellor Jan Zamoyski. The first years of his reign were focused on establishing power, defeating a fellow claimant to the throne, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, and quelling rebellions, most notably, the Danzig rebellion. He reigned only a decade, but is considered one of the most successful kings in Polish history, particularly in the realm of military history. His signal achievement was his victorious campaign in Livonia against Russia in the middle part of his reign, in which he repulsed a Russian invasion of Commonwealth borderlands and secured a highly favorable treaty of peace . Question: How many years old was Báthory when he became the third elected king of Poland? Answer:","output":"To find out how old Báthory was when he became the third elected king of Poland, we need to calculate the difference between the year he became king and the year he was born. Stephen Báthory was born on September 27, 1533, and became King of Poland in 1576.  To calculate his age at the time he became king, we can follow these steps: 1. Subtract his birth year from the year he became king: 1576 - 1533 = 43 years 2. Since his birthday is on September 27, and we don't have the exact date he became king in 1576, let's assume he became king before September 27. Hence, he would have already turned 43 years old in that year. Therefore, Báthory was 43 years old when he became the third elected king of Poland."},{"instruction":"Generate a question about the following movie plot: At a chic 'haute couture' fashion house in Rome, model Isabella (Francesca Ungaro) is brutally murdered one night during a raging thunderstorm by a mysterious figure dressed in black, wearing a mask.

Every year, without fail, I feel a little bit depressed on the First of March. I absolutely love summer. I love the hot weather, the skimpy clothes, the summer fruits and the party seasons. I only have good memories of summer - Christmas time, six weeks holidays when in school then three months off whilst at uni. In my eyes, there is not one bad thing about summer. That is why I hate the First of March. Yes, it is still hot. Yes, my summer fruits are still in season and I can still wear my skimpy clothes, but, in my mind, it means that winter is near. The weather is only going to get colder and my favourite time of the year is official over. In an attempt to lift my end of Summer blues I decided to give myself a bright, cheerful manicure. The colour I choose was a luscious purple cream from butter LONDON called Molly-Coddled. It was just about opaque after one coat, just ever so slightly streaky. Two coats, completely opaque and streak free. If you haven't previously heard of butter LONDON, it is a nail polish brand with a massive range of high fashion colours and it's products are formulated without the use of the harmful ingredients like Formaldehyde, Toluene, DBP or Parabens. butter LONDON was the first company to sell 3 Free nail lacquer in the United States. Formaldehyde is one of the biggest nasties that I make a real effort to avoid. I did my PhD in Forensics and spent a lot of time watching autopsies. Once the body parts have been harvested, they are stored in Formaldehyde to be preserved. The Formaldehyde alters the proteins in the tissue to stop them breaking down - fine for the dead, not something I want to use whilst I am alive. It is nasty, nasty stuff.

Q: What forms when tectonic plates move above a hot spot?    Choices:  - earthquake chain  - volcanic system  - volcanic setting  - volcanic chain  A: Answer:","output":"Volcanic Chain A volcanic chain forms when tectonic plates move above a hot spot. Hot spots are areas of intense heat within the Earth's mantle that arise from plumes of partially molten material. These areas remain relatively stationary while tectonic plates move over them. When a tectonic plate moves over a hot spot, the intense heat causes the mantle material to melt, creating magma. The magma then rises through the Earth's crust, eventually reaching the surface and resulting in the formation of a volcano. Volcanic chains are a series of volcanoes that form in a linear pattern, corresponding to the movement of the tectonic plate over the stationary hot spot. As the plate moves, new volcanoes form over the hot spot, while older volcanoes move away from the heat source and eventually become extinct. Over time, the extinct volcanoes erode, leaving behind a chain of volcanic seamounts (underwater mountains). One famous example of a volcanic chain is the Hawaiian Islands, located in the middle of the Pacific tectonic plate. The Hawaiian Islands are made up of a series of volcanic islands, all formed by the movement of the Pacific Plate over a hot spot. The Big Island of Hawaii, which is still volcanically active, is currently located over the hot spot, while the older and extinct volcanic islands lie to the northwest, having moved away from the heat source. Another example is the Emperor Seamounts, a chain of seamounts in the Pacific Ocean that stretches from Hawaii to the Aleutian Trench. The Emperor Seamounts are also the result of the Pacific Plate moving over a hot spot and represent an older portion of the volcanic chain. In summary, a volcanic chain forms when tectonic plates move above a hot spot. The movement of the plate over the stationary hot spot causes the formation of a series of volcanoes, which create a volcanic chain as the plate continues to move. Examples of volcanic chains include the Hawaiian Islands and the Emperor Seamounts."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

A federal judge in Georgia on Monday, Aug. 12, 2013 threw out race discrimination claims by a former... (Associated Press)      Lisa Jackson sued Deen and her brother, Bubba Hiers, last year saying she suffered from sexual harassment and racially offensive talk and employment practices that were unfair to black workers during her five years as a manager of Uncle Bubba's Seafood and Oyster House. Deen is co-owner of the restaurant, which is primarily run by her brother.      But claims of race discrimination by Jackson, who is white, were gutted in the 20-page opinion by U.S. District Court Judge William T. Moore Jr. The judge agreed with lawyers for Deen and Hiers that Jackson has no standing to sue her former employers for what she claims was poor treatment of black workers, regardless of her claims that she was offended and placed under additional stress.      Jackson, at best, \\"is an accidental victim of the alleged racial discrimination,\\" Moore said in his ruling. \\"There are no allegations that defendant Hiers's racially offensive comments were either directed toward plaintiff or made with the intent to harass her.\\"      The ruling lets stand Jackson's claims that Hiers sexually harassed her when she worked at the restaurant from 2005 to 2010. However, the judge said he was reserving the chance to rule on requests from Deen's lawyers to dismiss other claims in the lawsuit.      The judge added that to allow Jackson to seek legal recourse for discrimination directed toward other workers \\"would serve to conscript federal courts as human resource departments that are responsible for imposing and monitoring a federally created standard for harmony in the workplace.\\"      Of course, Jackson's race-based claims have already resulted in serious damage to Deen's public image. It was Jackson's lawyer who questioned Deen under oath in May when she acknowledged having used racial slurs in the past. A transcript of the legal deposition became public in June, and the backlash against Deen caused the Food Network and other corporate sponsors and business partners to drop her.      Still, Deen's publicist issued an upbeat statement Monday.      \\"We are pleased with the court's ruling today that Lisa Jackson's claims of race discrimination have been dismissed,\\" Elana Weiss said in a statement emailed to The Associated Press. \\"As Ms. Deen has stated before, she is confident that those who truly know how she lives her life know that she believes in equal opportunity, kindness and fairness for everyone.\\"      Jackson's attorney, Matthew Billips, did not immediately return a phone call seeking comment. Attorneys for Deen and Hiers also did not immediately return phone calls.      The judge's decision comes a month after Deen and Hiers dumped their attorneys and hired a new legal team. But the court motions seeking dismissal for all race-based claims in the case were filed in December, months before those changes were made.      In her lawsuit, Jackson had claimed Hiers frequently made jokes containing racial slurs at work and prohibited black workers from using the restaurant's front entrance and customer restrooms. She said she was personally offended because she had biracial nieces.      Attorneys for Deen have said in court filings that Jackson's lawsuit was based on \\"scurrilous and false claims.\\" They said before Jackson filed suit, she threatened to embarrass Deen publicly unless she paid the ex-employee \\"huge sums of money.\\" ||||| Paula Deen Wins Racial Lawsuit That Destroyed Her      Paula Deen Wins Racial Discrimination Lawsuit That Destroyed Her      Breaking News      In one of the most supremely ironic court decisions in a long time, a judge just threw out the racial discrimination claim filed against-- the very lawsuit that destroyed the famous chef.A judge just ruled ...had no right to claim racial discrimination, BECAUSE SHE'S WHITE!

Input: Article: Now that America has declared a state of swine flu   public health emergency, you may be asking yourself -- what am Isupposed to do? Here is a list of practical steps you can take to prepare and protect yourself and your family. 1) Know the symptoms-- Here are some of the symptoms that sound like swine flu -- fevers over 100 degrees (37.8degC), body aches, cough, runny nose, and sometimes, nausea   and diarrhea  . It's also useful to know if you might have had an exposure   either by recent travel to Mexico, or to the areas of known cases so far in America -- specific areas of California, Texas, New York, Ohio and Kansas. Or you may have been exposed to a sick person who came from those areas.  2) Don't panic-- If you have symptoms that sound like swine flu, do not rush to hospitals. Not only is this difficult for the healthcare system, it can also be potentially dangerous for everyone. Call your doctor or local public health clinic before going in. 3) Contain the illness-- Hand-washing works. Wash, wash and wash. Invest in some hand sanitizer   for the whole family. Avoid hugs and kisses of well-wishers, and do not share telephone handsets or computers. Be especially careful to always cough into the elbow of your arm (yes! the elbow, not your hand!). Cover your cough and sneeze to protect others.  4) What about a mask?-- The data shows that masks do work --as long asthere is a tight seal   about the mouth and nose.  5) Eat the pork(if you want) -- Swine flu gets its name because pigs can get the infection and spread it to each other -- as well as to humans. This latest virus contains pieces that indicate it evolved   from swine flu virus, and can now spread from person to person. Swine flu is not spread by properly prepared and cooked pork products. So if you want to eat pork, you can. 6) Getting sick? Stay home!-- In our go-go-go culture and these severe economic times, it can be very hard to call a boss and cancel a day's work. Now, however, if you or your loved ones are feeling like there's a flu coming on, stay home. 7) Stockpile?-- Right now, it's too early for any of us to become a Swine Flu Shut-In, but the public health department recommends that each home have two weeks of supplies, in case we must stay home -- either for illness or to help contain transmission. That means two weeks of food for everyone in your home, two weeks of all medications, and, if you're like most people, two weeks of books and DVDs.   Question: The purpose of the writer is mainly to   _  .

Summarize this article: The party is in first place in some other towns it is targeting, according to projections. President Francois Hollande's Socialists have lost ground overall and may lose control of some major towns. The vote is seen as a key test for the Socialists, deeply unpopular after nearly two years in power. The Socialists were also hit by the low turnout in the first round of the elections - exit polls suggest up to 35% of voters stayed at home. The vote is to choose councillors and mayors in more than 36,000 villages, towns and cities. The anti-immigration National Front (FN) took 50.26% of the vote in the northern town of Henin-Beaumont, which has historically voted for the left. Elsewhere, in Avignon and Perpignan in the south, the party's candidates for mayor had the biggest number of votes. In some 200 places FN candidates have won through to the second round next weekend. Marine Le Pen, National Front leader since 2011, hailed the results, saying her party had \\"arrived as a major independent force - a political force at both national and local level\\". The BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris says that in most cases, these candidates have little chance of gaining control of the town halls as they will be beaten in round two. However, it is a big advance for the far right and an expression of the growing popular exasperation with the establishment parties of the right and the left, he says. Many people who voted for President Hollande two years ago chose to abstain, which has meant losses for the Socialists, our correspondent notes, and in many important towns they will struggle in the second round to hold off challenges from the main centre-right UMP opposition party. Earlier, pollsters identified half a dozen towns that could see National Front rule as a result of the elections, giving it the chance to show it can be trusted with power after attempts to run four towns in the late 1990s revealed its lack of competence, Reuters news agency said.","output":"The National Front (FN), an anti-immigration party, has won 50.26% of the vote in the French town of Henin-Beaumont in the first round of local elections, and has led in other towns including Avignon and Perpignan in the south.

On 17 March 2003, Robin Cook, Leader of the House of Commons and former Foreign Secretary, resigned from the Cabinet in protest against the coming war in Iraq. His resignation speech inspired the first long applause in the history of the House and marked the end of the ministerial career of one of Labor's most brilliant politicians.  For the previous two years, Robin Cook kept a diary, a personal record of the life of Labor's second term, a diary that forms the center of the narrative . The Point of Departureis Robin Cook's plain account of this extraordinary period in our political history, the most important political publication of the decade. Though surprised by his abrupt dismissal as Foreign Secretary, he became determined to bring about some changes in Parliamentary democracy that he believed was essential if Parliament was to move into the 21stcentury. As Tony Blair told him, \\"This is the job for you.\\"  Drawing on first-hand experiences in the Commons and the Cabinet, of encounters in conferences, and late night conversations, we follow his gathering disillusionment as the political compass of the government changes to directions which he believes to be completely mistaken: from its failure about Lords reform and its unwillingness to provide leadership for social change, to a foreign policy which has led us away from our responsibility in Europe, into closer relationship with the most right-wing government in American history, and participation in Bush's war on Iraq.  This is the story of a government in power and the tensions between those who govern. But above all it is a story of a politician who truly wanted to bring democracy closer to the people, but who saw a government increasingly separated from the values of himself and his party, and who developed a growing belief that on Iraq, its position was morally, diplomatically and politically wrong.  Robin Cook first entered Parliament as MP for Edinburgh Central in 1974. He held a number of senior positions in Opposition -- Shadow Foreign Secretary, Shadow Health and Social Services Secretary -- before becoming Foreign Secretary in 1997.

On completing his seven-year apprenticeship he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk crayons\\", with the intention of becoming a history painter in the tradition of the Old Masters, and studied under renowned artist Thomas Lawrence. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, Etty submitted numerous paintings to the Royal Academy of Arts and the British Institution, all of which were either rejected or received little attention when exhibited.In 1821 the Royal Academy accepted and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra), which depicted a large number of nude figures. Cleopatra was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting, and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, over the next decade Etty tried to replicate its success by painting nudes in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 included nude figures.While some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, the country had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of such material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in painting nudes, and many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent, although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received. From 1832 onwards, needled by repeated attacks from the press, Etty remained a prominent painter of nudes, but made conscious efforts to try to reflect moral lessons in his work. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was known for their fascination with contrasts in skin tones?, what is it ?

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: There’s a story in my Tuscan family of nobility and forbidden love. It’s set in Taranto, Puglia, on Italy’s southern heel and involves my daughter’s great-great-grandmother. The best known version is told by my husband Marco’s uncle, Riccardo, who remembers it being told to him by his elderly Nonna Anna herself. Anna Michela Comasia Maria Calianno. Her long name was a sign of her family’s noble status. She was born in Taranto, Puglia, in 1889, into a wealthy, well-educated Tarantine family of physicians, surgeons and landowners. One day, by chance, young Anna answered the door instead of the butler. There was Nicola Cardellicchio, the postman. He came from a poor family of bricklayers and wool spinners, raised by a single mother. “He was no adonis,” noted Nonna Anna. Nicola was rather short and stocky, but she liked him immediately. She continued answering the door whenever the postman passed. When Anna’s mother, Girolama, noticed her daughter’s growing interest in the postman, she forbid her to see him again, threatening to disown her. So Anna did what any lovesick girl would do: she ran away, eloping with Nicola. The couple had nine children in Taranto — Mario, Marco’s grandfather was born in the middle of the First World War — but times were very hard, and they moved north to Torino to look for work. Nonna Anna was perhaps not an instinctive cook. I wondered whether she ever had the possibility to learn how to cook. Her grandchildren, Angela (my mother in law) and Riccardo, remember her only ever making lesso (boiled meat) and these polpette, which became variously known in the family as “sugo di nonna Anna” and, oddly, “amatriciana” (which is actually a different recipe, a chilli-spiked sauce of fried guanciale and tomato to coat pasta). But these polpette – plump meat balls, cooked slowly in tomato sauce, a very traditional dish from Puglia – were passed down to Anna’s daughter in law, Angela’s Tuscan mother, Lina, who made them so often for her own family that she in turn taught her daughter in law,... Question: Why did Anna continue answering the door? Options: - not enough information - Because Girolama threatened to disown her - Because she married Nicola - Because she liked Nicola The answer to this question is:","output":"Because she liked Nicola."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Death is natural, but do you have any idea of the process of dying? Modern scientists divide the process of dying into two phases --- clinical or temporary death and biological death. Clinical death occurs when the vital organs, such as the heart or lungs, have ceased to function, but have not suffered permanent damage. The organism can still be revived . Biological death occurs when changes in the organism lead to the \\"breaking up\\" of vital cells and tissues. Death is then unchangeable and final. Scientists have been seeking a way to prolong the period of clinical death so that the organism can remain alive before biological death occurs. The best method developed so far involves cooling of the organism, combined with narcotic sleep. By slowing down the body's metabolism , cooling delays the processes leading to biological death. To illustrate how this works, scientists performed an experiment on a six-year-old female monkey called Keta. The scientist put Keta to sleep with a narcotic. Then they surrounded her body with ice-bags and began checking her body temperature. When it had dropped to 28 degrees the scientists began draining blood from an artery. The monkey's blood pressure decreased and an hour later both the heart and breathing stopped: clinical death set in. For twenty minutes Keta remained in this state. Her temperature dropped to 22 degrees. At this point the scientists pumped blood into an artery in the direction of the heart and started artificial breathing. After two minutes Keta's heart became active once more. After fifteen minutes, spontaneous breathing began, and after four hours Keta opened her eyes and lifted her head. After six hours, when the scientists tried to give her a penicillin injection, Keta seized the syringe and ran with it around the room. Her behavior differed little from that of a healthy animal.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the answer you found on Google does not provide a correct and clear explanation of the Universal Law of Gravitation.  The Universal Law of Gravitation, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton, states that any two objects with mass attract each other with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Mathematically, it can be expressed as: F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2 Where: F is the gravitational force between the two objects, G is the gravitational constant (approximately 6.674 × 10^-11 N(m/kg)^2), m1 and m2 are the masses of the two objects, and r is the distance between the centers of the objects. The answer you found may be referring to the fact that the gravitational constant G was not measured experimentally until 71 years after Newton's death, which indeed made it impossible for Newton to determine the exact value of the gravitational forces involved.

Question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president. Question: Trump probably feels that he should go forward with the plan despite some polls indicating it is viewed negatively because...

Input: Passage: Coming off their dominating win over the Saints, the Broncos traveled to Paul Brown Stadium for an AFC duel with the Cincinnati Bengals. A 43-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater gave the Broncos an early lead, but the Bengals countered in the second quarter, with a 28-yard field goal by placekicker Mike Nugent. The Broncos responded, with a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Peyton Manning to wide receiver Eric Decker. The Broncos added to their lead, when return specialist Trindon Holliday took the opening kickoff of the second half 105 yards for a touchdown. However, the Bengals would reel off 17 unanswered points, consisting of a 10-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Andy Dalton to wide receiver A. J. Green, a 49-field goal by Nugent followed in the fourth quarter by running back BenJarvus Green-Ellis rushing for a 2-yard touchdown, with the latter two scores coming off Manning interceptions. This gave Cincinnati a 20-17 lead early in the fourth quarter. The Broncos re-claimed the lead on their next possession, with Manning connecting on a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Joel Dreessen. Ten plays into the Bengals' next possession, Dalton was intercepted by cornerback Champ Bailey at the Bengals' 46-yard line, and the Broncos subsequently added to their lead eight plays later, with a 4-yard touchdown pass from Manning to Decker. Trailing 31-20 with 3:36 remaining in the fourth quarter, the Bengals tried to rally, with Nugent nailing a 41-yard field goal with 52 seconds remaining, but the Broncos recovered the onside kick in the game's final minute and subsequently ran out the clock. Peyton Manning improved his personal record to 8-0 all-time in games against the Bengals. Question: How many yards was the longest field goal of the game?

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged?  Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...","output":"The name of the person since whose death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged is Saint-Saëns."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Florence Nightingale was born on 12 May 1820 into a rich, upper-class, well-connected British family at the Villa Colombaia, in Florence, Tuscany, Italy, and was named after the city of her birth. Florence's older sister Frances Parthenope had similarly been named after her place of birth, Parthenope, a Greek settlement now part of the city of Naples. The family moved back to England in 1821, with Nightingale being brought up in the family's homes at Embley, Hampshire and Lea Hurst, Derbyshire. Florence inherited a liberal-humanitarian outlook from both sides of her family. Florence Nightingale exhibited a gift for mathematics from an early age and excelled in the subject under the tutelage of her father. Later, Nightingale became a pioneer in the visual presentation of information and statistical graphics. She used methods such as the pie chart, which had first been developed by William Playfair in 1801. While taken for granted now, it was at the time a relatively novel method of presenting data.  Indeed, Nightingale is described as \\"a true pioneer in the graphical representation of statistics\\", and is credited with developing a form of the pie chart now known as the polar area diagram, or occasionally the Nightingale rose diagram, equivalent to a modern circular histogram, to illustrate seasonal sources of patient mortality in the military field hospital she managed. Nightingale called a compilation of such diagrams a \\"coxcomb\\", but later that term would frequently be used for the individual diagrams. She made extensive use of coxcombs to present reports on the nature and magnitude of the conditions of medical care in the Crimean War to Members of Parliament and civil servants who would have been unlikely to read or understand traditional statistical reports. In 1859, Nightingale was elected the first female member of the Royal Statistical Society. In 1874 she became an honorary member of the American Statistical Association.  Her attention turned to the health of the British army in India and she demonstrated that bad drainage, contaminated water, overcrowding and poor ventilation were causing the high death rate. She concluded that the health of the army and the people of India had to go hand in hand and so campaigned to improve the sanitary conditions of the country as a whole.  Nightingale made a comprehensive statistical study of sanitation in Indian rural life and was the leading figure in the introduction of improved medical care and public health service in India. In 1858 and 1859, she successfully lobbied for the establishment of a Royal Commission into the Indian situation. Two years later, she provided a report to the commission, which completed its own study in 1863. \\"After 10 years of sanitary reform, in 1873, Nightingale reported that mortality among the soldiers in India had declined from 69 to 18 per 1,000\\".  The Royal Sanitary Commission of 1868-9 presented Nightingale with an opportunity to press for compulsory sanitation in private houses. She lobbied the minister responsible, James Stansfeld, to strengthen the proposed Public Health Bill to require owners of existing properties to pay for connection to mains drainage. The strengthened legislation was enacted in the Public Health Acts of 1874 and 1875. At the same time she combined with the retired sanitary reformer Edwin Chadwick to persuade Stansfeld to devolve powers to enforce the law to Local Authorities, eliminating central control by medical technocrats. Her Crimean War statistics had convinced her that non-medical approaches were more effective given the state of knowledge at the time. Historians now believe that both drainage and devolved enforcement played a crucial role in increasing average national life expectancy by 20 years between 1871 and the mid-1930s during which time medical science made no impact on the most fatal epidemic diseases.

This lake is quite interesting because it is classified as an \\"exploding lake\\". This term refers to a rare type of natural lake that contains significant amounts of dissolved gases (methane and carbon dioxide), which can potentially escape into the atmosphere, leading to a huge explosion.  Being one of only three such lakes in the world (the other two are Lake Monoun and Lake Nyos, both in Cameroon), it poses a certain threat to nearby populations, primarily due to the risk of a limnic eruption. This is an unusual natural disaster that can occur when water becomes saturated with gas, causing a large explosion potentially killing wildlife and people in the vicinity and causing significant damage to buildings and infrastructure. On the other side, the methane in Lake Kivu’s waters also presents an opportunity for local communities. Depending on the technology used, this gas could be extracted and used as an energy source. If properly managed, methane extraction from Lake Kivu could provide a steady supply of energy to the region's communities, as it continuously generates from organic matter at the lake’s bottom. Thus, the context of the sentence, \\"Lake Kivu is one of the world’s three known “exploding lakes,” presenting a threat as well as an opportunity for local communities,\\" outlines this dual characteristic of Lake Kivu - its potential dangers and its possible benefits. It highlights the unique and delicate balance inhabitants of the region must maintain to safely harness the resources it provides while living with the ever-present risk of a natural disaster."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What is the difference between a pocket veto and the actual veto power of the President of India? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Hello little friend! I'll gladly explain the answers to your questions.  Question 1: In India, there are two types of bodies called constitutional and statutory bodies.  Constitutional bodies are mentioned in the Indian Constitution, like a treasure map with special locations. The Constitution is a big book of rules for the country. The bodies mentioned in it have been created following these rules. Examples are the Election Commission and the Public Service Commission. Statutory bodies, on the other hand, are not mentioned in the Constitution. They are created by laws passed by the Parliament, which is like a big team that makes decisions for the country. Examples of statutory bodies are the Reserve Bank of India and the National Human Rights Commission.  Question 2: In India, the President has different types of veto powers, like special buttons they can push when they don't agree with a law. There are two important buttons called \\"pocket veto\\" and \\"actual veto.\\" A pocket veto is like a secret power. The President keeps the bill, or the paper with the law written on it, in their pocket and does not take any action. There is no time limit, so it can take as long as the President wants. The bill might not become a law or might just wait longer. The actual veto power is more open. The President says \\"no\\" to the bill, and it goes back to the Parliament. The big team can discuss it again and, if they still want that law, they can pass the bill with more votes. The President then has to accept it, and the bill becomes a law. Question 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They talk about different topics: one is about different types of bodies in India, and the other is about the President's powers. But both questions help us understand more about India's government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You do not have to limit yourself to a certain type of fabric to make a great tie, but heavier fabrics do tend to wear better. For one tie, you'll need at least 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of fabric for the front of the tie and about 5 x 6 inches of fabric for the back liner.  Silk is a popular choice for tie liners. For a casual tie, go for patterned cotton, linen or denim. Ties are made with a material called interfacing, which is sewn or ironed into the inside of the tie as a liner. It allows fabrics to keep a firm shape. You will need 1 1⁄2 yards (1.4 m) of interfacing in a color that matches the tie fabric.  For fusible interfacing, you will put the glazed side face down on the tie fabric to permanently adhere it to the tie. Be sure to buy sewable, fusible interfacing because you will be sewing the tie later on.  Interfacing that is sewn-in does not have a glaze on it. It is sewn to the inside of the seam line so there won't be visible stitching on the outside of the tie. In addition to the fabric and interfacing, you will need to buy the following supplies:  Fine thread that matches the tie fabric A good pair of fabric scissors Either a needle (if you're sewing the tie by hand) or a sewing machine Straight pins Measuring tape Iron There are many tie patterns available for you to choose from. Once you find a style you like, you can print the outline for it online for free. The alternative to printing a tie outline would be to use a ruler to trace another tie out yourself.  When tie outlines print, they will continue onto more than one page because the length of the tie will be longer than a standard sheet of printing paper. Simply tape the paper together when you trace them onto the fabric. You will need about 3/8in of additional space outside of your trace line that you will later use for the inseam. Summary:","output":"To make a great tie, choose from various fabrics, use at least 1.4 meters of fabric and a compatible interfacing, gather essential sewing supplies, select a preferred pattern, and ensure sufficient seam allowance while tracing the outline."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What superhuman sense did Grenouille have? Movie title: Perfume: The Story of a Murderer Movie plot: The film begins with the sentencing of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille (Ben Whishaw), a notorious murderer. Between the reading of the sentence and the execution, the story of his life is told in flashback, beginning with his abandonment at birth in a French fish market. Raised in an orphanage, Grenouille grows into a strangely detached boy with a superhuman sense of smell. After growing to maturity as a tanner's apprentice, he makes his first delivery to Paris, where he revels in the new odors. He focuses on the scent of a kindly girl selling plums (Karoline Herfurth) and startles her with his behavior. To prevent her from crying out, he covers the girl's mouth and unintentionally suffocates her. After realizing that she is dead, he strips her body naked and smells her until the scent fades.Afterwards, Grenouille becomes haunted by the desire to preserve the woman's scent forever. After making a delivery to a perfume shop, Grenouille amazes the Italian owner, Giuseppe Baldini (Dustin Hoffman), with his ability to create fragrances. He revitalizes the perfumer's career with new formulas, demanding only that Baldini teach him how to convert scents into perfume. Baldini explains that all perfumes are harmonies of twelve individual scents, and may contain a theoretical thirteenth scent. He also tells a story about a perfume discovered in an Egyptian tomb that was so perfect that it caused everyone in the entire world to briefly believe they were in paradise the moment the bottle was opened.When Grenouille discovers that Baldini's method of distillation will not capture the scents of all objects, such as iron chains and dead animals, he becomes depressed. After receiving a letter of presentation written by Baldini, Grenouille leaves to learn a different method in Grasse. En route to Grasse, Grenouille realises that he has no scent of his own, and is therefore a cipher.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said deficit spending by the federal government hasn’t been as effective at stimulating the economy as expected.      “I’m not saying the stimulus is not working, I’m saying it’s working far less than anyone anticipated,” Greenspan said today at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York.      Greenspan said the “most effective” stimulus would be an increase in stock prices rather than more government spending. He also said he favors raising taxes to curb the federal budget deficit, joining the debate in Congress over whether to extend reductions enacted under President George W. Bush.      “We have to find a way to settle down the extent of activism that is currently going on and allow this economy to heal,” Greenspan said. “We would be far better off to allow the normal market forces to operate.”      Taxes and spending are dominating the congressional agenda less than two months before elections that will determine control of the House and Senate. President Barack Obama is defending his economic policies against criticism from Republicans, who argue they haven’t been effective and have widened a budget deficit that reached a record 1.42 trillion in 2009.      Obama last week proposed a package of 180 billion in business tax breaks and infrastructure spending to boost the economy. That would come on top of the 814 billion stimulus measure enacted last year.      Extending Tax Cuts      Obama also wants to extend Bush-era tax cuts for individuals who make less than 200,000 a year and couples earning less than 250,000 while repealing them for those who earn more. Republicans want to extend cuts for all taxpayers.      Greenspan said raising taxes in a weak economy isn’t an ideal option.      “There are risks, but our choice is not between good and bad, it’s between terrible and worse,” he said. “Unless we come to grips with the deficit quickly we’re fooling ourselves as to how much time we have.”      A relapse into a recession is unlikely, said Greenspan, 84, who was chairman of the central bank from 1987 to 2006 and didn’t comment on monetary policy in today’s remarks.      “What we have going for us is that the tinder for a double dip is not readily available,” he said. Still, he repeated his warning that if housing prices drop, “all bets are off.”      Unemployment Rate      The economy grew at a 1.6 percent annual rate in the second quarter, hampered by an unemployment rate that has stayed above 9 percent all year. The unemployment rate rose to 9.6 percent in August from 9.5 percent in July.      Greenspan cited the level of excess reserves in the banking system as evidence of the uncertainty that’s restraining recovery. As of Sept. 9, U.S. banks have 1.01 trillion in excess reserves.      “There is a heavy weight of uncertainty on the system such that we are not getting the impact of a trillion dollars already on the books into the marketplace,” he said, describing the situation as a “liquidity trap.”      “Our financial institutions are still partially disabled and will continue to be disabled until we restore a level of capital in the system that enables the average lender to a depository institution to feel secure,” he said.      Capital requirements proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision earlier this week are a move in the right direction, he said.      “The nature of the regulations that were promulgated by the Basel committee made sense to me,” he said.      As Fed chairman in 2001, Greenspan supported the first round of tax cuts under Bush. At the time, the federal government operated with a surplus, and Greenspan told Congress he didn’t think the cuts would lead to a deficit.      To contact the reporters for this story: Joshua Zumbrun in Washington at jzumbrun@bloomberg.net; ||||| The former head of the Federal Reserve said fiscal stimulus efforts have fallen far short of expectations, and the government now needs to get out of the way and allow businesses and markets to power the recovery.      “We have to find a way to simmer down the extent of activism that is going on” with government stimulus spending “and allow the economy to heal” itself, former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan told a gathering held at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York on Wednesday.      Bloomberg News Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan      At this point, “we’d probably be better off doing less than more” because “you’d be far better off to allow the normal market forces to operate here,” Greenspan said. That’s largely because stimulus spending is not proving as effective as many had hoped. “To the extent the evidence suggests very large deficits concurrently crowd out capital investment, there is a debit to the stimulus program that is somewhere between a third and a half of what the gross stimulus is,” he said.      Greenspan was Fed chairman from 1987 to 2006, and was succeeded by current central bank chief Ben Bernanke. Greenspan’s tenure at the Fed was defined by his opposition to government regulation and his confidence that markets would discipline themselves.      To many, the financial crisis was largely born of that ideology, and to some degree, Greenspan has himself said he overestimated the market’s willingness to understand and price for risk. Greenspan has also been widely accused of running an overly easy monetary policy during the early years of the last decade, in turn providing the fuel that powered the housing bubble, the rupturing of which drove the worst recession in generations.      Greenspan’s comments came in response to moderator and audience questions, and were accordingly wide-ranging. The former central banker noted that gold, the price of which has been surging, still represents the “ultimate means of payment.” What is happening in that market “is a signal there is a problem with respect to currency markets.” He reckons the problem is not a large one, but the jump in gold prices could be “the canary in the coal mine to keep an eye on.”      Greenspan, while worried about the outlook and what is happening with the housing market, said when it comes to a double-dip recession, “the probability of that is going down.” Given all the ground the economy has lost, “the tinder for a double-dip is not readily available,” although he added if housing goes down “all bets are off.”      Greenspan said that the U.S. needs to do something now to deal with budget deficits and it must do something very soon. He explained his anxiety is so high that “I’m coming out in the first time in my memory” in support of higher taxes in addition to reduced spending, including allowing the so-called Bush tax cuts to expire.      “Our choice is not between good and bad; it’s between terrible and worse,” Greenspan said. The nation has “a level of commitment … which I don’t think we can psychically meet,” absent huge changes in how the government finances itself. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan stated that deficit spending by the federal government has not been as effective at stimulating the economy as expected.

The statement follows the template: \\"t1 doesn't occur between t2 and t3\\". 3. Provide the output 'True' or 'False'. Solution: First, let's note down t1, t2, and t3 in the given statement: t1: 14 Apr 1980 t2: Feb 11, 2017 t3: 11 Jan 1998 Now, for the given template \\"t1 doesn't occur between t2 and t3\\", we need to check if t1 (14 Apr 1980) is outside the time range of t2 (Feb 11, 2017) and t3 (11 Jan 1998). 14 Apr 1980 comes before both other dates: 14 Apr 1980 < 11 Jan 1998 and 14 Apr 1980 < Feb 11, 2017 Hence, the given statement is true because 14 Apr 1980 is indeed outside and before the time range of Feb 11, 2017 and 11 Jan 1998.

Question: Given the following context:  After the Wicked Witch of the West is melted by a bucket of water, and Dorothy is sent back to her world, Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, decides to revive the Wicked Witch and remove her powers by storing them in a magic broom. Glinda then gives the magical broom to Dorothy's friends, Tin Woodman, Cowardly Lion, and Scarecrow, and they become the guardians of the broom. Evilene, the Wicked Witch, conspires with her Flying Monkeys to retrieve her broom. However, a friendly little monkey named Ozzy forgets to close the gate of the castle and a battle ensues between the flying monkeys and the 'Bums of Oz.' Evilene retrieves her broom and repels the Champions of Oz from the castle. She then punishes Ozzy's father, transforming him into a chicken. Angered by the witch's spell on his father, Ozzy steals the broom from Evilene and runs away from the palace. Ozzy reaches Glinda to find she has been paralyzed by accidentally drinking a magic potion created by her niece Gabby, who is unable to create an antidote without a vital ingredient based on wood. Gabby and Ozzy set off to find the Champions of Oz. They are pursued by the other Flying Monkeys. They soon find Cowardly Lion, who is out of sorts due to the witch's spell, but with some effort they guide him to the north town, where they find the Tin Woodman, who is extremely depressed by the spell. The spell-raged Lion smashes the Tin Man to bits, but calms down when Ozzy accidentally hits him with the magic broom. Ozzy, Gaby, and the Cowardly Lion take the Tin Man's parts to the Library of Oz where (due to the spell) Scarecrow is obsessively reading books in an effort to become more intelligent. He quickly repairs Tin with the help from a clue. However, the group is attacked by the Flying Monkeys, and in the chaos Ozzy cures Scarecrow of the spell's effects, but they are unable to save Gabby from being whisked away by the Flying Monkeys.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person who repairs Tin?

Which entity is this text about? I. Lewis \\"Scooter\\" Libby (first name generally given as Irv, Irve or Irving; born August 22, 1950) is an American lawyer and former advisor to Vice President Dick Cheney. From 2001 to 2005, Libby held the offices of Assistant to the Vice President for National Security Affairs and Chief of Staff to the Vice President of the United States and Assistant to the President during the administration of President George W. Bush. In October 2005, Libby resigned from all three government positions after he was indicted on five counts by a federal grand jury concerning the investigation of the leak of the covert identity of Central Intelligence Agency officer Valerie Plame Wilson. He was subsequently convicted of four counts (one count of obstruction of justice, two counts of perjury, and one count of making false statements), making him the highest-ranking White House official convicted in a government scandal since John Poindexter, the national security adviser to President Ronald Reagan in the Iran-Contra affair. Libby was born to an affluent Jewish family in New Haven, Connecticut; his late father, Irving Lewis Liebowitz, was an investment banker.  Libby graduated from the Eaglebrook School, in Deerfield, Massachusetts, a middle school, in 1965. The family lived in the Washington region, Miami and Connecticut prior to Libby's graduation from Phillips Academy, in Andover, Massachusetts, in 1968.  He and his elder brother, Hank, a retired tax lawyer, were the first in the family to graduate from college. Libby matriculated at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, in Fall 1968, graduating magna cum laude in 1972. As Yale Daily News reporter Jack Mirkinson observes, \\"Even though he would eventually become a prominent Republican, Libby's political beginnings would not have pointed in that direction. He served as vice president of the Yale College Democrats and later campaigned for Michael Dukakis when he was running for governor of Massachusetts.\\" According to Mirkinson: \\"Two particular Yale courses helped guide Libby's future endeavors. One of these was a creative writing course, which started Libby on a 20-year mission to complete a novel ... [later published as] The Apprentice ... [and] a political science class with professor and future Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz. In an interview with author James Mann, Libby said Wolfowitz was one of his favorite professors, and their professional relationship did not end with the class.\\" Wolfowitz became a significant mentor in his later professional life.  In 1975, as a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar, Libby received his Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree from Columbia Law School. Entity:","output":"The entity this text is about is I.

Use this fact to answer the question: bacteria can cause people to become ill Bacteria can cause people to become what?","output":"Bacteria can cause people to become ill. The term 'ill' refers to a state of poor health, or a condition in which an individual's physical, mental, or emotional well-being is adversely affected. Bacteria are microscopic, single-celled organisms that can be found almost everywhere on Earth, including in soil, water, plants, animals, and humans. While many bacteria are harmless or even beneficial to humans, there are certain types of bacteria that are pathogens, meaning they can invade the human body and cause infections and illnesses. The mechanism through which bacteria cause people to become ill typically involves the bacteria entering the human body, multiplying, and releasing harmful substances called toxins. These toxins can damage tissue, cause inflammation, and interfere with the normal functioning of the body. When the immune system detects the presence of bacteria, it mounts a defense to try to eliminate the infection, which can also contribute to the symptoms of illness. Some examples of bacterial infections include strep throat (caused by Streptococcus bacteria), urinary tract infections (caused by Escherichia coli, or E. coli), and pneumonia (caused by several bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae). Bacterial infections can be mild, moderate, or severe, and they can affect various parts of the body, such as the skin, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or urinary tract. The symptoms of bacterial infections can vary widely depending on the type of bacteria and the part of the body that is affected. Some common symptoms include fever, chills, fatigue, pain, swelling, redness, and the presence of pus or other discharge. Bacterial infections can also lead to more serious complications, such as sepsis (a life-threatening systemic response to infection), organ damage, or long-term health problems. To treat bacterial infections, doctors typically prescribe antibiotics, which are medications that work by killing bacteria or inhibiting their growth. It is important to take the full course of antibiotics as prescribed by a healthcare professional to ensure that the infection is completely eradicated and to prevent the development of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. In addition to antibiotics, other supportive treatments such as rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers or fever reducers may be recommended to help alleviate symptoms. Preventing bacterial infections includes practicing good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand sanitizers, properly cooking and storing food to avoid foodborne illnesses, and keeping wounds clean and covered. Additional preventive measures may include getting vaccinated against certain bacterial infections, such as pneumococcal pneumonia, and avoiding close contact with individuals who have contagious bacterial infections. In summary, bacteria can cause people to become ill by invading the body, multiplying, and releasing harmful toxins that damage tissue and interfere with normal bodily functions. The resulting illnesses can range in severity and affect various parts of the body. Treatment typically involves antibiotics in combination with other supportive measures, and prevention strategies include good hygiene practices and receiving appropriate vaccinations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Dry soils are relatively unproductive because plants need a sufficient quantity of liquid water to carry out what process?   Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:     Choices:  - contraction  - shrinkage  - flowering  - photosynthesis   A: A:","output":"The correct answer is - photosynthesis. Plants require water to carry out photosynthesis. Photosynthesis is a crucial process where plants convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy that can be later released to fuel the organisms' activities.

Article: An Australian inventor has designed and built an environmentally friendly ferry  that uses solar and wind power to transport people around Sydney Harbor. Robert Dane and his Solar Sailor were given the top prize at the Australian Design Awards recently.      The Solar Sailor has been in use for six months. It uses four sources of energy for its power -- solar, wind, battery power with stored solar energy and a fuel generator  in store all controlled by computers. The ferry can travel up to 7.5 knots on just wind and solar power. It's solar wings and fiberglass solar panels   which not only take in sunlight and store it in batteries, but also act as sails.       \\"We angle  our solar panels to the sun in two planes , which increases the amount of energy we get from the sun by 40 percent,\\" Dane says. \\"And also we can use that same structure to do another job, which is also the sail, and so these wing sails actually push the ferry forward just like a soft sail does.\\"       Computers check the sun and wind and angle the solar wings to take in the most sunlight. If there isn't much wind or it is a cloudy day, energy stored in the batteries runs the electric motor for up to five hours. \\"If the batteries are too low, then the computer turns the generator on so the boat is always able to meet a commercial schedule, or get from point A to point B no matter what,\\" Dan explains.      Dane got his idea for the Solar Sailor from a book on insects. He was amazed how insects use their wings to collect solar energy to warm themselves.       \\"When I read that, I realized there was a good example in nature for what we were going to do, which was to use a solar wing to collect solar energy and also to sail,\\" he says. Question: We can learn from the passage   _   . - the ferry sails at a speed of 7.5 kilometers an hour - the ferry is good for the environment - four sources of energy for the ferry are controlled by Dane - solar energy needn't be stored in case of good weather Answer:","output":"the ferry is good for the environment"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bob Taft (R) yesterday pleaded no contest to charges that he violated state ethics laws, becoming the first governor in the state's history convicted of a crime and providing powerful ammunition to Democrats seeking to break the Republican Party's dominance in a critical swing state. For the past decade, Democrats have been in retreat in the Buckeye State. Republicans have won the governor's office for four consecutive terms, control both houses of the legislature and hold the other major statewide offices. Last year, Ohio was ground zero in the presidential campaign and provided the crucial electoral votes that secured President Bush's reelection victory. Political analysts said yesterday that the spreading scandal that put Taft in a Columbus courthouse, as well as public dissatisfaction over an economy whose unemployment rate is above the national average, leaves Republicans vulnerable for a potential housecleaning in next year's elections. \\"Potentially, it could be a very tough year,\\" said Eric W. Rademacher, co-director of the University of Cincinnati's Ohio Poll. Taft, who cooperated with investigators, issued a public apology after being convicted on four misdemeanor counts for failing to report 52 golf outings, dinners and other entertainment gifts. He was fined 4,000, the maximum. Taft, who by law cannot run again, said he will not resign. \\"There are no words to express the deep remorse that I feel over the embarrassment that I have caused for my administration and for the people of the state of Ohio,\\" Taft said after the sentencing. \\"I offer my sincere and heartfelt apology, and I hope the people will understand that these mistakes, though major and important mistakes, were done unintentionally, and I hope and pray they will accept my apology.\\" Among the golf outings were two from Tom Noe, a prominent Republican fundraiser and rare coin dealer who is at the heart of a larger scandal involving the Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation, which invested approximately 50 million in rare coins through Noe. Investigators later found 10 million to 13 million was missing, sending GOP officials scampering to escape the taint of association with Noe. The Taft name is one of the most storied in the history of Republican politics. His father and grandfather were both U.S. senators, and his great-grandfather, William Howard Taft, served both as president and as chief justice of the United States. But in office, Taft has struggled constantly. With the news of his reporting failures, his approval rating has plunged below 20 percent, the lowest of any governor in the nation. Republicans blamed Taft's unpopularity and the coin scandal for the surprisingly close outcome in a special House election in southwest Ohio this month. In that race, Democrat Paul Hackett, an Iraq war veteran and harsh critic of Bush, came within 5,000 votes of defeating Republican Jean Schmidt in a district Bush won with 64 percent of the vote. Rademacher said the challenge for Republicans next year will be to convince voters that the problems that have left them so unhappy are the fault of the Taft administration, not the GOP itself. \\"One of the real questions for all of us for next year is . . . whether or not their focus is on the governor's office or all the statewide offices up for election next year,\\" he said. The Democrats' top priorities appear to be the governor's office and the office of secretary of state, which oversees elections and which became a focal point of Democrats' anger last year because the incumbent, Republican J. Kenneth Blackwell, also chaired the Bush-Cheney campaign in the state. Congressional Democrats also are targeting Republican Rep. Robert W. Ney, whose association with indicted Washington lobbyist Jack Abramoff has tied him to charges of GOP corruption. On Wednesday, Chillicothe Mayor Joseph P. Sulzer, a Democrat, announced his candidacy for the House seat. Senate Democratic campaign officials have been seeking to recruit someone to run against Republican Sen. Mike DeWine, but on Wednesday, heavily recruited Rep. Sherrod Brown announced he would not run. Some grass-roots Democrats want Hackett to run for the Senate. However vulnerable Republicans may be, Democrats can't count on scandal alone to change their fortunes. \\"Their party structure is not well funded or well organized,\\" said John C. Green, director of the Ray C. Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron. \\"Even if the situation turned out to be very bad for the Republicans next year, from the vantage point of today, it would seem unlikely that the Democrats would sweep a large proportion of the offices.\\"","output":"Ohio Governor Bob Taft pleaded no contest to charges of violating state ethics laws, making him the first governor in Ohio's history to be convicted of a crime. This case provides ammunition to Democrats seeking to challenge the Republican Party's dominance in the critical swing state.

Democrats are hoping this vulnerability could lead to significant changes in next year's elections.

It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is likely true about President Trump? OPT: (I) He is not bothered or nervous about the controversies he is currently experiencing during his presidency.. (II) not enough information. (III) He has only faced controversy during his presidency.. (IV) He has faced several instances of controversy and allegations throughout his life..

Question: Process: - A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth - The oxygen travels into the body - Breaks down into glucose - Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown - The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth.  Question: suppose more oxygen is inhaled happens, how will it affect more carbon dioxide is produced.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"In order to answer this question correctly, it is essential to have a clear understanding of the process of respiration in the human body. To begin, let us first explain each step of the process you have mentioned and then discuss the relationship between oxygen intake, glucose breakdown, and carbon dioxide production. 1. A person takes in oxygen through their nose or mouth: Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nostrils during inhalation. This oxygen-rich air then travels through the respiratory system, including the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles, until it reaches the alveoli, which are small sacs in the lungs specialized for gas exchange. 2. The oxygen travels into the body: Once in the alveoli, oxygen diffuses across the alveolar and capillary membranes, entering the bloodstream where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 3. Breaks down into glucose: This step may be a bit confusing, as the breakdown of glucose, not oxygen, is the main process in cellular respiration. Oxygen is essential for the breakdown of glucose in cells, which produces energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This process occurs in the mitochondria and is known as aerobic respiration. It involves a series of metabolic reactions, including glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain, which all contribute to the production of ATP. 4. Carbon dioxide is produced by the glucose breakdown: During the breakdown of glucose, carbon dioxide (CO2) is generated as a waste byproduct. CO₂ also needs to be transported out of the cell and into the bloodstream, where it eventually diffuses into the alveoli. 5. The carbon dioxide is exhaled out of the body through the nose or mouth: Once carbon dioxide reaches the alveoli, it diffuses back across the alveolar and capillary membranes for exhalation, removing it from the body. Now, let's consider the hypothetical situation where more oxygen is inhaled and its effect on the production of carbon dioxide. In general, breathing in more oxygen would not necessarily result in a direct increase in the amount of carbon dioxide produced or ATP generation. The amount of glucose breakdown and subsequent energy production depends on various factors, including bodily needs (e.g., during physical activity, resting, etc.), and the availability of substrates like glucose, fatty acids, and amino acids to fuel these processes. Unless there is an increase in metabolic demand for energy production, inhaling more oxygen would not necessarily accelerate the rate of glucose breakdown and consequently the production of carbon dioxide. However, if the body does require more energy, either due to higher physical or metabolic activity, and increased oxygen intake is available accordingly, then the rate of glucose breakdown may increase in response. This, in turn, would lead to higher carbon dioxide production as a waste byproduct during this process. In such cases, the relationship between oxygen intake and carbon dioxide production would follow option A: more. It is also essential to consider that breathing in more oxygen than required (i.e., hyperventilation) may disturb the balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body and create other complications. The body's respiratory system is designed to match oxygen consumption with carbon dioxide production to maintain an optimal balance for the proper functioning of cells and tissues. In conclusion, the relationship between oxygen intake and carbon dioxide production depends on the activity level and other factors related to the energy demands of the body. In situations where energy demands are increased, and more oxygen is available, carbon dioxide production may also increase. However, in a resting state or without an increase in metabolic demand, additional oxygen intake does not necessarily lead to more carbon dioxide production."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: For your weave, you’ll at need at least two packages of wefts of human hair in a color coordinating your natural hue. You’ll also need curved sewing needles, weave thread that matches the hair color, a wig cap, and a pick or fine tooth comb for separating sections of hair. When you finish weaving in a weft of hair, you’ll cut the excess with a pair of shears, so have those on hand as well. Measure about 1-inch down the perimeter braid from the first knot you made, and repeat the process. Hook the needle under the braid, pull it through the other side, and tug to pull the loose thread tight. Before the thread between the two knots has been tightened all the way though, wrap the needle around it twice near where you inserted it, and pull tight. This will give you your second knot. Repeat this same process all the way around the perimeter braid.  Each knot should be about 1 inch (2.5 cm) apart from each other. Make sure that your knots and thread are pulled tight, so that your cap is firmly attached to your braids. When you’ve sewn the wig cap around the perimeter braid, you’ll complete the ‘loop’ by sewing around the outside of your part. Starting from your last knot on the perimeter braid, skip up to the next row of braids on your head. Repeat the knot-tying process, and then go up to the next row. By the time you’ve sewn around the part, you should have a large ‘U’ shape of knots. Make sure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Finish off by tying two knots at the base of your sewing, where you started on the perimeter braid.  The finishing knots should be the same as the other knots you’ve been sewing the whole time. Cut the extra string off as close to the knot as you are able, without cutting the knot.","output":"To summarize, in order to create a weave, gather the necessary supplies, which include at least two packages of human hair wefts, curved sewing needles, matching weave thread, a wig cap, a pick or fine-tooth comb, and shears. Begin by attaching the wig cap to your perimeter braid, approximately 1-inch from the first knot. Use the curved sewing needle and weave thread to create knots evenly spaced around the perimeter braid, ensuring each knot is about 1 inch apart and tight enough to hold the cap firmly. Once the wig cap is securely attached to the perimeter braid, start sewing around the outline of your hair part using the same knot-tying method as before. Move up to the next row of braids, creating a 'U' shape of knots. Ensure that each knot is at least 1-inch away from the center part. Complete the process by tying two finishing knots at the base of your sewing, where you began on the perimeter braid, and trim the extra string close to the knot without cutting it.

Her career has spanned over 30 years. Her debut solo album She's So Unusual (1983) Context: Lauper was born at Boulevard Hospital in Astoria, Queens, New York City, to a Catholic family. Her father, Fred, was of German and Swiss descent. Her mother, Catrine (nee Gallo), is Italian American (from Sicily). Lauper's siblings are younger brother Fred (nicknamed Butch), and older sister, Ellen. Lauper's parents divorced when she was five. Her mother remarried and divorced again.  Lauper grew up in the Ozone Park neighborhood of Queens and, as a child, listened to such artists as The Beatles, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland and Billie Holiday. At age 12, she began writing songs and playing an acoustic guitar given to her by her sister.  Lauper expressed herself with a variety of hair colors, eccentric clothing and even took a friend's advice to spell her name as \\"Cyndi\\" rather than \\"Cindy\\".  Lauper went to Richmond Hill High School, but was expelled, although she later earned her GED. She left home at 17, to escape her abusive stepfather, intending to study art. Her journey took her to Canada, where she spent two weeks in the woods with her dog Sparkle, trying to find herself. She eventually traveled to Vermont, where she took art classes at Johnson State College and supported herself working odd jobs.  In the early 1970s, Lauper performed as a vocalist with various cover bands. One, called Doc West, covered disco songs as well as Janis Joplin. A later band, Flyer, was active in the New York metropolitan area, singing hits by bands including Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane and Led Zeppelin. Although Lauper was performing on stage, she was not happy singing covers. In 1977, Lauper damaged her vocal cords and took a year off from singing. She was told by doctors that she would never sing again, but regained her voice with the help of vocal coach Katie Agresta. Question: What music did she like as a young adult? Answer:","output":"As a young adult, Cyndi Lauper enjoyed listening to various artists and genres, including The Beatles, Ella Fitzgerald, Judy Garland, and Billie Holiday. She also performed as a vocalist with various cover bands, singing hits by bands like Bad Company, Jefferson Airplane, and Led Zeppelin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: I have known, and admired, Julia Busuttil Nishimura, for many years now and always felt connected through our love of Italian food, Tuscany (Julia lived in Florence and in Orbetello, just 10 minutes away from where we lived in Porto Ercole while I was writing Acquacotta) and Japan. So I have been eagerly awaiting her debut cookbook, Ostro: The Pleasure that Comes From Slowing Down and Cooking with Simple Ingredients, and it is a beauty — it is full of food I want to make and eat. It’s also a joy to look at, as it is presented so beautifully with photographs of Julia (and often her darling little boy Haruki) at home and tables full with food that look Caravaggesque. I have already made her everyday banana loaf, several times, after years of searching for my ideal everyday cake, it is now my go-to banana loaf. I tested her ricciarelli (soft almond cookies from Siena) and pork braised in milk (a classic Italian dish that I have always loved) when she was writing the book and I have long-known her absolutely wonderful, incredibly moist lemon olive oil cake (which is also divine with blood oranges). I absolutely love her homemade approach to everything, including all the wonderful handmade pasta like trofie and orecchiette (look at those beautiful dishes below), but also things like classic tiramisu — homemade savoiardi, homemade mascarpone (yes and yes, I absolutely believe that for the freshest, most delicious mascarpone, it needs to be homemade especially if you live outside of Italy). Yes, these are all things you can also buy in a packet, but Julia’s point is, it is a pleasure to make these things by hand, and the ingredients are so simple — water, flour, cream, eggs, — you probably have them all in your house already. She is a woman after my own heart. Her book inspires you to give it a go. Question: who made the recipe?

It wasn't notable enough to be truly horrible, it was just incredibly lame. The story was not half bad, but the execution was just horrendous. To start with, it moved too fast for us to emotionally get involved with what was going on. It was just paced badly. The dialog was so utterly un-sparkling, just flat and boring. And the characters, cripes almightly, they made Deadpool boring. How the hell do you make Deadpool boring? He wasn't even funny. He wasn't crazy. He was just an annoying guy with a couple of swords he did not even know how to use properly. Gambit was boring. And since when did he have telekenisis to make the cards just float and fly around, or super strength to leap hundreds of feet into the air? And what the heck was up with all the stupid helicopter moves? I mean, we know they are mutants, but they still exist within the realm of physics. A round bo staff is not a helicopter blade, you cannot fly by twirling super-duper fast. Which Gambit wouldn't be able to do anyway. Nor Deadpool, especially when using it as a replacement for real fight choreography. And this film stands as proof that wire work should only be used by fight coordinators who know WTH they are doing, and know better than to use it in every. single. shot. as a replacement for real fight choreography. Three of the most physical fighters in Marvel comics (Logan, Creed, and Wilson), and some of the worst fight choreography I have ever seen in recent film memory. It was as if the stunt coordinator just shrugged his shoulders and left it all up to the special effects guys. And then you had the break out, with all these mutants who did nothing. Even mutants who had been shown in their cells to have powers (nice to see a Quicksilver nod), did f-all when they got out. Only Emma-really-lame-for-this-film-Frost and Cyclops did something.

The reviewer even draws a comparison to another film, \\"Daredevil,\\" which they perceive to have similarly disappointing qualities.

Summarize the following: Also referred to as the Destiny Number, the Expression Number highlights the personal gifts and shortcomings you brought into this world. If your Life Path reveals the road on which you walk, the Expression Number reveals the flavor and character of your steps. Considered from the perspective of reincarnation, your Life Path Number is akin to the lesson you must learn this lifetime. Connected to this, your Expression Number reflects the core being - including your personal history from any past lifetimes - that you brought with you to Earth. The name is used because it represents the inborn character of the self as well as that which was passed down to you at birth. Similar to calculating your Life Path Number, we reduce the number values of each name individually before combining the results. This honors the individual character your name's (and self's) different facets before uncovering their combined meaning.      1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9    A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I    J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R    S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z As an example, we'll take the name Robert Nesta Marley.

And so Bob Marley has an Expression Number of 22. Summary:","output":"The Expression Number, also known as Destiny Number, represents one's personal gifts, shortcomings, and inherent character traits brought into this world. It works in conjunction with the Life Path Number, which reveals the road an individual walks, while the Expression Number showcases the flavor and character of their journey. From a reincarnation perspective, the Life Path Number represents the lessons to be learned in this lifetime, while the Expression Number reflects the core being and past lifetime history. To calculate the Expression Number, the number values of each letter in a person's name are reduced and then combined. This process acknowledges the unique aspects of the individual's name and self before revealing their collective meaning. Using the example of Robert Nesta Marley, his Expression Number is calculated as follows: ROBERT = 9+6+2+5+9+2 = 33 = 3+3 = 6 NESTA = 5+5+1+2+1 = 14 = 1+4 = 5 MARLEY = 4+1+9+3+5+7 = 29 = 2+9 = 11 By adding the reduced values together, we get 6+5+11 = 22.

It is composed of 12 pairs of ribs with their costal cartilages and the sternum. The ribs are anchored posteriorly to the 12 thoracic vertebrae. The sternum consists of the manubrium, body, and xiphoid process. The manubrium and body are joined at the sternal angle, which is also the site for attachment of the second ribs. Ribs are flattened, curved bones and are numbered 1–12. Posteriorly, the head of the rib articulates with the costal facets located on the bodies of thoracic vertebrae and the rib tubercle articulates with the facet located on the vertebral transverse process. The angle of the ribs forms the most posterior portion of the thoracic cage. The costal groove in the inferior margin of each rib carries blood vessels and a nerve. Anteriorly, each rib ends in a costal cartilage. True ribs (1–7) attach directly to the sternum via their costal cartilage. The false ribs (8–12) either attach to the sternum indirectly or not at all. Ribs 8–10 have their costal cartilages attached to the cartilage of the next higher rib.

Amsterdam has a population of 847,176 within the city proper, 1,343,647 in the urban area, and 2,431,000 in the Amsterdam metropolitan area. The city is located in the province of North Holland in the west of the country. The metropolitan area comprises much of the northern part of the Randstad, one of the larger conurbations in Europe, with a population of approximately 7 million.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - The Caribbean (or ) is a region that consists of the Caribbean Sea, its islands (some surrounded by the Caribbean Sea and some bordering both the Caribbean Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean) and the surrounding coasts. The region is southeast of the Gulf of Mexico and the North American mainland, east of Central America, and north of South America.  - A municipality is usually a single urban administrative division having corporate status and powers of self-government or jurisdiction as granted by national and state laws, to which it is subordinate. It is to be distinguished from the county, which may encompass rural territory and/or numerous small communities such as towns, villages and hamlets. The term \\"municipality\\" may also mean the governing or ruling body of a given municipality. A municipality is a general-purpose administrative subdivision, as opposed to a special-purpose district. The term is derived from French \\"municipalité\\" and Latin \\"municipalis\\".  - A county is a geographical region of a country used for administrative or other purposes, in certain modern nations. The term is derived from the Old French \\"conté\\" or \\"cunté\\" denoting a jurisdiction under the sovereignty of a count (earl) or a viscount. The modern French is \\"comté\\", and its equivalents in other languages are \\"contea\\", \\"contado\\", \\"comtat\\", \\"condado\\", \\"Grafschaft\\", \\"graafschap\\", \\"Gau\\", etc. (cf. \\"conte\\", \\"comte\\", \\"conde\\", \\"Graf\\").  - The Dommel is a stream in Belgium and the Netherlands, left tributary of the Dieze. It rises in north-eastern Belgium near Peer and flows into the southern part of the Netherlands. The Dommel takes in water from the Keersop, Tongelreep, Run, Gender and Kleine Dommel streams and merges at 's-Hertogenbosch with the Aa stream to form river Dieze, which subsequently flows towards the Meuse. The main cities and towns along the Dommel's course are Peer, Neerpelt, Valkenswaard, Dommelen, Eindhoven, Son en Breugel, Sint-Oedenrode, Boxtel, Sint-Michielsgestel and 's-Hertogenbosch. The most original part and natural state of the Dommel can be found between Eindhoven and Boxtel. Here the Dommel has still its original winds and meanders and forms a cultural-historical and valuable landscape area called the Dommelbeemden.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - Koninklijke Philips N.V.

The Gender was dammed short of the city centre in the 1950s and the Dommel still runs through the city. The city has a population of 223,220 in January 2015, making it the fifth-largest municipality of the Netherlands and the largest in the province of North Brabant.  - Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. The name \\"Holland\\" is also frequently used to informally refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and not entirely uncommon among the Dutch themselves, though some in the Netherlands and particularly in other regions of the country may find it undesirable, misleading or insulting.  - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries).  - Noord Brabant, also unofficially called Brabant, is a province in the south of the Netherlands. It borders the provinces of South Holland and Gelderland to the north, Limburg to the east, Zeeland to the west, and the Belgian provinces of Antwerp and Limburg to the south. The northern border follows the Meuse (Maas) river westward to its mouth in the Hollands Diep strait, part of the RhineMeuseScheldt delta. History. The Duchy of Brabant was a state of the Holy Roman Empire established in 1183 or 1190. It developed from the Landgraviate of Brabant and formed the heart of the historic Low Countries, part of the Burgundian Netherlands from 1430 and of the Habsburg Netherlands from 1482, until it was split up after the Dutch revolt. After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands.  Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794.  - Operation Market Garden (1725 September 1944) was an unsuccessful Allied military operation, fought in the Netherlands and Germany in the Second World War. The operation was split into two sub-operations:  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - Koninklijk or Koninklijke (Dutch for \\"Royal\\") is an honorary title given to certain companies and non-profit organizations in Belgium and the Netherlands, by the monarchs of each country. It was first introduced by Louis Bonaparte in 1807, then King of the Netherlands, who awarded the title to cultural associations. Companies awarded with the title may opt to use the English equivalent 'Royal' instead. It is comparable with the Royal Warrant in the UK.  - Nuenen , Gerwen en Nederwetten ( pronunciation ) is a municipality consisting of the larger village of Nuenen and two adjacent smaller ones . It is located in the province of Noord - Brabant , about 10 kilometres ( 6.2 mi ) east of Eindhoven , the fifth largest city in the Netherlands . From being a small farmers town of less than 1000 inhabitants around 1950 Nuenen grew steadily as ever more new employees of Philips and the Eindhoven University ( TUE ) chose Nuenen as their new home .  - The Kingdom of the Netherlands , commonly known as the Netherlands, is a sovereign state and constitutional monarchy with territory in western Europe and in the Caribbean.  - Rotterdam is a city in the Netherlands, located in South Holland, within the RhineMeuseScheldt river delta at the North Sea. Its history goes back to 1270 when a dam was constructed in the Rotte river by people settled around it for safety. In 1340 Rotterdam was granted city rights by the Count of Holland and slowly grew into a major logistic and economic centre. Nowadays it is home to Europe's largest port and has a population of 633,471 (city proper), ranking second in the Netherlands. The Greater Rijnmond area is home to approximately 1.4 million people and the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Area makes for the 168th most populous urban area in the world. Rotterdam is part of the yet larger Randstad conurbation with a total population of 7,100,000.  - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.  - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.  - Nuenen is a town in the municipality of Nuenen, Gerwen en Nederwetten in the Netherlands. From 1883 to 1885, Vincent van Gogh lived and worked in Nuenen. In 1944, the town was a battle scene during Operation Market Garden. The local dialect is called Peellands. In 2009, Nuenen had a population of 22,437.  - Gerard Leonardo Frederik Philips (9 October 1858  26 January 1942) was a Dutch industrialist, co-founder (with his father Frederik Philips) of the Philips Company as a family business in 1891. Gerard and his younger brother Anton Philips changed the business to a corporation by founding in 1912 the NV Philips' Gloeilampenfabrieken.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: What bonds form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons?   A: Answer:","output":"The bonds that form because they give atoms a more stable arrangement of electrons are known as chemical bonds. Chemical bonding plays a crucial role in determining the properties of substances and enabling the formation of various compounds in nature. There are several types of chemical bonds, including covalent bonds, ionic bonds, metallic bonds, and hydrogen bonds. 1. Covalent Bonds: These bonds involve the sharing of one or more pairs of electrons between two atoms so that each atom achieves a more stable electronic configuration. Typically, covalent bonds form between nonmetal atoms with similar electronegativities, resulting in the creation of stable molecules. In covalent bonding, electron-sharing assists both atoms in achieving noble gas-like electronic configurations, offering greater stability. 2. Ionic Bonds: These bonds form when electrons are transferred from one atom to another due to a significant difference in electronegativity between the two atoms. Ionic bonding commonly occurs between a metal and a nonmetal atom. When a metal atom transfers one or more electrons to a nonmetal atom, it creates positively charged ions (cations) and negatively charged ions (anions). These oppositely charged ions are attracted to one another, forming an ionic bond and leading to a stable ionic compound. 3. Metallic Bonds: These bonds occur among metal atoms, resulting in the formation of a \\"sea of electrons\\" or \\"electron cloud\\" that surrounds positively charged metal cores. In metallic bonding, valence electrons are not fixed to individual atoms; instead, they are free to move within the metallic lattice structure. This delocalization of electrons creates an electrostatic attractive force between the positively charged metal ions and the electron cloud, providing stability to the metal structure. Metallic bonds are responsible for the characteristic properties of metals, such as malleability, ductility, and electrical conductivity. 4. Hydrogen Bonds: Hydrogen bonds are a type of intermolecular force that forms between molecules containing polar covalent bonds, specifically involving hydrogen atoms bonded to highly electronegative atoms, such as nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. In hydrogen bonding, the positively charged hydrogen atom of one molecule is attracted to the negatively charged electronegative atom of another molecule. Although hydrogen bonds are weaker than covalent and ionic bonds, they play a critical role in stabilizing the structures of many compounds, particularly in biological systems. Examples of hydrogen bonding can be found in water molecules, DNA, and proteins. In conclusion, chemical bonds like covalent, ionic, metallic, and hydrogen bonds form because they allow atoms to achieve a more stable arrangement of electrons. These bonds result from the interactions between atoms due to differences in electronegativity and the need for atoms to attain a noble gas-like electronic configuration, which ensures lower energy states and increased stability."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ransom comes a week after U.S. journalist James Foley was beheaded in a propaganda video for ISIS. Group has threatened to execute fellow-journalist Steven Sotloff next. Article:","output":"Title: Islamist Militants Kidnap American Aid Worker in Syria, Demand Ransom and Release of Aafia Siddiqui The rise of extremist groups in volatile regions has led to an increasing number of abductions targeting foreign aid workers and journalists in recent years. One such group, the notorious terrorist organization known as ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria), has demanded a ransom payment in exchange for the release of an American aid worker kidnapped from Syria last year. The identity of the hostage has been withheld at the request of her family, due to concerns for her safety.  ISIS has not only sought a monetary ransom for the release of the aid worker, but has also demanded the release of neuroscientist Aafia Siddiqui, a Pakistani national who is currently being held in Texas. She is serving an 86-year sentence after being convicted of multiple felonies, including assault and attempted murder of U.S. personnel in Afghanistan. The demand for ransom and Siddiqui's release comes in the wake of the brutal beheading of American journalist James Foley, which was captured on film and used as a propaganda video by ISIS. The group has threatened to carry out the same gruesome fate for a fellow journalist named Steven Sotloff, whose life now hangs in the balance. The reason for ISIS demanding the release of Aafia Siddiqui, who has been dubbed \\"Lady al-Qaeda,\\" remains unclear. Siddiqui is a highly educated neuroscientist who studied at Brandeis University and MIT. Many speculate that her knowledge and expertise in the field may be perceived as useful for the terrorist group in their ongoing campaign of violence and destruction. The recent kidnapping and ransom demands reveal the relentless tactics employed by ISIS, exploiting civilians' vulnerability in war-torn areas and generating fear. Abducting aid workers and journalists is a particularly insidious method, as these individuals are often present in conflict zones to provide humanitarian assistance and report on the situation affecting innocent civilians. In the midst of this harrowing situation, governments have been forced to grapple with a pressing ethical dilemma: when faced with ransom demands from extremist groups, should they pay the price to secure the hostages' safe return? While yielding to these demands may save lives in the short term, some argue that it only serves to fuel terrorism by providing financial and tactical support. As such, many nations, including the United States and the United Kingdom, adhere to policies of non-negotiation with terrorists, even at the risk of hostages losing their lives. The plight of the American aid worker and the journalists held by ISIS has brought the world's attention to the terrifying reality facing those who venture into the heart of conflict regions. An international response is needed to address the root causes of terrorist activity, not just react to the symptoms. Furthermore, we must acknowledge and honor the bravery and dedication of individuals like the kidnapped aid worker, whose tireless efforts in difficult circumstances often put their own lives at risk. As Islamist militants continue to terrorize innocent civilians, it is crucial that the international community takes swift and decisive action to dismantle these extremist networks, protect vulnerable populations, and ensure that those who selflessly devote their lives to the aid and understanding of others can do so without fearing for their own safety."},{"instruction":"Q:Information:  - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa.

Oakland Athletics general manager Billy Beane is upset by his team's loss to the New York Yankees in the 2001 postseason. With the impending departure of star players Johnny Damon, Jason Giambi, and Jason Isringhausen to free agency, Beane needs to assemble a competitive team for 2002, but must overcome Oakland's limited payroll.During a visit to the Cleveland Indians, Beane meets Peter Brand, a young Yale economics graduate with radical ideas about how to assess players' value. Beane tests Brand's theory by asking whether he would have drafted him (out of high school), Beane having been a Major League player before becoming general manager. Though scouts considered Beane a phenomenal prospect, his career in the Major Leagues was disappointing. After some prodding, Brand admits that he would not have drafted him until the ninth round and surmised that Beane would probably have accepted a scholarship to Stanford instead. Impressed, Beane hires the inexperienced Brand to be the Athletics assistant general manager.Oakland team scouts are first dismissive and then hostile towards Brand's non-traditional sabermetric approach to scouting players. Most notably, Grady Fuson aggressively confronts Beane, causing him to be fired. Grady then takes to the radio airwaves and doubts the team's future. Rather than relying on the scouts' experience and intuition, Brand selects players based almost exclusively on their on-base percentage (OBP). Beane signs the ones Brand suggests, such as unorthodox submarine pitcher Chad Bradford, past-his-prime outfielder David Justice, and injured Scott Hatteberg. Beane also faces opposition from Art Howe, the Athletics' manager, who does not agree with the new philosophy. With tensions already high between the two due to a contract dispute, Howe disregards Beane's and Brand's strategy and plays a lineup he prefers.Early in the season, the Athletics fare poorly, leading critics to dismiss the new method as a failure. Beane convinces the owner to stay the course. He trades away the lone traditional first baseman, Carlos PeÃ±a, to force Howe to use Hatteberg at that position, threatening to make similar deals if Howe won't cooperate. The A's win 19 consecutive games, tying for the longest winning streak in American League history. Beane's young daughter implores him to go to a game against the Kansas City Royals, where Oakland is already leading 11â0 after the third inning and appears set to win a record-breaking 20th game in a row. Like many baseball players, Beane is superstitious and avoids games in progress, but upon hearing how well the game is going on the radio, he decides to go. Beane arrives in the fourth inning, only to watch the team falter and eventually allow the Royals to even the score at 11. Finally, the A's do win, on a walk-off home run by Hatteberg.After celebrating that, however, the A's again lose in the postseason, this time to the Minnesota Twins. Beane is disappointed, believing nothing short of a championship should be considered a success. He is contacted by the owner of the Boston Red Sox, who realizes that the sabermetric model is the future of baseball. Beane declines an opportunity to be GM of the Red Sox, despite the 12.5 million salary, which would have made him the highest-paid general manager in sports history. He returns to Oakland, while an epilogue reveals that two years later, the Red Sox won the 2004 World Series, using the model pioneered by the Athletics., Question: Where did Beane meet Peter Brand?

Given the question: Robert and John both went to the doctor because they had been having stomach problems. The doctor decided to take images of the men's jejunum to try and diagnose the issues. He discovered that Robert has more villi covering his jejunum compared to John.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients?  Hint: The jejunum is the second part of the small intestine, where most nutrients are absorbed into the blood. As shown in Figure below , the mucous membrane lining the jejunum is covered with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi (singular, villus). Villi contain many capillaries, and nutrients pass from the villi into the bloodstream through the capillaries. Because there are so many villi, they greatly increase the surface area for absorption. In fact, they make the inner surface of the small intestine as large as a tennis court! The answer is:","output":"Given the information from the paragraph, it states that the jejunum is lined with millions of microscopic, fingerlike projections called villi, and these villi greatly increase the surface area for absorption of nutrients. Since Robert has more villi covering his jejunum compared to John, it can be concluded that Robert has more surface area available for absorption of nutrients.

Question: What language was replaced in Central Asia? Context: The geographical regions in which Iranian languages were spoken were pushed back in several areas by newly neighbouring languages. Arabic spread into some parts of Western Iran (Khuzestan), and Turkic languages spread through much of Central Asia, displacing various Iranian languages such as Sogdian and Bactrian in parts of what is today Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. In Eastern Europe, mostly comprising the territory of modern-day Ukraine, southern European Russia, and parts of the Balkans, the core region of the native Scythians, Sarmatians, and Alans had been decisively been taken over as a result of absorption and assimilation (e.g. Slavicisation) by the various Proto-Slavic population of the region, by the 6th century AD. This resulted in the displacement and extinction of the once predominant Scythian languages of the region. Sogdian's close relative Yaghnobi barely survives in a small area of the Zarafshan valley east of Samarkand, and Saka as Ossetic in the Caucasus, which is the sole remnant of the once predominant Scythian languages in Eastern Europe proper and large parts of the North Caucasus.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Today is a new year. A new start. Fresh beginnings. I am inspired in the name of that optimism to share something with my readership today: I’m not doing well. In fact, I’m really struggling. I’ve been extremely overwhelmed recently, in a lot of different ways. I think it’s time to share that with all of you in the hopes that speaking my truth will allow me to move forward– and also in the hopes that anybody else who is trying to hold it all together with similarly emotional results will know it’s ok to let go– to accept help, forgive themselves, and to move towards a solution.      So here it is, I’m in an emotionally bad place, for reasons I will explain. I’m depleted and anxious, and I haven’t been giving my anxiety and feelings the attention they deserve for a little while now. I’ve been hoping that powering through would get me to the other side, but I’ve finally realized that feelings don’t work like that. Nice try, Martino! Lol.      I’m the type of personality who tries my hardest to be optimistic and fight through, but as my husband put so well a couple of days ago, sometimes fighting emotion is like quicksand– the more you fight, the more it grabs you until eventually it pulls you under. Here is my effort to unclutch, to stop furiously pedaling, to share and to move forward. But first, I have to share with you something that happened to our family in November that has deeply affected all of us, and that I have been practically too emotional to speak of since.      A couple of days after Thanksgiving, our Night Nurse fell asleep while holding Major and dropped him, and he cracked his head on the hardwood floor. Kyle and I were sleeping at the time and were awoken by the sound of his head hitting the floor, and then hysterical piercing screams. He suffered a fractured skull and bleeding on his brain, and was transported by ambulance to Yale Medical Center where I spent two harrowing days with him to receive emergency care and further testing. To say these were the most traumatic and anxious two days of my life is an understatement. If you read my post about choosing Homebirth, you know that I have an (irrational) phobia of Hospitals. To be in one for two days under such circumstances was nearly unbearable for me, not to mention how scary and emotional those days were for the entirety of our family.      But here’s the good part: by the grace of all of his many angels, and every God one cares to pray to, MAJOR IS FINE. Completely fine. Though he had the fracture, some skull displacement, and bleeding, the skull did not touch his brain and the bleeding was localized. Further MRI’s showed no brain damage and we were discharged by experts in pediatrics and neurology with as excellent of a prognosis as we could have ever hoped for. We were absolutely, divinely lucky that day. He had no other broken bones, and no spinal effects whatsoever. He has been healing well, hitting milestones, cooing, smiling, and generally showing us that he is and will be ok as he grows and develops.      So why didn’t I share this when it happened? A couple of reasons. First of all, the accident traumatized all of us. It was so sudden, and so scary, and the idea of sharing it almost felt like it would make it all that much more real– all of the risks and the dangers. I wanted to make sure that he was definitely OK before I shared what had happened, so that I could have some good news to celebrate. I don’t know if this reaction will make sense to a lot of people, it hardly makes sense to me, but that’s what I was (or wasn’t) capable of at the time. The second reason I chose not to share was fear of judgement. The internet can be a peculiar place, where some people forget about humanity and go for the jugular. I know that this news might reach many, and of those many there will always be the people who say that this accident was my fault. That if it had been me in there holding him instead of a Night Nurse, that this never would have happened. That I deserve this for allowing my child to be in the care of somebody other than me. Well, let me tell you– the guilt I bore in the days and weeks after this accident was more intense and more damaging than anything I would wish upon my worst enemy. I had all those same thoughts and more. I wept in the hospital, telling anyone who would listen that it should have been me. That I was to blame. The truth is, even this woman who came so highly recommended, with a perfectly clean track record, could make a very human mistake. It “could happen to anyone”, and as they told me repeatedly in the hospital, it DOES happen to anyone. More often than you’d like to hear. Obviously, the (extremely upset and remorseful) nurse is no longer working for our family, though we forgive her. And even though I finally made peace with the fact that this freak accident could not have been avoided by me, it has continued to effect me to my core and in all aspects of my daily life.      It’s nearly impossible for me to trust anyone but myself to take care of Major now. We definitely don’t have night time help anymore, but it has only been in the past week or so that I have felt comfortable with somebody coming during the day to help me with him so that I can complete normal tasks and work responsibilities. Hearing Major cry hard immediately triggers my memories of the moments after the accident and instigates an immediate panic attack– my heart races and tears spring to my eyes. Sometimes I get dizzy spells. I feel nauseous and overwhelmed and even small discomforts he has make me anxious. My appetite has decreased to nothing, I have a hard time getting to sleep after night time feedings, and my milk supply goes up and down depending on the stresses of the day. Any time we are near an edge or a ledge, I fear that he will fall, somehow, and be hurt again. Just last week, we were on the second floor of a Starbucks, and I sat there panicked and frozen as I imagined Major falling from my arms over the edge of the banister and on to the floor below. My brain played back the sound of his screams that night. I had to close my eyes and clench my teeth as the waves of nausea eventually subsided. To cope through all of this the past month, I had been trying to breathe, to talk myself down, to remind myself that my son is alright, that we are all alright. But while we were in Charleston on our Christmas vacation, Marlowe had a fall on the playground. She was trying to go down the slide and fell on to the ground on her back, knocking the wind out of her. Within ten minutes she was totally fine and normal– but I stood there while Kyle held me, sobbing and shaking, while my scared two year old watched. It was then that I really realized that I am not okay. And, unfortunately, trying to push through these experiences and feelings, keep up with work and with my parental responsibilities, has just pushed me deeper in the quicksand. I’ve been easily overwhelmed, and between follow up doctor visits for Major, and the stresses of learning our rhythm as a family of four, I have felt most of my other responsibilities slipping through the cracks. I think I need to take some things off of my plate. It’s time to really face this all and find a solution.      My instinct tells me that I have some form of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, possibly linked to some form of Postpartum Depression. I was only three weeks postpartum when my husband fell off the roof of our house while cleaning the gutters (I shared this on Instagram when it happened, in case you missed it) and could have easily been killed or paralyzed according to the ER doctors. In another miraculous stroke of luck, he walked out of the ER with minor injuries. Just two weeks later was when Major had his accident. My hormones were still not stable from the birth, and I suspect that all of this in succession probably triggered something. I’m not a doctor and I haven’t been diagnosed by anyone, so I don’t know for sure. Even typing those words scares me and makes me realize that there may be a longer road ahead to feel better than I would hope for. But I know that the way I’m feeling, though understandable and human, is not normal. My husband has been instrumental the past week in helping me acknowledge this. He has held me and loved me unconditionally enough to convince me that facing all of this will end in relief and not in disaster. I’m choosing to trust that. I finally feel secure enough to admit that it is possible for me to feel better than I do today. I deserve that, and my family deserves that. I’m going to focus on working with a therapist who can help me find better coping mechanisms than what I can come up with on my own, and who will hopefully help me understand a way forward. I have somehow retained a lot of optimism and humor through these challenges, and there have been many moments in the past month where I have found silver linings in the day– but the storm under the surface has been brewing to a point that I can no longer ignore.      So what does this mean for the blog? I’m going to take the next couple of weeks off to focus on myself and my family. I have a couple of posts in the pipeline that I will be releasing (one about breastfeeding and the other involves a super cute Marlowe VIDEO!) but otherwise I’m going to be tuning in to what I need to do to get back on my feet. I know that once I dedicate myself fully to understanding what I’m going through that I will begin to get better. Even writing this and speaking my truth today has parted the clouds a bit. On my blog, I have always maintained that true happiness can be found even amidst chaos and imperfection. That it is these ups and downs that make us great parents and good people. I have never believed this more than I do now. I believe that my challenges and struggles the past month have shown me the depths of my strength, and that handling my shortcomings gracefully will make me grow as a woman and as a Mom. I can only hope that this is true.      With open arms, I welcome 2017 as the year I learn to forgive a little deeper, to let go a little more easily, to accept some things I cannot change, and to love myself a lot more unconditionally. To anybody else who is suffering from similar feelings or challenges, no matter the cause– I am with you in this. Let’s get better. It’s time.      Thank you all for your support the past month, your kind words, and your voices– even when you didn’t know that I needed help, you all helped me so much. Peace, peace, peace, my friends. See you all very soon.      Happy New Year!

It does not specify who won or how many games were won. Step 3: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that \\"they\\" (a team) won a single game at the Women's World Cup.  Step 4: Compare the two statements The premise confirms a Women's World Cup win, while the hypothesis narrows it down to a single game won by a team.  Step 5: Determine if the hypothesis can be concluded from the premise Since the premise only states a win in the Women's World Cup, it can be considered that at least one game was won. In this context, the hypothesis states that they won a single game, which is a possible specific case derived from the more general premise. Conclusion: Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true (Women's World Cup win), then the hypothesis (They won a single game at the Women's World Cup) is also true, as winning the Women's World Cup would imply winning at least one game."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: SEOUL — The U.S. has indicated it is prepared to open the North Korean economy to significant private investment, if a nuclear deal can be reached. But even if economic restrictions were lifted, the restrictive and repressive state would likely still present a challenging environment for foreign investment. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Sunday that if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un complies with what President Donald Trump has demanded, the complete, verifiable, and irreversible denuclearization of North Korea, the United States would offer foreign investment “in spades” to build up the country’s infrastructure and develop its economy. “This will be Americans coming in, private sector Americans, not the U.S. taxpayer, private sector Americans coming in to help build out the energy grid. They need enormous amounts of electricity in North Korea; to work with them to develop infrastructure, all the things that the North Korean people need, the capacity for American agriculture to support North Korea, so they can eat meat and have healthy lives,” said Pompeo during an interview on the Fox News Sunday program. The Secretary of State recently returned from a trip to Pyongyang, where he meet with the North Korean leader to prepare for the upcoming Trump-Kim summit that will be held in Singapore on June 12. North Korea also released three American prisoners to Pompeo as a humanitarian gesture in advance of the summit. The Trump administration is increasingly optimistic it can work out an agreement to dismantle the North’s nuclear program, its advanced ballistic missile arsenal, and chemical weapons capabilities, so as to no longer threaten the U.S. or it is allies. During the recent North-South summit, Kim committed to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and indicated that he seeks an end to the severe U.S.-led sanctions banning 90 percent of North Korean trade that were imposed for his country’s repeated nuclear and missile tests. “They obviously want to make concessions, a lot of...

Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be concluded that most nutrients are washed into ocean water from land. This implies that water closer to the shore tends to have a higher concentration of nutrients due to the proximity to the land where the nutrients originate from. Now, considering the given scenario where Mona is in her sailboat and takes two samples of ocean water – one close to the shore and the other far away from the shore, the paragraph's information can be used to infer which sample will have fewer nutrients. As mentioned earlier, water closer to shore tends to have more nutrients. Thus, by contrast, water far away from the shore would have comparatively fewer nutrients than the water found near the shore.

Since the number of desks and bookcases is equal, we have D = B. The total length of the desks is 2D meters, and the total length of the bookcases is 1.5B meters. Since the desks and bookcases are to be placed along a 15-meter wall, we have the following equation: 2D + 1.5B = 15 Since D = B, we can substitute B for D in the equation: 2D + 1.5D = 15 3.5D = 15 Now, we solve for D: D = 15 / 3.5 D = 4.2857... Since we can't have a fraction of a desk or bookcase, we need to round down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, we can fit 4 desks and 4 bookcases along the wall.

First, we simplify sqrt{2} as 2^{frac{1}{2}}. Next, we simplify 4^{frac{1}{3}}. Since 4 = 2^2, this term becomes (2^2)^{frac{1}{3}} = 2^{frac{2}{3}}. Then, we simplify sqrt[6]{32}. Since 32 = 2^5, this term becomes (2^5)^{frac{1}{6}} = 2^{frac{5}{6}}. Now, we can combine all the terms with base 2 by adding their exponents:  2^{frac{1}{2}} cdot 2^{frac{2}{3}} cdot 2^{frac{5}{6}} = 2^{frac{1}{2} + frac{2}{3} + frac{5}{6}} = 2^{frac{3}{6} + frac{4}{6} + frac{5}{6}} = 2^2 = 4.

For a parabola in the form x^{2}=2py, the equation of the latus rectum is y=- frac{p}{2}. 2. As the latus rectum is tangent to the ellipse, we know that the y-coordinate of the point of tangency is the same for both curves. Since the parabola opens upwards and the latus rectum is below the x-axis, the point of tangency is on the lower half of the ellipse.

First, let's consider the equation 2x + y = 13. We can express y in terms of x: y = 13 - 2x Now, let's consider the inequality |y| <= 13. This inequality means that y can range from -13 to 13, inclusive. Since y must be an integer, we can substitute integer values for y into the equation y = 13 - 2x and solve for x to see if x is also an integer. Let's start with y = -13 and go up to y = 13, checking each value to see if it results in an integer value for x. For y = -13: 13 - 2x = -13 2x = 26 x = 13 For y = -12: 13 - 2x = -12 2x = 25 x = 12.5 (not an integer, so this is not a solution) We can continue this process for each integer value of y from -13 to 13. However, we can notice a pattern: for y to be an integer, x must also be an integer because y is expressed as 13 minus twice an integer. Therefore, we only need to consider the values of y that will result in an integer x. Since y = 13 - 2x, for x to be an integer, 2x must be an even number because it is being subtracted from an odd number (13). Therefore, y must also be an odd number.

This is a parabola that opens downwards because the coefficient of x^2 is negative. The vertex form of a quadratic function is y=a(x-h)^2+k, where (h,k) is the vertex of the parabola. For our function, the axis of symmetry can be found using the formula x=frac{-b}{2a}, where a and b are the coefficients from the quadratic equation in the form ax^2+bx+c.    - Here, a=-1 and b=1, so the axis of symmetry is x=frac{-1}{2(-1)}=frac{1}{2}. 2. **Determine the Interval Where y Increases:**    - Since the parabola opens downwards and the axis of symmetry is at x=frac{1}{2}, y increases as x increases for x<frac{1}{2}. This means that the interval ends at x=frac{1}{2}, so a+3=frac{1}{2}, leading to a=-frac{5}{2}. 3. **Find the Intersection with the Line y=-4:**    - To find the common points with the line y=-4, we set the function equal to -4: -4=-x^{2}+x+2.    - Solving this equation, we rearrange it to x^2-x-6=0, which factors (or can be solved using the quadratic formula) to find x=-2 or x=3. We discard x=3 because it does not fall within the interval where y is increasing as x increases based on the parabola's shape and the axis of symmetry. 4. **Determine the Range of a:**    - Since the graph must have a common point with the line y=-4 within the interval aleqslant xleqslant a+3, and we found x=-2 to be a valid solution, the minimum value of a must allow -2 to be within this interval. Thus, the minimum a can be is when a=-2-3=-5.    - We already determined that the maximum value of a is -frac{5}{2} from the condition a+3=frac{1}{2}.

Therefore, the speed of person A is 4x = 4 times frac{20}{3} = boxed{frac{80}{3}} kilometers per hour. Answer: The speed of person A is boxed{frac{80}{3}} kilometers per hour, and the speed of person B is boxed{frac{20}{3}} kilometers per hour. (2) The time taken for person B to complete the entire journey and meet is 100 div frac{20}{3} = 15 hours. The time taken for person A to complete the entire journey is 100 div frac{80}{3} = frac{15}{4} hours. Let's denote the time of the second encounter as a hours. Since person A would have already turned back after reaching town B and person B is still on the way to town A, we have [frac{20}{3} a = frac{80}{3} left(a - frac{15}{4}right)] Solving for a,  [a = 5] Next, let the time of the third encounter be b hours.

Prove that the network administration can divide users into groups so that the following conditions are met:   each user is in exactly one group  each group is connected in the above sense  one of the groups contains from  1  to  100  members and the remaining from  100  to  900 .","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    We are given a connected graph ( G ) where each vertex (user) has at most 10 neighbors (friends). We need to partition the vertices into groups such that:    - Each user is in exactly one group.    - Each group is connected.    - One group has between 1 and 100 members, and the remaining groups have between 100 and 900 members. 2. **Constructing a Spanning Tree:**    Since ( G ) is connected, we can construct a spanning tree ( T ) of ( G ). A spanning tree is a subgraph that includes all the vertices of ( G ) and is a tree (connected and acyclic). 3. **Degree Constraint:**    In the spanning tree ( T ), the degree of any vertex ( v ) is at most 10, i.e., ( deg_T(v) leq 10 ). 4. **Defining Subtree Sizes:**    Let ( u_0 ) be the root of ( T ). For any vertex ( v ) in ( T ), let ( V(v) ) denote the number of vertices in the subtree rooted at ( v ). 5. **Finding the Critical Vertex:**    We start from the leaves and move towards the root ( u_0 ). Let ( v_0 ) be the first vertex encountered such that ( V(v_0) > 900 ). This means the subtree rooted at ( v_0 ) has more than 900 vertices. 6. **Analyzing the Subtree:**    The vertex ( v_0 ) is connected to at most 9 upward vertices ( v_i ) (since ( deg_T(v_0) leq 10 )). If ( V(v_i) leq 900 ) for all ( i in {1, 2, ldots, 9} ), then we can find a subtree with size between 100 and 900. 7. **Partitioning the Tree:**    If ( V(v_i) > 900 ) for some ( i ), we continue moving up the tree until we find a vertex ( v_0 ) such that ( V(v_i) leq 900 ) for all vertices ( v_i ) above ( v_0 ). 8. **Removing Subtrees:**    We can remove subtrees one by one, ensuring that each removed subtree has between 100 and 900 vertices. This process ensures that the remaining vertices also form a connected subtree. 9. **Ensuring the Small Group:**    Finally, we ensure that one of the groups has between 1 and 100 members. This can be done by carefully selecting the subtrees to remove, ensuring that the remaining vertices form a group of the desired size. By following these steps, we can partition the graph ( G ) into groups that meet the given conditions.

We want to choose 3 pieces out of these 18, regardless of what type they are. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula dbinom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. For our case, n=18 and r=3, so we have: [ dbinom{18}{3} = frac{18!}{3!(18-3)!} = frac{18!}{3!15!} = 816 ] This is the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware from the drawer. **Step 2: Calculating the Numerator** Next, we need to calculate the number of ways to specifically choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife. Since there are 6 of each type in the drawer, the number of ways to choose one fork is 6, the number of ways to choose one spoon is also 6, and the number of ways to choose one knife is again 6. Therefore, the total number of ways to choose one of each type is the product of these numbers: [ 6 cdot 6 cdot 6 = 216 ] This is the number of ways to choose one fork, one spoon, and one knife from the drawer. **Step 3: Calculating the Probability** Finally, the probability of choosing one fork, one spoon, and one knife when choosing 3 pieces of silverware from the drawer is the ratio of the number of ways to do so (the numerator) to the total number of ways to choose 3 pieces of silverware (the denominator).

We will analyze the pattern by considering the effect of each additional radius and the secant line. 1. **Base Case Analysis**:    - When n = 0, there are no radii, and the secant line does not exist. Thus, the disk remains whole, and there is only 1 area.    - When n = 1, there are 2 radii and 1 secant line. The radii divide the disk into 2 semicircles, and the secant line, crossing both radii, divides each semicircle into two parts, resulting in 4 areas.    - When n = 2, there are 4 radii, dividing the disk into 4 sectors. The secant line can be arranged to cross through 2 sectors completely, dividing each into two parts, resulting in 7 areas. 2. **General Case Analysis**:    - Each additional pair of radii (increasing n by 1) adds 2 more radii to the disk. These additional radii increase the number of sectors by 2.    - The secant line, optimally placed, should intersect as many different sectors as possible. When it crosses through n sectors, it maximizes the number of additional areas created. 3. **Pattern Recognition**:    - From the base cases, we observe that the number of areas increases by 3 for each increment of n. This suggests a linear relationship between n and the number of areas.    - The formula for the number of areas seems to be 3n + 1, where n is the number of pairs of radii. 4. **Formula Verification**:    - For n = 0, the formula gives 3(0) + 1 = 1 area.    - For n = 1, the formula gives 3(1) + 1 = 4 areas.    - For n = 2, the formula gives 3(2) + 1 = 7 areas.    - For n = 3, the formula gives 3(3) + 1 = 10 areas.    - This pattern matches the observed results from the specific cases analyzed. 5. **Conclusion**:    - The formula 3n + 1 correctly predicts the maximum number of non-overlapping areas into which the disk can be divided by 2n equally spaced radii and one secant line.

First reduction of 35%: The price is reduced by 35%, so the new price is 100 - (35% of 100) = 100 - 35 = 65. Second reduction of 10%: The price is further reduced by 10% of 65, which is 10/100 * 65 = 6.5. So the new price is 65 - 6.5 = 58.50. Third reduction of 5%: The price is further reduced by 5% of 58.50, which is 5/100 * 58.50 = 2.925. So the final price is 58.50 - 2.925 = 55.575. To find the percentage increase needed to get back to the original price of 100 from the final price of 55.575, we use the formula for percentage increase: Percentage Increase = [(Final Price - Initial Price) / Initial Price] * 100 Plugging in the values: Percentage Increase = [(100 - 55.575) / 55.575] * 100 Percentage Increase = [44.425 / 55.575] * 100 Percentage Increase ≈ 0.799 * 100 Percentage Increase ≈ 79.9% Therefore, the price of the jacket must be increased by approximately boxed{79.9%}  to restore it to its original amount after the sale period expires."},{"instruction":"Determine how many positive integers n, 1 le n le 2023, make the polynomial x^2 + x  n factorizable as the product of two linear factors with integer coefficients.","output":"To factorize x^2 + x - n into two linear factors with integer coefficients, it can be expressed as: [(x-a)(x-b) = x^2 - (a+b)x + ab,] where a and b are integers.

Just as the sword was about to touch his neck, his wife touched his neck lightly with a fan, which caused him to die from shock.    - The key point to note here is that since the officer died without waking up, no one could have known the details of his dream. Therefore, the story’s accuracy is questionable because:    - It's impossible for anyone to describe his dream as he never shared it being already dead.    **Conclusion for the First Question**: The entire story is a fabrication since the officer didn't wake up to share his dream.    blacksquare 2. **Analyzing the Second Question: Measuring Volume of Apples**    - The scenario proposes if apples were sold by cubic centimeters (cc), how would one measure the volume of a dozen dozen (144) apples.    - The method suggested is to submerge the apples in water. 3. **Steps to Determine the Volume Using Water Displacement:**        - **Step 1:** Take a container filled with a known volume of water.

For which (n) is it possible to cover them completely and without overlapping with paper strips of size (3 times 1)? The paper strips can also be glued over the edges of the cube.","output":"To solve the given problem, we need to determine for which values of ( n ) it is possible to completely cover three adjacent face sides of an ( n times n times n ) cube using paper strips of size ( 3 times 1 ), without any overlap. We need to consider the constraints on tile placement and ensure all areas are covered appropriately. First, let's clarify the problem and set up a systematic approach to coloring the ( n times n ) faces of the cube. 1. **Step 1: Coordinate Setup**    - Consider an ( n times n ) face of the cube with coordinates set such that ((1,1)) is at the common corner where the three faces meet, and ((n,n)) is the opposite, or diametric, corner.     2. **Step 2: Coloring Scheme**    - Color the squares as follows: color all squares ((a, b)) black if both (a notequiv 2 pmod{3}) and (b notequiv 2 pmod{3}). Otherwise, color the squares white.     3. **Step 3: Condition for Paper Strips**    - Note that the paper strips are of size (3 times 1). Each strip will necessarily cover an even number of black squares. This is because the length of the strip is 3 and each row or column it covers will either include 1 or 3 black squares due to our coloring method.     4. **Step 4: Calculation of Black Squares**    - We need to check the number of black squares when ( n ) is of the form:         - ( n = 3m + 1 )         - ( n = 3m + 2 )         - ( n = 3m )        - For ( n = 3m + 1 ):      The total number of black squares in one such ( n times n ) face will be ( (2m + 1)^2 ). This is calculated since the structure repeats every three rows and columns, ensuring that there’s a fixed pattern, and here we find an odd number ( 2m + 1 ) rows and columns. Calculating:      [      text{number of black squares} = (2m + 1)^2 quad (text{odd number})      ]          - For ( n = 3m + 2 ):      Similarly, the total number of black squares in one such ( n times n ) face will again be ( (2m + 1)^2 ). Calculation:      [      text{number of black squares} = (2m + 1)^2 quad (text{odd number})      ]          - For ( n = 3m ):      The number of black squares will be different and more uniform, involving ( 2m times 2m ), making it an even number. Calculation:      [      text{number of black squares} = (2m)^2 quad (text{even number})      ]     5. **Step 5: Conclusion Based on Total Black Squares:**    - Given that each ( 3 times 1 ) strip covers an even number of squares, we need the total count of black squares on all three faces combined to be even for the strips to completely cover the area.        - For ( n = 3m + 1 ) and ( n = 3m + 2 ), since each face has an odd number of black squares, the total number of black squares across three faces will be odd. Hence, it is impossible to cover all the black squares without some leftover.        - For ( n = 3m ), each face has an even number of black squares, leading to a sum that is even, making complete coverage feasible with ( 3 times 1 ) strips. Conclusively, the values of ( n ) that allow the complete and non-overlapping coverage of the three side faces of the cube using the ( 3 times 1 ) paper strips must be such that ( n ) is divisible by 3.

Find the range of the parameter a.","output":"To ensure f(x) geq 1 for all x in the interval [-1, 1], we must consider the minimum value of f(x) on this interval. We know that for a quadratic function f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, the vertex occurs at x = -frac{b}{2a}, and the function has a minimum value there when a > 0. 1. **Check the coefficient of x^2**: The coefficient of x^2 in f(x) is 1, which is positive. So, the function opens upwards and has a minimum value at the vertex.     2. **Find the vertex**: The vertex of f(x) is at x = -frac{2a}{2} = -a. We need to consider three cases: -a leq -1, -1 < -a < 1, and -a geq 1. These correspond to the vertex being to the left of the interval, within the interval, and to the right of the interval, respectively.    - **Case 1**: -a leq -1         This means a geq 1. For the case when x = -1, f(-1) = (-1)^2 + 2a(-1) + 2a + 1 = 1 - 2a + 2a + 1 = 2, which is already greater than or equal to 1. So, for a geq 1, the condition is satisfied.        - **Case 2**: -1 < -a < 1         Here, the vertex is within the interval. We check the value at the vertex, which gives us f(-a) = (-a)^2 + 2a(-a) + 2a + 1 = a^2 - 2a^2 + 2a + 1 = 1 - a^2 + 2a.         For this to be greater than or equal to 1, we need 1 - a^2 + 2a geq 1, simplifying to 2a - a^2 geq 0, or a(2 - a) geq 0. This inequality is true for 0 leq a < 2. Since we are also given -1 < -a, that condition translates to a < 1. Hence, in this case, 0 leq a < 1.        - **Case 3**: -a geq 1         This case cannot occur, as it would imply a leq -1, which is outside the interval [-1, 1] where f(x) must be greater than or equal to 1. Combining the results from Case 1 and Case 2, we get that a must be greater than or equal to 0 and there is no upper bounding condition from these cases. 3. **Alternative Approach via Function Analysis**: Instead of case-wise analysis, we can analyze the function f(x) over the interval [-1, 1]. If f(x) geq 1 is to hold for this entire interval, we require that the coefficient 2a in the term 2ax must ensure that the linear and constant terms combined do not lower the value of f(x) below 1. Upon setting y = g(x) = frac{-x^2}{x + 1}, we find that the maximum value of y on the interval (-1, 1] is 0, implying that we must have 2a geq 0.

For a square, we can potentially have lines of symmetry along the diagonals and the midlines (vertical and horizontal).     - **Rotational Symmetry of Order 2**:         - This means the figure looks the same after a rotation of 180 degrees. 3. **Determine additional shading**:     - To achieve the required symmetries, start by reviewing and trying different possible additional shadings.     - **Option for Diagonal Symmetry**:         - If we consider the diagonals to be lines of symmetry, the figure must mirror across these diagonals.     - **Option for Rotational Symmetry**:         - The figure needs mirrored pairs of shaded squares around the center. 4. **Strategize minimal shading**:     - Consider the fewest unshaded squares that will meet both conditions (rotational and line symmetry).     - Visualize adding up to no more than necessary to achieve symmetry, checking each configuration for correctness.    5. **Check configurations**:     - Analyze various combinations where additional shading converts figure into desired symmetry pattern.     - For rotation and diagonal symmetry together, the shaded squares need to be positioned symmetrically around the center. 6. **Example configuration**:     - Assume the initial configuration needs backside addition to balance symmetry.     - By shading three specific unshaded squares symmetrically relative to center and diagonals, it works.     - Verify if these squares convert both diagonals and achieve 180-degree rotation equivalence.    # Conclusion: After shading the key positions ensuring both the line of symmetry and the rotational symmetry of order 2 with minimal effort, we find:  boxed{3}"},{"instruction":"Five standard, sixsided dice are rolled.

Each die has three odd outcomes (1, 3, 5), so there are (3^5) ways to roll all odd numbers out of a total of (6^5) possible outcomes. **Step 2**: For the sum to be even when all numbers are odd, an odd number of dice must show an even number of times. With five dice, this can only happen if all five numbers rolled are odd. **Step 3**: The number of ways to roll all odd numbers is (3^5). Since all dice rolled odd numbers (which all must happen for an odd product), and this configuration also ensures an even sum (since the count of dice is odd), the number of favorable outcomes is (3^5). **Step 4**: The total number of ways to obtain an odd product is also (3^5), because each die must independently roll an odd number. The probability that the sum is even given that the product is odd is therefore: [ frac{text{Number of ways to get an odd product and even sum}}{text{Number of ways to get an odd product}} = frac{3^5}{3^5} = 1 ] Thus, the probability is (boxed{1})."},{"instruction":"Let f(x) be an even function defined on (infty, +infty), and suppose f(x) is increasing on [0, +infty).

This implies that g(x), and hence f'(x), is monotonically decreasing on the interval (0,+infty). - **When a > 0**, the sign of g'(x) = frac{ax-1}{x^2} depends on the value of x:   - For x < frac{1}{a}, g'(x) < 0, so g(x) is monotonically decreasing.   - For x > frac{1}{a}, g'(x) > 0, so g(x) is monotonically increasing. Therefore, we conclude that: - For a leq 0, f'(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,+infty). - For a > 0, f'(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,frac{1}{a}) and monotonically increasing on (frac{1}{a},+infty).

We aim to prove that x(e^{x}+1) > f(x)+1, which simplifies to: [xe^{x}+x > xln x + ln x + 1.] This is equivalent to showing xe^{x} > xln x. To do this, we examine two inequalities: 1. **e^{x} > x**:    - Define m(x) = e^{x} - x for x > 0.    - The derivative m'(x) = e^{x} - 1 > 0 for all x > 0, indicating m(x) is increasing.    - Since m(0) = 1, we have e^{x} - x > 1 > 0, thus e^{x} > x. 2. **x geq ln x + 1**:    - Define n(x) = x - ln x - 1 for x > 0.    - The derivative n'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} = frac{x-1}{x}, which changes sign at x=1.    - Since n(1) = 0, n(x) is decreasing for x < 1 and increasing for x > 1.    - Therefore, n(x) geq n(1) = 0, implying x geq ln x + 1. Combining these results, we have e^{x} > x geq ln x + 1 > ln x, which leads to xe^{x} > xln x. Adding x to both sides gives xe^{x} + x > xln x + ln x + 1, thus proving x(e^{x}+1) > f(x)+1. Therefore, the final answers are encapsulated as follows: - For part (1), the monotonicity of f'(x) is described as:   - For a leq 0, f'(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,+infty).   - For a > 0, f'(x) is monotonically decreasing on (0,frac{1}{a}) and monotonically increasing on (frac{1}{a},+infty). - For part (2), the proof that x(e^{x}+1) > f(x)+1 for a=1 is confirmed.

Now, for tan(pi-theta), we use the tangent subtraction formula: tan(pi-theta) = -tan(theta) We can find tan(theta) by dividing sin(theta) by cos(theta): tan(theta) = frac{sin(theta)}{cos(theta)} tan(theta) = frac{frac{4}{5}}{-frac{3}{5}} tan(theta) = -frac{4}{3} Substituting this into the tangent formula for tan(pi-theta) gives: tan(pi-theta) = -(-frac{4}{3}) tan(pi-theta) = frac{4}{3} Therefore, the solution is: boxed{tan(pi-theta) = frac{4}{3}} Since this corresponds to option B, the correct answer is B: frac{4}{3}."},{"instruction":"Melody has three dogs.

To find the area of triangle QST, we observe that triangles QST and PQT are similar (by AA similarity criterion, as they share angle T and have right angles), and the ratio of their sides is ST/PT. The area ratio of similar triangles is the square of the side length ratio. We know triangles PRT and PQT share an altitude, so ST/PT = [PRT]/[PQT] = 25/40 = 5/8. The ratio of their areas is then (ST/PT)^2 = (5/8)^2 = 25/64, thus [QST] = (25/64)[PQT] = (25/64)(40) = 15.625 square units.

The problem here is that we are assuming that the original number is a prime number with a decimal point, which is not possible since prime numbers are integers.  Let's rephrase the problem: we are looking for a prime number such that when we multiply it by 10 (moving the decimal point one place to the right), the result is 5.4 more than the original prime number.  So, we have: [ 10p = p + 5.4 ] [ 9p = 5.4 ] [ p = frac{5.4}{9} ] [ p = 0.6 ] This is not a valid solution since boxed{0.6}  is not a prime number. There seems to be a misunderstanding in the problem statement as prime numbers are integers and cannot have decimal points moved. If we are strictly looking for a prime number, the problem as stated does not have a solution that satisfies the conditions of being a prime number."},{"instruction":"Evaluate the expression [   frac{144 left( frac{1}{14}  frac{1}{18} right)            + 196 left( frac{1}{18}  frac{1}{12} right) + 324 left( frac{1}{12}  frac{1}{14} right)}{         12 left( frac{1}{14}  frac{1}{18} right)            + 14 left( frac{1}{18}  frac{1}{12} right) + 18 left( frac{1}{12}  frac{1}{14} right)} , . ]","output":"Let a = 12, b = 14, c = 18.

Then:    [    ak + bell = a cdot 1 + b cdot p = a + bp    ]    Since ( p mid a ) and ( p mid bp ), it follows that ( p mid (a + bp) ). Therefore, ( ak + bell ) is divisible by ( p ).

Suppose there exist positive integers ( 1 le i < j le p ) such that:    [    ai + b equiv aj + b pmod{p}    ]    This implies:    [    ai equiv aj pmod{p}    ]    Subtracting ( ai ) from both sides, we get:    [    a(i - j) equiv 0 pmod{p}    ]    Since ( gcd(a, p) = 1 ), it follows that ( p mid (i - j) ).

This implies that the discriminant of each quadratic must be positive.     2. **Establish the Conditions for the Discriminant**:    - For the quadratic function ( y = ax^2 + bx + c ), the discriminant is ( Delta_1 = b^2 - 4ac ). Since it has two real roots, ( Delta_1 > 0 ):      [      b^2 > 4ac      ]    - For the quadratic function ( y = cx^2 + ax + b ), the discriminant is ( Delta_2 = a^2 - 4bc ).

Here's the detailed breakdown: 1. **Establishing the relationship between weights and densities:**    When the object is immersed in a liquid, it experiences a loss in weight equivalent to the weight of the liquid displaced by its volume. According to Archimedes' principle, the loss of weight is proportional to the density of the liquid.    Therefore, for the first liquid with density (d_1):    [    text{Weight loss in liquid} = p - p_1    ]    Moreover, the weight loss in liquid can be related to the volume (V) and the density of the object (d) and liquid (d_1):    [    p - p_1 = V cdot d_1 cdot g    ]    where (g) is the acceleration due to gravity.    Thus, we can set up the ratio of the weight to weight loss in the first liquid:    [    frac{p}{p - p_1} = frac{d}{d_1}    ] 2. **Finding the density (d) of the object:**    Rearranging the equation:    [    frac{p}{p - p_1} = frac{d}{d_1} implies d = d_1 cdot frac{p}{p - p_1}    ] 3. **Applying to the second liquid with unknown density (x):**    Similarly, for the second liquid:    [    frac{p}{p - p_2} = frac{d}{x}    ]    Substituting the value of (d) from the previous step:    [    frac{p}{p - p_2} = frac{d_1 cdot frac{p}{p - p_1}}{x}    ] 4. **Solving for (x):**    Solving for (x), we get:    [    frac{p}{p - p_2} = frac{d_1 cdot p}{(p - p_1) cdot x}    ]    Simplifying,    [    x cdot frac{p}{p - p_2} = d_1 cdot frac{p}{p - p_1}    ]    [    x = d_1 cdot frac{p - p_2}{p - p_1}    ] 5. **Conclusion:**    The density of the test object (d) is:    [    d = frac{d_1 cdot p}{p - p_1}    ]    The density of the second liquid (x) is:    [    x = d_1 cdot frac{p - p_2}{p - p_1}    ] [ boxed{left( d = frac{d_1 p}{p - p_1}, , x = d_1 cdot frac{p - p_2}{p - p_1} right)} ]"},{"instruction":"he ratio of boys to girls in a class is 2 : 3 . the career preference of the students in the class are to be represented in a circle graph . if the area of the graph allocated to each career preference is to be proportional to the number of students who have that career preference , how many degrees of the circle should be used to represent a career that is preferred by one third of the boys and two  third of the girls in the class ?","output":"First, let's find the total number of parts that represent the class.

Since the boys are 2 parts of the total 5 parts, one third of the boys would be (1/3) * 2 parts. Since the girls are 3 parts of the total 5 parts, two-thirds of the girls would be (2/3) * 3 parts. Calculating these: One third of the boys: (1/3) * 2 = 2/3 parts Two thirds of the girls: (2/3) * 3 = 2 parts Now, add these two parts together to find the total parts of the class that prefer this career: 2/3 parts (boys) + 2 parts (girls) = 2/3 + 6/3 = 8/3 parts To find out how many degrees of the circle should be used to represent this career preference, we need to calculate what fraction of the total class 8/3 parts represents and then multiply that by 360 degrees (since a circle has 360 degrees).

The equation becomes:    [    (u^2 + v^2) left( frac{484(u^2 + v^2)^2}{u^2 v^2} right) - 1900 = 16p^2u^2v^2((u^2 + v^2)^2 - 4u^2v^2)    ] 8. **Finding integer solutions**: We need (uv) to divide (88) (since (a + b = 88)). Possible pairs ((u, v)) are ((2, 1), (4, 1), (8, 1), (11, 1), (22, 1), (44, 1), (88, 1), (11, 2), (11, 4), (11, 8)). 9. **Checking pairs**: Only ((2, 1)) gives a perfect square for (p^2):    [    p^2 = 625 implies p = 25    ]    Thus, (x = 50) and (y = 25). 10. **Verifying the solution**: Check if (L = 55) fits:    [    L = frac{22(50^2 + 25^2)}{50 cdot 25} = 55    ]    This satisfies the conditions. The final answer is (boxed{(50, 25)})."},{"instruction":"Daniel practices basketball for some minutes each day during the school week. He practices twice as long each day on the weekend.

Since there are 5 school days in a week, he practices 5x minutes during the school week.  On the weekend, he practices twice as long each day, so for each of the 2 weekend days, he practices 2x minutes. Therefore, for the whole weekend, he practices 2 * 2x = 4x minutes. The total practice time for the whole week is the sum of the practice time during the school week and the weekend, which is 5x (school week) + 4x (weekend) = 135 minutes. Combining the terms for the whole week, we get 5x + 4x = 135. This simplifies to 9x = 135.

The idea is that the least common multiple (LCM) of a set of numbers grows very quickly as the size of the set increases, especially when the numbers are distinct and large. 2. **Claim:** (frac{a_n}{n}) is bounded by a constant.    **Proof:**    Assume for the sake of contradiction that the claim is false. Call a natural number ( t ) good if (frac{a_t}{t} > frac{a_s}{s} ) for all ( s < t ). Pick a sufficiently large good ( t ) such that (frac{a_t}{t} = r ge 2).    Let ( T = {1, 2, dots, a_t } - {a_1, a_2, dots, a_t } ). Since (|T| ge rt - t), by our claim, (text{lcm}(T) > ((r-1)t)^{4040} > (rt)^{2020} > a_{t-2020}a_{t-2019}dots a_{t-1}).    Since (text{lcm}(T) nmid a_{t-2020}a_{t-2019}dots a_{t-1}), there was some element of ( T ) which was smaller than ( a_t ) and did not divide ( a_{t-2020}a_{t-2019}dots a_{t-1} ). This contradicts the definition of ( a_t ). That element would have been chosen in place of ( a_t ). (blacksquare) 3. Now suppose that (frac{a_n}{n}) is bounded by ( c ). Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is some sufficiently large number ( k gg c ) that doesn't appear in the sequence. ( k ) has a sufficiently large prime power factor, say ( p^alpha gg c ). 4. For all ( t > k ), since ( k neq a_t ), ( p^alpha mid k mid a_{t-2020}a_{t-2019}dots a_{t-1} ), which means ( q = p^{lceil frac{alpha}{2020} rceil} gg c ) divides one of the terms ( a_{t - 2020}, a_{t - 2019}, dots, a_{t-1} ). 5. If ( a_t ) is divisible by ( q ), call ( t ) friendly. Now, for some ( n gg k ), since at least ( n ) numbers in ( {1, dots, k+2020n } ) are friendly, one of the numbers ( a_1, dots, a_{k+2020n} ) is at least ( qn > kc + 2020cn ).
