The title itself, \\"China Vox,\\" could be interpreted in a couple of ways, but it's not an established phrase with a widely recognized meaning outside of its context in the game. Breaking down the title: - \\"China\\" likely refers to the setting or thematic inspiration for the track, implying a connection to Chinese culture, landscapes, or atmospheres depicted in the game. Street Fighter games are known for drawing inspiration from a variety of countries and cultures to create diverse backgrounds and settings for their characters and stages. - \\"Vox\\" is a Latin word for \\"voice,\\" and in modern usage, it commonly refers to vocal elements of a music track or the act of singing. In the context of music production, \\"vox\\" can denote vocal tracks or samples included within the piece. Therefore, \\"China Vox\\" could suggest a music track that incorporates vocal elements (whether singing or possibly traditional vocal sounds) inspired by or themed around Chinese culture or motifs. The track itself would blend these elements into the overall soundscape of Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike, contributing to the game's diverse and dynamic soundtrack that complements its equally diverse roster of international fighters and settings. The use of culturally specific music helps to immerse players in the game's world, providing a more authentic experience during gameplay."},{"instruction":"Name 12 video games that were originally released in the year 2009, and after the games, write a note stating that the games listed will turn 15 years old in the year 2024.","output":"1.

Based on the structure of the data you've provided, the likely cause is how you're accessing the quote status within the \`row-style-fn\`. Clojure's keyword functions (\`:keyword\`) will work on maps directly to retrieve the value for that key. In your \`row-style-fn\`, you're receiving a map as the \`quote\` via destructuring the argument, which is the correct approach. However, the statuses in your data appear as keywords (e.g., \`:approved\`), so it's important to ensure you're comparing the status correctly to apply the styles. Let's adjust your function to match the keyword statuses properly: \`\`\`clojure (defn- row-style-fn [_ _ {quote :raw-data}] (cond (= (:status quote) :approved) \\"bg-light-green-2\\" ; Add additional conditions for other statuses if required :else \\"bg-light-grey\\")) \`\`\` This function now correctly matches the status in the \`quote\` map against keywords. I've removed the case for \`\\"bg-secondary-yellow\\"\` since you haven't provided an example status that would trigger it, but you can reintroduce similar conditions for other specific statuses as needed. Ensure the statuses (\`:approved\` in the example provided) are used as they are represented in your data. In ClojureScript, keywords are often used to represent enumerated types, such as statuses, because they are more efficient and idiomatic than strings for this use case. Also, make sure that the rest of your application correctly handles these styles (\`\\"bg-light-green-2\\"\`, \`\\"bg-secondary-yellow\\"\`, \`\\"bg-light-grey\\"\`). They need to be defined in your CSS so that applying these classes to the rows actually results in the visual changes you expect."},{"instruction":"Can the row-fn access the right data?","output":"Based on the way you've structured your \`row-style-fn\`, it's crucial that the function is actually receiving the correct data in the expected format. From your code snippet, the \`row-style-fn\` is defined to receive three parameters, where the third parameter expects a map with a \`:raw-data\` key containing the quote data. As long as the data passed to the \`table/table-component\` (or whatever component you're using that utilizes the \`row-style-fn\`) is structured correctly and invokes \`row-style-fn\` with the expected arguments, your function should be able to access the data correctly. To clarify, for the \`row-style-fn\` to access the right data, the following conditions must be met: 1. **Correct Argument Structure:** Your destructuring in \`row-style-fn\` assumes the data comes in a specific shape. The third argument must be a map that contains a \`:raw-data\` key, which itself contains the quote data. Ensure that this matches how your table component actually calls this function. 2. **Correct Data Passing:** The component or system that uses \`row-style-fn\` must pass the correct data. This means that wherever \`row-style-fn\` is utilized, it must be called with arguments that match the expected pattern. In your case, the component must provide the raw quote data under the \`:raw-data\` key of the third argument. 3. **Data Shape and Availability:** Make sure that the data structure of each quote includes all the keys and values \`row-style-fn\` tries to access. For instance, \`(:status quote)\` accesses the \`:status\` key within the quote. Your example data shows this key exists and looks correct for the given examples. If there's a mismatch in any of these areas, the \`row-style-fn\` might not work as expected. Given your provided data snippet and assuming the calling context correctly matches the expected argument pattern, your function should theoretically access the correct data. However, remember that all data manipulation and function calls in Clojure/ClojureScript are case sensitive and rely on exact matches. Thus, ensure that your \`:status\`, \`:approved\`, and other keys are consistently used across your dataset and function definitions. If your \`row-style-fn\` isn't behaving as expected, I recommend verifying the invocation context, checking the actual runtime data being passed to it, and ensuring that there's no discrepancy between the expected and actual structure/format of the data. Sometimes, adding logging or debug statements temporarily can help illuminate where mismatches occur."},{"instruction":"Am I using else wrong here?

Instead, you should use a literal value that you know won't match any of your case values (often, this is just \`nil\` or a value you are certain won't appear), or simply omit a specific value and include the default case last without a test expression. However, in \`case\`, you must actually use the special form \`_\` (underscore) for the default case, not \`:else\`. Your use of \`:else\` in the \`case\` form suggests you want a default case to apply when \`status\` doesn't match any of the explicitly handled cases. You should replace \`:else\` with \`_\` for it to serve as the catch-all case correctly. # Use of \`def\` Inside Functions The use of \`def\` inside a function (like your \`(def foo quote)\`) is incorrect for several reasons: 1. **Namespace Scope:** \`def\` is used to define symbols at the namespace level, not within the local scope of functions. Using it inside a function impacts the entire namespace and is not thread-safe or recursion-safe, leading to unpredictable behavior. 2. **Var Creation:** Every call to \`def\` creates (or rebinds) a Var at the namespace level. This is not only inefficient but can lead to subtle bugs due to the shared global state. 3. **Debugging:** If you're using \`def\` for debugging purposes, it's better to use logging or REPL-based debugging techniques. For temporary variables or debugging within a function, you should use \`let\` bindings instead. # Corrected \`row-style-fn\` Taking the above points into consideration, you can adjust your function as follows: \`\`\`clojure (defn- row-style-fn [_ _ { {:keys [status] :as quote} :raw-data}] ; Assuming you were using \`foo\` for debugging, you might remove or replace it accordingly. (case status :rejected \\"bg-gojee-secondary-yellow\\" :approved \\"bg-gojee-light-green-2\\" _ \\"bg-gojee-light-grey\\")) ; Note the use of \`_\` for the default case \`\`\` This corrected version of \`row-style-fn\` should now properly handle varying \`status\` values and default correctly for any status not explicitly mentioned."},{"instruction":"Can you tell me what the underscores represent?","output":"In Clojure, underscores (\`_\`) are commonly used in several contexts, each carrying a slightly different meaning depending on its usage. When you see an underscore in Clojure code, it typically represents one of the following: # 1. Ignored Binding When destructuring data structures or in function parameters, an underscore is often used to indicate that the value is being intentionally ignored. This is a convention to signal to other developers (and to remind yourself) that a certain value is available in that context but is not going to be used. For example, in a function that takes two parameters but only uses the second one: \`\`\`clojure (defn process-second [_ second-param] (println second-param)) \`\`\` In this case, the underscore indicates that the first parameter is intentionally not used within the function body. # 2. Default Case in \`case\` In a \`case\` expression, when no conditions match, the underscore is used to specify the default case. This is similar to how \`default\` is used in a \`switch\` statement in other languages. However, it's important to correct my earlier statement: in Clojure's \`case\`, you don't actually use an underscore (\`_\`) for the default case; you simply provide the default expression after all the cases. My previous reference to using \`_\` as the default was incorrect in the context of Clojure's \`case\`. Thank you for prompting this clarification. The correct use in a \`case\` statement would look like this: \`\`\`clojure (case value 1 \\"one\\" 2 \\"two\\" ; There's no special symbol for the default case; just provide the default value after all cases \\"others\\") \`\`\` # 3. \\"Don't Care\\" Symbol in Pattern Matching (Not Official) In some pattern matching libraries or non-standard Clojure extensions, an underscore might be used to signify a \\"don't care\\" value in patterns. This is not part of standard Clojure but can be seen in certain libraries that extend Clojure's pattern matching capabilities. # 4. Readability in Numerics (Clojure 1.9+) Starting with Clojure 1.9, you can use underscores for readability in long numeric literals, similar to how some other languages allow commas or underscores as visual separators. \`\`\`clojure (def one-million 1_000_000) \`\`\` In this context, the underscores have no semantic meaning and are ignored by the compiler; they are purely for making the code more readable. --- In summary, when you see an underscore in Clojure code, its meaning depends on the context: it could indicate an ignored value, serve as a convention for unused bindings, or enhance the readability of numerical literals. However, for the specific case of a default case in a \`case\` expression, Clojure does not use an underscore; you just list the default return value without a matching condition."},{"instruction":"Here are my new components: (ns blueridge.ui.new (:require [ui.components :as components] [cljs.pprint :refer [cl-format]] [clojure.string :as string] [reagent.core :as ra] [\\"reactstrap\\" :as rs])) (defn dropdown-item [config] [components/dropdown-item config (:label config)]) (def default-styles-dropdown-button {:title \\"Actions\\" :dropdown-button {:key (str \\"dropdown-\\" (rand-int 100)) :style {:height \\"44 px\\"} :toggle {:width 150}} :dropdown-toggle {:key \\"dropdown-toggle\\" :style {:width 150} :color \\"primary\\" :caret true} :dropdown-menu {:key \\"dropdown-menu\\" :class \\"dropdown-menu-right\\"} :items [[dropdown-item {:key \\"item-1\\" :disabled false :on-click \\"\\" :label \\"Clickable item\\"}] [dropdown-item {:key \\"item-2\\" :disabled true :on-click \\"\\" :label [:div.d-flex \\"Disabled item\\" [:i.fas.fa-question-circle]]}]]}) (defn dropdown-button \\"Standard dropdown menu button.

Without the full error trace, it's somewhat difficult to pinpoint the exact source of the problem, but we can go through some common troubleshooting steps and best practices that might help resolve or identify the issue. # Possible Issues and Fixes 1. **Incorrect Propagation of Props in Components:** Make sure that when you're forwarding props to child components, all props are correctly passed, especially if they're expected to be React components themselves. This includes the elements in your \`:items\` list - they must be properly formatted Reagent components. 2. **Reagent Atom Misuse:** The usage of \`ra/atom\` and its state management within \`dropdown-button\` seems fine at a glance, but ensure there’s no side-effect or misuse happening when toggling \`is-open\`. 3. **Component Keys:** It's good practice to have unique keys for sibling components in a list for React to correctly handle DOM changes. You're already using \`:key\` with a combination of static strings and random numbers, which should generally be okay, but reconsider if these can in any way lead to duplicates or if they're reused across re-renders, leading to unexpected behavior. 4. **Syntactical Mistakes in Component Definitions:** Your use of the \`ra/with-let\` macro and component definitions looks syntactically correct, but ensure there's no accidental oversight, such as misplaced brackets or misalignment in your actual components definitions that might not be evident in the code snippet provided. 5. **Ensure components/dropdown-* Functions Correctly Handle Props:** This might sound obvious, but verify that \`components/dropdown-button\`, \`components/dropdown-toggle\`, and \`components/dropdown-menu\` correctly deal with the props they're given. A common mistake is to pass Reagent/React components incorrectly or in a way that the underlying component does not expect. 6. **Debugging Approach:** - **Simplify**: Temporarily remove dynamic features (like the use of \`ra/atom\`) and reduce your components to the most basic version that should render. This helps identify if the issue is with the component structure or the dynamic parts. - **Check for Missing Requirements**: Double-check if all required props are provided, particularly for third-party components where missing required props can lead to render errors. - **Console Log within Render**: Temporarily add \`println\` or \`console.log\` statements at various points in your component rendering process to ensure values are what you expect. 7. **Incorrect Usage of HTML Attributes:** In your \`default-styles-dropdown-button\`, you set the style height with a space between the number and the unit (\`:style {:height \\"44 px\\"}\`). CSS values should not have a space between the number and the unit (\`\\"44px\\"\` is correct). Without a deeper dive into the \`components/dropdown-*\` implementations and their expectations for props, these are broad suggestions. If these components are wrappers around \\"reactstrap\\" components, ensure that their prop requirements are correctly mapped to your ClojureScript data structures, and consider going through some examples provided by \\"reactstrap\\" to catch any discrepancies in usage."},{"instruction":"Name 8 video games that were released in the year 2007.","output":"In 2007, the video game industry saw numerous high-profile releases across various platforms.

Privileges that had been already established, and in part those that had been sanctioned regionally by the princes, were as a general rule accepted by this power. In this way, they were constituted by power. Even freedom from taille only ever became a definitive characteristic of the nobility when the kingdom was divided into areas of taille personelle and taille réelle. In the south, where the taille was levied on 'nonnoble' land rather than on persons, release from the tax was possible through the acquisition of such land. Estate privileges were most evident in relation to judicial power. In criminal cases, in particular, nobles enjoyed a different law from non-nobles (cf. below, however, on benefit of clergy). The fact that the nobility in 'France' was largely absolved from direct taxa-tion not only explains why royal fiscal power could be extended relatively easily, despite a certain resistance; it also explains why it was not only mem-bers of the nobility who opposed too ready an access to their estate. For as the number of nobles increased, so the number of taxpayers declined. The pos-sibility of simply usurping a new social status was checked therefore at the local level. This facilitated the assertion of the notion of a nobility of birth. In the wake of the constitution of this nobility as an estate, practices of inheritance underwent a further change. In the north, where primogeniture had been very widespread, younger sons subsequently received a greater share of the family inheritance; in the south, where partage of the common legacy had been commonly practised, the custom developed of favouring the eldest son.18 The result was that the different forms of inheritance converged. This prevented an 'upper stratum' of the richest noble families from establishing itself alongside the territorial princes, and stabilised the typically 'French' development of a comprehensive noble stratum - though even at the time of its formation this was already not completely dominant in material terms. a.2. Generalisation of royal rule In 1357 the dauphin (later Charles V) issued a decree that recognised local rights [coutumes] including that of seigneurie banale. This had scarcely any prac-tical significance. It arose in a situation in which the existence of the dynasty was endangered, if not that of the royal rule as a whole, and can rather be seen as documenting the conditions of this rule. In this respect, the decree of 1357 can be compared with Magna Carta. The latter was the result of a crisis of gov-ernment. The conditions of royal rule that were formulated at that time aimed at a regulation of the exercise of royal power, but its generalised character was not contested, being in fact even promoted. The French case was different. If we leave aside the demands for administrative reforms that were advanced and the concessions to these that were made, given that these appear in one form or another in any crisis of government and rule in societies of the ancien régime, the intention of this document seems rather to have been one of support for royal rule under the condition of its limitation. Generalisation of royal rule was to arise from fiscal, legal, juridical and military assistance to autonomous noble rule. In point of fact, the assembly of the estates of Languedoil (i.e. northern France) that the dauphin summoned in late autumn 1356 and again in the two following years, after the French army had suffered a crushing defeat at Poitiers in September 1356 and Jean II been taken prisoner by the English, did not have any notable political significance. Both the royal administration and deputies from the estates considered referring the discussions to regional assemblies.19 Far more decisive at this time were the effects of the devaluation of the coinage to which the dauphin resorted in order to pay his father's ransom. The widespread discontent that the economic consequences of this manipulation aroused among the Paris citizens led the leader of the merchants there, Etienne Marcel, to ally politically with the rebellious peasantry. From early in 1358, first of all in the Beauvaisais, then spreading rapidly throughout the north, peasants took up arms in protection against the marauding soldiery. Though purely a defensive measure, the jacquerie as it was contemptuously named (from Jacques, the nickname for a peasant), was treated as a crime. Under the leadership of Charles of Navarre (who had recently been the dauphin's prisoner, and was later to be an ally of the Plan-tagenets), the nobles bloodily defeated the uprising. Once Etienne Marcel's policy had suffered this setback, he was killed by the Paris burghers. The city then surrendered to the dauphin and abandoned its previous demands for reform. The end of peasant and urban revolt was far more significant than the assembly of the estates in maintaining royal rule during the absence of Jean de Valois, as the king had described himself on his capture.20 We shall now go on to discuss developments in the royal military, fiscal and judicial power, as well as the extension of rule over the clergy and the towns. The generalisation of royal power was the most striking characteristic of the development of rule in the second half of the fifteenth century and the first half of the sixteenth. Its unifying effect however remained limited. There remained local variation in laws, taxes, structures of administration and representation. But from the confirmation of particular freedoms that was demanded in 1356, and with the incorporation of new territories into the kingdom from 1202 through to 1477, there gradually arose a system of differentially privileged participation in generalised power. This form was finally implemented only in the mid-seventeenth century. Its military and fiscal preconditions, however, already developed in the two previous centuries. Besides the material linkage of the nobility to royal rule, the appropriation of military organisational power by the crown was also decisive. Development of royal armed force Three elements characterise the structural change in the organisation of armed force: the expansion of the labour market for warriors, strategies for the ‘real subsumption' of fighting men to a military command, and the establishment of long-term conditions of employment. When the kings of ‘France' possessed enough power to include the so-called arrière-ban in their military contingent (i.e. to extend this obligation to towns and subordinates of the royal vassals), though they still had recourse to the vocabulary of feudalism and its structures of legitimisation, on closer inspec-tion this was not an expansion of the feudally-based military organisation. The summoning of ‘the nobility' that had to precede that of the arrière-ban was in no way limited to vassals of the king, but extended to all who were indicated as accepted nobles in the areas of royal suzerainty. The obligation of the French nobility at the turn of the fourteenth century also differed from a feudal organisation of armed force in the fact that it had no fixed time limit, though on the other hand service was no longer expected without reward. After the mid-fourteenth century, the arrière-ban was only rarely summoned. For a certain period, this obligation had played a central role in the financing of war. Though the service could be fulfilled in one's own person, the crown promoted money payment as a possible alternative. As taxation became easier to levy, the necessity of summoning the arrière-ban declined, though this was still practised occasionally even in the seventeenth century. The most important form of recruitment came to be contracts of service. As a rule, these were made for one month at a time. The supply of knights was large enough to extend existing lettres de retenue or conclude new ones. On the other hand, the short duration made possible immediate reductions in outlay if the number of those engaged could be lowered - for whatever political, military or seasonal reasons. Nobles continued to fight in the king's armies. Their payment corresponded to that of mercenaries.21 Differently from the English case, whilst there were a few nobles in ‘France' who did not ride to war even in their prime, there was no tendency towards the demilitarisation of an entire stratum of nobility. The constitutive importance of warfare for the entire nobility in 'France' endured for much longer than was the case in England. This estate recruitment, however, was no guarantee of military discipline: on the contrary. Like other princes of the time, therefore, the kings of ‘France' also made use of secular knightly orders. These very likely arose in a similar way to fraternities among artisans: as ties of mutual support in the troubles of life in this world and the next. As distinct from these ‘societies of knights', as J. D'Arcy Bouton calls them,22 also from the sworn orders that generally existed only for a short time, the courtly orders that were founded by kings and territorial princes in the midfourteenth century - and repeatedly again over the next two hundred years - were subordinate to a lord on earth as well as in heaven. Their particular characteristics were an egalitarian internal structure, untypical for this time, and the moral and religious basis of service to a lord. The knightly orders of the late Middle Ages inherited the ideal of self-discipline. What was new was that this was now subordinated to a quite specific purpose, the service of a secular lord, and in this way it also facilitated the establishment of a kind of group discipline. In a certain manner, the foundation of these courtly orders marked the beginning of efforts by the princes to gain permanent command of a nucleus of highly skilled soldiers whose conduct would not be primarily oriented to prospects of individual gain. They therefore rewarded members of these orders correspondingly well. The development of a morality of service in the guise of a renewal of the old knightly ideal took place at a time when the manner in which wars were waged had begun to depend only to a lesser degree on the individual prowess of the knights. After the battle of Poitiers (1356), the French kings confined themselves for years to defensive measures, in the hope of wearing down the Plantagenet enemy with his greater problems of supply and logistics. This kind of protracted war, in which the idea was to avoid battle, was a break with tradition. For the knightly mode of combat had been developed for short campaigns culminating in a well-ordered battlefield, presenting the oppor-tunity to take prisoners and gain honour. From 1356 to 1369, however, the French side's efforts were more like marauding campaigns: short attacks on enemy territory with a view to plunder and intimidation. That this departure from knightly combat tradition was due not only to a political and military conjuncture is shown by the fact that starting with the battle of Crécy in 1346, knights generally dismounted from their horses before battle commenced. Though the military importance of infantry declined in the fourteenth and fif-teenth centuries, knights now fought frequently on foot. Still more significant was the claim of commanders to decide before the start of a battle whether prisoners should be taken or not. ‘Murderous war' had been up till then gen-erally a non-noble affair. Knights did not fight to the death, but with a view to ransoming their opposite number. The conduct of war was thus marked by private appropriation. Forbidding this conflicted not only with the military self-conception of the knightly life, but with its economic and cultural self-conception as well.23”翻译为中文","output":"贵族财政性的出现决定性因素是王室司法和财政权力的普及。已经确立的特权，部分由各地亲王制裁的特权，通常都被这股权力所接受。这样，它们就是由权力所确立的。只有当王国被划分为个人财产税和实物财产税区域时，免除个人财产税才真正成为贵族身份的决定性特征。在南方，财产税是对“非贵族”土地征税，而不是向个人征税，通过获取这类土地可以免税。在司法权力方面，地产特权最为明显。特别是在刑事案件中，贵族享有与非贵族不同的法律待遇（然而，下文还会讨论神职人员的特权）。 “法兰西”贵族在很大程度上免于直接税收，这不仅解释了为何尽管存在一定抵抗，王室的财政权力能够相对容易地扩张；这还解释了为什么不仅是贵族反对过于容易进入他们的阶层。因为随着贵族数量的增加，纳税人的数量就减少了。因此，在地方层面限制简单地冒充新的社会地位成为可能。这促进了贵族身份观念的确立。 随着这种作为一个阶层的贵族身份的形成，继承实践发生了进一步变化。在北方，原本普遍实行长子继承法的地区，次子后来在家族遗产中分得了更多；在南方，原本通常实行共同继承的地区，形成了偏袒长子的习俗。结果是，不同形式的继承方式趋于一致。这防止了最富有的贵族家族形成一个与领地亲王并列的“上层阶层”，稳定了典型的“法国式”全面贵族阶层的发展——尽管即便在其形成时，这个阶层在物质条件上已经不完全占主导地位了。 2. 王权普及 1357年，太子（后来的查理五世）颁布了一项承认地方权利[习俗]的法令，包括seigneurie banale的权利。这几乎没有实际意义。它出现在王室甚至整个王权存亡受到威胁的情况下，更多的是作为这种王权状态的记录。在这方面，1357年的法令可以与《大宪章》相提并论。后者是政府危机的结果。当时制定的王权条件旨在对王权行使进行规范，但其普遍性并未受到质疑，实际上还得到了促进。法国的情况则不同。如果我们忽略提出的行政改革要求和对这些要求所做的让步，因为这些要求以一种或另一种形式出现在任何一个古代政权危机中，这份文件的意图似乎更多的是在限定条件下支持王权。王权的普及将通过财政、法律、司法和军事方面对自治贵族统治的支持而实现。 实际上，太子在1356年深秋和接下来的两年召集的兰格多伊（即法国北部）三级会议并没有任何显著的政治意义。王室行政部门和三级会议的代表都考虑将讨论转交给地区会议。在当时更具决定性的是，为了支付其父亲的赎金，太子采取的货币贬值措施引发了巴黎市民广泛的不满，这导致商人领袖埃蒂安·马塞尔与反抗的农民政治联盟。 从1358年初开始，首先在博韦地区，然后迅速蔓延到整个北方，农民拿起武器保护自己不受游荡士兵的侵害。尽管仅仅是一种防御措施，但这场被轻蔑地称为jacquerie（来自Jacques，农民的绰号）的起义被视为犯罪行为。在查理·纳瓦尔（他曾经是太子的囚犯，后来成为普兰特亨特的盟友）的领导下，贵族血腥地镇压了起义。埃蒂安·马塞尔的政策遭遇挫败后，他被巴黎市民杀害。此后，城市向太子投降并放弃了之前的改革要求。农民和城市起义的结束对于在让·德·瓦卢瓦被俘期间维持王权比三级会议更为重要。 现在我们将继续讨论王室军事、财政和司法权力的发展，以及对教士和城镇统治的扩展。王权普及是十五世纪下半叶和十六世纪上半叶统治发展中最引人注目的特征。然而，其统一作用仍然有限。法律、税收、行政和代表机构的地方差异仍然存在。但从1356年要求确认特定自由开始，随着新领土从1202年到1477年被纳入王国，逐渐形成了一个在普遍权力中不同地享有特权参与的体系。这种形式直到十七世纪中期才最终实施。然而，其军事和财政前提在前两个世纪已经发展起来。除了贵族与王权的物质联系之外，王冠对军事组织权力的占有也是决定性因素。 王室武力的发展 组织武力结构变革的三个要素是：战士劳动市场的扩展、“战斗人员真正属从”的战略，以及建立长期雇佣条件。 当“法兰西”的国王拥有足够的权力将所谓的arrière-ban（即向城镇和皇家封臣的从属者扩展这一义务）纳入自己的军事编制时，尽管他们还在使用封建体制的词汇和合法化结构，但仔细观察，这并不是对基于封建制度的军事组织的扩张。召唤“贵族”之前的举措绝不仅限于国王的封臣，而是扩展到所有在王室宗主权范围内被认定为公认贵族的人。法国贵族在十四世纪转折时期的义务也与封建武装力量组织不同，因为它没有固定的时间限制，尽管另一方面，不再期望无偿服务。 在十四世纪中期以后，很少召集arrière-ban。一段时间内，这一义务在战争融资中扮演了中心角色。尽管这项服务可以亲自完成，但王冠推动金钱支付作为可能的替代方式。随着税收变得更易征收，召集arrière-ban的必要性下降，尽管即使在十七世纪，这种做法偶尔仍被实践。最重要的招募形式变成了服务合同。通常情况下，这些合同每次签订为期一个月。骑士的供应足够多，可以扩展现有的lettre de retenue或签订新的合同。另一方面，短期合同使得如果能够降低参与人数——无论出于何种政治、军事或季节原因——就能立即减少开支。 贵族继续在国王的军队中作战。他们的报酬与雇佣兵相当。不同于英格兰的情况，而在“法兰西”，尽管有少数贵族即便在壮年时也不参战，但没有整个贵族阶层去军事化的趋势。对整个贵族来说，战争的构成重要性在“法兰西”持续了比在英格兰更长的时间。然而，这种阶层招募并不能保证军事纪律：相反。因此，像当时的其他亲王一样，“法兰西”的国王也利用了世俗骑士团。这些骑士团很可能类似于工匠之间的兄弟会：作为在此世和来世生活困境中互相支持的联系。与这些“骑士社会”，正如J. D'Arcy Bouton所称，不同的是，通常只存在很短时间的誓约团体，十四世纪中叶由国王和领地亲王成立的朝廷团体——在接下来的两百年里反复出现——既服从于天上的主，也服从于世上的主。这些团体的特殊特点是对于当时来说不典型的平等内部结构，以及服务于一个主的道德与宗教基础。晚中世纪的骑士团继承了自律的理想。新颖的是，这现在被置于一个非常具体的目的之下，即为世俗的主服务，这样也促进了某种团队纪律的建立。 这些朝廷团体的建立在某种程度上标志着诸侯们开始努力获得对一群高技能士兵的长期指挥权，这些士兵的行为不会主要以个人利益为导向。因此，他们相应地为这些团体的成员提供了丰厚的奖励。 在战争方式开始较少依赖骑士个人英勇的时期，以更新旧骑士理想的形式发展服务道德观。在普瓦捷之战（1356年）之后，法国国王们多年限于防御措施，希望用对手更大的补给和后勤问题消耗掉普兰特亨特敌人。这种避免战斗的长期战争是传统的突破。因为骑士战斗方式是为了短期战役而发展的，以紧凑的战场为高潮，提供俘虏对手和获得荣誉的机会。然而，从1356年到1369年，法国方面的努力更像是对敌人领土的掠夺性战役：短暂的攻击，目的是掠夺和恐吓。这种偏离骑士战斗传统不仅仅是由于一种政治和军事结合的情况，这一事实可以从1346年克雷西战役开始，骑士们通常在战斗开始前就从马上下来的行为看出。尽管在十四、十五世纪骑兵的军事重要性下降，骑士现在经常步战。更重要的是指挥官在战斗开始前决定是否应该俘虏对方的权力主张。到目前为止，“残酷的战争”通常是非贵族的事务。骑士们不是为了杀戮而战，而是以赎金对手为目的。战争行为因此被私人占有所标记。禁止这种行为不仅与骑士生活的军事自我认知相冲突，而且与其经济和文化自我认知相冲突。"},{"instruction":"请将“At the centre of these strategies to regulate the form of battle lay the insti-tutionalising of a particular jurisdiction for combatants. Despite the participa-tion of non-nobles in war, military courts were the courts of nobles, just as the 'right' of war was a noble right. This was nothing new. What was new, however, was that the patterns of behaviour were no longer anchored in cul-turally dominant requirements of habitus, but had rather to be sanctioned by instances of royal exercise of rule.24 Just like other princes of this time, the French kings also set out in the late fourteenth century to obtain specialists in warfare on a permanent basis. His-torical presentations frequently give 1445 as the beginning of a standing army in 'France'. This is questionable however in two respects. First of all, because the notion of a standing army, as we shall show below, is more usefully reserved for forms of organisation whose structure is marked by training and externally imposed discipline, and secondly because the (lost) decree of 1445 referred not to the introduction of long-term service conditions, but to their regulation. What we do know is that it contained a list of the chefs de guerre who were in the king's service, and forbade the employment of women as well as other 'superfluous' personnel. In the second half of the fifteenth century, none the less, permanent employ-ment conditions came to be taken for granted, to the extent that the difference between permanent and temporary employment became usual. The ordon-nances du roi also date from this time. When Charles VII ordered a series of war leaders to engage themselves in his service, these were described as the 'commanded' [les ordonnances]. Garrison troops were known as the petite ordonnance, mounted units as the grande ordonnance. Similar developments also took place in the princely territories. Those able to afford it could keep particularly experienced warriors in their command, and the princes of Brit-tany and Burgundy kept ordonnance companies like those of the king, in Bur-gundy even with a regular training system. The scope of the grande ordonnance, which is where the structural change in armed force had its particular focus, is hard to determine, as inflating the number of personnel offered better prospects for the chefs. In 1473 it is supposed to have contained 2,094 lances fournis. Each of these 'lances' consisted of a lancer, two bowmen, three assistants and three or four horses. So-called 'Italian lances', which were frequently used by the French kings from the late fourteenth century, consisted only of mounted lancers. In these Italian 'lances', a hundred knights would have from three to four thousand horses, two dozen genétaires (a kind of light cavalry), and a dozen 'master cutters' [coustilleurs maistres]. In the space of a few years, during the war with Burgundy, the number of permanently employed 'lances' rose to 4,000, before falling back to 2,000. This means that even 'permanent' employment remained completely dependent on the military conjuncture. Thousands of knights at a time would be engaged or dismissed.25 Added to these were the many non-combatants required for the maintenance of the army. Contamine estimates the number of those permanently employed by the crown for its military purposes in 1450-75 at 14,000, and for the years 1475-1500 at 25,000. The effective strength reached by short-term contracts was in general about double this number. Three further changes should also be noted. From the late fifteenth century, the military importance of artillery grew substantially, and with it developed the need to procure and improve such weapons, as well as to recruit appropri-ate specialists. It is already noticeable at this time that employment of Swiss mercenaries who fought in squares now became more important in the out-come of battles. This was the start of a renewed military role for the infantry. With the formal end of the summoning of feudal arrays, it was no longer necessary for the king to fight in his own person in 'the king's wars'. This change is symptomatic of the objectification of royal rule. It should not how-ever be overestimated. Even in the seventeenth century, contemporaries made fun of Louis XIV because he was all too ready to take cover when the fighting began.26 In the course of the fifteenth century, the French crown staked a claim to exclusive military authority. The royal power monopoly could not yet be implemented at this time. But towns now regularly conceded their indepen-dent military organisation to the king (or the local prince), while seigneurs more frequently recognised that the prosecution of feuds by armed force could lead to a punishment expedition by companies of the grande ordonnance. Though the crown for its part made use of the military potential of towns and nobles, it was in a stronger position than previously to prevent the indepen- dent use of this potential. The generalisation of royal power proceeded partly in the form of an integration of private armed force into generalised ruling practice. Generalisation of royal fiscal power The crown also made frequent use of private or urban appropriation for the exercise of its fiscal power, legitimising this and restricting it at the same time. The various particular forms of royal fiscal power need not concern us here, and we shall confine ourselves to the structural characteristics that were constitutive for the development of the particular forms of the ancien régime in 'France'. There is firstly the fact that in the fifteenth century the nobility accepted the notion that the king had the right to regularly demand 'extraor-dinary' revenues. This meant, as in other countries, revenues additional to those from the royal domain. Extraordinary revenues in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries were often demanded under the feudal description of auxilium or aid (in 'France', however, never from vassals alone). Later, it was generally the indirect taxes levied on commercial transactions that were described as aid. On top of this were the hearth taxes (initially known usually as fouages, latter as tailles), as well as the tax in many places on salt. Like the forced loans or 'presents' that were exacted from towns, Jews and Lombards, all such payments through to the fifteenth century were justified by renewed emergency conditions. The constant repetition of 'extraordinary' demands finally established taxation authority as a de facto royal prerogative. The preconditions for this development are easy to grasp: on the one hand the recipients of royal rentes or pensions could readily see that income of this kind could not be financed by the domain economy alone. On the other hand, it was not only religious and secular lords, but towns as well, that were granted freedom from tax. If the kings summoned estate assemblies, those attending generally had more urgent complaints than their tax burdens. P.S. Lewis, familiar with the differences in relation to English development, believes that the introduction of regular taxation and a standing army was very likely the result of a temporary lack of attention of the états généraux.27 Indirect taxes affected nobles as well, and not all towns were able to acquire privileges. Yet the fact that the late medieval kings did not dare to tax the nobility directly, decisively influenced not only the royal fiscal power but also the basic structures of the 'French' ancien régime, leading to the emergence of a system of private participation in centralised extraction. Already for the year 1347, Guy Bois estimates the tax burden on peasants in Normandy as around thirty days' labour.28 It is widely agreed, however, that, from the late thirteenth century and during the Hundred Years War, taxes rose, before remaining largely constant until the early seventeenth century. The frequent fluctuations in the value of money, and the tremendous regional variation, make it generally hard to assess the specific extent of extraction. The second structural feature of the royal fiscal power with a long-term effect in the late Middle Ages arose from the relevance this had for membership of a privileged estate. In a certain sense, the estate character of the nobility was established by the exercise of royal fiscal power. For nobility required freedom from the specific taxes levied on the non-noble. The same applied to recognition as 'clergy' (see below). Conversely, the generalisation and regula- risation of royal fiscal power led to a reinforcement of the notion of hereditary nobility. Whilst in the fourteenth and fifteenth century (in particular cases still in the sixteenth) the hereditability of nobility had to be confirmed in practice by at least a landed estate of a certain minimum size, later on proof that one's ancestors had been non-taillable was taken as evidence for membership of the nobility. Since privilege of this kind, though it facilitated appropriation, could not prevent impoverishment, the specific structure of royal fiscality promoted the development of the difference between hierarchy of social rank and hier-archy of possession that was a typical structural feature of the ancien régime in 'France'. Generalisation of royal judicial power For most of the inhabitants of 'France', the private judicial power of the sire in whose domain they lived was decisive - and not just in the initial phase of the ancien régime. The number of seigneuries banales is impossible to establish, though for the seventeenth and eighteenth century estimates of 80,000 are usual. There were lawyers in the thirteenth and the fourteenth century who took the view that each sire had jurisdiction only over his vassals, and any fur-ther jurisdiction had to be expressly granted by the king. In practice, the crown accepted that the possessor of a seigneurie banale could decide 'civil' cases and practise so-called 'lower' and 'middle' jurisdiction in penal matters. Only in the realm of 'blood jurisdiction' [haute justice] did the view gradually come to prevail that this had to be explicitly granted and confirmed. The French crown could not refuse this concession to mighty nobles. Also, in times when royal government power was weak (as for example in the late sixteenth century), the number of lords who were confirmed in this power tended to rise.29 Sires did not exercise justice in their own person, but through 'officials' of their seigneurie or their substitutes. As a general rule, these legal functionaries did not officiate or live in the country, but in the nearest town. Along with the increasingly common venality of these offices, this spatial separation from the accused or the parties to a dispute affected judicial practice. It was not just the typically English influence of the 'neighbourhood', but also a form of judicial handling of social conflicts that presupposed personal acquaintance, that had difficulty in developing in the French context.”翻译为中文","output":"在这些调节战斗形式的策略中心，是为战斗人员设立特定司法管辖权的制度化。尽管非贵族也参与战争，但军事法庭是贵族的法庭，正如战争的“权利”是贵族的权利一样。这并不是什么新鲜事。然而，新的是，行为模式不再植根于文化主导的习惯要求中，而是必须由王权行使实例进行制裁。 就像这个时期的其他亲王一样，法国国王在十四世纪晚期开始着手永久获得战争专家。历史介绍常常将1445年视为“法国”常备军的开始。然而，这在两个方面是值得质疑的。首先，因为我们将在下文展示，常备军的概念更有用地保留给那些其结构由训练和外部强加的纪律标记的组织形式；其次，因为（已失的）1445年法令并不是指长期服务条件的引入，而是指它们的规范。我们所知道的是它包含了在国王服役的战争首领的名单，并禁止雇佣女性以及其他“多余”的人员。 然而，在十五世纪下半叶，永久性雇佣条件被视为理所当然，以至于永久与临时雇佣之间的区别变得寻常。国王条例也来自这个时期。当查理七世命令一系列战争领袖投身于他的服役时，这些人被称为“受命者”[les ordonnances]。守备军被称为petite ordonnance，骑兵单位被称为grande ordonnance。在亲王领地也发生了类似的发展。那些有能力的人可以在自己的指挥下保留特别有经验的战士，布列塔尼和勃艮第的亲王像国王一样保有ordonnance公司，在勃艮第甚至有一个规律的训练系统。grande ordonnance的范围很难确定，因为增加人员数量为首领们提供了更好的前景。据称，1473年时包括了2094个装备完善的枪矛。每个“枪矛”由一名枪兵、两名弓箭手、三名助手和三到四匹马组成。所谓的“意大利枪矛”，从十四世纪晚期开始经常被法国国王使用，仅由骑马枪兵组成。在这些意大利“枪矛”中，一百位骑士将拥有三到四千匹马，二十四名轻骑兵，以及十二名“主要刀兵”[coustilleurs maistres]。在与勃艮第的战争中，几年内，长期雇佣的“枪矛”数量增至4000，然后又回落至2000。这意味着即使是“永久性”的雇佣也完全取决于军事局势。成千上万的骑士将被雇佣或解雇。此外还有许多非战斗人员需要维护军队。Contamine估计，1450-75年间，皇冠为其军事目的永久雇用的人数为14000，而在1475-1500年间为25000。通过短期合同达到的有效力量通常是这个数字的大约两倍。 应该注意的另外三个变化。从十五世纪晚期开始，火炮的军事重要性大幅增长，随之而来的是获取和改进此类武器的需求，以及招募合适的专家。这个时期已经可以看到，雇佣作战方阵的瑞士雇佣兵在战斗结果中变得更加重要。这标志着步兵重新获得军事角色的开始。 随着封建阵列召集的正式结束，国王不再有必要亲自参与“国王的战争”。这一变化是王权客观化的症状性表现。然而，这不应被高估。即使在十七世纪，当代人也因路易十四在战斗开始时太愿意找地方躲藏而嘲笑他。 在十五世纪的过程中，法国王冠主张专属军事权威。尚未能实现王权垄断。但城镇现在经常将它们的独立军事组织让与国王（或当地亲王），而领主们更频繁地认识到，以武力进行私人争斗可能导致大型ordonnance公司的惩罚性远征。尽管皇冠方面利用了城镇和贵族的军事潜力，但与以前相比，它处于更有力的位置来阻止这种潜力的独立使用。王权的普及部分以将私人武装力量整合入普遍统治实践的形式进行。 王权财政权力的普及 皇冠也经常利用私人或城市的征用来行使其财政权力，同时对此进行合法化和限制。在这里，我们无需关心各种特殊形式的王权财政权力，我们将限于构成“法国”古代政体发展特殊形态的结构特性。首先是十五世纪贵族接受了国王有权定期要求“额外”收入的观念这一事实。这意味着，如同在其他国家一样，除了来自王室领地的收入之外的额外收入。在十三和十四世纪，“额外”的收入常常以封建术语auxilium或援助的形式要求（在“法国”，然而，从不单独向封臣要求）。后来，通常是对商业交易征收的间接税被描述为援助。此外还有炉灶税（最初通常称为fouages，后来称为tailles），以及在许多地方对盐征税。像从城镇、犹太人和伦巴第人勒索的强制贷款或“礼物”一样，所有这些支付直到十五世纪都是通过重复紧急状态来证明的。不断重复的“额外”要求最终建立了作为事实上的王权特权的征税权威。 这一发展的前提条件很容易理解：一方面，皇家rente或养老金的接受者可以轻易看出，这种收入不能仅凭领地经济来资助。另一方面，不仅是宗教和世俗领主，城镇也被授予免税权。如果国王召集地产大会，那么与会者通常抱怨的问题比他们的税负更紧迫。P.S. Lewis，熟悉与英国发展的差异，认为定期征税和常备军的引入很可能是états généraux暂时缺乏关注的结果。 间接税也影响到贵族，不是所有城镇都能获得特权。然而，中世纪晚期国王不敢直接对贵族征税这一事实，决定性地影响了不仅是王权的财政权力，而且也影响了“法国”古代政体的基本结构，导致了一个私人参与中央化提取的系统的出现。对于1347年，Guy Bois估计诺曼底农民的税负约为三十天的劳动。然而，普遍认为，从十三世纪晚期开始，在百年战争期间，税收上升，之后一直大致保持不变，直到十七世纪初。货币价值频繁波动，以及巨大的地区差异，通常很难评估提取的具体程度。 王权财政权力的第二个结构特征对中世纪后期产生了长期影响，源于这对获得特权地位成员资格的相关性。从某种意义上说，贵族的地位特征是由王权财政权力的行使确立的。因为贵族需要免除对非贵族征收的特定税收。对作为“神职人员”的认可也是如此（见下文）。相反，王权财政权力的普及和规范化加强了世袭贵族观念。虽然在十四和十五世纪（在特定情况下，甚至在十六世纪），贵族的世袭性必须通过至少具有一定最小规模的领地财产在实践中得到证实，但后来，证明某人的祖先是非税负者被视为贵族身份的证据。由于这种特权虽然促进了占有，但不能防止贫困，王权财政的特定结构促进了社会等级和财产层级之间差异的发展，这是“法国”古代政体中的典型结构特征。 王权司法权力的普及 对“法国”大多数居民来说，决定性的是他们所居住的领地主的私人司法权力——不仅仅是在古代政体的初始阶段。尽管无法确定banale领主制的数量，但对十七和十八世纪，通常的估计是80000。在十三和十四世纪有律师认为，每个领主只对其封臣拥有司法权，任何进一步的司法权必须由国王明确授予。在实践中，皇冠接受了banale领主能够裁决“民事”案件并在刑事事务中执行所谓的“较低”和“中等”司法权。只有在“血液司法”[haute justice]领域，逐渐形成了这必须被明确授予和确认的观点。法国王冠无法拒绝向强大的贵族做出这一让步。同时，在王权政府力量薄弱的时期（例如在十六世纪晚期），被确认拥有此权力的领主人数往往会增加。 领主并不亲自行使司法权，而是通过其领地或其代理人的“官员”行使。作为一般规则，这些法律职能人员并不在乡村办公或居住，而是在最近的城镇。随着这些职位的日益普遍出卖，这种空间分离对被告或纠纷双方的司法实践产生了影响。不仅是典型的英国“邻里”影响，而且一种假定个人熟悉的社会冲突的司法处理形式，在法国环境中难以发展。"},{"instruction":"请将“In the early thirteenth century, many districts had lacked any possibility of appeal against seigneurial jurisdiction. The later strengthening of princely or royal territorial rule, moreover, led neither to the abolition of this private jurisdiction nor to the transformation of autonomous into delegated rule. Instead, royal rule was established by way of a limitation and control of private judicial authority: by the development of an instance of appeal. This proceeded steadily, but in phases. The first phase of royal offensive lasted more or less from the second half of the fourteenth to the end of the fifteenth century, coinciding therefore with the crisis of seigneurie banale that was especially pronounced in the north. At this time, the crown also asserted its judicial supremacy vis-à-vis the communes. As well as the control of private or urban jurisdiction, the crown claimed a right of prévention. This concept denoted the crown's ability to act whenever court proceedings seemed advisable but were neglected by private sires, as well as denying seigneurial competence in all cases of importance to the crown, the so-called cas royal. Eventually, the expropriation of private jurisdiction was legitimised by reference to possible abuse. (In individual cases, this form of prévention was also practised.) When the form of seigneurie banale was newly reinforced in the sixteenth century, the possessors of private jurisdiction in the north won back competences that the crown had denied them. In the south, the crown had hardly exercised juris-diction up to this time. The seventeenth century then saw a new limitation of private jurisdiction, this time more far-reaching and comprehensive. But even this development was partly revised again in the eighteenth century. In 'France', the development of royal jurisdiction was the particular strategy by which the generalisation of royal power was promoted.30 The crown how-ever accepted not only the private possession of judicial power, but also the persistence of different legal customs. The generalisation of royal power did not therefore lead to a unification of law, but rather - from the late fifteenth century - to the formalising of local coutumes. In some cases, these customs varied from one châtellenie (the earlier castellania) to the next, in others - espe-cially in Normandy, Brittany and Burgundy - princes succeeded in unifying the law in their realm in the same way as the royal rule had contributed to spreading the coutume of Paris. In the north, local law was transmitted almost exclusively by word of mouth until it was recorded by the crown, while in the south local legal custom had developed in the context of a partly surviving and partly renewed tradition of Roman legal notions, and in large parts had long been encoded. Though many differences in local legal practice disappeared in the course of the ancien régime, the fundamental difference between the legal systems of north and south survived until the Revolution. ('North' and 'south' should be understood here in very general terms.) These particular developments were reinforced by the military-political conjunctures of the Hundred Years War. Until the start of the fifteenth century, the royal courts had confirmed regional judicial centres only under the condition that the parlement de Paris (see below) remained the highest appeal instance for all courts in the kingdom. When Charles VII had to take refuge in the south in the 1420s, and the Plantagenets ruled in Paris and the north, the jurisdiction of the parlement de Paris was in practice abolished. The dauphin then granted the assize court of Toulouse the same sovereign character that had previously been conceded only to the parlement de Paris. Charles VII and his successors proceeded likewise with other courts in outlying regions of the kingdom, those where independent princely power had been strongest: these courts were declared to be parlements, subject to the king but to no other court. In accordance with the unity of judicial and administrative competence that was characteristic of the ancien régime, powers of administrative regulation [arrêts] and policing functions were similarly extended to the parlements of Toulouse, Grenoble, Rennes, Aix, etc. The Toulouse parlement, for example, exercised its own administrative supervision over towns in the region, decreed regulations for guilds, and pursued a regular policy of protective tariffs - thanks to its competence of establishing duties at the Spanish frontier.31 At least theoretically, regulations of this kind could be quashed by the royal council, in the same way as legal decisions. In the historiography and sociology of the rise of the ‘modern state', it is usual to attribute an important role in the strengthening of royal rule to legal theorists schooled in Roman law - as if this was basically dependent on its own theoretical legitimisation. Joseph R. Strayer, however, countered in a remarkable contribution32 that it was quite evidently not only the king but also the princes, as well as towns struggling for their liberties, who had taken into their service scholars who had learned to make use of the structures of argument of Roman law. He also refers to careers involving a clear change in allegiance. Strayer's view is that in the case of the French kings, the spread of Roman law may ultimately have even proved an obstacle to the intensification of royal rule. What did spread throughout the kingdom - i.e. not just in the main stronghold of a law that was influenced by the Roman tradition - was an emphasis on individual cases. This experience became in a certain sense the instrument of a new professional group, whose members, like the knights at an earlier time, served the rulers in their exercise of rule. It was in the interest of legal scholars that the ‘judgement of God' - generally in the form of a legal duel - should be abolished in seigneurial judicial practice where it still obtained. As royal rule in ‘France' was established by the crown making itself the appeal instance for continuing seigneurial and princely judiciaries, all fiscal-policy and to a large extent even religious controversies became questions of law. At the same time, the question of legitimacy became linked to a specific procedure. In practice, this also meant the delegitimisation of certain summary pro-cedures practised by the king himself. Thus in 1343, twelve supporters of Jean de Montfort could still be hung as traitors simply at the behest of the king. From the middle of the fourteenth century, however, ‘treason against the king' became a crime that was judged in parlement (sometimes also in the Châtelet). The king could still order an execution, but if this was not to appear arbitrary, it now had to follow the conclusion of a trial.33 Strayer sees the fact that the crown governed in the form of legal decision as making it tempting to challenge fiscal and administrative regulations in court; if such cases were lost, reasons could almost always be found to launch an appeal. Conversely, practices of this kind caused the crown to perfect its pro-cedures and establish more special courts. Though eventually the crown gen-erally won cases of this kind, this was rarely as rapid a matter as the effective exercise of rule would have required. It was therefore increasingly prepared, for example, to accept immediate payment on account from towns, so as to avoid lengthy conflict over the full sum demanded. The practice of leasing out tax collection to private individuals was also encouraged by the constant court cases against the royal administration.34 In short, according to Strayer, ‘Roman law' and the rationalisation of court procedures favoured the crown only to a very slight degree. The parlement de Paris developed into the central royal judicial institution. It arose as an extension of the royal council, and developed from the mid-thir-teenth century into a separate institution, and one that remained stationary, in contrast to the court. The parlement was initially the king's court of fiefs, and thus responsible for dealing with all conflicts between the king and his vassals. In the course of time, it retained this ‘first instance' character only for disputes between the crown and territorial princes or other great nobles, and developed otherwise into a court of appeal. At the same time, the parlement (its name should not suggest that it had any representative function) issued decrees, and it ‘registered' the laws and decrees of the crown, which in this way were made public. Before this happened, objections or remonstrations were possible (in some cases repeatedly) against the ‘unreasonableness' of a decree. If the king was not prepared to accept the ‘reason' of parlement as his own, then he either ordered the registration to be effected (a fact that would then generally be noted in the registration), or held a so-called lit de justice, i.e. appearing in person so as to display his rule over the parlement. In this case, the decree which the parlement had remonstrated against was registered in the presence of the king (cf. below). Nowhere was the argumentative skill of the royal lawyers more important than in the power struggles with the Curia. Here as elsewhere, the extent of royal power was decided in the last instance not by argument but by the pos-sibility of its armed assertion; but as long as weapons were silent, it was the lawyers who fought. The personnel were exchangeable, so long as the clergy monopolised education. Only from the mid-fifteenth century did the king increasingly employ specialists who were not clerics.35 Up till then it had been clergy in the main who developed the grounds for the limitation of church jurisdiction. In the eleventh and twelfth centuries, the jurisdiction of bishops (and popes) had been extended, and canon law further developed (cf. above on the exemptions of monasteries). Legal authority was claimed over all 'clergy' [ratione personae] as well as over all material affairs affecting the church [ratione materiae]. Both aspects were extended widely. Though in principle only those could be considered 'clergy' who were at least seven years old, unmarried, could read and had received the tonsure, in practice there were many 'clergy' with tonsures but unable to read, or who had not yet reached seven, or were married, engaged in trade or hired themselves out as knights. The church courts and the crown were generally prepared in the fourteenth century to accept all these 'clergy' at face value. This meant that the individuals in ques-tion profited from the tax privileges of the clerical estate, and could only be accused before church courts. It was only if they practised daylight robbery, lent money at interest, had married a second time or a widow, that difficulties arose.36 Philippe le Bel (1285-1314), for example, complained to the pope that Italian merchants had themselves tonsured and wore clerical dress in order to escape secular justice. In practice, when the crown took its first measures against the competence claims of the church courts in the thirteenth century, it proceeded initially against their jurisdiction in ratione materiae. Clerical juris-diction over crusaders and scholars, on the other hand, was untouched. In the fourteenth century, royal lawyers struggled initially against the scope of papal jurisdiction, before turning their attention to that of the church courts in 'France'. Eventually, the church courts in the kingdom were integrated into the royal authority.”翻译为中文","output":"在十三世纪早期，许多地区缺乏对领主司法管辖权提出上诉的可能性。此外，亲王或王室领土统治的后期加强既未废除这种私人司法管辖权，也未将自治转变为授权统治。相反，王室统治是通过限制和控制私人司法权力建立起来的：通过开发上诉实例。这一过程稳步进行，但分阶段进行。王室进攻的第一阶段大体上从十四世纪下半叶持续到十五世纪末，因此与尤其在北方特别显著的领主制危机同时发生。在这个时期，王室还对公社宣称其司法至高无上的权利。除了控制私人或城市的司法管辖权外，王室还声称拥有预防权。这一概念表示王室在法庭程序被私人领主忽视但被认为是可取的情况下采取行动的能力，以及在对王室至关重要的所谓皇家案件中否认领主的管辖权。最终，私人司法管辖权的征用通过引用可能的滥用得到合法化。（在个别案件中，也实行过这种预防形式。）当领主制在十六世纪被重新加强时，北方私人司法权利所有者赢回了王室曾经否认他们的职能。在南方，王室直到这时几乎没有行使过司法管辖权。然后十七世纪看到了对私人司法管辖权的新的限制，这次更加深远和全面。但即便这种发展在十八世纪部分被再次修改。 在“法兰西”，王室司法权的发展是促进王权普及的特殊策略。然而，王室不仅接受了私人拥有的司法权力，还接受了不同法律习惯的持续存在。因此，王权的普及并未导致法律的统一，而是——从十五世纪晚期开始——对地方习俗进行形式化。在某些情况下，这些习俗从一个châtellenie（早期的castellania）变化到下一个，在其他情况下——尤其是在诺曼底、布列塔尼和勃艮第——亲王成功地在他们的领域内统一了法律，就像王室统治有助于传播巴黎习俗一样。在北方，地方法律几乎完全通过口头传播，直到被王室记录下来，而在南方，地方法律习俗是在部分幸存和部分更新的罗马法律概念传统中发展起来的，在很大部分已经被编纂。尽管在古代政体过程中许多地方法律实践的差异消失了，但北方和南方法律体系的根本差异一直持续到革命时期。（这里的“北方”和“南方”应该以非常一般的方式理解。） 这些特殊的发展被百年战争的军事政治形势加强。到十五世纪初为止，皇家法院仅在巴黎高等法院（见下文）仍然是王国所有法院的最高上诉实例的条件下确认了地区司法中心的地位。当查理七世在1420年代不得不逃往南方，并且金雀花家族在巴黎和北方统治时，巴黎高等法院的管辖权在实践中被废除了。于是，太子授予图卢兹的法庭同样的主权特征，这以前仅被让予巴黎高等法院。查理七世及其继任者对王国边远地区的其他法院也采取了同样的做法，那些地方独立亲王权力最强：这些法院被宣布为高等法院，服从国王但不服从任何其他法院。根据古代政体特有的司法和行政职能的统一性，行政规定[决议]和警察职能也同样扩展到图卢兹、格勒诺布尔、雷恩、艾克斯等地的高等法院。例如，图卢兹高等法院对该地区的城镇行使了自己的行政监督，颁布了行会的规章，并实行了一项常规的保护性关税政策——感谢其在西班牙边境设立关税的职权。至少在理论上，此类规定可以被皇家委员会撤销，就像法律裁决一样。 在“现代国家”崛起的历史学和社会学中，通常将在罗马法学有所学识的法律理论家在加强王室统治中发挥的重要作用归因于——好像这基本上依赖于它自己的理论合法性。然而，Joseph R. Strayer在一篇杰出的贡献中提出反驳，显然不仅仅是国王，而且亲王以及为争取自由而奋斗的城镇，都聘请了学会利用罗马法论证结构的学者为他们服务。他还提到了涉及明显变更效忠的职业生涯。Strayer认为，就法国国王而言，罗马法的传播最终可能甚至证明是加强王权统治的障碍。在整个王国内传播的——即不仅仅在受罗马传统法律影响的主要据点内——是对个案的强调。这种经验在某种意义上成为了一个新的专业群体的工具，其成员，就像早期的骑士一样，为统治者在其统治行使中服务。法律学者们的利益在于应当废除在领主司法实践中仍然存在的“上帝的判决”——通常以法律决斗的形式。由于“法兰西”的王权是通过王室使自己成为持续领主和亲王司法的上诉实例建立起来的，所有财政政策和在很大程度上甚至是宗教争议都变成了法律问题。同时，合法性问题与特定程序挂钩。 在实践中，这也意味着对国王自己实行的某些摘要程序的非法定化。因此，在1343年，还可以仅凭国王的命令就将十二名支持Jean de Montfort的人作为叛徒吊死。然而，从十四世纪中叶开始，“对国王的叛国”成为在高等法院（有时也在Châtelet）审判的罪行。国王仍然可以下令执行死刑，但如果这不想显得是武断的，现在必须在审判结束后进行。Strayer认为，皇室以法律裁定的形式进行统治，使得人们有诱因在法庭上挑战财政和行政规定；如果这类案件败诉，几乎总能找到理由提起上诉。相反，这类做法促使王室完善其程序并设立更多的特别法院。尽管最终王室通常赢得了此类案件，但这很少像有效行使统治所需的那样迅速。因此，它越来越倾向于例如接受城镇的即时部分付款，以避免就要求的全部金额发生长期冲突。对王室行政部门的不断法庭案件也鼓励了将税收征集外包给私人个体的做法。简而言之，根据Strayer的观点，“罗马法”和法庭程序的合理化仅在很小程度上有利于王室。 巴黎高等法院发展成为中央王室司法机构。它起源于王室议会的扩展，并从十三世纪中叶开始发展为一个独立的机构，与法庭不同，它保持不动。最初，高等法院是国王的封地法院，因此负责处理国王与其封臣之间的所有冲突。随着时间的推移，它保留了这种“第一实例”特性，仅用于处理王室与领地亲王或其他大贵族之间的争议，而在其他方面发展为上诉法院。同时，高等法院（其名称不应暗示它具有任何代表性功能）颁发法令，并且“记录”了王室的法律和法令，通过这种方式公之于众。在此之前，可以针对法令的“不合理性”提出反对或声明（在某些情况下反复多次）。如果国王不准备接受高等法院的“理由”作为自己的理由，那么他要么命令进行记录（这一事实通常会在记录中注明），要么举行所谓的“正义之床”，即亲自出现以展示其对高等法院的统治。在这种情况下，高等法院反对的法令会在国王在场的情况下进行记录（见下文）。 在与教廷的权力斗争中，皇家律师的辩论技巧无处不在地发挥着重要作用。在这里和其他地方，王权的范围最终不是由辩论而是通过武力主张的可能性决定的；但只要武器沉默，就是律师在战斗。只要神职人员垄断了教育，人员就是可以交换的。直到十五世纪中叶，国王越来越多地雇佣非神职人员作为专家。直到那时，主要是神职人员发展了限制教会司法权的理由。 在十一和十二世纪，主教（和教皇）的管辖权被扩大，教会法得到进一步发展（参见上文关于修道院豁免的内容）。对所有“神职人员”[ratione personae]以及涉及教会的所有物质事务[ratio materiae]声称具有法律权威。这两个方面被广泛扩展。虽然原则上只有那些至少七岁，未婚，能读写并且接受了剃度礼的人才能被视为“神职人员”，但实际上有许多剃度但不识字的“神职人员”，或者还未达到七岁，或者已婚，从事商业或作为骑士出租自己。在十四世纪，教会法庭和皇室通常准备接受所有这些“神职人员”的面值。这意味着相关个体从神职阶层的税收特权中获益，并且只能在教会法庭上被指控。只有当他们在白天抢劫、放高利贷、再婚或与寡妇结婚时，才会出现困难。例如，菲利普贝尔（1285-1314年）向教皇抱怨说，意大利商人剃了头，穿上神职服装以逃避世俗司法。实际上，当王室在十三世纪首次采取措施反对教会法庭的权力主张时，最初是针对它们在ratione materiae中的管辖权。另一方面，对十字军和学者的神职司法权没有受到影响。在十四世纪，皇家律师最初挣扎于教皇管辖权的范围，然后转向关注“法兰西”教会法院的权力。最终，在王国内的教会法院被整合入皇家权威。"},{"instruction":"请将“As Lemarignier has shown, in the course of these conflicts the crown made use of procedures that had been developed for the limitation and integration of seigneurial jurisdiction. This meant that in any cas royal the crown was declared an instance of appeal, while decisions by church courts were also quashed by the argument of misuse. Three areas of conflict are of particular importance here. The first concerned the decision of Boniface VIII to remove the tasks of the Inquisition from the responsibility of episcopal courts and turn them over to the Dominicans. With the support of the French bishops, Phillipe le Bel's legal minds developed the basic argument for Gallicanism (see below): heresy was deemed to threaten the peace of the kingdom, and thus fall under the responsibility of the crown. In actual fact, the parlement became an appeal instance for the Inquisition tribunals. This meant an appropriation by the crown of the power to define the boundary between correct belief and heresy. The second conflict to be discussed here concerned legal authority in the case of treason against the king. S.H. Cuttler, who has made a special study of this problem, writes: In good part, the authority of the French crown in the late Middle Ages was a function of its ability to punish crimes. Since treason more than any other crime was directed against the general order, this crime could only be judged by the king as embodiment of public order, or by the officers and courts that he appointed for this purpose. This at least was the majority view of lawyers and coutumiers [specialists in unformalised local law: H.G.]. In practice, though in most cases of treason the crown achieved this competence, it had sometimes to be asserted against urban, seigneurial, and above all religious jurisdictions.37 Punishment of clergy in 'France' customarily remained the responsibility of church courts. In cases of lèse-majesté, however, the crown demanded - and obtained - jurisdiction. During the Hundred Years War, for example, bishops were on several occasions condemned by the parlement for their links with the enemy, often - though not always - with the participation of clerical judges. It also seems that some of those condemned were executed without previously having been expelled from the clerical estate, as was the general custom.38 The third example of these restrictions of competence arose from the extension of secular jurisdiction in marital affairs. Though marriage as such remained the uncontested responsibility of church courts, the crown claimed jurisdiction over marital disputes that involved material connections between spouses, as well as conflicts resulting from the separation of goods, and some-times also the separation of bodies. From the mid-fifteenth century, the crown prevailed with the argument of misuse of judicial power. In other words, decisions of church courts could be quashed by the crown's instances of appeal. The practice of appeal against misuse developed very rapidly also for administrative decrees of the church. It then affected for example specific prescriptions of religious practice or even excommunication. What made it possible to implement legal practice of this kind was a particular balance of forces between the pope and the French king, which we shall discuss further below. But it outlasted this particular political conjuncture. Until the Revolution, decisions of church courts were regularly overturned by royal courts on the basis of misuse. Under Napoleon the practice was not only restarted, but actually intensified. It lasted until the final separation of church and state in 1905.39 Power of office and avancement In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a fief, a farm, a commission that was limited in content and time or a long-term task in the service of the king (or another lord) could all be described as an office. Many offices of the king were awarded to the retainers of royal vassals. In some cases they were given to vassals so that these could sell them or occupy them as they saw fit. Offices were thus understood as a source of income. They offered the king the pos-sibility of rewarding his vassals at no great cost. At the same time, there were also dealings in offices in which money was involved. A private trade in office power existed. For 'offices' with judicial power, this trade was repeatedly forbidden. This not only shows that it took place, it also shows that judicial power was ascribed a quite special importance. To sell it for money was rather like the sale of religious power (likewise quite usual), simony or sacrilege. The most that money alone could buy, however, was access to minor power of office. For all other transactions, 'elections' not excepted, recommendation was needed as well as cash. Françoise Autrand believes therefore that what was rather involved, strictly speaking, was a form of co-optation linked with financial settlement, rather than a regular trade.40 From the end of the fifteenth century, access to a whole series of offices needed not just money along with kinship or friendship connections with influential incumbents, but also a certain qualification. This made it harder to make unimpeded use of office power for retainers. Yet mighty nobles con-tinued to profit materially from the fact that the king would necessarily be inclined to follow their recommendations. They now conveyed office power also to individuals outside their own 'household', and accepted reward for their pains. The most important path of access to offices du roi, however, in the fifteenth and still in the sixteenth century, was lignage. In the historical rise of the new social group that the officiers were rapidly perceived as forming, the charac-teristic medieval practice of defining social structures as forms of kinship, and behaving according to such definitions, played once again a decisive role. We find again here varying notions of kinship in the different strata of the popu-lation. Whilst in the lower strata an individual choice of spouse had become more common from the fourteenth century, along with a later age of first mar-riage for women, and the tendency towards the nuclear family was already so advanced that the royal tax authorities oriented themselves to it, among the nobility and the higher strata of non-nobles the kinship forms of lignage - and thus family agreements over marriage, and an early age of first marriage for women - remained largely in place.41 With hindsight, these biologically defined protective associations stand in a certain sense at a historical turning-point. They are somewhat similar to the personal structures of obligation between lords and their retinue, and to this extent fit into a culturally dominant tradition. At the same time, they were historical prefigurations of the cli- entele groups that were later to be so important, more or less stable networks of connection for mutual promotion in material, status and political terms. In this connection, the transmission of office power within the extended fam-ily is of immense significance. It proceeded above all through the practice of resignatio in favorem, retirement in favour of a nominated successor. Françoise Autrand has studied the development of this form in the fifteenth century.42 Many such retirements were in favour of relatives or persons recommended by relatives or friends. (Neither case excluded payment for the office received.) ‘Dans le service de l'Etat au XVème siècle, les choses se passent en famille ou au moins entre gens de connaissance,' as she summarised her results.43 Family support was also useful for strategies of advance in other fields than royal office, if not indeed essential. Jean-Louis Bourgeon has impressively demonstrated this for a particularly celebrated example, that of Colbert.44 Mikhal Harsgor pertinently described the ‘accumulation' of fiefs, commissions, offices, profitable marriage ties, houses and land as a familial strategy [poursuite familiale],45 and held that in the late fifteenth century the kingdom was de facto in the possession of a few great families, who shared out among them - along with their friends and hangers-on - command of the army, rule over the royal fiscality, a considerable share of the sénéchausées and above all the profitable episcopal and archepiscopal sees. Their constant aim was in one way or another to attain possession of seigneurial rule. Characteristic of this power élite, which consisted of a relatively stable core with fluctuating adherents, seems to have been its pronounced legalism. Court cases were preferred means of exercising appropriation and power. Not just the relatives and friends of this narrow ruling circle, but also those at its centre, were composed of a mixture of nobles and non-nobles (the majority at least ennobled in some form). It was not their origin, but their function as 'oligarchs', that was decisive for their social status.46 It may be that Harsgor overestimates the systematic and economically purposive character of this private exploitation of generalised power in the late fifteenth century. What is incontestable, however, is that at this time the foundations developed for the form of rule that was later characteristic of the ancien régime: expansion of centralised power in the form - and under the condition - of its far-reaching privatisation. The formation of a notion of office as a permanent institution of rule, inde-pendent of its present incumbent, went together with the assertion of a de facto and then formal inamovibilité. Only in cases of gross abuse of office could an incumbent be dismissed, but not for example with the death of the king or a change in government policy. Along with resignatio in favorem and the so- called survivances, candidatures to office, this irremovable character prepared the transformation into private property that was legalised in the early seventeenth century (see below). At that time the acquisition of office power became one of the most important forms of social advance. In this respect there is no difference from developments in England and other European kingdoms of the time. But as distinct from the English case, acquisition of office in France was not only a means of advance, but at the same time a decisive form of appropriation for wealthy non-nobles. Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie also speaks of a mode d'appropriation in this connection.47 In the late fifteenth century, and especially the early sixteenth century, this development was promoted precisely by those social circles who were later to complain about it so bitterly: the noblesse d'épée, who still hoped to win power, money, land and honour through warfare. The propaganda campaign that presented the first expedition to conquer Italy as a war waged in the name of God for the reform of the church, was according to Harsgor a cynical exercise on the part of those who planned it, as in their correspondence it was purely the prospects of victory and profit that were debated.48 Eventually, in the first half of the sixteenth century, the royal and dynastic policy of conquest that was supported by considerable parts of this nobility favoured far less the appropriation strategies of impoverished knights than the prospects of advance for non-nobles. The financing of its policy of conquest led the crown in 1552 to undertake trade in offices on its own account. It established a bureau des parties casuelles, to sell office power under the fiction of requesting from the bidders a loan that would actually be forfeited. ”翻译为中文","output":"正如勒马尼埃所展示，在这些冲突过程中，王室利用了为限制和整合领主司法管辖权而开发的程序。这意味着在任何皇家案件中，王室被宣布为上诉实例，而教会法庭的判决也因滥用的论点而被推翻。这里有三个特别重要的冲突领域。第一个涉及波尼法斯八世决定将宗教裁判的任务从主教法庭移交给多米尼加会的决定。在法国主教的支持下，菲利普勒贝尔的法律智囊团制定了加利加尼主义（见下文）的基本论点：异端被认为威胁王国的和平，因此属于王权的责任。实际上，巴黎高等法院成为宗教裁判法庭的上诉实例。这意味着王室占据了定义正统信仰与异端之间界限的权力。第二个将在此讨论的冲突涉及反对国王的叛国罪的法律权威。对这个问题进行专门研究的S.H. Cuttler写道： 在很大程度上，法国王室在中世纪晚期的权威是其惩罚罪行能力的功能。由于叛国罪超过任何其他罪行针对的是整体秩序，这一罪行只能由作为公共秩序象征的国王或他指派的官员和法庭判决。至少这是律师和习惯法专家[地方非正式法律的专家：H.G.]的主流观点。实际上，虽然在大多数叛国案件中王室获得了这一职权，但有时还必须与城市、领主，尤其是宗教管辖权抗争以争取这一地位。 在“法兰西”的神职人员的惩罚通常仍由教会法庭负责。然而，在重大不敬罪案件中，王室要求——并获得——管辖权。例如，在百年战争期间，因与敌人有联系，主教们曾多次被巴黎高等法院谴责，往往（尽管不总是）有神职法官的参与。似乎也有一些被定罪者在没有被正式逐出神职阶层之前就被执行了，这是一般的惯例。 第三个例子是世俗司法管辖权在婚姻事务中的扩展所带来的权限限制。尽管结婚本身仍由教会法庭无可争议地负责，但王室声称对涉及夫妇之间物质关系的婚姻纠纷，以及因财产分离和有时也包括身体分离而产生的冲突拥有管辖权。 从十五世纪中叶开始，王室以司法权力滥用的论点占了上风。换句话说，教会法庭的决定可以被王室的上诉实例推翻。针对教会的行政法令提出上诉以反对滥用的做法发展得非常迅速。然后它影响了例如特定的宗教实践规定甚至绝罚。使得能够执行此类法律实践的是教皇和法国国王之间特定的力量平衡，我们将在下面进一步讨论。但它超越了这个特定的政治形势。直到革命，教会法庭的决定经常因滥用而被皇家法院推翻。在拿破仑时代，这种做法不仅被重新开始，而且实际上被加强了。这一做法持续到1905年教会和国家最终分离。 职位权力和晋升 在十四和十五世纪，领地、农场、内容和时间有限的任务或为国王（或其他领主）服务的长期任务都可以被称为职位。许多国王的职位被授予王室封臣的随从。在某些情况下，它们被授予封臣，以便这些封臣可以出售它们或随意占据它们。因此，职位被视为收入来源。它们为国王提供了以较低成本奖励其封臣的可能性。同时，也存在涉及金钱的职位交易。存在一个私人的职位权力交易市场。对于拥有司法权力的“职位”，这种交易被反复禁止。这不仅表明这种交易发生了，还表明司法权力被赋予了特殊的重要性。用金钱出售它有点像出售宗教权力（同样很常见），是种司教行为或亵渎行为。然而，光凭金钱最多只能买到次要的职位权力。对于所有其他交易，“选举”也不例外，除了现金外还需要推荐。因此，弗朗索瓦·奥特朗认为，严格来说，这更多是一种与金融结算相结合的共同选择形式，而不是常规的交易。 从十五世纪末开始，进入一系列职位的途径不仅需要金钱以及与有影响力的现任者有亲属或友谊关系，还需要一定的资格。这使得更难以不受阻碍地利用职位权力来为随从提供服务。然而，强大的贵族继续从这样一个事实中获益，即国王必然倾向于遵循他们的推荐。他们现在也将职位权力传递给自己“家庭”之外的个人，并为此获得回报。 然而，在十五和十六世纪，进入国王职位的最重要途径是家世。在形成的新社会群体——职员——迅速被认为是构成的历史崛起中，将社会结构定义为亲属关系的形式，并根据此类定义行事的典型中世纪做法再次发挥了决定性作用。我们在这里再次发现了人口不同阶层中对亲属关系的不同观念。虽然在较低阶层，从十四世纪开始个人选择配偶变得更加普遍，妇女初婚年龄变晚，以及核心家庭的趋势已经如此发达，以至于国王的税务机关以此为导向，但在贵族和非贵族的较高阶层中，家族形式的亲属关系——因此关于婚姻的家庭协议，以及妇女初婚年龄较早——基本上仍然存在。回顾性地看，这些在生物学上定义的保护联合在某种意义上处于历史转折点。它们在某种程度上类似于领主及其随从之间的个人义务结构，并因此符合文化主导的传统。同时，它们是稍后将非常重要的朋党团体的历史预兆，这些团体更或少稳定的关系网用于相互在物质、地位和政治方面的提升。 在这方面，职位权力在大家庭内的传承具有巨大的意义。它主要通过退休以支持指定继任者的做法进行。弗朗索瓦·奥特朗研究了十五世纪该形式的发展。许多此类退休是为了亲属或由亲属或朋友推荐的人。（这两种情况都不排除为获得的职位付费。）“在15世纪的国家服务中，事情发生在一个家庭或至少在认识的人之间，”她总结了她的研究结果。 家庭支持对进入其他领域的提升策略也是有用的，如果不是必不可少的。让-路易·布尔让通过一个特别著名的例子，即科尔伯特，令人印象深刻地证明了这一点。米哈尔·哈斯戈恰当地描述了作为家族策略的领地、任命、职位、有利的婚姻联系、房产和土地的“积累”，并认为在十五世纪末，王国实际上掌握在少数大家族手中，他们与他们的朋友和追随者分享了对军队的指挥、对王室财政的统治、一大部分地方行政长官职位，尤其是有利可图的主教和大主教职位。他们的不断目标是以某种方式获得领主统治的所有权。 这个权力精英的特点似乎是其明显的法律主义。法庭案件是行使占有和权力的首选手段。不仅是这个狭窄统治圈子的亲戚和朋友，甚至是核心成员，也由贵族和非贵族（至少多数以某种形式被封为贵族）混合组成。对他们的社会地位而言决定性的不是他们的出身，而是他们作为“寡头”的功能。哈斯戈可能高估了十五世纪末这种私人利用普遍权力的系统性和经济上的目的性。然而，无可争辩的是，当时为古代政体后来典型的统治形式发展了基础：通过——并在其广泛私有化的条件下——中央集权的扩张。 作为一个与目前任职者无关的永久统治机构的职位概念的形成，伴随着实际上和随后正式不可撤职的主张。除了严重滥用职位权力的情况外，任职者不能被解职，例如不能因为国王去世或政府政策变更。退休以支持和所谓的幸存者，职位候选人，这种不可撤销的特性为十七世纪初期合法化的私有化转变做了准备（见下文）。那时，获得职位权力成为最重要的社会提升形式之一。在这方面，与当时的英格兰和其他欧洲王国的发展没有区别。但与英格兰的情况不同的是，在法国，获得职位不仅是一种提升手段，同时也是富裕的非贵族进行重要占有的决定性形式。Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie也在这方面谈到了一种占有方式。 在十五世纪末，特别是在十六世纪初，这种发展恰好是由那些后来对此如此苦苦抱怨的社会圈子推动的：剑贵族，他们仍然希望通过战争赢得权力、金钱、土地和荣誉。根据哈斯戈的说法，将第一次征服意大利的远征描绘为代表上帝和为了改革教会而进行的战争的宣传活动，是那些策划者的一个愤世嫉俗的行为，因为在他们的通信中，纯粹是胜利和利润的前景在被讨论。最终，在十六世纪上半叶，这个由相当一部分贵族支持的皇室和王室征服政策远不如对非贵族的提升前景有利，不如对贫困骑士的占有策略有利。征服政策的资金筹集使得王室在1552年自行进行职位交易。它建立了一个临时事件办公室，以要求出价者提供实际上会被没收的贷款的名义出售职位权力。"},{"instruction":"请将“Since as a result of immovability, resignatio in favorem and candidature, the crown as a rule had only a few vacant positions to offer, it shifted on the one hand to demanding fees for resignatio and candidature, and on the other hand to the establishment of ever more new offices. It was led all the more in this direction because the demand for offices was so high that prices could be greatly inflated. The royal trade in offices was one of the most rewarding and least problematic ways of paying for cannons and mercenaries. According to Mousnier, the number of officiers royaux rose elevenfold in a century and half, from 4,141 in 1515 to 46,047 in 1665.49 Nobles participated at all levels of the ‘hierarchy of office'. But systematic familial strategies as well as training pro-grammes favoured the rise of non-nobles. For the highest officials, the view developed in the sixteenth century that their proximity to the king in a certain sense obliterated the origin of the incumbent. Anyone who became chancellor, a member of the royal council, or president of a parlement, thus acquired de facto nobility. Many other officials in high positions either purchased letters patent or received these. As against the situation in the fourteenth century, letters patent were no longer an exception in the noble ranks. Yet while those ennobled in this way acquired many noble privileges, they remained members of the Third Estate. It was only after several generations that a ‘silent' transition to real nobility took place. The attraction of power of office was not thereby reduced. The highest strata of the social group sometimes described by contemporaries as the ‘fourth estate'50 were in the process of constituting themselves as a second stratum of nobility. The ‘depiction' of the social order that Charles Loyseau published in 1610 is a document of these collective strategies of ascent. All that need concern us here is Loyseau's treatment of the question of precedence in the complex cases where rank and estate did not correspond: ‘the lowest gentilhomme has precedence over the richest and most honourable man from the Third Estate'. Hence the simple but fundamental behavioural requirement that social status should be sanctioned by power as a personal quality. The situation became difficult when a noble met a non-noble or an ennobled official of the king. It was clear that ‘princes cannot allow precedence to any official, no matter what his rank'. Knights and other members of the high nobility should only concede precedence to those officials who on the basis of their office were themselves noble [chevaliers], ‘for within the same estate, service to the king grants higher rank'. Simple nobles [gentilhommes, écuyers] gave precedence to officials of the king who were magistrates, i.e. members of the most important courts. And this was ‘on account of their jurisdiction and the scope of their power', even if the mag-istrate was a commoner.51 George Huppert52 holds, differing from Mousnier, that Loyseau's Ordres did not depict established rules of behaviour, but rather asserted the demands of a noblesse de robe that criticised the parasitic character of the noblesse d'épée. Indeed, around 1600, outside the noblesse d'épée it was still family origin that determined rank, and not yet office. The ennobled urban officials, for example, did not consider respectable old families in the towns as genuinely high-ranking, so long as they still pursued trade. Those in the towns who considered themselves gentil were not only rich but lived at leisure, drawing their income from seigneuries banales, rentes, property and offices, not the least of these being church offices. By their practices of appropriation and their education, these families distinguished themselves - in their own view as well - from merely wealthy bourgeois. In the first half of the sixteenth century, a large part of these French ‘gentry', as Huppert terms them, managed the silent ascent into the nobility. As against the situation in the previous centuries, this advancing stratum frequently maintained their cultural identity, especially their enthusiasm for classical education. They founded schools rather than chapels, endowed professorial chairs rather than masses. Differently from the English case, in ‘France' the emergence of a ‘gentry', i.e. informal transition into a second stratum of nobility, ended in the late sixteenth century, partly because families from this social group experienced a considerable restriction on their incomes, but above all because of successful competition from educated sons of the less eminent urban bourgeoisie, along with successful defensive struggles by members of the ‘old' nobility. Outside of the noblesse d'épée, the importance of origin for social status was somewhat reduced. What replaced it in the seventeenth century was rather the determination of status by the hierarchy of office, and hence by the rule of the crown. Bénéfices and Gallicanism ‘In the fourteenth century the question of sinecures [bénéfices] stood at the centre of relations between church and state', wrote Mgr Guillaume Mollat at the start of his detailed treatise on the conflicts that culminated in the ‘pragmatic sanction' of Bourges (1438), the ‘charter of Galllicanism'.53 These conflicts and the theological-legal foundations of Gallicanism cannot detain us in any detail here, still less the general state of the church. In the writings of those who championed a reform, both the higher and lower clergy were depicted as greedy, theologically uneducated, and sinners uninterested in the spiritual welfare of the parishioners entrusted to them. The numerous personnel of the church naturally contained exceptions, secular clerics as well as those in holy orders. But even within the French church, in Mollat's view, the question of sinecures was central in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The pope, the king, princes and great nobles all had an interest in the finan-cial situation of the French church, along with those who directly benefited from it or expected to do so, since by granting or agreeing to bénéfices, they could spare expenses for their own personnel, obtain or maintain supporters, acquire a claim to annates (see below), and provide for their own relatives. In the fourteenth and fifteenth century, it was the nobility in particular who enriched themselves from the church. At this time, however, the church itself offered prospects of social advance. Innocent VI (1352-62) was the son of a peasant from Limoges, Jean Charlier (or Gerson) who hailed from a village in Champagne became chancellor of the university of Paris, Pierre d'Ailly, son of a Compiègne townsman, became cardinal of Cambrai.54 In the years 1483 to 1515, on the other hand, more than 70 per cent of the archbishoprics and bish-oprics of ‘France' (excluding Brittany and Nantes) were in the possession of members of the royal council, their sons, nephews, first and second cousins or in-laws.55 This did not mean that these bénéficiaires fulfilled clerical duties, but rather that they enjoyed the incomes from their sinecures. All of them were ‘clerics' in so far as they could read and write. But their higher education was far more likely to have been in the faculty of law rather than that of theology. (One of the demands of the reformers was that graduates of the University of Paris, i.e. theologians, should be more highly regarded in filling church posi-tions.) All clerics were deemed members of the First Estate. But many secular clergy saw themselves far more as nobles in the sense of originating from a lignage of gentilhommes. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, even the less profitable clerical sinecures were among the crumbs that it was worth fighting for. This was already the case in the time of castellanery, when the sires appropriated the right to appoint lower clerical positions, and again in the thirteenth century, when princes (and kings) were concerned to increase the number of sinecures for which they possessed collature (the right to confer clerical office), or else influence electoral processes by their competences of regulation and confirma-tion. The fourteenth and fifteenth centuries saw a certain simultaneous explo-sion of all the conflict structures of this form of rule. On the one hand, from the middle of the century it became harder to materially exploit office power, due to the death from plague of many who owed obligations, and in the north also due to the crisis of seigneurie. It was because of this, at least so P.S. Lewis maintained,56 that the more powerful churchmen made increased efforts to obtain two or more sinecures. For maintaining a great household, in the eyes of the world as well as in their own, counted among the demands and perks of their dignity. When bénéfices were acquired, not only did annates (a share of the profit from the first year) have to be paid to the collateur, substitutes in office compensated and endowments financed, but 'gifts' to the crown (or territorial prince) were also necessary, if not to the pope as well. The conflicts that were kindled by this double taxation and the level it reached were elements in the general struggle for power of disposal over sinecures. One of the most vigorous conflicts over the right of the French kings to tax the clergy of the church of 'France', broke out between Philippe IV and Pope Boniface VIII. This was the starting-point for the long residence of the popes in Avignon, from 1309 to 1377. In 1303 Philippe had tried to settle the conflict in his favour by inviting the pope to a council in Lyon, with the idea of accusing him there. The invitation could only be presented by armed soldiers violently occupying the castle of Agnani where the pope was staying. The pope did not accept the invitation, and managed to defend himself against kidnap- ping by force of arms, but the excitement led to his death. The following year a Frenchman was elected as Pope Clement V, and in 1309 he shifted the papal residence to Avignon. Many historians see the presence of the popes in 'France' as evidence of a subordination of papal rule to that of the French kings. This appearance is deceptive. Their presence in 'France' gave the popes extensive opportunities to expand their discretionary powers. Initially recognised only for the case in which a clerical dignitary died at the seat of the Curia, this 'reservation' was subsequently extended to all bénéfices where the incumbent had had any contact with the pope. In this way the number of 'reserved' sinecures was expanded, at the cost of the former rights of the electoral colleges, the collature of the territorial princes, and in part also that of the king.”翻译为中文","output":"因为不可撤销性、辞职以支持和候选人资格的结果，王室通常只有少数空缺职位可以提供，一方面转而要求支付辞职和候选的费用，另一方面则是设立越来越多的新职位。这一趋势尤其明显，因为对职位的需求如此之高，以至于价格可以大幅增加。王室职位买卖成为支付大炮和雇佣兵费用最有利可图、问题最少的方式之一。根据穆斯尼耶的说法，皇家官员的数量在一个半世纪内增长了十一倍，从1515年的4141人增加到1665年的46047人。贵族参与了“职位等级制度”的各个层次。但系统性的家族策略以及培训计划有利于非贵族的崛起。对于最高官员来说，十六世纪形成了这样一种观点，即他们与国王的亲密关系在某种意义上抹去了现任者的出身。任何成为大臣、王室议会成员或高等法院院长的人，因此都获得了实际上的贵族身份。许多其他高级官员要么购买了专利信函，要么获得了这些信函。与十四世纪的情况相比，专利信函在贵族行列中不再是罕见的。然而，以这种方式被封建的人获得了许多贵族特权，但他们仍然是第三等级的成员。只有几代人之后，才会悄然完成向真正贵族的过渡。职位权力的吸引力由此并未减弱。有时被同时代人称为“第四等级”的社会群体的最高阶层，在形成为贵族的第二阶层的过程中。查尔斯·洛约索在1610年发布的社会秩序“描述”是这些集体上升策略的文件。我们只需要关注洛约索对身份和地位不对应的复杂情况下的优先顺序问题的处理：“最低级的贵族男士比来自第三等级的最富有和最尊贵的人拥有优先权”。因此，社会地位应该由权力作为个人品质来制裁，这是一个简单但根本的行为要求。当贵族遇到非贵族或被封建的王室官员时情况变得复杂。很明显，“亲王们不能允许任何官员，无论他的等级如何，拥有优先权”。骑士和其他高级贵族只应该向那些根据其职位本身就是贵族的官员[骑士]让路，“因为在同一等级内，为国王服务赋予更高的等级”。普通贵族[贵族男士，骑士]向王室的法官让路，即最重要法院的成员。这是“因为他们的司法管辖权和权力范围”，即使法官是平民。乔治·胡珀与穆斯尼耶的观点不同，他认为洛约索的《等级》并没有描述既定的行为规则，而是提出了一种被批评为寄生性的剑贵族的袍贵族的要求。实际上，到了1600年，除了剑贵族之外，家族出身仍是决定地位的因素，而不是职位。例如，被封建的城市官员并不认为城市中古老尊贵的家族是真正的高等级，只要他们仍然从事贸易。那些在城市中认为自己是贵族的人不仅富有，而且过着悠闲的生活，靠着领地、地租、财产和职位的收入为生，其中包括教会职位。通过他们的占有做法和教育，这些家庭在他们自己看来也与仅仅富有的市民区分开来。在十六世纪上半叶，这些法国“乡绅”，如胡珀所称，成功地悄然晋升为贵族。与前几个世纪的情况相比，这个崛起的阶层经常保持他们的文化身份，特别是对古典教育的热情。他们更倾向于创办学校而非小教堂，资助教授职位而非弥撒。与英国的情况不同，在“法国”，“乡绅”的出现，即非正式过渡到贵族的第二阶层，在十六世纪末结束，部分原因是来自这个社会群体的家庭经历了收入的相当大的限制，但主要是因为受过教育的低层城市资产阶级的儿子们的成功竞争，以及“旧”贵族成员的成功防御斗争。 在剑贵族之外，出身对社会地位的重要性有所降低。取而代之的是十七世纪地位更多地由职位等级来决定，因此由王室统治来决定。 教会禄位和加利加尼主义 “在十四世纪，禄位问题[sinecures]成为教会和国家关系的中心”，吉约姆·莫拉在他关于以“布尔日审慎制裁”（1438年，“加利加尼主义宪章”）为高潮的冲突的详细论述的开头写道。这些冲突和加利加尼主义的神学-法律基础在此无法详细讨论，更不用说教会的总体状况了。在提倡改革者的著作中，高级和低级神职人员都被描绘成贪婪、缺乏神学教育、对委托给他们的教友的精神福祉不感兴趣的罪人。教会的众多人员自然包含一些例外，包括世俗神职人员和宗教团体成员。但即使在法国教会内部，在莫拉的观点中，禄位问题在十四和十五世纪仍是核心问题。 教皇、国王、亲王和大贵族都对法国教会的财政状况感兴趣，以及那些直接从中受益或期望受益的人，因为通过授予或同意禄位，他们可以为自己的人员节省费用，获得或维持支持者，获得对年金的索赔权（见下文），并为自己的亲属提供保障。在十四和十五世纪，特别是贵族从教会中致富。然而，这时教会本身提供了社会晋升的前景。无辜六世（1352-62年）是来自利摩日的农民之子，让·夏利耶（或称格尔松）来自香槟的一个村庄，成为巴黎大学的校长，皮埃尔·德艾伊，一个康比涅市民的儿子，成为教皇。另一方面，在1483年到1515年间，\\"法国\\"（不包括布列塔尼和南特）超过70%的总主教和主教职位掌握在王室议会成员及其子侄、堂兄弟或姻亲手中。这并不意味着这些受益人履行了神职职责，而是他们享受了禄位带来的收入。他们都被视为“神职人员”，因为他们能够读写。但他们接受的高等教育更有可能是法律而不是神学。（改革者之一的要求是，在填补教会职位时，应更高度重视巴黎大学的毕业生，即神学家。）所有的神职人员都被视为第一等级的成员。但许多世俗神职人员更多地把自己视为来自贵族男士血统的贵族。 在十四和十五世纪，即使是利润较少的神职禄位也是值得争夺的馈赠。这种情况在领地时代就已存在，当时领主占有了指派低级神职职位的权利，再到十三世纪，当亲王（和国王）试图增加他们拥有授予（领袖任命权）权利的禄位数量，或者通过他们的监管和确认能力影响选举过程。十四和十五世纪见证了这种统治形式所有冲突结构的某种同时爆发。一方面，由于许多负有义务的人死于瘟疫，加上在北方还有领主制的危机，从中世纪以来利用职位权力变得更加困难。至少P.S. Lewis就提出了这个观点，较有势力的教士加大了努力获得两个或更多的禄位。在世人和他们自己看来，维持一个大家庭属于他们尊严的要求和特权。当获得禄位时，不仅必须向授予者支付年金（首年利润的一部分），还必须补偿职位代理人和资助捐赠，而且还必须向国王（或领土亲王）支付“礼物”，如果不是给教皇的话。由于这种双重征税及其达到的水平引发的冲突是争夺禄位支配权斗争的要素之一。 菲利普四世与教皇波尼法斯八世之间爆发的关于法国国王对教会神职人员征税权的斗争是冲突的高潮。这是教皇居住在亚维农的长期起点，从1309年延续到1377年。1303年，菲利普试图通过邀请教皇参加在里昂的会议来使冲突对他有利，想法是在那里指控教皇。邀请只能由武装士兵通过暴力占领教皇所在的阿格南尼城堡来提出。教皇没有接受邀请，并设法用武力防止了绑架，但激动导致了他的死亡。次年，一位法国人被选为教皇克莱门特五世，1309年他将教皇居所迁至亚维农。 许多历史学家将教皇在“法国”的存在视为教皇统治服从于法国国王统治的证据。这种看法是误导的。教皇在“法国”的存在给了教皇广泛的机会来扩展他们的自由裁量权。最初仅被承认适用于神职高官在教廷驻地去世的情况，这种“保留”随后被扩展到所有与教皇有任何接触的禄位。通过这种方式，“保留”的禄位数量扩大了，以牺牲前选举团体的原有权利、领土亲王的授予权，部分也是国王的权利为代价。"},{"instruction":"请将“At the same time, the parlement de Paris developed its strategies for limiting clerical jurisdiction, as we have discussed above. It followed from this that there was not only conflict as to who should occupy a position, but also over who had the right to decide on the legal disputes over investiture rights that constantly arose. In the course of the fourteenth century, the parlement not only asserted itself as the appeal instance for disputes over the benefices of lower clergy, but also achieved the judicial integration of the abbot-bishops. Eventually, in the period of the great schism, when from 1378 to 1415 two popes struggled for rule (even three for a while in 1409), the French clergy accustomed itself to appealing not to 'the' pope, but to the parlement de Paris. At the end of the fourteenth century, the parlement also decided on disputes on the investiture of bishoprics and archbishoprics. It was the legal practice of the final decades of the fourteenth century and the early decades of the fifteenth that gave rise to what was later called the Gallicanism of the parlement, a doctrine that defended the 'indigenous' freedoms of the church against claims of papal supremacy. The strategies of centralisation that the popes pursued in their period of Avignon residence were successfully counteracted in this way. This legal Gallicanism was extended during the schism by demands within the church for papal rule to be subordinated to councils. In point of fact, the division of the church was ended only by the council of Constance (1414-18). The debate about necessary reforms that was begun there was continued at the council of Basle from 1431 to 1449. The decisions of the assembly of French clergy that Charles VII summoned at Bourges in 1438 included many of the reform demands of the council of Basle. The guidelines eventually decreed by the king for the reform of the church in 'France', the so-called ‘pragmatic sanction' of Bourges (1438), insisted on the 'old' rights of the French church vis-à-vis the expansion of papal rule, restored in particular the competence of electoral bodies, and restricted both the pope's fiscal power and the papal 'reservation'. For benefices of the lower clergy, reservation was completely excluded. Differently from the council of Basle, however, the Bourges assembly did grant the pope certain fiscal rights. Gallicanism never developed into a fundamental attack on papal rule, but always remained a demand to restrict it. Gallicanism is customarily depicted as an element in the formative process of generalised royal rule or national statehood, for example by J.-F. Lemari- gnier.57 The argument for this is that those members of the electoral bodies who had hoped to be able to choose their superiors on the basis of monastic discipline and spiritual care, rapidly discovered that little had changed. Instead of the pope appointing his candidates, it was now the king, or clergy dependent on the king, who appointed theirs. But P.S. Lewis warns against the assumption that clerical power was thereby instrumentalised by royal rule. For the shape of royal policy was determined to a very high degree by the result of dispute within the clergy. There were changes of direction on the part of the king, for example the temporary rejection of Gallicanism by Louis XI. But these were unable to withstand the prevailing tendencies within the personnel of clerical rule. Moreover, the specific policy of the clergy in the fifteenth century was decided not on the basis of principle, but of advantage.58 Those hoping for promotion by the king were Gallicans, and those hoping for promotion by the pope were papists. The individuals involved frequently changed sides, often in a short space of time. Harry A. Miskimin59 finally made clear how inappropriate it is to see the Gallicanism of the fifteenth century as an unqualified 'religious policy'. Given the general - and still sharpening - scarcity of precious metal, a policy directed against rulership claims that annually transferred abroad up to half the output of the royal mint became a question of survival. In both the parlement and the cahiers de doléances that were compiled before the convening of the états généraux in 1484, church policy, as Miskimin show, was debated in terms of the shortage of money.60 This perspective was all the more decisive in that it had emerged in the course of the fifteenth century that while manipulation of the currency regularly led to disturbances, as it prejudiced either creditors or debtors, the goal it aimed at could not be achieved, as prices changed to correspond with the real value of money rather than its newly established nominal value.61 A final point to be stressed here is that even the victories that the French crown fought for and achieved in the name of Gallicanism do not immediately confirm the interpretation predominant in the literature of the special power of the French kings vis-à-vis the church. For in other cases princes achieved similar results by less conflictual policies. It was the French clergy who barred this route for the French kings.62 In the same way as the persecution of heretics, the debates at the reforming councils attest that not just among 'simple' churchgoers but also among the possessors of benefices there were Christians concerned for an order on earth that was pleasing to God. Even in the case of kings, their self-proclaimed task of protecting the church - and re-ordering it, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries - cannot be interpreted simply in terms of power politics. For the development of rulership structures in 'France' of this time, however, compe-tition over disposal of benefices was a key structural characteristic. The 'French' form of generalisation of monarchical power François I died in 1547. In the week that passed before his funeral, a period extended by special circumstances, his corpse lay in its coffin while a dummy of his body - with a mask for the face, taken from the living model - lay on display at court. During this week 'the king' continued to 'receive' his advisers and the nobility. They were summoned to table, where meals were served, and even glasses lifted at the precise times when the king liked to drink. The king was even present in effigie at his own burial. This practice, which lasted in both England and France until the seven-teenth century, expressed the complex idea according to which the royal rule of a mortal person was both personal to him and at the same time immortal. Contemporaries of François I described this permanent character of royal rule as the royal dignitas, for which today we use the concept of institution. In the late Middle Ages the dead king of 'France' 'lived' until the moment of his burial. Only at this moment - and not already at the time of his corporeal death - was the cry 'Le roi est mort!' given, followed immediately by 'Vive le roi!' This 'Vive le roi!' signified also a decline in the importance of coronation. For a long time, the rites of succession continued to express the earlier foun-dation of royal rule in election. Even when the throne regularly passed from father to son, the form of election persisted in the confirmation of each succes-sor by the nobility (cf. above). Coronation, which in France was described as a rite [sacre], then meant the definitive confirmation of the legitimate successor. Although the number of sacraments had been limited to seven in the twelfth century, in 'France' there continued to be eight. For the new king was 'sanc-tified' by the sacrament of anointing conducted by the church. The oil that endowed him with this character was a mixture. The largest component was the same oil used for the consecration of bishops. To this however was added a few drops of the oil that according to legend had been used for the baptism of Clovis in the early sixth century. Until 1824, the rite of consecrating royal rule remained linked with the evangelising of the Franks. The early Capetians had effected the continuation of their dynasty (and thereby the royal rule) by making an association with their successors in their own lifetime. When Louis XI died on Crusade no such arrangement had been made, but the rule of the new king was already accepted before he was con-firmed by the nobility and anointed. This showed for the first time the relative loss of importance of coronation for the legitimising of royal rule, and the rise of the principle of succession. But the two conceptions still went together in the fifteenth century. Thus for example it was not just the coronation of Charles VII that confirmed the legitimacy of his rule, but indirectly also the fact that he was a son of Charles VI. Rumours about his extramarital origin were allayed by his coronation. In the course of time, the constitutive importance of coronation for the legit- imisation of royal rule disappeared almost entirely. Its significance now lay rather in determining the symbolic content of royal rule. From the beginning to the end of the ancien régime, this rule, no matter how much it was the property of a person, was never completely personified. The cult of this rule bore rather on the king 'as anointed', 'as knight', 'as protector of the church', rather than as an individual elevated by heredity. In the opening phase of the ancien régime, 'representation' focused on digni- tas, the general character of rule. The geography of the cult also corresponded to this conception. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the most important ceremonies of royal rule, the lits de justice and entrées, were still held in outlying places. Later on, however, the religion royale would be practised above all within the king's palace. A lit de justice meant that the king visited in person the parlement de Paris (or rarely, one of the provincial parlements). This could be, for example, if a noble was accused before the parlement, and this was then expanded into a court of peers by addition of the great nobles and presided over by the king himself; it could also be if the king compelled the registration of laws and decrees in the face of remonstration. In the sixteenth century, a further kind of lit de justice was introduced, the so-called lit de justice inaugural. When the Rouen parlement was summoned in 1560, at the start of the reign of Charles IX, the partial secu-larisation of the royal dignity was manifest. The new reign was now formally opened not by coronation, but by the proclamation of a parlement of the crown. When the start of Louis XIII'S reign was proclaimed at a lit de justice in 1610, the king was then eight years old. He sat on a cushion in the parlement, while it was proclaimed in his name that his mother, Marie de Médicis, would act as regent. At the funeral of his late father, Henri IV, the dead king was carried in effigie for the last time. But because the reign of the new king had already been officially proclaimed, this reproduction now served only as a memorial of the late king. When Louis XIII was himself buried in 1643, his body was carried to the grave without a reproduction of his person being 'present'. The reign of the minoritarian king Louis XIV had again been established already by the parlement, and the regency proclaimed in the name of the king.”翻译为中文","output":"与此同时，巴黎高等法院发展了其限制神职人员司法管辖权的策略，正如我们上面讨论的那样。由此可见，争议不仅在于谁应占据一个职位，而且还在于谁有权决定不断出现的关于投资权法律纠纷。在十四世纪的过程中，高等法院不仅证实了其作为低级神职人员受益权纠纷上诉实例的地位，而且还实现了对修道院院长-主教的司法整合。最终，在大分裂时期，当从1378年到1415年两位教皇为统治而斗争（甚至在1409年一度有三位）时，法国神职人员习惯于不向“教皇”上诉，而是向巴黎高等法院上诉。到了十四世纪末，高等法院还对主教和大主教的投资争议作出了决定。十四世纪最后几十年和十五世纪初几十年的法律实践催生了后来被称为高等法院的加利加尼主义，这一理论捍卫了教会对教皇至上权要求的“本土”自由。在亚维农居住期间，教皇追求的中央集权策略以这种方式成功地得到了对抗。这种法律上的加利加尼主义在分裂期间通过教会内要求教皇统治服从于议会的要求得到了扩展。实际上，教会的分裂只有通过康斯坦茨会议（1414-18年）才得以结束。从那里开始的必要改革辩论在巴塞尔会议上从1431年持续到1449年。 查理七世召集的法国神职人员大会在1438年包括了许多巴塞尔会议的改革要求。 国王最终颁布的指导方针，用于“法国”教会的改革，即所谓的“布尔日审慎制裁”（1438年），坚持了法国教会对抗教皇统治扩张的“旧”权利，特别是恢复了选举机构的职能，并限制了教皇的财政权力和教皇的“保留”。对于低级神职人员的受益权，完全排除了保留。然而，与巴塞尔会议不同，布尔日大会确实授予了教皇一定的财政权利。加利加尼主义从未发展为对教皇统治的根本性攻击，但始终是限制它的要求。 加利加尼主义通常被描述为王室统治或国家国民性形成过程中的一个元素，例如J.-F. Lemarignier所言。这一论点的依据是，那些希望根据修道院纪律和精神关怀能够选择他们上级的选举机构成员，很快就发现变化不大。不是教皇任命他的候选人，而是国王或依赖国王的神职人员任命他们的候选人。但P.S. Lewis警告不要假设神职权力因此被王权所利用。因为王室政策的形态在很大程度上由神职人员内部的争议结果决定。例如，路易十一暂时拒绝加利加尼主义就是一个变动的例子。但这些都无法抵御神职人员统治人员中的主流倾向。此外，十五世纪神职阶层的具体政策不是基于原则，而是基于利益做出决定。那些希望通过国王获得提升的人是加利加尼主义者，那些希望通过教皇获得提升的人是教皇主义者。涉及的个人经常改变立场，往往在很短的时间内。Harry A. Miskimin最终明确了将十五世纪的加利加尼主义视为无条件的“宗教政策”是多么不妥。鉴于贵金属的普遍——并且仍在加剧的——稀缺，针对每年将高达皇家铸币厂产量一半转移到国外的统治要求的政策成了生存问题。在高等法院和在1484年召开三级会议之前编制的抱怨册中，如Miskimin所示，教会政策是从货币短缺的角度进行辩论的。这一视角在十五世纪变得尤为决定性，因为尽管货币操纵经常导致骚乱，因为它损害了债权人或债务人的利益，但其目标无法实现，因为价格会根据货币的实际价值而非新设定的名义价值而变化。 需要强调的最后一点是，法国王室以加利加尼主义的名义争取并取得的胜利，并不立即证实文献中占主导地位的解释，即法国国王相对于教会的特殊权力。因为在其他情况下，亲王通过较少冲突的政策取得了类似的结果。是法国神职人员为法国国王阻止了这条路。62 正如异端的迫害，改革议会的辩论证明，不仅在“简单”的教徒中，甚至在受益权持有者中，也有基督徒关心上帝喜悦的地上秩序。即使在国王的情况下，他们自称的保护教会的任务——在十四和十五世纪对教会进行重新排序——也不能简单地以权力政治来解释。然而，对于这一时期“法国”的统治结构的发展而言，对受益权处理权的竞争是一个关键的结构特征。 法国君主权力普遍化的“法国”形式 弗朗索瓦一世于1547年去世。在他的葬礼之前经过的那一周中，由于特殊情况而延长了这一期间，他的尸体躺在棺材里，而他的身体复制品——用从活着的模特取下的面具作为面孔——在宫廷展出。在这一周里，“国王”继续“接见”他的顾问和贵族。他们被召集到餐桌旁，那里供应餐点，甚至在国王喜欢喝酒的确切时间举杯。国王甚至在他自己的葬礼上以肖像出席。 这一做法在英格兰和法国一直持续到十七世纪，表达了一个复杂的观念，即一位凡人的王室统治既是个人所有，同时又是不朽的。 弗朗索瓦一世的同时代人将这种王室统治的永久特征描述为王室尊严，对于这个概念，我们今天使用了机构的概念。 在中世纪后期，“法国”的死去的国王“活”到了他的葬礼那一刻。只有在这一刻——而不是在他的肉体死亡时——才会发出“国王已死！”的呼喊，紧接着是“国王万岁！”这个“国王万岁！”也意味着加冕礼的重要性下降。长时间以来，继承仪式继续表达王室统治早期建立在选举基础上的做法。即使王位经常从父亲传给儿子，选举的形式仍然以贵族确认每位继承人的方式持续存在（见上文）。加冕礼，在法国被描述为一种仪式，然后意味着对合法继承人的最终确认。尽管在十二世纪圣礼的数量已限制为七个，在“法国”仍然继续存在八个。因为新国王是由教会进行的圣油涂抹仪式“圣化”的。使用的油是混合物。最大成分是用于主教圣职的相同油。然而，还添加了几滴据传说在六世纪初用于克洛维斯受洗的油。直到1824年，王权的圣化仪式仍然与法兰克人的福音化相联系。 早期的卡佩王朝通过在有生之年与他们的继承人结盟，实现了他们王朝的延续（从而是王室统治）。当路易十一在十字军东征时去世时，没有做出这样的安排，但在国王得到贵族确认和被涂油之前，新国王的统治就已经被接受了。这首次显示了加冕礼对于合法化王室统治的相对重要性下降，以及继承原则的上升。但在十五世纪，这两种观念仍然共存。因此，例如，不仅是查理七世的加冕礼确认了他统治的合法性，间接地也是他作为查理六世之子的事实。有关他私生子出身的谣言被他的加冕礼平息了。 随着时间的推移，加冕礼对王室统治合法性的构成性重要性几乎完全消失。其重要性现在更多地在于确定王室统治的象征内容。从古代政体的开始到结束，这种统治无论如何都是个人的财产，从未完全个性化。这种统治的崇拜更多地针对“被涂油的国王”、“骑士国王”、“教会的保护者”，而不是因为世袭而高贵的个人。 在古代政体的开端阶段，“代表性”集中在尊严上，王权的一般性质。崇拜的地理分布也与这一概念相对应。在十五和十六世纪，王室统治的最重要仪式，如正义之床和进入式，仍然在偏远地区举行。然而，后来，皇家宗教主要在国王的宫殿内实践。 正义之床意味着国王亲自访问巴黎高等法院（或很少情况下，某个省级高等法院）。例如，如果一位贵族在高等法院被控告，这时通过增加大贵族并由国王本人主持，将其扩展为一家贵族法院；也可能是国王在反对之声中强制注册法律和法令。到了十六世纪，引入了另一种类型的正义之床，即所谓的就职正义之床。当1560年，在查理九世统治开始时召集鲁昂高等法院时，王室尊严的部分世俗化表现得很明显。新的统治现在正式开始不是通过加冕，而是通过宣布皇家议会。当1610年路易十三的统治开始在正义之床上宣布时，国王当时只有八岁。他坐在高等法院的一个垫子上，而以他的名义宣布他的母亲，玛丽·德·美第奇，将担任摄政王。在他已故的父亲亨利四世的葬礼上，死去的国王最后一次以肖像被抬着。但因为新国王的统治已经正式宣布，这个复制品现在只作为对已故国王的纪念。当1643年路易十三被埋葬时，没有人携带他的肖像来“参加”葬礼。未成年的国王路易十四的统治已经由高等法院建立，并以国王的名义宣布了摄政统治。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Dreaming can occur during any stage of sleep, but the most vivid and well-remembered dreams happen during the rapid eye movement (REM) phase. REM sleep is characterized by rapid movement of the eyes, low muscle tone throughout the body, and the propensity of the sleeper to dream vividly. The brain is very active during REM sleep, and studies show that this stage plays a crucial role in learning and memory. Non-REM (NREM) sleep also consists of dreams, but these are often considered less vivid or memorable compared to those experienced during REM sleep. Everybody dreams, although some people may not remember their dreams upon waking. Dreaming is a universal human experience, integral to our sleep cycles, and while the exact purposes of dreaming are still being studied, theories suggest it may be crucial for emotional regulation, cognitive function, and processing experiences."},{"instruction":"Did Randy Gardner laid down during the sleep deprivation without falling asleep","output":"Randy Gardner is famous for setting the record for the longest amount of time a human has gone without sleep, a total of 264 hours or approximately 11 days, in 1964. During his sleep deprivation experiment, which was not conducted in a scientific laboratory setting but rather observed by Stanford sleep researcher Dr. William Dement and documented by a high school science project, Gardner did remain awake without using stimulants. While specific details about whether he laid down during the experiment are not extensively documented in the original accounts, the nature of such sleep deprivation experiments typically involves participants engaging in various activities to stay awake. This can include standing, walking, playing games, or having conversations. Lying down is often avoided in these scenarios because it can increase the likelihood of accidentally falling asleep, especially as the body becomes more exhausted. It's worth noting that during the experiment, Gardner experienced significant cognitive and psychological effects from sleep deprivation, including mood swings, problems with concentration and short-term memory, paranoia, and hallucinations. Gardner's endeavor is often cited in discussions about the limits of human endurance regarding sleep loss, and it has contributed to our understanding of the importance of sleep for health and well-being. Importantly, sleep experts do not recommend trying to replicate such experiments due to the potential negative health impacts of sleep deprivation."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Trudy has a dictionary of 2^30 passwords, and the probability that a randomly selected password is in her dictionary is 1/4. Work is measured in terms of the number of hashes computed. a. Suppose that Trudy wants to recover Alice’s password. Using her dictionary, what is the expected work for Trudy to crack Alice’s password, assuming the passwords are not salted? (List the equation to do the calculation is enough.) b. Repeat part a, assuming the passwords are salted. (List the equation to do the calculation is enough.) c. What is the probability that at least one of the passwords in the password file appears in Trudy’s dictionary?(List the equation to do the calculation is enough.)","output":"To calculate the expected work or probabilities for Trudy's password cracking activities and the impact of salting, we can follow these outlines: **a. Dictionary Attack without Salting:** Given: - The probability that a randomly selected password is in her dictionary, (P = frac{1}{4}). To find: - Expected work for Trudy to crack Alice’s password. The expected work in terms of hashing operations, in this case, is simply the expected numbers of attempts before Trudy finds the correct password assuming each attempt is independent. Since the probability of a successful attempt is (P), and there's a (1/P) chance of success, the expected number of tries (work) is equal to (1/P). So, the equation for expected work without salting is: [ text{Expected work} = frac{1}{P} = frac{1}{1/4} = 4 ] **b. Dictionary Attack with Salting:** Salting passwords before they are hashed makes pre-computed dictionary attacks much less effective, if not entirely impractical, because each password hash would need to be attacked individually. Given the same assumptions as above, but each hash now has a unique salt, the expected work drastically changes. Since each password needs its own attack effort, and assuming Trudy's dictionary needs to be hashed anew for each salt (because salts make the hash unique), the size of her dictionary (D = 2^{30}) is less relevant because she cannot use a precomputed hash. Therefore, with salting, the expected work is: [ text{Expected work} = text{Size of Trudy’s dictionary} = 2^{30} ] (The specific impact of salting makes precomputed dictionaries almost useless, forcing Trudy to re-compute the hash for each password candidate with the given salt.) **c. Probability at Least One Password in the File Appears in Trudy’s Dictionary:** Here, we calculate the probability that at least one of the passwords in the password file (which contains (2^{10}) passwords) appears in Trudy’s dictionary. First, calculate the probability that a given password is not in the dictionary, which is (1 - P = 3/4). Then, find the probability that all (2^{10}) passwords are not in her dictionary and subtract it from 1 to get the probability that at least one password is in the dictionary. The equation for the probability that none of the passwords in the file matches Trudy's dictionary is: [ (1 - P)^{2^{10}} ] So, the probability that at least one matches is: [ 1 - (1 - P)^{2^{10}} = 1 - left(frac{3}{4}right)^{2^{10}} ] This formula gives us the likelihood that Trudy finds any match in her dictionary from the password file, showing the importance of password uniqueness and complexity."},{"instruction":"- When passwords are salted, each hash in the password file is unique, even if users have the same password. Therefore, Trudy cannot use precomputed hashes from her dictionary directly and must compute the hash for each password in her dictionary against each salt. Assuming there are (2^{10}) salts (one for each password in the file): [ text{Expected work} = text{Size of dictionary} times text{Number of salts} = 2^{30} times 2^{10} = 2^{40} text{ hashes} ]","output":"Absolutely, thanks for the clarification. When considering salted passwords, the detailed explanation involves considering each unique salt applied to the passwords, which effectively necessitates individual hash computations for every dictionary entry against every salt. This dramatically increases the computational effort required to attempt to crack the passwords through brute force or dictionary attacks. Given: - The size of Trudy's dictionary: (2^{30}) passwords. - The number of unique salts (corresponding to the number of passwords in the file): (2^{10}). The expected work (in terms of hash computations) when trying to find matches through a brute force attack that takes salting into account would indeed be the size of the dictionary multiplied by the number of salts: [ text{Expected work} = text{Size of dictionary} times text{Number of salts} = 2^{30} times 2^{10} = 2^{40} text{ hash computations} ] This scenario illustrates the effectiveness of salting in protecting against both dictionary and brute force attacks by significantly increasing the computational load required to crack even a single password."},{"instruction":"HI","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?"},{"instruction":"HOW CAN I BE WEALTHY","output":"Achieving wealth is a goal for many, and while there's no guaranteed pathway, there are strategies that can increase your chances of becoming financially well-off. Remember, building wealth is often a long-term endeavor that requires patience, discipline, and smart decisions. Here are some key steps to consider: 1. **Educate Yourself**: Learn about personal finance, investing, and the economic principles that affect wealth generation. Resources like books, online courses, and podcasts can be invaluable. 2. **Create a Financial Plan**: Define your financial goals, both short-term and long-term. Plan how you'll save, invest, and spend. A budget can help you manage your money effectively by tracking income and expenses. 3. **Build an Emergency Fund**: Start by setting aside a rainy day fund to cover unexpected expenses like car repairs or medical bills. Aim for three to six months' worth of living expenses. 4. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt**: High-interest debts, such as credit card debt, can hinder your ability to build wealth. Focus on paying these off as quickly as possible. 5. **Save and Invest Wisely**: Once you have a solid savings buffer and have reduced your debt, you should start saving and investing a portion of your income. Consider retirement accounts like 401(k)s and IRAs, which offer tax advantages. Diversify your investments across different asset classes like stocks, bonds, and real estate to spread risk. 6. **Increase Your Income**: Look for ways to increase your income through career advancement, side hustles, or starting your own business. Continuously improving your skills and knowledge can lead to higher-paying opportunities. 7. **Live Below Your Means**: This doesn't mean you have to live frugally at all times, but consciously spending below what you earn will allow you to save and invest more. 8. **Automate Your Savings**: Automation is a powerful tool for building wealth. Automatically transferring a portion of your income into savings or investment accounts can help ensure you remain consistent. 9. **Network and Seek Mentorship**: Building relationships with people who can offer advice or opportunities is invaluable. Seek out mentors who have achieved financial success and learn from them. 10. **Stay Disciplined and Patient**: Wealth building is a marathon, not a sprint. Stay disciplined with your savings and investment strategies, and understand that compounding takes time to significantly increase your wealth. Remember, everyone's financial situation is unique, so it's important to adapt these strategies to fit your own circumstances. Consulting with a financial advisor can also provide personalized advice tailored to your specific goals and financial situation."},{"instruction":"how to Save and Invest Wisely","output":"Saving and investing wisely is crucial for building wealth over time. Here are steps and strategies to help you get started: # 1. **Understand Your Financial Goals** - Short-term: Saving for a vacation, emergency fund, or a significant purchase within the next few years. - Long-term: Investing for retirement, buying a house, or funding a child's education. # 2. **Create a Budget** - Track your income and expenses to understand where your money goes. - Identify areas where you can cut back to increase your savings rate. # 3. **Build an Emergency Fund** - Aim to save at least three to six months’ worth of living expenses in a high-yield savings account. - This fund protects you against unexpected expenses and financial downturns. # 4. **Pay Off High-Interest Debt** - Before heavily investing, consider paying off high-interest debts (e.g., credit card debt), as the interest on these can often outpace average investment returns. # 5. **Invest in Retirement Accounts** - Take advantage of tax-advantaged retirement accounts like 401(k)s or IRAs. - If your employer offers a 401(k) match, ensure you contribute enough to get the full match; it's essentially free money. # 6. **Diversify Your Investments** - Don't put all your money in one type of investment (e.g., all in stocks or a single stock). - Consider a mix of stocks, bonds, and other assets to spread your risk. # 7. **Consider Low-Cost Index Funds and ETFs** - These funds provide a cost-effective way to invest in a broad section of the market. - They tend to have lower fees compared to actively managed funds, which can add up to significant savings over time. # 8. **Start Early and Invest Regularly** - The earlier you start investing, the more time your investments have to grow through compound interest. - Consider setting up automatic contributions to make regular investing easier. # 9. **Review and Rebalance Your Portfolio Regularly** - Periodically check your investment portfolio to ensure it remains aligned with your risk tolerance and financial goals. - Rebalance as needed to maintain your desired asset allocation. # 10. **Educate Yourself** - Continuously learn about personal finance and investing. Knowledge is a powerful tool for making informed decisions. - Consider consulting with a financial advisor for personalized advice, especially if you're unsure where to start or want to navigate complex financial situations. # Remember: Investing always involves risks, including the loss of principal, and there's no guarantee that any investment strategy will be successful. However, being informed, disciplined, and strategic about where and how you save and invest can significantly increase your chances of reaching your financial goals."},{"instruction":"how to make a investment portfolio","output":"Creating an investment portfolio involves several steps designed to align your financial goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon with your asset allocation and investment choices. Here's a structured approach to help you start building your investment portfolio: # 1. **Define Your Investment Goals** Identify what you're investing for. Goals can be short-term (e.g., saving for a car in the next few years) or long-term (e.g., retirement, buying a house, or funding a child's education). Your goals will influence your investment choices, how much risk you're willing to take, and your time horizon. # 2. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance** Understanding your risk tolerance—how much risk you can stomach financially and emotionally—is crucial. It affects how you allocate your investments among different asset classes. Typically, younger investors can afford to take on more risk because they have more time to recover from market downturns, while those closer to retirement may prefer lower-risk investments. # 3. **Determine Your Investment Horizon** Your time horizon is the expected timeframe you plan to hold your investments before needing to access your money. Longer investment horizons typically allow for a greater allocation to riskier assets like stocks, while shorter horizons favor more conservative investments like bonds and money market funds. # 4. **Choose an Asset Allocation** Based on your goals, risk tolerance, and investment horizon, decide how to divide your investment among asset classes such as stocks, bonds, and cash. This decision is one of the most critical factors in determining the overall risk and return of your portfolio. # 5. **Select Your Investments** Once you’ve set your asset allocation, choose specific investments to fill those allocations. Consider factors like cost, performance history, and how the investment fits with your goals and risk tolerance. - **Stocks and Equities**: Offer potential for growth but come with higher risk. - **Bonds**: Generally provide income and are less volatile than stocks. - **Mutual Funds and ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds)**: Allow you to buy a basket of stocks or bonds, providing instant diversification. - **Alternative Investments**: Real estate, commodities, and more can offer diversification and hedge against inflation but might be riskier or less liquid. # 6. **Implement Diversification** Diversification involves spreading your investments across various sectors, geographic regions, and asset classes to reduce risk. It’s the investment equivalent of not putting all your eggs in one basket. # 7. **Monitor and Rebalance Regularly** Review your portfolio periodically to ensure it stays aligned with your goals. Rebalance as necessary if your actual asset allocation drifts from your target due to the varying performance of your investments. Rebalancing helps maintain your desired level of risk. # 8. **Consider Costs and Tax Implications** Be mindful of the costs associated with your investments, including management fees, fund expense ratios, and transaction fees. Taxes on gains and dividends also impact your net returns. In some cases, tax-efficient investing strategies may be beneficial. # 9. **Continuous Learning and Adjustment** Stay informed about the financial markets and the global economy. Life events, financial market changes, and shifts in your financial goals may all necessitate adjustments to your portfolio. # Additional Tips - For beginners, starting with a simple mix of low-cost index funds or ETFs can be a smart way to achieve broad market exposure. - Consider using robo-advisors or consulting with a financial advisor for personalized portfolio guidance and management. Building an effective investment portfolio is an ongoing process that evolves with your financial situation, goals, and market conditions. Patience, consistency, and a focus on long-term goals are key to successful investing."},{"instruction":"ty","output":"You're welcome!

This perception is grounded in several factors: 1. **House Edge**: In casino games, the odds are designed to favor the house (the casino), meaning the probability of the casino coming out on top over the long term is significantly high. This built-in advantage ensures a consistent revenue stream. 2. **Volume of Play**: Casinos attract a large number of patrons, and the sheer volume of gambling transactions every day means that even small margins can translate into substantial profits. 3. **Diversification of Services**: Many casinos are part of larger entertainment complexes offering hotels, restaurants, shopping, and live entertainment, expanding their revenue sources beyond just gambling proceeds. Given these factors, the idea that a casino could lose money strikes many as inconsistent with the general understanding of how gambling economics work. It conjures images of extreme incompetence or mismanagement, akin to \\"not being able to sell water in a desert.\\" This incongruity between expectation and situation is what makes the idea seem humorous or far-fetched. However, in reality, there are scenarios where casinos can struggle financially or even fail, such as poor management, lack of competitive market research, failure to adapt to industry changes (like online gambling), large debts from construction projects, not diversifying the business model, or broader economic downturns affecting discretionary spending. But these cases are more the exception than the rule, thus the humor in the seemingly absurd proposition of losing money by running a casino."},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息: coupon_id:优惠券id，字符串类型，格式如:\\"2102024040378314\\" time:活动时间，字符串类型，格式如:\\"2024-4-1 ~ 2024-5-1

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

情况3：如果没有开始时间，只有截止时间，则格式为:\\"time\\":\\"即日起 ~ 2024-5-1 23:59:59\\"。 情况3例子：自票券到账之日起3天（3*24小时）内有效，票券每日承兑时间10:00:00-23:59:59，最迟承兑时间不得晚于2024年3月31日23:59:59。 关于优惠活动状态state的详细要求:

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 11:16:27

To craft a well-rounded essay about \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" it's essential to consider several components such as the synopsis, themes, character analysis, cinematography, and its cultural impact. Below is a structured breakdown to help guide your essay writing: # Introduction - Start with an engaging opening sentence to grab the reader's attention. For example, you might comment on the film's unique position in Hollywood history or its critical acclaim. - Provide a brief overview of \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" mentioning its release in 1990, directed by and starring Kevin Costner. Touch upon the film winning several Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. - State your thesis statement, which lays out what your essay will discuss or argue about the movie, such as its portrayal of Native American culture, its contribution to the Western genre, or its themes of friendship, loyalty, and nature. # Synopsis - Give a concise summary of the film's plot. Focus on Lieutenant John J. Dunbar (played by Kevin Costner), who requests a position on the western frontier, becomes a part of the Lakota tribe, and undergoes a deep transformation through his relationships with the tribe members and the natural world. # Themes - Explore the primary themes depicted in \\"Dances with Wolves.\\" Some of the prominent themes include cultural understanding and respect, the beauty and destruction of nature, and the transformation through self-discovery. - Discuss how the film challenges stereotypes about Native American tribes and promotes a message of peace and cross-cultural friendships. # Character Analysis - Delve into Lt. John J. Dunbar's character development throughout the film, from a disillusioned soldier to a respected member of the Lakota tribe and his adopted Lakota name, Dances With Wolves. - Discuss the roles and portrayals of other significant characters, such as Stands With A Fist (Mary McDonnell), Kicking Bird (Graham Greene), and Wind In His Hair (Rodney A. Grant), and how they contribute to Dunbar's transformation and the film’s overall message. # Cinematography - Highlight the cinematography by Dean Semler, which played a crucial role in the film's storytelling. Talk about how the sweeping landscapes and the portrayal of the vast, untamed West serve as a backdrop that complements the narrative's themes. - Mention specific scenes that showcase the film's visual appeal and how they enhance the storytelling, such as the buffalo hunt. # Cultural Impact - Address the impact \\"Dances with Wolves\\" had on popular culture and its significance in cinema history. Discuss how it helped revive interest in the Western genre and influenced perceptions of Native American history and culture. - Mention any controversies or criticisms the film faced regarding accuracy or representation. # Conclusion - Summarize the key points you've discussed in your essay. - Reinforce your thesis statement and how the movie's exploration of deep themes, character development, and stunning visuals contribute to its lasting significance. - End with a closing thought that reflects on the movie’s place in modern cinema or its message's relevance today.

Beyond its surface narrative, the film seeks to challenge and redefine the historical perspectives of Native American cultures and the early encounters between indigenous people and European settlers. By focusing on themes of friendship, cultural exchange, and mutual respect, it stands apart as a cinematic endeavor to bridge historical gaps and offer a nuanced view of America's past. **Personal Reaction and Historical Relevance** Upon watching \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" I was immediately struck by its sincere attempt at presenting a more balanced and historically sensitive portrayal of Native American cultures. Unlike many Westerns that preceded it, the film painstakingly constructs a narrative that places emphasis on cultural understanding and respect. The detailed depiction of the Lakota Sioux's way of life stands out as a testament to the film's commitment to historical accuracy, from their social customs and language to their spiritual beliefs and interactions with the environment. What I found historically significant was the film's endeavor to humanize the Native American experience, which has often been marginalized in historical accounts and popular media. The careful attention to language, with substantial portions of the dialogue in the Lakota language (accompanied by subtitles for English-speaking audiences), was both a bold artistic choice and a step towards authenticity. This focus invites viewers to immerse themselves in a world vastly different from the often stereotypical portrayals seen in earlier Western genres. **Historical Message or Theme** The historical message of \\"Dances with Wolves\\" resides in its exploration of the consequences of encroachment and cultural imperialism, wrapped in a theme of mutual respect and the possibility of coexistence. Historically, it serves as a reflection on the lost opportunities for understanding and collaboration between Native American tribes and early European settlers. The film critiques historical narratives that have frequently depicted Native Americans as savages or obstacles to progress, opting instead to highlight their humanity, dignity, and deep connection to the land. \\"Dances with Wolves\\" prompts viewers to reconsider the historical legacy of colonization and its impact on indigenous populations, advocating for a perspective that recognizes the complexity and richness of Native American cultures. It invites a reevaluation of history, not as a series of conquered frontiers but as a mosaic of missed connections and lost possibilities for a richer, more inclusive American narrative. **Effectiveness in Showing the Theme** \\"Dances with Wolves\\" is largely successful in conveying its theme, primarily through its empathetic portrayal of the Lakota Sioux and the personal transformation of its protagonist, Lt. John J. Dunbar. By choosing to tell the story from Dunbar's perspective - a man who gradually sheds his preconceptions and embraces a new culture - the film effectively mirrors the journey it hopes the audience will take. This narrative choice makes the historical themes more accessible, encouraging viewers to empathize with and understand cultures different from their own. However, the film is not without its critics, who argue that it still filters the Native American experience through a predominantly white lens, embodied by Dunbar's character. While this critique holds merit, it does not wholly detract from the film's overall success in challenging historical stereotypes and fostering a deeper appreciation for the complexities of early Native American-European relations. **Conclusion** \\"Dances with Wolves\\" stands as a significant cinematic endeavor that pushes the boundaries of how history is portrayed and understood in popular culture. Through its detailed characterization, commitment to authenticity, and thoughtful exploration of themes of cultural understanding and respect, the film offers a poignant message about the historical impact of colonization and the potential for mutual respect and understanding. Despite its narrative limitations, \\"Dances with Wolves\\" successfully invites viewers to engage with American history in a manner that is both reflective and enlightening, making it a valuable contribution to the reexamination of the past."},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息: coupon_id:优惠券id，字符串类型，格式如:\\"2102024040378314\\"

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

解释","output":"这段代码片段实现的功能是从一个源数据数组（假设代表一个图像的一列）中按一定规则提取特定的元素，并将它们填充到目标数据数组（假设代表一个图像的一行）中。详细解释如下： 1. **初始化和循环条件：** \`for (int i = 0; i < dstWidth; i++)\` —— 这个循环从\`0\`开始，直到\`i\`等于\`dstWidth\`（目标宽度，即目标数组的长度）。每次循环\`i\`都会增加1。循环的目的是逐个处理目标数组\`p_dst_row\`的每个元素。 2. **访问源数组元素和填充目标数组：** \`p_dst_row[i] = p_src_col[i * srcWidth];\` —— 这行代码在做的是，对于目标数组\`p_dst_row\`的第\`i\`个位置，它从源数组\`p_src_col\`中按照某种规定的规则选取元素填充。 - \`p_src_col[i * srcWidth]\`表示从源数组中选取的元素。这里使用的索引计算\`i * srcWidth\`意味着，随着目标数组下标\`i\`的递增，从源数组中选取的元素索引以\`srcWidth\`（源宽度或源数组的长度）为间隔，即每次跳过\`srcWidth - 1\`个元素来选取下一个元素。 - 等式的左侧\`p_dst_row[i]\`确保了这些选取的元素按顺序填充到目标数组中。 3. **应用场景解释：** - 如果\`p_src_col\`代表图像的一列像素值，而\`p_dst_row\`代表要构建的新图像的一行，这段代码实现的可能是基于一定规则的图像重采样或转换过程。 - 具体来说，这段代码每次从源列中跳过\`srcWidth\`个元素来选取下一个，意味着在一个较大的图像中按一定间隔提取像素值，可能是为了缩减目标图像的尺寸或者应用某种特定的采样逻辑。 **注意：** 这个代码片段的具体应用意图及其有效性依赖于\`srcWidth\`、\`dstWidth\`的具体值及\`p_src_col\`、\`p_dst_row\`的初始状态（比如它们分别代表的图像尺寸和内容）。如果不考虑周围的上下文，我们只能提供一种基于代码本身的解释而非具体应用场景的细节。"},{"instruction":"#include <cuda_runtime.h> #include

分别指向源矩阵和目标（转置后）矩阵的指针。 - \`srcWidth\`, \`srcHeight\`, \`dstWidth\`, \`dstHeight\`: 源矩阵和目标矩阵的宽度和高度。 - \`srcArea\`, \`dstArea\`: 源矩阵和目标矩阵的面积（元素总数）。 - 核心逻辑： - 计算当前线程应处理的目标矩阵中的元素位置(\`dx\`, \`dy\`)。 - 使用循环将源矩阵的相关列的元素复制到目标矩阵的行中。 2. **主函数（\`main\`）** - 初始设定相关参数，包括批次大小（\`batch_size\`）、源矩阵的宽度、高度（亦即目标矩阵的高度、宽度）。 - 为源矩阵（\`h_src\`）和目标矩阵（\`h_dst\`）在主机端分配内存，并初始化源矩阵。 - 为源矩阵（\`d_src\`）和目标矩阵（\`d_dst\`）在设备（GPU）端分配内存，并将初始化后的源矩阵数据从主机复制到设备。 - 配置并启动CUDA核函数，以执行实际的转置操作。使用\`dim3\`类型定义了\`threadsPerBlock\`和\`numBlocks\`，这两个变量控制了并行执行时每个块的线程布局和要启动的总块数。 - 将转置后的矩阵数据从设备端复制回主机端，并打印结果。 - 最后，释放在主机端和设备端分配的内存。 **注意事项** - 隐含地，在核函数中动态计算\`p_dst_row\`和\`p_src_col\`的偏移是为了正确地将一个矩阵的列元素复制到另一个矩阵的行中，实现矩阵的转置。 - 还要注意内存访问模式可能不是最优的，因为直接利用全局内存（而不是共享内存或其他优化手段）可能会导致非连续内存访问，这在CUDA编程中可能会导致性能下降。 - 没有错误检查代码，例如对\`cudaMalloc\`、\`cudaMemcpy\`和\`cudaFree\`调用的返回值进行检查，以确保操作成功。在实际应用中，准确地检查和处理这些调用的返回状态是很重要的。"},{"instruction":"float* p_dst_row = dst + dy * dstArea + dx * dstWidth; // row = dx float* p_src_col = src + dy * srcArea + dx; // col = dx for (int i = 0; i < dstWidth; i++) { p_dst_row[i] = p_src_col[i * srcWidth]; }详细解释一下其中的这一小段代码","output":"这是CUDA核函数\`transpose_device_kernel\`中的一段关键代码，用于进行矩阵转置操作。让我们逐行分析： # 声明和初始化 \`\`\`c float* p_dst_row = dst + dy * dstArea + dx * dstWidth; // row = dx float* p_src_col = src + dy * srcArea + dx; // col = dx \`\`\` - \`p_dst_row\`和\`p_src_col\`都是指针，分别指向目的矩阵（转置后的矩阵）和源矩阵（转置前的矩阵）中的特定元素。 - \`p_dst_row\`计算的是目标矩阵中某一行的起始位置。\`dst + dy * dstArea\`移动到当前处理的批次（batch）的起始位置，\`+ dx * dstWidth\`进一步移动到该批次中第\`dx\`行的起始位置。（这里的\`dx\`和\`dy\`是通过线程的全局索引计算出的，代表当前线程负责处理的元素在转置后矩阵中的行（\`dx\`）和批次（\`dy\`））。 - \`p_src_col\`计算的是源矩阵中与\`p_dst_row\`对应的某一列的起始位置。这依赖于\`dx\`，即源矩阵中的列，因为我们在进行转置操作。\`src + dy * srcArea\`计算得到当前处理批次的起始位置，\`+ dx\`进一步定位到该列的首个元素。 # 循环复制元素 \`\`\`c for (int i = 0; i < dstWidth; i++) { p_dst_row[i] = p_src_col[i * srcWidth]; } \`\`\` - 这个循环负责将源矩阵中某一列的元素复制到目标矩阵中对应的某一行。 - 循环变量\`i\`遍历目标行（即源列）的每个元素。\`dstWidth\`是目标矩阵的宽度，代表目标行应该有的元素数。 - \`p_dst_row[i]\`定位到目标行中的第\`i\`个元素位置。 - \`p_src_col[i * srcWidth]\`是找到源矩阵中对应的需要复制的元素。\`i * srcWidth\`这一操作确保了我们沿着源矩阵的列向下移动，因为我们正在将一个列向量复制到目标矩阵的一行中。\`srcWidth\`是源矩阵的宽度，乘以\`i\`表示在源矩阵的列方向上下移动。 # 整体操作 这段代码的整体操作是将源矩阵（\`src\`）的一列元素（通过\`p_src_col\`定位的列）复制到目标矩阵（\`dst\`）的一行中（通过\`p_dst_row\`定位的行）。由于这是在CUDA内核中，每个线程都会执行这个复制操作，但是对于不同的线程，\`dx\`和\`dy\`的值不同，意味着每个线程负责矩阵的不同部分。结合整个内核函数和其启动配置，这完成了矩阵的并行转置操作。"},{"instruction":"ubuntu如何安装dcgm-exporter","output":"\`dcgm-exporter\`是NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM)的一部分，它是用来监控和管理数据中心GPU的工具。\`dcgm-exporter\`具体是用来将DCGM监控的GPU指标以Prometheus兼容的形式导出，方便在Prometheus监控系统中监控GPU的性能和健康状态。 要在Ubuntu系统上安装\`dcgm-exporter\`，请按照以下步骤操作： # 前提条件 确保你的系统上已经安装了NVIDIA GPU驱动和Docker。\`dcgm-exporter\`通常在Docker容器中运行以收集和导出GPU指标。 # 安装步骤 1. **安装NVIDIA Docker支持** 首先，你需要确保NVIDIA的Docker运行时（nvidia-docker2）已经安装，它允许Docker容器访问宿主机上的NVIDIA GPU资源。 - 添加NVIDIA Docker仓库的GPG密钥和仓库： \`\`\`bash distribution=(. /etc/os-release;echo IDVERSION_ID) curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/gpgkey | sudo apt-key add - curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/nvidia-docker/distribution/nvidia-docker.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-docker.list \`\`\` - 安装nvidia-docker2并重启Docker服务： \`\`\`bash sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-docker2 sudo systemctl restart docker \`\`\` 2. **运行\`dcgm-exporter\`容器** \`dcgm-exporter\`可以通过NVIDIA GPU Cloud (NGC)上的容器镜像来运行。运行以下命令来启动\`dcgm-exporter\`容器： \`\`\`bash docker run --gpus all -d --rm --name=dcgm-exporter -p 9400:9400 nvcr.io/nvidia/dcgm-exporter:latest \`\`\` 这条命令会下载最新版本的\`dcgm-exporter\`镜像，并在后台运行一个名为\`dcgm-exporter\`的容器。它将容器的9400端口映射到宿主机的同一端口，这是dcgm-exporter默认的端口。 请确保替换\`latest\`标签为你需要的特定版本。 3. **验证\`dcgm-exporter\`是否运行** 可以通过访问\`http://<宿主机IP>:9400/metrics\`来查看导出的GPU指标，确保\`dcgm-exporter\`正在正确运行。 # 注意事项 - 在一些系统和配置上，可能需要调整Docker命令中的参数，例如安全性银策等。 - 如果你的环境已经安装了Prometheus，你可以配置Prometheus来抓取这些指标。 - 如果你使用的是Kubernetes, NVIDIA也提供了一个GPU监控的Helm chart，这会自动包括\`dcgm-exporter\`。 - 事先确保你的NVIDIA GPU驱动是兼容的，并且正确安装。 以上步骤说明了如何在Ubuntu系统中通过Docker容器安装和运行\`dcgm-exporter\`。这些步骤可能会随着软件的更新而发生变化，因此建议查阅NVIDIA的官方文档以获取最新信息。"},{"instruction":"Will not apply HSTS.

Let's break them down: 1. **HSTS Database Issue:** \`\`\`plaintext Will not apply HSTS. The HSTS database must be a regular and non-world-writable file. ERROR: could not open HSTS store at '/home/jh/.wget-hsts'. HSTS will be disabled. \`\`\` - **Explanation:** HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) is a web security policy mechanism that helps to protect websites against man-in-the-middle attacks such as protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking. The warning indicates that wget attempted to use the HSTS feature, but it was unable to open or create the HSTS database file, which it expects to be a regular file (not a symbolic link, directory, or device file) and with permissions that restrict write access to the owner only. - **Solution:** You might want to ensure that the file permissions and type for \`/home/jh/.wget-hsts\` are correct. If the file doesn't exist, try creating it manually with the correct permissions. If it exists, verify its permissions and adjust them if necessary: \`\`\`bash touch /home/jh/.wget-hsts # Creates the file if it does not exist chmod 600 /home/jh/.wget-hsts # Sets the permission to be readable and writable by the owner only \`\`\` This should resolve the HSTS database error; however, it's more of a warning than an error that would prevent \`wget\` from functioning. 2. **404 Not Found Error:** \`\`\`plaintext --2024-04-22 11:17:14-- https://github.com/NVIDIA/dcgm-exporter/releases/download/v2.x.x/dcgm-exporter_v3.3.5_linux_amd64.tar.gz ...

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

It followed from this that there was not only conflict as to who should occupy a position, but also over who had the right to decide on the legal disputes over investiture rights that constantly arose. In the course of the fourteenth century, the parlement not only asserted itself as the appeal instance for disputes over the benefices of lower clergy, but also achieved the judicial integration of the abbot-bishops. Eventually, in the period of the great schism, when from 1378 to 1415 two popes struggled for rule (even three for a while in 1409), the French clergy accustomed itself to appealing not to 'the' pope, but to the parlement de Paris. At the end of the fourteenth century, the parlement also decided on disputes on the investiture of bishoprics and archbishoprics. It was the legal practice of the final decades of the fourteenth century and the early decades of the fifteenth that gave rise to what was later called the Gallicanism of the parlement, a doctrine that defended the 'indigenous' freedoms of the church against claims of papal supremacy. The strategies of centralisation that the popes pursued in their period of Avignon residence were successfully counteracted in this way. This legal Gallicanism was extended during the schism by demands within the church for papal rule to be subordinated to councils. In point of fact, the division of the church was ended only by the council of Constance (1414-18). The debate about necessary reforms that was begun there was continued at the council of Basle from 1431 to 1449. The decisions of the assembly of French clergy that Charles VII summoned at Bourges in 1438 included many of the reform demands of the council of Basle. The guidelines eventually decreed by the king for the reform of the church in 'France', the so-called ‘pragmatic sanction' of Bourges (1438), insisted on the 'old' rights of the French church vis-à-vis the expansion of papal rule, restored in particular the competence of electoral bodies, and restricted both the pope's fiscal power and the papal 'reservation'. For benefices of the lower clergy, reservation was completely excluded. Differently from the council of Basle, however, the Bourges assembly did grant the pope certain fiscal rights. Gallicanism never developed into a fundamental attack on papal rule, but always remained a demand to restrict it. Gallicanism is customarily depicted as an element in the formative process of generalised royal rule or national statehood, for example by J.-F. Lemari- gnier.57 The argument for this is that those members of the electoral bodies who had hoped to be able to choose their superiors on the basis of monastic discipline and spiritual care, rapidly discovered that little had changed. Instead of the pope appointing his candidates, it was now the king, or clergy dependent on the king, who appointed theirs. But P.S. Lewis warns against the assumption that clerical power was thereby instrumentalised by royal rule. For the shape of royal policy was determined to a very high degree by the result of dispute within the clergy. There were changes of direction on the part of the king, for example the temporary rejection of Gallicanism by Louis XI. But these were unable to withstand the prevailing tendencies within the personnel of clerical rule. Moreover, the specific policy of the clergy in the fifteenth century was decided not on the basis of principle, but of advantage.58 Those hoping for promotion by the king were Gallicans, and those hoping for promotion by the pope were papists. The individuals involved frequently changed sides, often in a short space of time. Harry A. Miskimin59 finally made clear how inappropriate it is to see the Gallicanism of the fifteenth century as an unqualified 'religious policy'. Given the general - and still sharpening - scarcity of precious metal, a policy directed against rulership claims that annually transferred abroad up to half the output of the royal mint became a question of survival. In both the parlement and the cahiers de doléances that were compiled before the convening of the états généraux in 1484, church policy, as Miskimin show, was debated in terms of the shortage of money.60 This perspective was all the more decisive in that it had emerged in the course of the fifteenth century that while manipulation of the currency regularly led to disturbances, as it prejudiced either creditors or debtors, the goal it aimed at could not be achieved, as prices changed to correspond with the real value of money rather than its newly established nominal value.61 A final point to be stressed here is that even the victories that the French crown fought for and achieved in the name of Gallicanism do not immediately confirm the interpretation predominant in the literature of the special power of the French kings vis-à-vis the church. For in other cases princes achieved similar results by less conflictual policies. It was the French clergy who barred this route for the French kings.62 In the same way as the persecution of heretics, the debates at the reforming councils attest that not just among 'simple' churchgoers but also among the possessors of benefices there were Christians concerned for an order on earth that was pleasing to God. Even in the case of kings, their self-proclaimed task of protecting the church - and re-ordering it, in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries - cannot be interpreted simply in terms of power politics. For the development of rulership structures in 'France' of this time, however, compe-tition over disposal of benefices was a key structural characteristic. The 'French' form of generalisation of monarchical power François I died in 1547. In the week that passed before his funeral, a period extended by special circumstances, his corpse lay in its coffin while a dummy of his body - with a mask for the face, taken from the living model - lay on display at court. During this week 'the king' continued to 'receive' his advisers and the nobility. They were summoned to table, where meals were served, and even glasses lifted at the precise times when the king liked to drink. The king was even present in effigie at his own burial. This practice, which lasted in both England and France until the seven-teenth century, expressed the complex idea according to which the royal rule of a mortal person was both personal to him and at the same time immortal. Contemporaries of François I described this permanent character of royal rule as the royal dignitas, for which today we use the concept of institution. In the late Middle Ages the dead king of 'France' 'lived' until the moment of his burial. Only at this moment - and not already at the time of his corporeal death - was the cry 'Le roi est mort!' given, followed immediately by 'Vive le roi!' This 'Vive le roi!' signified also a decline in the importance of coronation. For a long time, the rites of succession continued to express the earlier foun-dation of royal rule in election. Even when the throne regularly passed from father to son, the form of election persisted in the confirmation of each succes-sor by the nobility (cf. above). Coronation, which in France was described as a rite [sacre], then meant the definitive confirmation of the legitimate successor. Although the number of sacraments had been limited to seven in the twelfth century, in 'France' there continued to be eight. For the new king was 'sanc-tified' by the sacrament of anointing conducted by the church. The oil that endowed him with this character was a mixture. The largest component was the same oil used for the consecration of bishops. To this however was added a few drops of the oil that according to legend had been used for the baptism of Clovis in the early sixth century. Until 1824, the rite of consecrating royal rule remained linked with the evangelising of the Franks. The early Capetians had effected the continuation of their dynasty (and thereby the royal rule) by making an association with their successors in their own lifetime. When Louis XI died on Crusade no such arrangement had been made, but the rule of the new king was already accepted before he was con-firmed by the nobility and anointed. This showed for the first time the relative loss of importance of coronation for the legitimising of royal rule, and the rise of the principle of succession. But the two conceptions still went together in the fifteenth century. Thus for example it was not just the coronation of Charles VII that confirmed the legitimacy of his rule, but indirectly also the fact that he was a son of Charles VI. Rumours about his extramarital origin were allayed by his coronation. In the course of time, the constitutive importance of coronation for the legit- imisation of royal rule disappeared almost entirely. Its significance now lay rather in determining the symbolic content of royal rule. From the beginning to the end of the ancien régime, this rule, no matter how much it was the property of a person, was never completely personified. The cult of this rule bore rather on the king 'as anointed', 'as knight', 'as protector of the church', rather than as an individual elevated by heredity. In the opening phase of the ancien régime, 'representation' focused on digni- tas, the general character of rule. The geography of the cult also corresponded to this conception. In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, the most important ceremonies of royal rule, the lits de justice and entrées, were still held in outlying places. Later on, however, the religion royale would be practised above all within the king's palace. A lit de justice meant that the king visited in person the parlement de Paris (or rarely, one of the provincial parlements). This could be, for example, if a noble was accused before the parlement, and this was then expanded into a court of peers by addition of the great nobles and presided over by the king himself; it could also be if the king compelled the registration of laws and decrees in the face of remonstration. In the sixteenth century, a further kind of lit de justice was introduced, the so-called lit de justice inaugural. When the Rouen parlement was summoned in 1560, at the start of the reign of Charles IX, the partial secu-larisation of the royal dignity was manifest. The new reign was now formally opened not by coronation, but by the proclamation of a parlement of the crown. When the start of Louis XIII'S reign was proclaimed at a lit de justice in 1610, the king was then eight years old. He sat on a cushion in the parlement, while it was proclaimed in his name that his mother, Marie de Médicis, would act as regent. At the funeral of his late father, Henri IV, the dead king was carried in effigie for the last time. But because the reign of the new king had already been officially proclaimed, this reproduction now served only as a memorial of the late king. When Louis XIII was himself buried in 1643, his body was carried to the grave without a reproduction of his person being 'present'. The reign of the minoritarian king Louis XIV had again been established already by the parlement, and the regency proclaimed in the name of the king.”翻译为中文","output":"同时，巴黎高等法院发展了其限制神职管辖权的策略，正如我们上面讨论的那样。由此可见，争执不仅在于谁应占据某一职位，还在于谁有权决定不断出现的有关圣职授予权纠纷。在十四世纪的过程中，高等法院不仅确立了自己作为低级神职人员福利争议的上诉实例，还实现了对修道院主教的司法整合。最终，在大分裂期间，当1378年至1415年 两名教皇（1409年时甚至有三名）为统治争斗时，法国神职界习惯于不向“教皇”上诉，而是向巴黎高等法院上诉。到了十四世纪末，高等法院还决定了主教和大主教职位的圣职授予纠纷。正是十四世纪末和十五世纪初几十年的法律实践，催生了后来所谓的国民教会主义（Gallicanism），这是一种捍卫教会“本土”自由、反对教皇至高无上权利主张的理论。教皇在亚维农居住期间追求的中央集权策略，就这样成功地受到了抑制。在分裂期间，教会内部要求将教皇统治服从于教会大公会议的声音，使得这种法律上的国民教会主义得到了扩展。事实上，教会的分裂最终只有通过康斯坦茨大公会议（1414-1418年）才得以结束。在那里开始的关于必要改革的辩论，继续在1431年到1449年的巴塞尔大公会议上进行。 查理七世于1438年召集的法国神职人员大会所作出的决定，包括了巴塞尔大公会议的许多改革要求。国王最终制定的关于“法国”教会改革的准则，所谓的布尔日实用制裁（1438年），坚持了法国教会对抗教皇统治扩张的“旧”权利，特别是恢复了选举机构的权能，并限制了教皇的财政权力和教皇的“保留权”。对于低级神职人员的福利，完全排除了保留权。然而，与巴塞尔大公会议不同的是，布尔日大会确实为教皇授予了某些财政权力。国民教会主义从未发展成对教皇统治的根本性攻击，而始终是限制它的一种要求。 通常将国民教会主义描绘为泛化皇权或民族国家形成过程中的一个元素，例如J.-F. Lemarignier所示。其论点是，那些原本希望能基于修道院纪律和精神关怀选择其上级的选举机构成员，很快发现几乎没什么变化。现在不再是教皇任命他的候选人，而是国王或依赖国王的神职人员任命他们的人。但P.S. Lewis警告不要认为这样就使得神职权力被皇权所利用。因为皇家政策的形成在很大程度上是由神职内部争议的结果决定的。例如，路易十一临时拒绝国民教会主义，但这些都无法抵挡神职统治人员中的主导趋势。而且，十五世纪神职人员的具体政策不是基于原则，而是基于优势而定的。那些希望通过国王得到晋升的人是国民教会主义者，那些希望通过教皇得到晋升的人是教皇主义者。涉及的个体经常变换立场，往往在短时间内。Harry A. Miskim终于明确了，认为十五世纪的国民教会主义是一项毫无疑问的“宗教政策”是多么不适当。鉴于贵金属的普遍 - 并且仍在加剧的 - 短缺，一项针对每年将皇家铸币厂产量高达一半的转移给国外的统治权利索赔的政策成为了生存问题。正如Miskimin展示的那样，无论是在高等法院还是在1484年召开三级会议之前编纂的“抱怨册”中，教会政策都是从货币短缺的角度进行讨论的。这个视角是决定性的，因为在十五世纪的过程中，虽然货币的操纵经常导致骚乱，因为它损害了债权人或债务人，但其目标无法实现，因为价格变化以符合货币的实际价值而不是其新设立的名义价值。最后需要强调的一点是，法国王冠以国民教会主义的名义争取并取得的胜利，并不立即证实了文献中占主导地位的解释，即法国国王相对于教会拥有特殊权力。因为在其他情况下，王公们通过较少冲突的政策获得了类似的结果。是法国教会为法国国王封锁了这条路。与对异教徒的迫害一样，改革会议的辩论证明，不只是在“简单”的教徒中，即使是在福利所有者中，也有基督徒关心一个能取悦上帝的地上秩序。即使在国王的案例中，他们自称保护教会的任务 - 并在十四和十五世纪对其进行重新整顿 - 也不能仅仅以权力政治解释。对于这一时期“法国”的统治结构的发展而言，竞争福利的处理权是一个关键结构特征。 “法国”泛化君主权力的形式 弗朗索瓦一世于1547年去世。在他的葬礼之前经过的那一周内，由于特殊情况，这一期间被延长，他的遗体躺在棺材里，而一个以他的活生生的面孔为模型制作的面具的假人，则在宫廷中展示。在这一周内，“国王”继续“接见”他的顾问和贵族。他们被召唤到餐桌旁，按照国王喜欢喝酒的准确时间供应餐点，甚至举杯致敬。国王甚至以雕像的形式出席了自己的葬礼。 这一做法一直持续到十七世纪的英格兰和法国，表达了一个复杂的观念：即一位凡人的王权既是个人的，同时又是不朽的。 弗朗索瓦一世的同时代人将这种王权的永恒特性描述为王家尊严，而今天我们使用的是机构的概念。在中世纪晚期，“法国”的已故国王在其葬礼的那一刻“活着”。只有在这一刻 - 而不是在他的肉体死亡时 - 人们才会喊出“国王已死！”紧接着是“国王万岁！”这个“国王万岁！”也意味着加冕典礼的重要性下降。长时间以来，继承仪式继续表达王权建立在选举上的早期基础。即使宝座经常由父亲传给儿子，选举的形式仍然以贵族确认每位继任者的方式持续存在（参见上文）。在法国，加冕，被描述为一种礼节，那意味着合法继承人的最终确认。尽管在十二世纪，圣礼的数量被限定为七个，但在“法国”，仍然有八个。因为新国王通过教会进行的涂油圣礼“圣化”，这赋予了他这个特性。使用的油是一种混合物。最大的成分是用于祝圣主教的相同油。然而，其中加入了几滴按照传说在六世纪初用于克洛维斯洗礼的油。直到1824年，君权的圣化仪式仍与法兰克人的福音化联系在一起。 早期的卡佩王朝通过在自己有生之年与继任者结盟，使他们的王朝（从而是王权）得以延续。当路易十一在十字军东征时去世，没有做出这样的安排，但新国王的统治已经在他被贵族确认并受圣礼之前被接受。这首次显示了加冕对于合法化王权重要性的相对下降，以及继承原则的崛起。但在十五世纪，这两种观念仍然共存。因此，例如，不仅是查理七世的加冕证实了他统治的合法性，但间接地也是因为他是查理六世的儿子。关于他私生子身份的谣言被他的加冕所驳斥。 随着时间的推移，加冕对于合法化王权的构成性重要性几乎完全消失。其重要性现在更多地在于确定王权的象征内容。从古代制度的开始到结束，这种统治，无论多么属于一个人，从未完全个人化。这种统治的崇拜更侧重于“受涂油的国王”、“骑士国王”、“教会的保护者国王”，而不是因遗传而崇高的个体。 在古代制度的开启阶段，“代表性”集中在尊严上，规则的一般性质。这种信仰的地理分布也与这一概念相符。在十五和十六世纪，王权最重要的仪式，即公正之床和入城仪式，仍在偏远地方举行。然而，后来，皇家宗教主要是在国王的宫殿内实践的。 公正之床意味着国王亲自访问巴黎高等法院（或者很少，某个省级高等法院）。例如，如果一个贵族在高等法院面前被控告，这就扩大为在国王亲自主持下由众多贵族组成的同僚法庭；也可以是国王在面对反抗时强迫法令和法令的注册。在十六世纪，引入了另一种类型的公正之床，所谓的初始公正之床。当1560年鲁昂高等法院召开时，在查理九世统治开始时，王权的部分世俗化表现得淋漓尽致。新的统治现在不再由加冕正式开启，而是通过宣布皇家法院的公告。当路易十三的统治在1610年的公正之床上宣布时，国王当时只有八岁。他坐在高等法院的一个垫子上，而宣布他的母亲，玛丽·德·美第奇，将担任摄政王。在他已故的父亲，亨利四世的葬礼上，已故国王最后一次以雕像形式出现。但因为新国王的统治已经被正式宣布，这个复制品现在仅作为已故国王的纪念。当路易十三于1643年被埋葬时，没有用他的人偶进行“陪葬”。新国王路易十四的统治已经由高等法院建立，摄政已经以国王的名义宣布。"},{"instruction":"请将“The entrée was the arrival of the king (or another great lord) into a town. When these occasions lost the provisioning character that they had had at the time when the court was migrant, they developed into ceremonies in which the authorities of the bonnes villes gave expression to their relationship to the crown. Bernard Guenée and Françoise Lehoux describe the entrées of the late Middle Ages as a dialogue between the king and his subjects.63 The entrées give good evidence of a change in the conception of rule. Until the end of the fifteenth century the backdrop was dominated by biblical themes, later by quotations from antique mythology. In the power theatre of the entrées, the town authorities staged both their subjection to the king, their expectations of his rule and their interpretation of urban order. In this fashion, the com-paratively simple medieval festivals, in which all strata of the town population participated, developed by the sixteenth century into grandiose events at which the lower orders could only gape. It was not uncommon for special taxes to be raised to finance these spectacles.64 By a process of steady change (sometimes clearer, sometimes less so), the ceremonies of the religion royale were adapted to new conditions and con-ceptions of rule. If we make use of the helpful distinction between custom and tradition that Eric Hobsbawm has proposed,65 in the period of royal rule under discussion here there were not yet those formalised and ritualised patterns of behaviour summed up in the concept of tradition, but rather mere customs of rule. These marked the obverse of the exercise of rule. The material conditions of royal rule, on the other hand, were largely negotiated in wrangles over the price of offices, in tough negotiations with urban emissaries in quest of freedom from taxation and cancellation of arrears, or in the petitions of nobles for promised pensions to be paid. To bring all relevant transactions onto a common denominator, this amounted to the transformation of loyalty into a tradeable good. Even members of the courtly orders were not excluded from this. Their particular obligations of loyalty were well rewarded. The generalisation of personal rule, which was the constitutional charac-teristic of societies of the ancien-régime structural type, arose in 'France' in the form of a variety of very different connections - military, fiscal and legal - between the king on the one hand, and princely, noble or urban territorial rule on the other. The 'unity' of the kingdom existed in the material favouring of local rule, in the construction of a royal administration along with the com-munication routes this required,66 as well as in the cult of royal rule. The generality of royal rule was sometimes expressed in the convening of the états généraux. But 'France' was not a Ständestaat, in the German term that Guenée uses here.67 The royal rule was not limited by general 'representa- tive' bodies, but by the structure of its own executive apparatus. For a long while, historians took this state of affairs as evidence of the great strength of the French kings, and the rare convening of the états généraux as a failure of efforts (deemed structurally necessary) by the nobility and urban bourgeoisie. P.S. Lewis was the first to refute this point of view fundamentally, by showing how, quite the contrary, the états généraux in late medieval ‘France' were convened almost always at the initiative of the crown. Under Charles VII, the crown made many unsuccessful efforts to summon the états généraux, and on the occasion of the (only) assembly of the états généraux in the reign of Louis XI, the deputies asked the king not to summon them again.68 The provinces of Languedoc let the king know that they were not accustomed to meet together with those of Languedoil, as they each had their own assemblies. Even some of the regional estate assemblies lost their practical importance by the disinterest of those they were supposed to send. In exceptional cases, conditions for the royal exercise of rule were formulated in doléances, compiled into cahiers des doléances before the estates assembled. These complaints were dealt with as a general rule, however, in a number of individual negotiations conducted with nobles, towns and corporations. Given the diverse nature of the exercise of rule, some individuals could hope - and corporations always did - that they would succeed in gaining favourable treatment or alleviation of their burdens. The generalisation of royal rule consisted in the generalisation of competition for particular advantages. This structure arose from the (above described) manner in which the royal rule had been expanded. Its reproduction was favoured by the size of the country, the differences in language, and the variation in cultural and material life. If the situation in 'France' did not develop to a generalisation of estate demands on the crown for rule, this did not give the kings particularly great strength. They certainly dominated the law more than the kings of England did. But their arbitrary practice presupposed the satisfaction of the material interests oriented towards the crown. This basic structure of royal rule in the ancien régime of 'France' stood persistently in the way of the realisation of that 'reformation' of the apparatus of royal rule that was time and again demanded and attempted. a.3. The wars of religion As a result of the concordat that was made in 1516 following the conquest of Milan by François I, most of the lucrative church benefices in 'France' came into the direct disposal of the crown (or its indirect disposal in the case of elective procedures). In practice, the king saw himself compelled to meet the wishes of influential nobles on questions of investiture.69 In the first half of the sixteenth century, the church became a component of the patronage system. Piety and scholarship were now the exception, not just among the secular clergy, but also among those who belonged to the religious orders. Criticism was natural under these conditions, expressed by rich and poor alike, by nobles and bourgeois, and by the clergy themselves. Demands for a reforma-tion of the church had no specific group of champions in 'France'. What was characteristic of the French pre-Reformation was rather an attitude of indi-vidual piety, strongly influenced by traditions of mysticism. The reforming teaching of Martin Luther found only few supporters in 'France'. The Sorbonne found it necessary, none the less, to declare it a heresy, and the chambre ardente, a special chamber of the parlement, condemned Christians guilty of Protestantism to be burned at the stake. Some of these verdicts were quashed by the crown, which was concerned to secure the sup-port of German Protestant princes for its war with Spain. Only when Calvinist preachers from Geneva arrived in 'France', many of these being French subjects who secretly returned after having fled the country, in order to preach the reformed religion, did a real movement develop. In many districts, there were so many Calvinists by the middle of the sixteenth century that they now practised their religion openly. In several cities Calvinist assemblies were held in public squares, many landed nobles paid for preachers or deacons, and placed churches at their disposal. Estimates of their number vary. I follow here the very cautious assumptions of Mark Greengrass, according to whom by 1560 there were at least two million Protestants and 1,400 communities with their own priest or deacon.70 Disputes over the right Christian belief in the sixteenth century were above all disputes over the possession of rule, and the manner in which this should be exercised. They took place in 'France' under historical conditions that led to a situation in which, still more than in other realms, the question of right belief was increasingly degraded into a mere means of struggle for power and possessions. For nearly four decades 'France' was beset by internal warfare. From 1562 to 1597 Catholics battled against the crown, or - from 1589 - against a prince whose claim to the throne they would not accept. There were men on both sides who struggled for their genuine religious convictions. The specific dynamic of the wars of 'religion', however, did not develop from questions of faith, but as an effect of crises of government. In 1559, the war between the French and Spanish monarchies came to an end. From the last years of the fifteenth century the French kings had waged almost continuous war, which for most of their subjects had brought only burdens: tax increases, billeting of soldiers, and plunder. Many found service in the royal army, but few shared in its booty. They received offices, land, pensions or gifts, and sometimes a (higher) noble rank into the bargain. But very few nobles could close by participation in war the gap that had emerged between the costs of their lifestyle and their income; more usually, increased costs and the devaluation of money opened the gap still further. Moreover, the protracted wars of the French kings against Emperor Charles V ended with a peace that neither side could see as the end to a glorious struggle. Many nobles had their hopes dashed, and the bankruptcy of the royal rule also meant a loss of income for the possessors of offices and pensions. As for the less privileged strata of the population, or those not privileged at all, ever higher taxes were demanded from them, and in addition to this they suffered the private exploitation practices of those who felt the basis of their material reproduction threatened or sought to expand it. It was in this situation of general fiscal, political and religious crisis that Henri II died. His successor François II (1559-60) was not of age, and was succeeded in turn by his younger brother Charles IX. When the new king died in 1574, his successor Henri III was himself only thirteen years old. During the minority of her sons, the government of the kingdom lay with their mother, Catherine de Médicis, on whom the regency was conferred (along with Navarre). Under the ancien régime, regency always brought a more or less serious crisis of government. In such a period nobles were able to oppose ministers, maintaining that they were upholding the interest of the king; the parlement could take a stand against the government without this necessarily being treated as rebellion against the king, and all those who hoped for offices and pensions, for themselves or their clients, could set out to establish entire new structures of influence at court. The struggles of this time over religious belief were combined with com-petition for power and money. This happened all the more readily, in that criticism of the existing practice of rule was increasingly expressed outside the narrow circle of clientele struggles at court, in the form of conversion to the reformed religion. After the death of Henri II, mass conversions became common not only among the bourgeois of the towns, but also in places among the lower and middle ranks of nobles. This general crisis situation became a field of power struggle for noble factions. From 1562 these were waged with arms. When the first noble grouping, under the leadership of the prince de Condé, took up the cause of the Huguenots as its own, the egalitarian parish structures of French Protestantism were rapidly lost.”翻译为中文","output":"入城仪式是指国王（或其他大贵族）进入城镇。当这些场合失去了他们在流动皇室时代所具有的补给特征时，他们发展成为一种仪式，好城市的权威机构借此表达了他们与王权的关系。Bernard Guenée 和 Françoise Lehoux 描述了中世纪晚期的入城仪式，作为国王与臣民之间对话的一种形式。入城仪式很好地证明了对统治概念的改变。直到十五世纪末，背景主题还是以圣经为主，后来转向引用古代神话。在入城的权力剧场中，城镇权威机构上演了他们对国王的臣服，他们对其统治的期待，以及他们对城市秩序的解释。通过这种方式，到了十六世纪，相对简单的中世纪节日演变成了宏大的活动，这些活动仅允许下层阶级瞠目以对。为了筹措这些壮观场面的资金，征收特别税并不少见。 通过一个稳定变化的过程（有时明显，有时不那么明显），皇家宗教的仪式被适应到新的条件和对统治的概念。如果我们利用 Eric Hobsbawm 提出的习俗与传统之间有用的区别，在此处讨论的皇权时期，尚未有那些在传统概念中总结的形式化和仪式化的行为模式，而只是统治的单纯习俗。这些标记了统治行使的反面。另一方面，皇家统治的物质条件主要通过对官职价格的争吵，在寻求免税和取消拖欠税款的城市代表团进行的艰苦谈判中，或在贵族对支付承诺养老金的请愿中进行谈判。将所有相关交易归纳为一个共同分母，这相当于将忠诚转化为一种可交易的商品。连宫廷秩序的成员也不例外。他们特定的忠诚义务得到了丰厚的回报。 个人统治的泛化，这是旧制度结构类型社会的宪法特征，在“法国”以国王与王公、贵族或城市领地统治之间的各种非常不同的联系（军事、财政和法律）的形式出现。“王国”的“统一”存在于对地方统治的物质上的支持中，在建设皇家行政管理机构以及所需的通信路线中，以及在对王权的崇拜中。 王权的概括有时在召集三级会议时表达。但“法国”并不是一个在 Guenée 使用的这个德语术语中的 Ständestaat（义务国家）。皇家统治并没有受到一般“代表”机构的限制，而是受到其自身行政机构结构的限制。长时间以来，历史学家将这种情况视为法国国王巨大力量的证据，并将三级会议的罕见召集视为贵族和城市资产阶级（被认为在结构上必要）努力的失败。P.S. Lewis 首次从根本上驳斥了这种观点，他展示了恰恰相反，在中世纪晚期的“法国”，三级会议几乎总是在皇冠的倡议下召集。查尔斯七世在位期间，皇冠做出了许多召集三级会议的不成功努力，在路易十一统治期间（唯一）的三级会议上，代表们请求国王不要再召集他们。朗格多克省让国王知道他们不习惯与朗格多伊省的人一起开会，因为他们每个人都有自己的集会。甚至一些地区性的贵族大会也因为被派遣者的不感兴趣而失去了实际的重要性。在特殊情况下，在召开贵族大会之前，编纂成“抱怨册”的抱怨为王权行使的条件制定了规定。然而，这些抱怨通常通过与贵族、城镇和公司进行的一系列个别谈判得到处理。鉴于统治行使的多样性，一些个人可以希望 —— 并且公司总是这样 —— 他们将成功获得有利待遇或减轻负担。王权的概括在于特殊优势竞争的概括。这种结构源于王权扩张的（如上所述）方式。其复制得到了这个国家的规模、语言的差异以及文化和物质生活的变化的支持。 如果“法国”的情况没有发展为对王冠的泛化贵族要求，这并没有给国王特别大的力量。他们当然比英格兰的国王更控制法律。但他们的武断做法预设了对朝向王冠的物质利益的满足。这种在旧制度下“法国”的皇家统治的基本结构，始终妨碍了那种一再要求和试图实现的皇家统治机构的“改革”的实现。 宗教战争 由于弗朗索瓦一世在 1516 年占领米兰之后达成的协和谅解，大部分有利可图的教会福利归皇冠直接（或在选举程序的情况下间接）处置。实际上，国王发现自己被迫在圣职授予问题上满足有影响力的贵族的愿望。在十六世纪上半叶，教会成为赞助体系的组成部分。虔诚和学问现在是异常，不仅在世俗神职人员中如此，也在那些属于宗教团体的人中如此。在这些条件下，由富人和穷人、贵族和市民以及神职人员本身表达的批评是自然的。教会改革的要求在“法国”没有特定的倡导者群体。法国宗教改革前的特点更多是个人虔诚的态度，受到神秘主义传统的强烈影响。 马丁·路德的改革教义在“法国”只找到了极少数的支持者。然而，索邦大学仍然觉得有必要宣布它为异端，而烈火审判室，一个高等法院的特别法庭，判定犯有新教罪行的基督徒被烧死。皇冠撤销了一些这样的判决，因为它关心的是为了与西班牙的战争获得德国新教诸侯的支持。只有当来自日内瓦的加尔文派传教士抵达“法国”时，许多这样的传教士是秘密返回国内的法国臣民，在那里传播改革宗宗教，才真正形成了一个运动。到了十六世纪中叶，在许多地区有如此多的加尔文主义者，以至于他们现在公开实践他们的宗教。在几个城市，加尔文主义者在公共广场举行集会，许多有土地的贵族为传教士或执事付费，并提供教堂供他们使用。对他们的人数估计不一。我在这里遵循 Mark Greengrass 非常谨慎的假设，据他估计，到 1560 年有至少两百万新教徒和 1,400 个拥有自己牧师或执事的社区。 十六世纪关于正确基督教信仰的争议，首先是关于统治权的争夺，以及这应该如何行使。这在“法国”发生在历史条件下，导致了一种情况，在这种情况下，与其他王国相比，正确信仰的问题越来越多地降级为权力和财产斗争的手段。 将近四十年，“法国”饱受内战之苦。从 1562 年到 1597 年，天主教徒与皇冠作战，或者 - 从 1589 年开始 - 与他们不接受王位继承权的王子作战。双方都有人为他们真正的宗教信念而斗争。然而，“宗教”战争的特定动力不是来自信仰问题，而是作为政府危机的效果。 1559 年，法国和西班牙君主之间的战争结束了。从十五世纪最后几年开始，法国国王几乎持续不断地发动战争，对他们的大多数臣民来说，这场战争只带来了负担：增税、士兵的驻扎和掠夺。许多人在皇家军队中服役，但很少有人分享其战利品。他们获得了官职、土地、养老金或赠品，有时还有（更高的）贵族等级。但是，很少有贵族能够通过参与战争来弥补他们的生活成本与收入之间出现的差距；更常见的是，成本增加和货币贬值使这个差距进一步扩大。此外，法国国王与查理五世皇帝的长期战争以一场双方都无法视为光荣斗争的和平而告终。许多贵族对此感到失望，国王统治的破产也意味着官职和养老金持有者的收入损失。对于那些特权较少或根本没有特权的人来说，他们被要求缴纳越来越高的税款，除此之外，他们还遭受那些感到他们的物质再生产基础受到威胁或寻求扩大它的人的私人剥削行为。 亨利二世去世后，出现了普遍的财政、政治和宗教危机。他的继任者弗朗索瓦二世（1559-60）未成年，并由他的弟弟查尔九世继承。当新国王于 1574 年去世时，他的继任者亨利三世当时只有十三岁。在她儿子的未成年期间，王国的治理由他们的母亲凯瑟琳·德·美第奇掌握，摄政权被授予她（连同纳瓦拉）。 在旧制度下，摄政总是带来或多或少的政府危机。在这样的时期，贵族们能够反对大臣，声称他们是在维护国王的利益；高等法院可以对政府采取立场，而这不必然被视为对国王的反叛，而所有那些希望获得官职和养老金的人，为自己或他们的客户，可以着手在宫廷建立全新的影响力结构。 这段时间的宗教信仰斗争与权力和金钱竞争相结合。这在批评现有统治实践的声音越来越多地在宫廷客户群争斗的狭窄圈子之外以改信改革宗宗教的形式表达之时，更加容易发生。亨利二世去世后，大规模改宗在城市市民中变得司空见惯，也在贵族的低中等阶层中出现。这种普遍的危机情况成为贵族派系权力斗争的领域。从1562年开始，这些斗争武装化。当第一个由孔代亲王领导的贵族集团将胡格诺派事业作为自己的事业时，法国新教的平等教区结构迅速丧失。"},{"instruction":"请将“The groups of nobles and religious factions made their own foreign policy. The Catholic side that dominated the crown's policy in this period received support from the Spanish crown and the pope, the Protestant side from the English crown. Power struggles between groups of nobles continued bloodily even between actual military campaigns. Both sides murdered in the name of God. Since the Catholic faction led by the duc de Guise dominated the royal army, it could conduct itself more aggressively. (It was this side that provoked the first in a total of eight religious wars.) The crown's attempts at mediation were ulti-mately unsuccessful, since the struggles within the country for a hold on the generalised power were integrated into international conflicts by the uprising of the Netherlands against Spanish rule. The conflicts culminated in the grisly massacre that Catholics conducted on St Bartholemew's Day of 1572 against the numerous Huguenots who had travelled to Paris to celebrate the marriage of Henri of Navarre; the murder of admiral de Coligny was designed not only to revenge that of the duc de Guise, but also to eliminate the most important general of the Huguenots, and their link man with the Netherlands. The death of many thousand other Huguenots (real or presumed) was designed to pre-vent their revenge and at the same time stamp out their heresy once and for all. Noble interest and religious fanaticism made a grisly combination. After the Paris massacre, the relationship of the Huguenots to the crown changed. Up till then French Protestants had not seen themselves as opposed to the crown; on the contrary, they had frequently asked for its protection, and offered to free it from the grip of 'foreigners'. This referred both to the Guise, who ruled Lorraine, and to the Italian bankers who had bought into the Lyon syndicate and profited from the crown's financial distress. This policy came to an end in 1572. Huguenot leaders now formed the view that resistance to royal arbitrary power was legitimate, after the crown had shown complicity in the murders. They demanded a separation of powers, to end tyrannical rule and prevent this in the future: more specifically, greater influence on the representative bodies dominated by the nobility. The crown still sought to make peace after 1572, by granting privileges to both religious groups. The Catholic nobles now formed a league against Henri Ill's peace policy. To bring them under control, the king declared himself its leader. This step, however, in no way altered the situation of royal powerless-ness against the factions. The peace effort failed, and armed conflict resumed. On 10 June 1584, the heir to the throne, François of Anjou, died suddenly. There was no further direct heir. The succession was claimed by both Henri of Navarre and the Bourbon prince Charles. Henri was a Huguenot, Charles a cardinal. The Catholic League championed Charles as their candidate. The succession conflict changed the basis of the Catholic faction. From the end of 1584, Paris citizens met in secret to consider how to defend the true faith in the face of the threat of a Protestant succession. As far as is known, members of this secret association concluded early on that it was legitimate to remove Henri III and appoint a successor who would champion the cause of faith more vigorously. The following years saw an increase in the number of those who took the oath to the secret Paris league. Officials, clerics and wealthy bourgeois were joined by printers, employees of the royal mint, members of the parlement and other courts, as well as ostlers and members of the royal courier service. The League developed a systematic propaganda in support of the true Catholic faith, and against the possible succession of a heretic (Henri of Navarre had been excommunicated by the pope). This radicalisation was stoked up by royal fiscal policy towards the city and infringement of the possession rights of officials, as well as by the extravagance of the court, the preaching of fanatical clergy, and the execution of Mary Stuart at the behest of the Protestant queen of England. The leading body of the Paris League, the Seize, called after the sixteen dis-tricts of the city, developed into an informal municipal government. Emissar-ies were dispatched to link true Catholics in other cities with Paris in a ‘holy union'. As far as sources reveal - Henri IV was to order the destruction of documents from the period of civil war - the situation exploded in July 1588 at the news that the king had ordered troops into the city for his protection. The League took the Bastille, occupied the parlement and the houses of powerful 'officials' who were loyal to the king. Barricades were erected in the streets around the Louvre. The king was thus made a prisoner of the League. Accord-ing to F.J. Baumgartner, the Paris League acted at first independently of the nobility. It was supported by the lower orders in the city, and by leagues in 300 other towns in the kingdom. From 1588 to 1594 the League ruled Paris. Its members spread the notion that the people had the right to depose a tyrannical king and choose a new one. They demanded the regular convening of the états généraux, control of royal finances and of the sale of offices. Henri III fled Paris and laid siege to his capital; in 1589, he was murdered. Henri IV then had to fight against the League for eight years, its candidate being declared king by the parlement as Charles X. The Spanish crown and the papacy supported the League's struggle. Peace was eventually not so much won as purchased bit by bit. Henri's representatives made peace with several nobles individually, likewise with many towns. The towns supporting the League had their old privileges confirmed, they received an amnesty for their resistance, exemption from taxes, and assurance that the Protestant faith would not be tolerated within their walls. Nobles and powerful citizens also successfully negotiated offices and pensions for themselves and their clients. The princes extracted especially high payments, the duc de Lorraine receiving 900,000 écus for his loyalty.71 In many of the 'reconquered' towns, the inhabitants experienced a carefully planned royal entrée. Paris opened its gates to Henri IV after he converted to Catholicism. His reputed dictum that 'Paris is worth a mass' is not actually recorded, but pertinent enough. For the parlement to accept him as king, he also had to agree a financial reform. So long as historians viewed the development of royal rule in 'France' as the construction of 'absolutism', the reign of Henri IV from 1597 to his murder in 1610 could be characterised as the start of this new form of rule. Similar to the supposed despotism of the Tudors in England, the supposed absolutism of the Bourbons required a disciplining of the nobility, explicable in the one case by its self-destruction in the Wars of the Roses, in the other by the wars of religion. But now that preambles to royal legislation are no longer taken as expressing the reality of structures of rule, the persistence of the strength of the French nobility into the seventeenth century has become increasingly clear. This affects our interpretation of the reign of Henri IV, as well as the achievement of his minister Sully. Today the stabilisation of royal rule under Henri IV is only rarely ascribed to a permanent expansion in the power of the crown and the development of a 'modern state apparatus', but rather to an integration of continuing noble strength into the practice of royal government. This was possible because the long wars had ultimately not only caused widespread distress across the country, but also provoked the anger of the nobility. From the end of the 1570s, peasants had several times risen against the plunder of the nobles and the tax collectors of both sides. The 1590s saw regular peasant wars - especially in Guyenne, Burgundy, Normandy and Brittany. It must have seemed especially threatening that peasants of both faiths frequently joined together in these uprisings. When competition for rulership developed into a crisis of noble rule itself, a readiness for peace grew even among the supporters of the leading noble factions. Peace could be stabilised because the crown succeeded in conceding so many privileges to factions and corporations that it secured their loyalty and was tolerable to the contending parties. It is in this connection that the edict of Nantes should be understood. This recognised the Huguenots as a group entitled to claim certain privileges guaranteed by the crown. (As was later to emerge, the crown was not strong enough to deliver all that it promised.) In additional documents, the crown conceded the Huguenots the right to a defi-nite number of fortified strongholds, and hence a certain political and military autonomy. In 1611, these privileges were reconfirmed by the new king, but, in the 1620s, when the power relations shifted, the most important privileges of the Huguenots were withdrawn by armed force. What was new above all in the reign of Henri IV was his recognition of the fact that the levying of taille above a certain limit endangered order in the country. Despite the crown's immense indebtedness - almost the entire crown domain was mortgaged during the war against the League - direct taxation was reduced. Indirect taxes were raised instead, in particular the duty on salt, and these were also introduced in areas that had previously been free of them. At the same time, however, the crown saw itself forced on fiscal grounds to extend its trade in offices. This was so far-reaching that the crown abandoned the fiction of its non-existence. Up to this time, revenue from parties casuelles had been officially deemed a loan to the crown. Despite the sale of judges' positions, therefore, it was still required of them that on taking up their posi-tion they should swear that they had not purchased their office. In 1598 the crown revoked this obligation.”翻译为中文","output":"贵族集团和宗教派别制定了自己的对外政策。在这一时期主导王室政策的天主教一方得到了西班牙王冠和教皇的支持，而新教一方则得到了英格兰王冠的支持。贵族集团之间的权力斗争即使在实际军事行动之间也血腥地持续着。双方都以上帝的名义进行谋杀。由于天主教派别在吉斯公爵的领导下主导了皇家军队，它可以更加激进地行事。（正是这一方挑起了共八场宗教战争中的第一场。）王室的调解尝试最终失败，因为国内为争夺广泛权力的斗争被纳入了荷兰人反抗西班牙统治的国际冲突中。冲突在1572年圣巴托洛缪日天主教徒对前往巴黎庆祝纳瓦尔的亨利婚礼的众多胡格诺派信徒进行的残忍大屠杀中达到高潮；刺杀科利尼元帅不仅是为了报复吉斯公爵的死，也是为了消除最重要的胡格诺派将领及与荷兰的联络人。许多其他（真实或假定的）胡格诺派信徒的死亡旨在防止他们的报复，同时一劳永逸地根除他们的异端邪说。贵族利益和宗教狂热构成了一个可怕的组合。 经过巴黎大屠杀后，胡格诺派与王室的关系发生了变化。直到那时，法国新教徒并没有将自己视为与王室对立；相反，他们经常寻求其保护，并提出解救其摆脱“外国人”的控制。这既指统治洛林的吉斯家族，也指购入里昂财团并从王室财政困境中获利的意大利银行家。这一政策在1572年终结。胡格诺派领导人现在认为，反抗王室的专断权力是合理的，因为王室在谋杀中表现出了同谋。他们要求分权，以结束暴政并防止未来发生：更具体地说，要求在由贵族主导的代表机构中拥有更大的影响力。 王室在1572年之后仍试图通过向两个宗教团体授予权利来实现和平。天主教贵族现在组成了一个联盟，反对亨利三世的和平政策。为了控制他们，国王宣布自己成为其领导者。然而，这一步骤丝毫没有改变王室对派系无力的处境。和平努力失败，武装冲突重新爆发。 1584年6月10日，法兰西王位继承人安茹的弗朗索瓦突然去世。不再有直接的继承人。纳瓦尔的亨利和波旁亲王查尔斯都宣称继承权。亨利是胡格诺派，查尔斯是枢机主教。天主教联盟支持查尔斯作为他们的候选人。继承冲突改变了天主教派系的基础。从1584年底开始，巴黎市民秘密会面，考虑如何在新教继承人威胁下捍卫真正的信仰。据所知，这个秘密协会的成员很早就得出结论，罢黜亨利三世并指派一位更有力捍卫信仰的继任者是合法的。随后几年，宣誓加入秘密巴黎联盟的人数增加。官员、神职人员和富有的市民，以及印刷工、皇家铸币厂员工、高等法院及其他法院的成员，还有马夫和皇家邮政服务人员也加入了其中。联盟开展了有系统的宣传活动，支持真正的天主教信仰，反对可能的异教徒（纳瓦尔的亨利被教皇逐出教会）继承人。这种激进化由王室对该城市的财政政策和侵犯官员的财产权，以及法庭的奢侈、狂热神职人员的布道，以及应英格兰新教女王的请求处决玛丽·斯图亚特的行为所助长。 巴黎联盟的领导机构，被称为 Seize（十六人会），是根据该市的十六个区域命名的，发展成为一个非正式的市政府。派出使者将其他城市的真正天主教徒与巴黎联系起来，形成“神圣联盟”。据资料显示——亨利四世后来下令销毁内战时期的文件——1588年7月，当传出国王命令军队进城保护自己的消息时，形势爆发了。联盟占领了巴士底狱，占领了高等法院和忠于国王的有权势的“官员”的住所。在卢浮宫周围的街道上设置了路障。因此，国王成为了联盟的囚犯。根据 F.J. Baumgartner 的说法，巴黎联盟最初独立于贵族行动。它得到了城市中下阶层的支持，以及王国中300个其他城镇的联盟的支持。从1588年到1594年，联盟统治了巴黎。其成员传播了人民有权罢黜暴君并选择新国王的观念。他们要求定期召集三级会议，控制王室财政和官职出售。 亨利三世逃离巴黎，并对首都进行了围攻；1589年，他被暗杀。亨利四世随后不得不与联盟抗争八年，其候选人被高等法院宣布为查理十世国王。西班牙王室和教皇支持联盟的斗争。和平最终不仅仅是赢得的，而是一点一点买来的。亨利的代表与几位贵族个别和解，同样也和许多城镇和解。支持联盟的城镇确认了它们的旧特权，他们获得了对抗争的赦免、免税和保证其墙内不容许新教的承诺。贵族和有权势的市民也成功为自己及其客户谈判到了官职和养老金。亲王们获得了特别高的报酬，洛林公爵因其忠诚收到了90万埃居的报酬。 在许多“重新征服”的城镇，居民经历了精心策划的皇家入城仪式。巴黎在他皈依天主教后向亨利四世开放了大门。他那句著名的话“巴黎值得一弥撒”虽然没有实际记录，但却非常恰当。为了让高等法院接受他为国王，他还必须同意进行财政改革。 只要历史学家将“法国”王室统治的发展视为“绝对主义”的建构，亨利四世从1597年到他1610年被暗杀的统治就可以被视为这种新统治形式的开始。与英格兰都铎王朝所谓的专制主义类似，波旁王朝的所谓绝对主义要求对贵族进行纪律约束，在一个案例中通过玫瑰战争中的自我毁灭，在另一个案例中通过宗教战争来解释。但现在，鉴于王室立法的序言不再被视为表达统治结构的现实，法国贵族在十七世纪的力量持续存在变得越来越清晰。这影响了我们对亨利四世统治以及他的大臣苏利成就的解释。 如今，亨利四世统治下王室统治的稳定很少归因于王冠权力的持久扩张和“现代国家机构”的发展，而更多地归因于贵族力量的持续整合进王室政府的实践中。这是因为长期的战争最终不仅给全国带来了普遍的苦难，还激发了贵族的愤怒。从1570年代末开始，农民多次起义反对贵族和双方税吏的掠夺。1590年代见证了定期的农民战争——尤其是在圭亚那、勃艮第、诺曼底和布列塔尼。两个信仰的农民经常在这些起义中联合起来，这似乎尤其威胁。当争夺统治权发展成为贵族统治本身的危机时，即使是领导贵族派系的支持者中也增长了和平的意愿。 因为王室成功地向派系和公司让步这么多特权，以确保它们的忠诚并对争斗双方可接受，所以和平得以稳定。南特敕令应该在这种背景下理解。该敕令承认胡格诺派作为一个有权要求王室保证某些特权的团体。（正如后来显现的，王室并没有足够的力量兑现其所承诺的一切。）在附加文件中，王室给予胡格诺派一定数量的设防要塞的权利，从而给予他们一定的政治和军事自主权。1611年，这些特权被新国王重新确认，但在1620年代，当权力关系发生变化时，胡格诺派最重要的特权被武力撤回。 亨利四世统治期间最新的是他认识到超过一定限度的征收直接税会危及国家秩序。尽管王室负债累累——几乎整个王室领地在与联盟的战争期间都被抵押了——直接税被减少了。相反，间接税被提高，特别是盐税，并且还推广到以前免税的地区。 然而，同时，王室出于财政原因被迫扩大了其官职买卖。这种做法广泛到王室放弃了其不存在的幻想。直至此时，来自偶然事项的收入官方上被视为对王室的贷款。因此，尽管销售了法官职位，法官在就职时仍被要求宣誓他们没有购买自己的职位。1598年，王室撤销了这一义务。"},{"instruction":"","output":"对不起，您似乎没有提出具体的问题或要求。请告诉我您需要帮助的内容！"},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息:

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。

You’re worth that kid’s trust , her missing you everyday , thinkin’ where did Liam go.. he ran off with my flower and he never came back-No I ain’t seeing a reason to leave you up here. Don’t walk away from feelings you can’t see.”","output":"The passage you've shared evokes a deep emotional appeal, touching on themes of trust, abandonment, and the importance of confronting and acknowledging one's feelings. It's a plea or argument against someone walking away from a situation or relationship based on unseen or unresolved emotions. The speaker brings up a poignant example of a child, likely metaphorical, who trusts someone named Liam with something precious (\\"my flower\\") only for Liam to disappear, leaving a lingering sense of loss and betrayal. This scenario is used to emphasize the importance of facing emotions directly rather than avoiding them, and it suggests that the speaker sees inherent value in the person they are addressing, enough so to argue against departing from a situation that has clearly caused emotional turmoil. This kind of dialogue could fit into various contexts, such as personal relationships, discussions on loyalty and commitment, or even in a broader sense of dealing with emotions and responsibilities in life. It underscores the weight of emotional bonds and the impact of our actions on others, especially on those who trust and rely on us. The depth of the sentiment expressed suggests a critical moment of decision where the stakes involve deep emotional consequences for all parties involved. Without additional context, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact nature of the situation or relationship at hand, but the underlying message is universally resonant: don't turn away from difficult emotions or situations, especially when others have placed their trust in you."},{"instruction":"需要你充当资深的，思维严谨、逻辑清晰的优惠活动分析人员，我会给你发送活动的详细介绍内容，请你帮我整理出活动的基本信息:

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中

提及“付款码”和“扫一扫|扫码”，则属于“主扫被扫均可” 关于活动时间详细要求: 分为以下几种情况 情况1：如某几天，则格式为\\"time\\":\\"20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日、20xx年x月x日，每活动日00:00:00-20:59:59\\"； 情况1例子：2024年4月10日、2024年5月10日、2024年6月10日，每活动日00:00:00-23:59:59。

在2024年4月3日至2024年12月31日这段时间内，总共有9个月。但是需要注意的是，开始的第一个月（4月）只有4个周六，因为活动从4月3日开始，所以4月的第一个周六不能计算在内。同样，结束的最后一个月（12月）有5个周六，但是活动在12月31日结束，所以12月的最后一个周六也不能计算在内。所以，活动日的总数应该是36-2=34。 每个用户每月最多可以享受2次优惠，所以总领取次数应该是9*2，即18次。 记住这个优惠次数限制逻辑思维，并应用到之后的分析中 请根据优惠次数限制逻辑，详细综合分析days、bins、shops、daily、monthly、total确保数值计算正确，充分理解分析活动内容，严格按要求和格式输出，只回复json数据就行，不要回复其他多余内容，如果明白我所说的要求，则回复“知道了”","output":"知道了"},{"instruction":"当前时间:2024/4/22 11:16:24

Justify your answer. c. If a document is classified as Top Secret and spans both Nuclear and Diplomatic compartments, who can access(read) it?","output":"The Bell-LaPadula (BLP) model, with its focus on maintaining confidentiality using access controls, operates on two main principles: the Simple Security Rule (no read up, or \\"ss-property\\") and the *-property (no write down, or \\"star property\\"). When incorporating compartments along with security levels, the model further refines access decisions based on the need-to-know principle, ensuring that subjects (users) can only access information if they have both the appropriate clearance level and the need-to-know for that particular compartment of information. Given the scenario, let's address each question within the context of the BLP model with compartments: a. **Can John access(read) information classified as Secret within the Nuclear compartment?** Yes, John can access this information. John has clearance at the Top Secret level, which is higher than Secret. According to the Simple Security Rule of the BLP model, a subject with a given security clearance can read information at that level and below (i.e., John can read information classified as Top Secret, Secret, and Unclassified). Furthermore, since John has access to the Nuclear compartment and the information in question is within this compartment, he fulfills both the clearance level and compartmentalization requirements to access the information. b. **Can Mary access(read) information classified as Top Secret within the Diplomatic compartment?** No, Mary cannot access this information. Although Mary has access to the Diplomatic compartment, where the information is classified, her clearance level is Secret, which is below the classification level of the information she seeks to access. The BLP model's Simple Security Rule prohibits reading information at a higher classification level than the subject's clearance, meaning Mary cannot read Top Secret information due to her Secret clearance level. c. **If a document is classified as Top Secret and spans both Nuclear and Diplomatic compartments, who can access(read) it?** In this case, neither John nor Mary can access the document based on the information provided. The document requires Top Secret clearance and access to both Nuclear and Diplomatic compartments. Although John has the necessary Top Secret clearance, he only has access to the Nuclear compartment and not the Diplomatic compartment. On the other hand, Mary has access to the Diplomatic compartment but only possesses Secret level clearance, which is insufficient for accessing Top Secret classified information. To access a document classified at the Top Secret level and spanning both Nuclear and Diplomatic compartments, a subject would need to have Top Secret clearance along with access permissions to both the Nuclear and Diplomatic compartments. Neither John nor Mary meets these combined criteria."},{"instruction":"provide an exposition on mr. stripes of the little misters collection in the scp universe. explain how his abilities work and provide detailed examples. discuss ramifications of his powers","output":"In the SCP universe, \\"Mr. Stripes\\" is part of the \\"Little Misters\\" collection, a series of anomalous humanoids created by Dr. Wondertainment. Each Little Mister possesses unique characteristics or abilities, often with whimsical or childlike themes, embodying traits or concepts in exaggerated, often hazardous forms. The Little Misters are designated SCPs within the SCP Foundation, a fictional organization tasked with containing and studying phenomena that defy scientific explanation. Mr. Stripes, specifically designated as part of this group, is not fully detailed in the original SCP Foundation literature, which is vast and diverse, contributed to by a wide array of community members. Therefore, understanding Mr. Stripes requires some creative extrapolation and interpretation within the bounds of how Dr. Wondertainment's creations typically manifest their characteristics. Given the naming convention and thematic approaches seen in Dr. Wondertainment’s creations, Mr. Stripes likely possesses abilities or attributes related to stripes in some capacity. While there is no official detailed account of Mr. Stripes' abilities within the primary source material at my last update, we can theorize about his powers based on the naming and thematic consistency across the Little Misters series. # Theoretical Abilities of Mr. Stripes 1. **Altering Perceptions or Reality**: Mr. Stripes could have the ability to alter his appearance or the appearance of his surroundings through the manipulation of stripes. This could render him camouflaged or make him incredibly conspicuous, depending on his need for stealth or attention. 2. **Division of Space or Objects**: An interpretation of \\"stripes\\" could be the ability to divide space, objects, or perhaps even concepts into distinct segments or \\"stripes,\\" potentially allowing him to manipulate physical laws or characteristics within those divisions. 3. **Influence Over Behavior or Emotions**: Drawing from the associative power of colors and patterns, Mr. Stripes might influence emotions or behaviors in individuals or animals who observe him. Different stripe patterns or colors could evoke fear, calm, aggression, or confusion. # Detailed Examples - In a containment breach scenario, Mr. Stripes could utilize his camouflage ability to blend into striped wallpapers or textiles, sneaking past SCP Foundation personnel. - During experimentation, if Mr. Stripes possesses the ability to segment space or matter, he might demonstrate this by slicing through solid materials simply by passing through them, leaving striped patterns that act as fault lines. - If involved in an interaction with D-Class personnel for behavioral studies, Mr. Stripes might change his stripe patterns, observing the psychological effects on subjects. For instance, rapid, zigzagging stripes could induce anxiety or distress, while soft, wavy lines might have a calming effect. # Ramifications of His Powers The powers of Mr. Stripes, while speculative, could have various ramifications: 1. **Containment Difficulty**: His ability to blend into environments or manipulate his immediate surroundings would make him a containment challenge, requiring specialized protocols beyond conventional security measures. 2. **Research Potential**: The unique manifestations of Mr. Stripes' abilities could offer insights into anomalous changes in perception, the mechanics of spatial manipulation, and the psychological impact of visual stimuli. 3. **Ethical Concerns**: The use of Mr. Stripes' abilities, particularly in influencing emotions or behavior, raises significant ethical questions regarding autonomy and consent. The SCP Foundation would need to navigate these concerns carefully, balancing scientific exploration with ethical responsibility. In conclusion, Mr. Stripes, as a hypothetical example of Dr. Wondertainment's Little Misters, illustrates the creative depth and complexity of the SCP universe. The speculative nature of his abilities invites interpretation and exploration within the broader themes of anomaly, containment, and the human condition as explored by the SCP Foundation."},{"instruction":"rewrite discussing scp 2148","output":"SCP-2148, known colloquially as \\"Mr. Stripes,\\" is an anomalous entity categorized by the SCP Foundation, a fictional organization dedicated to securing, containing, and protecting humanity from phenomena that defy natural law. Unlike the speculative nature of the initially discussed character, SCP-2148 has distinct characteristics and a backstory as documented by the SCP Foundation's extensive archives. # Description of SCP-2148 SCP-2148's physical appearance is that of a human male dressed in a vertically striped suit that exhibits a unique anomalous property: the stripes on the suit appear to shift and change direction when not under direct observation, creating a disorienting visual effect. SCP-2148's face is always obscured by shadow, regardless of the lighting conditions, adding to its mysterious nature. # Abilities and Behavioral Traits SCP-2148's primary anomalous ability revolves around its striped suit. The suit's stripes have the power to induce various psychological states in observers, ranging from mild discomfort and disorientation to extreme terror and confusion. This effect is potentiated by SCP-2148's ability to move at high speeds and appear suddenly, enhancing the fear response in those who encounter it. Another significant characteristic of SCP-2148 is its seemingly sentient and malicious intent, primarily manifesting in its efforts to elude capture and containment by the SCP Foundation. Its behavior suggests a high level of intelligence and perhaps even an understanding of human psychology, which it uses to its advantage to evade and manipulate. # Containment Procedures Due to SCP-2148's elusive nature and the psychological effects of its anomalous properties, the SCP Foundation has developed specialized containment procedures. These involve the use of observation rooms with constant, multidirectional lighting to eliminate shadows and minimize its capacities for sudden appearances. Personnel interacting with or containing SCP-2148 are required to wear specially designed goggles that counteract the disorienting effects of the shifting stripes. # Ramifications of SCP-2148's Powers The psychological impact on individuals exposed to SCP-2148 is a significant concern for the SCP Foundation. Prolonged exposure can lead to lasting psychological trauma and even permanent cognitive deficits, underscoring the importance of strict containment and minimal direct interaction. Furthermore, SCP-2148's abilities present a unique challenge for the Foundation, not just in terms of containment but in understanding the nature of perception and reality. Research involving SCP-2148 could potentially lead to advances in psychological treatment methods or new technologies to counteract cognitive manipulation, but ethical considerations regarding the use of an anomalous entity for such purposes are paramount. # Conclusion In the SCP universe, SCP-2148, Mr. Stripes, embodies the blend of intrigue and danger that characterizes many of the entities contained by the SCP Foundation. His unique abilities and the Foundation's efforts to contain him highlight the perpetual struggle between understanding and fear that defines much of the SCP narrative. Mr. Stripes is a testament to the creativity and complexity of the SCP community's contributions to the realm of speculative fiction."},{"instruction":"discuss the character mr. laugh from the little misters collection. discuss its power and abilities and their uses. provide detailed examples","output":"Mr. Laugh, another character from the fictional \\"Little Misters\\" series created by Dr. Wondertainment, is cataloged within the SCP Foundation universe. Like his counterparts, Mr. Laugh embodies a specific concept or aspect of human experience, in this case, laughter and its effects on people. His designation in the SCP series provides insight into his anomalous properties and the complex implications of his powers. # Description and Abilities Mr. Laugh is characterized by his ability to induce intense and uncontrollable laughter in individuals within his vicinity. This effect does not seem to stem from any auditory joke or physical comedy but rather from a direct anomalous influence on those who are near him or directly interact with him. The laughter induced is described as being far beyond the normal response to humor, often leading to physical exhaustion, difficulty breathing, and in extreme cases, loss of consciousness due to the inability to stop laughing. # Uses of His Powers 1. **Disarming and Non-lethal Crowd Control**: Mr. Laugh's ability could be seen as a method for non-lethally subduing groups in a way that prevents violence or escape. For example, in a containment breach involving aggressive SCPs, Mr. Laugh's presence could incapacitate individuals or other entities through laughter, allowing for their recontainment with minimal harm. 2. **Psychological Therapy**: Under controlled conditions, Mr. Laugh's powers might be used therapeutically for individuals in need of relief from severe depression or anxiety. The involuntary laughter, while overwhelming, could potentially break cycles of negative emotion in a manner similar to laughter therapy, but this would require careful management to avoid the aforementioned negative side effects. 3. **Study of Laughter and Cognitive Effects**: By analyzing the effects of Mr. Laugh's abilities on the human brain, researchers could gain valuable insights into how laughter affects neurological function, emotional states, and social bonding. # Detailed Examples - During a containment breach exercise, Mr. Laugh is positioned strategically at choke points. As security personnel and other SCP entities approach, they are overwhelmed by laughter, allowing for a more straightforward recontainment operation. Observers note the difficulty in managing the operation due to the contagious effect of laughter, even among those previously briefed on Mr. Laugh's properties. - In a controlled experiment, subjects with clinical depression are exposed to Mr. Laugh in short, monitored sessions. Some participants report a temporary alleviation of depressive symptoms, though the sessions need to be kept brief to prevent physical side effects. The results are intriguing but inconclusive, prompting further study. - A neurological study involving Mr. Laugh explores the difference in brain activity between normal laughter and the laughter induced by his anomalous effect. Preliminary findings suggest abnormal activation in areas linked to emotional control and physiological responses, offering new avenues for research into how the brain processes humor and involuntary physical responses. # Ethical Considerations and Challenges The utilization of Mr. Laugh's powers, especially in contexts that might cause harm or distress, presents significant ethical dilemmas. The SCP Foundation's mandate to protect not only includes containment of anomalous entities but also the prevention of suffering and unethical treatment of both SCP entities and humans. The physical and psychological effects of prolonged exposure to Mr. Laugh's induced laughter necessitate careful containment procedures and the development of guidelines for any interaction with or study of Mr. Laugh. These measures ensure that his presence does not result in undue harm, aligning with the Foundation's ethical standards. # Conclusion Mr. Laugh, as a part of the \\"Little Misters\\" collection, represents the unique blend of whimsy and danger often found in the SCP universe. His abilities, while seemingly benign at first glance, underscore the complex relationship between human experience and the anomalous, challenging researchers to explore the boundaries of understanding and empathy within the Foundation's efforts to secure, contain, and protect."},{"instruction":"discuss mr. scary from the scp universe and its powers and abilities.","output":"As of my last update in September 2023, there is no widely recognized character known as \\"Mr. Scary\\" within the official SCP Foundation universe or the Little Misters series created by Dr. Wondertainment, that has been documented similarly to others like Mr. Laugh or Mr. Stripes. The SCP Foundation is a fictional organization featured in a collaborative writing project with the purpose of documenting various anomalous entities, objects, and phenomena. The Little Misters are a subset of these entities, each with unique attributes, all created by the in-universe character Dr. Wondertainment, intended to form a collection with a whimsical yet sometimes ominous twist. Given the absence of an official Mr. Scary, any discussion on potential powers and abilities would be purely speculative and based on extrapolation from the themes and naming conventions observed in other Little Misters. However, engaging in such speculation can be a fun exercise in creativity, using the established lore of the SCP universe as a foundation. # Speculative Powers and Abilities of a Hypothetical Mr. Scary In the spirit of the SCP Foundation's universe and the thematic elements of Dr. Wondertainment's creations, Mr. Scary could hypothetically embody fear and terror in various direct and indirect manners. Here are some speculative abilities that would align with the nature implied by the name \\"Mr. Scary\\": 1. **Fear Manifestation**: Mr. Scary could have the ability to bring a person's deepest fears into reality, albeit temporarily and perhaps in a way that's not physically harmful. This could serve as a mechanism for self-reflection or personal growth, despite the initial terror. 2. **Paranoia Inducement**: Another possible power could be the ability to induce intense feelings of paranoia in individuals he encounters. This effect could create an aura of distrust and fear around Mr. Scary, making him a particularly difficult entity for the SCP Foundation to work with or contain. 3. **Invisibility or Shape-shifting**: To enhance his terrifying presence, Mr. Scary might possess the ability to become invisible or to shape-shift into various forms that personify an individual's fears or societal phobias. This would make him not only a psychological threat but also a physically elusive entity to contain. 4. **Nightmare Induction**: Mr. Scary could have the power to infiltrate the dreams of sleeping individuals, inducing vivid nightmares that could have long-lasting psychological effects. This could be used by the SCP Foundation to study the nature of dreams and the subconscious mind, albeit with significant ethical considerations. # Ethical and Containment Considerations Considering the severe psychological impact of Mr. Scary's speculative powers, the SCP Foundation would likely prioritize developing containment procedures that minimize his interaction with both personnel and other SCP entities. Containment strategies could include isolation in a soundproof, vision-obstructing cell to prevent his abilities from affecting others. Additionally, the ethical implications of containing an entity like Mr. Scary would be complex, given the potential for causing lasting psychological trauma. # Conclusion While Mr. Scary does not exist in the documented SCP universe as of the last update, the hypothetical exploration of his powers and the implications of his containment brings to light the broader themes of fear, ethics, and the unknown that permeate the SCP Foundation's narrative universe. Such speculation not only highlights the collaborative creativity that defines the SCP community but also underscores the deep narrative potential within the lore of the SCP Foundation."},{"instruction":"discuss scp 2521","output":"SCP-2521, also known as ●●|●●●●●|●●|●, is a unique and intriguing entity within the SCP Foundation universe, notable for the way information about it is conveyed and the specific nature of its containment procedure. The anomaly itself challenges the norms of documentation and interaction within the SCP Foundation, offering a fascinating case study on non-traditional communication methods and information security. # Description SCP-2521 is depicted primarily through pictograms, as it has been discovered that any attempt to describe its physical features or abilities through text or verbal communication results in the anomaly appearing to confiscate the material or abduct the person sharing the information. The use of pictograms to document SCP-2521 is a strategic choice, leveraging a form of communication that the entity does not seem to react to or understand. From what can be understood through these pictograms, SCP-2521 appears to be a tall, shadowy figure with multiple tentacle-like appendages. It demonstrates an understanding of human languages and is capable of physical interaction with objects and individuals, especially focusing on information about itself. # Powers and Abilities The most distinctive ability of SCP-2521 is its reaction to information about itself shared through text or spoken words. It seems to be able to detect when information is being communicated in these formats, regardless of where it happens, and is capable of bypassing conventional physical and security barriers to reach the source of such information. Another aspect of SCP-2521's anomalous properties is its selectivity in what it takes; the entity only targets information that is explicitly about itself. This behavior suggests a level of sentience and discernment, as it can differentiate between general information and that which pertains directly to it. # Containment and Interaction The containment procedure for SCP-2521 revolves around the avoidance of traditional documentation and verbal discussion of its characteristics or behavior. By relying on pictograms and avoiding textual or verbal references, the SCP Foundation minimizes the risk of SCP-2521's intervention. This unconventional approach to containment underscores the adaptability required in managing various SCPs, especially those that interact with information or communication methods in anomalous ways. # Implications and Discussion SCP-2521 presents a unique challenge in the realm of information security and containment. Its ability to respond to specific formats of communication highlights the importance of understanding an SCP's properties thoroughly to develop effective containment strategies. Furthermore, SCP-2521 stimulates discussion about the nature of awareness and response to information in anomalous entities, suggesting that their interactions with the world can be complex and highly varied. The case of SCP-2521 also serves as a narrative exploration of knowledge and its dangers within the SCP universe. It embodies the concept that some information is inherently risky or volatile, necessitating creative solutions to mitigate those risks. SCP-2521's documentation, being entirely pictographic, demonstrates the SCP Foundation's commitment to maintaining security while navigating the challenges posed by such anomalies. In summary, SCP-2521 is a compelling example of how the SCP Foundation universe explores themes of knowledge, communication, and containment. Its unique characteristics and the methods employed to manage its presence offer insights into the depth and complexity of the Foundation's endeavors to secure, contain, and protect humanity from the unknown."},{"instruction":"eli5 a rhetorical questions","output":"A rhetorical question is like asking a question not because you want an answer, but to make a point or get someone thinking.

Immediate right of D Immediate left of D Fourth to the right of A ← None of the mentioned options","output":"Let's analyze the clues given, one by one: 1. A is second to the left of E. This means there is one person between A and E, with A on the more left position when viewed from the North. 2. E is second to the left of F. This means there is also one person between E and F, with E on the more left position when viewed from the North. 3. F is third to the right of C. This means there are two people between F and C, with F on the more right position when viewed from the North. 4. D is third to the right of B. This means there are two people between D and B, with D on the more right position when viewed from the North. These clues indicate several relative positions but do not give the exact positions. To solve the arrangement, let's start with the clues involving the most people: F and C, and then D and B. Since the bench is facing North, we need to consider that the right side of the bench will be to the West, and the left side will be to the East, based on the viewpoint of the students sitting on the bench. Let's denote empty seats as \\"_\\". Given \\"F is third to the right of C\\", therefore the arrangement involving F and C is: C _ _ F Now we need to place E and A. E is second to the left of F, so that means: C _ E F and then A is second to the left of E: C A E F Now for B and D, \\"D is third to the right of B\\" implies: B _ _ D There are seven students, and we've already placed five of them: C, A, E, F, and D. Now we must figure out where B fits into the already established positions, and then we'll identify where G must be. Since there must be two places between B and D, then one possible arrangement would be if we place B at the beginning: B C A E F _ D Another option could be with B right after student C: C B _ A E F D But if B was after C, there would be only one seat between B and D, which contradicts the clue. So we have confirmed that B takes the first position: B C A E F _ D The only remaining student is G, and there's one empty spot left immediately to the right of F: B C A E F G D So now we have the final arrangement: B, C, A, E, F, G, D Let's look at the options regarding G: - Immediate right of D: False, G is to the right of F. - Immediate left of D: False, G is to the left of D. - Fourth to the right of A: False, G is only two places to the right of A. - None of the mentioned options: True, none of the provided options match the position of G based on the clues."},{"instruction":"In a family, A and B are children of D, F is the mother of B, C is the brother of A and also the father of E.

A and B are children of D. 2. F is the mother of B. 3. C is the brother of A and also the father of E. From these statements, we can conclude the following: - D is a parent of both A and B. - Since A and C are siblings, D is also the parent of C. - C is E's father, which means D is E's grandparent. However, we don't know the gender of D directly from the statements given. D could either be the grandmother or grandfather of E. But we can infer D's gender based on the fact that F is identified as the mother of B. This implies that D should be the father if F is the mother because B has two parents, a father and a mother.

First, we'll find the rank of R, as it is 17 ranks above Q: If Q is 11th from the bottom, and R is 17 ranks above Q, we can find R's position from the bottom by adding Q's position to 17: Rank of R from the bottom = Rank of Q from the bottom + 17 Rank of R from the bottom = 11 + 17 Rank of R from the bottom = 28 Now we have R at the 28th position from the bottom. S is 6 ranks below R, so we subtract 6 from R's rank to get S's rank from the bottom: Rank of S from the bottom = Rank of R from the bottom - 6 Rank of S from the bottom = 28 - 6 Rank of S from the bottom = 22 Now we have S at the 22nd position from the bottom. Since P is ranked in the middle of R and S, we can find the position of P by calculating the average of R and S's ranks from the bottom: Rank of P from the bottom = (Rank of R from the bottom + Rank of S from the bottom) / 2 Rank of P from the bottom = (28 + 22) / 2 Rank of P from the bottom = 50 / 2 Rank of P from the bottom = 25 So P is at the 25th position from the bottom. Since Q is at the 11th position from the bottom, we can now calculate the number of candidates between P and Q: Number of candidates between P and Q = (Rank of P from the bottom - 1) - Rank of Q from the bottom Number of candidates between P and Q = (25 - 1) - 11 Number of candidates between P and Q = 24 - 11 Number of candidates between P and Q = 13 However, there is a discrepancy with the options provided.

The number of candidates between P and Q is: Number of candidates between P and Q = Rank of P from the bottom - Rank of Q from the bottom - 1 Number of candidates between P and Q = 25 - 11 - 1 Number of candidates between P and Q = 14 - 1 Number of candidates between P and Q = 13 Since 13 is an available option, that would be the correct answer.

This conclusion says that all keys are primary, but this is not supported by the statements. Statement B indicates that only some keys are digits, and it is known from statement C that all digits are primary.

However, there is an inconsistency with 'M' to 'B' and 'K' to 'S' as they do not match the +13 or -13 position shift.

What is the speed of the truck, if the bus travels at 45 km/h? 12 km/h 15 km/h 10 km/h 18 km/h","output":"First, determine the total distance the bus travels to go from 5 km behind the truck to 5 km ahead of it. This distance is 5 km (to reach the position of the truck) + 5 km (to get ahead of it) = 10 km. Since the bus travels at 45 km/h, we can calculate how far the bus travels in 20 minutes. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, 20 minutes is one-third of an hour. The distance the bus travels in 20 minutes at 45 km/h is: ( Distance = Speed times Time ) ( Distance = 45 frac{km}{h} times frac{20}{60} h ) ( Distance = 45 times frac{1}{3}) ( Distance = 15 km ) The bus has covered 15 km in 20 minutes, but as mentioned earlier, only 10 km of that distance was needed to move from 5 km behind the truck to 5 km ahead. So, during the 20 minutes, the truck also covers a certain distance, which will be the difference between what the bus traveled to catch up and the additional distance. The truck's distance in 20 minutes is: ( 15 km (bus) - 10 km (catch up + overtake) = 5 km ) This means that in 20 minutes, the truck has traveled 5 km. Now, we can calculate the truck's speed using the distance it traveled in 20 minutes: ( Speed = frac{Distance}{Time} ) ( Speed = frac{5 km}{frac{20}{60} h} ) ( Speed = frac{5 km}{frac{1}{3} h} ) ( Speed = 5 times 3 ) ( Speed = 15 km/h ) So, the speed of the truck is 15 km/h."},{"instruction":"Find the average of the numbers given below: 33, 38, 43, 48, 53 and so on till 83. 78 058 61 ← 49","output":"The numbers given form an arithmetic sequence (also known as an arithmetic progression) where each term increases by a common difference, d. For this sequence, the common difference is 5, as we can see by subtracting consequent terms (38 - 33 = 5, 43 - 38 = 5, and so on). In an arithmetic sequence, to find the average of all terms, we can simply take the average of the first term (a_1) and the last term (a_n). Let's identify these: - The first term, a_1, is 33. - The last term, a_n, must be found by determining how many terms are in the series. Since we don't know the total number of terms directly, we can find it using the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d We are given that the last term is 83. Hence: 83 = 33 + (n - 1) * 5 Now, let's solve for n: 83 = 33 + 5n - 5 83 = 28 + 5n 83 - 28 = 5n 55 = 5n n = 55 / 5 n = 11 The total number of terms in the sequence is 11.

John sold a painting for 200, and the profit percentage was equal to the cost of the painting. This means that if we let C be the cost of the painting, the profit he made was also C. Therefore, we have: Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Profit 200 = C + C 200 = 2C This implies that: C = 200 / 2 C = 100 Now, we're told that John wanted to increase his profit percentage points by 25%. The original profit is equal to the cost, which was 100, representing a 100% profit. An increase of 25 percentage points to the profit percentage means the new profit percentage is 100% + 25% = 125% of the cost price. The new profit amount would therefore be: New Profit = 125% of C New Profit = 1.25 × C New Profit = 1.25 × 100 New Profit = 125 The new selling price (NSP) would be the sum of the cost price and the new profit: NSP = CP + New Profit NSP = 100 + 125 NSP = 225 So, the new selling price should be 225, which is option B."},{"instruction":"Select Robinson Crusoe about British literature and write an essay of about 1,000 words.

This essay aims to delve into the novel's key themes and examine Defoe's writing techniques that contribute to its enduring appeal. By exploring the themes of survival, colonialism, and religion, as well as analyzing Defoe's use of narrative devices, this essay will demonstrate the depth and complexity of Robinson Crusoe. Main Body: The Theme of Survival: One of the central themes in Robinson Crusoe is the struggle for survival. Crusoe's isolation on a deserted island forces him to adapt, be resourceful, and rely solely on his own ingenuity. Defoe effectively depicts Crusoe's transformation from a naive and impulsive youth to a responsible and self-sufficient individual through the use of vivid descriptions. For example, Crusoe's meticulous record-keeping demonstrates his commitment to survival and organization, as he documents his efforts to grow crops and build shelter. Defoe's depiction of Crusoe's relentless determination highlights the resiliency of the human spirit in the face of adversity. The Theme of Colonialism: Robinson Crusoe explores the theme of colonialism, a prevalent issue during the time of its publication in the 18th century. Crusoe's arrival on the island mirrors the European exploration and expansion during the age of colonization. Defoe portrays Crusoe as a representative of European imperialism, as he claims ownership of the island and exercises his dominance over the land and its inhabitants. Through his encounters with the native cannibals, Crusoe grapples with the ethical implications of colonialism and his role in the subjugation of others. Defoe's portrayal of Crusoe's internal conflict invites readers to question the morality of colonization and its impact on indigenous cultures. The Theme of Religion: Religious undertones are woven throughout the narrative of Robinson Crusoe, reflecting the prevailing religious beliefs of the time. Crusoe experiences a spiritual awakening during his solitude on the island and attributes his deliverance to divine intervention. Defoe presents Crusoe's religious conversion as a significant turning point in his character development, shaping his newfound sense of purpose and determination. Through Crusoe's devotion to his faith, Defoe explores the theme of providence, emphasizing the belief in God's guidance and protection. Defoe's Narrative Devices: Defoe's use of narrative devices enhances the realism and authenticity of Robinson Crusoe. First-person narration allows readers to intimately connect with Crusoe's experiences and emotions, immersing them in his solitary existence on the island. The incorporation of travelogues and journal entries further adds to the novel's verisimilitude, presenting Crusoe's story as a firsthand account. Defoe's attention to detail, such as describing Crusoe's daily routines and the practicalities of survival, lends credibility to the narrative. The inclusion of maps and diagrams also contributes to the immersive reading experience, enhancing the readers' visual understanding of Crusoe's journey. Conclusion: In conclusion, Robinson Crusoe showcases the thematic richness and skilled narrative techniques employed by Daniel Defoe. Through the exploration of survival, colonialism, and religion, the novel prompts readers to reflect upon the complexities of human nature and society. Defoe's evocative descriptions, authentic storytelling, and realistic narrative devices ensure that Robinson Crusoe remains a timeless masterpiece of British literature."},{"instruction":"党的全面领导工作机制调研报告建设方案","output":"一、背景分析 党的全面领导工作机制是党在治国理政中的核心制度安排，是党的领导体系和治理体系的重要组成部分。完善党的全面领导工作机制，能够有效提升党的执政能力和水平，推动党的事业发展。 二、问题分析 1. 党的全面领导工作机制需要进一步完善和优化，以适应形势发展和任务变化的需要。 2. 党的全面领导工作机制存在一些制度和实际问题，如权责不明、监督不到位等。 3. 党的全面领导工作机制在一些地方和部门中实施不够到位，存在执行不力的问题。 三、建设目标 1. 建立健全党的全面领导工作机制，使其成为党治国理政的有效工具。 2. 提升党的领导水平和效能，增强党对全社会的凝聚力和号召力。 3. 保证党的全面领导在各级党组织和党员领导干部中得到有效贯彻和执行。 四、建设内容 1. 完善党的全面领导工作机制的制度设计，明确权责、分工协作、衔接协调等事项。 2. 加强对党的全面领导工作机制的监督和评估，确保其贯彻执行和有效运行。 3. 加强党员领导干部队伍的建设和培训，提高其全面领导工作的能力和素质。 4. 加强党的全面领导工作机制在地方和部门中的落实，确保其有效运行和执行。 五、实施路径 1. 组织开展党的全面领导工作机制的调研和专题研讨，明确存在的问题和改进的措施。 2. 成立专门工作组或机构，负责党的全面领导工作机制的建设和推进工作。 3. 制定党的全面领导工作机制的改革方案，明确改革任务和时间表。 4. 加强党的交流和学习，借鉴国内外优秀的党的全面领导工作机制经验。 5. 加强对党的全面领导工作机制实施效果的监测和评估，及时进行调整和优化。 六、推进措施 1. 加强组织领导，形成推进党的全面领导工作机制建设的合力。 2. 加强党员培训，提升党员领导干部的全面领导能力和素质。 3. 加强制度建设，完善党的全面领导工作机制的各项制度。 4. 加强信息化建设，推动党的全面领导工作机制的信息化和智能化。 5. 加强督导和考核，确保党的全面领导工作机制的有效执行和落实。 七、预期效果 1. 党的全面领导工作机制的调研报告与建设方案能够推动党的全面领导工作机制的改革和提升。 2. 党的全面领导工作机制的完善和优化，能够有效提升党的执政能力和水平。 3. 党的全面领导工作机制的实施和执行能够得到有效保障和落实。 4. 党的全面领导工作机制的建设能够在各级党组织和党员领导干部中得到广泛认同和支持。 5. 党的全面领导工作机制的改革和提升能够推动党的事业发展和社会进步。 【备注】以上建议仅供参考，具体实施方案需要根据实际情况进行调整。"},{"instruction":"como hago para que el sistema no consuma tanto internet en windows? me esta gastando todo el saldo del telefono","output":"Aquí hay algunas formas de reducir el consumo de internet en Windows y evitar que agote todo el saldo de tu teléfono: 1.

What would be the new selling price if John wanted to increase profit percentage points by 25%? Revisit Later Select an option 300 225 275 250","output":"Let's denote the cost of the painting as C and the profit as P. According to the problem statement, the profit percentage is equal to the cost of the painting. The profit percentage is given by the formula: Profit Percentage = (Profit / Cost) * 100 Since the profit percentage is equal to the cost, we have: C = (P / C) * 100 From the statement \\"John sold a painting for 200,\\" we know that the selling price (SP) is the sum of the cost and the profit: SP = C + P 200 = C + P Now we can substitute P with C in the above equation, as the profit percentage is equal to the cost, so P = C (from the equation C = (P / C) * 100): 200 = C + C 200 = 2C Now we solve for C: C = 200 / 2 C = 100 So the cost of the painting is 100, and since the profit is the same as the cost, the profit is also 100. John's current profit percentage is 100%. If John wants to increase his profit percentage by 25 percentage points (not percent), his new profit percentage would be 100% + 25% = 125%. Now let's find out what the new profit amount would need to be to achieve a 125% profit percentage: 125% of the cost (C) is: New Profit (NP) = 1.25 * C NP = 1.25 * 100 NP = 125 Now, to calculate the new selling price (NSP), we add this new profit to the cost: NSP = C + NP NSP = 100 + 125 NSP = 225 Therefore, if John wanted to increase his profit percentage by 25 percentage points, the new selling price would be 225."},{"instruction":"Hi","output":"Hello!

In the context of the Pokémon world, squeezing a Chikorita wouldn't produce oil as Pokémon aren't used in such a way.

What would be the new selling price if John wanted to increase profit percentage points by 25%? Revisit Later Select an option 300 225 275 250","output":"Let's denote the cost price of the painting as C and the profit as P. According to the problem, the profit percentage is equal to the cost of the painting, which can be written as: ( frac{P}{C} times 100 = C ) Now we know the selling price (S) is the sum of the cost price and profit, which means: ( S = C + P ) Given that John sold the painting for 200, we have: ( 200 = C + P ) Now, we need to find the value of C using the first equation: ( frac{P}{C} times 100 = C ) ( P = frac{C^2}{100} ) We can plug this into the selling price equation: ( 200 = C + frac{C^2}{100} ) Multiplying every term by 100 to get rid of the denominator, we have: ( 20000 = 100C + C^2 ) This is a quadratic equation: ( C^2 + 100C - 20000 = 0 ) We can solve for C using the quadratic formula: ( C = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} ) Where a = 1, b = 100, c = -20000. ( C = frac{-100 pm sqrt{100^2 - 4(1)(-20000)}}{2(1)} ) ( C = frac{-100 pm sqrt{10000 + 80000}}{2} ) ( C = frac{-100 pm sqrt{90000}}{2} ) ( C = frac{-100 pm 300}{2} ) Since the cost cannot be negative, we take the positive root: ( C = frac{200}{2} ) ( C = 100 ) Now we know the cost price is 100, and hence the profit was 100 as well (since S = 200 and S = C + P). If John wishes to increase the profit percentage points by 25, the new profit percentage points will be the old cost price plus 25, which is: ( 100% + 25% = 125% ) This means that the new profit is 125% of the cost price: ( New Profit = frac{125}{100} times C ) ( New Profit = 1.25 times 100 ) ( New Profit = 125 ) The new selling price would then be the cost price plus the new profit: ( New Selling Price = C + New Profit ) ( New Selling Price = 100 + 125 ) ( New Selling Price = 225 ) So the new selling price would be 225."},{"instruction":"以格局为主题写一篇700字议论文","output":"格局是指一个事物的结构和整体的布局，体现了组织的层次和关系。在日常生活和各个领域中，格局都扮演着重要的角色。一个好的格局可以带来秩序和效率，而一个糟糕的格局则可能导致混乱和低效。因此，我们应该重视格局，努力塑造一个合理、有序的格局。 首先，一个好的格局可以提高工作和学习的效率。在工作场所，一个合理的办公室布局可以提高员工之间的沟通和协作，减少信息传递的时间和成本。而在学习环境中，一个良好的布局可以提供一个舒适的学习环境和合理的储物空间，促进学生的学术成长和发展。因此，在设计工作和学习场所时，我们应该注重格局的规划，以提高效率和效果。 此外，一个好的格局也可以改善社会的秩序和和谐。在城市规划中，合理的道路和交通布局可以减少拥堵和交通事故的发生，提高公共交通的效率，并为居民提供更好的交通条件。而在社区规划中，合理的公共设施和社区布局可以促进居民之间的交流和互动，建立一个相互依赖和和谐共处的社区。因此，社会的发展和进步离不开一个好的格局规划。 此外，在个人的成长和发展中，一个良好的格局也起着至关重要的作用。一个合理的生活方式和时间安排可以帮助我们更好地管理时间和资源，提高效率和生活质量。而在人际关系中，一个良好的人际网络和社交圈可以为我们提供更多的机会和资源，扩大人脉，并促进个人的成长和进步。因此，我们每个人都应该有意识地打造一个合理、有序的个人格局，为自己的成长和发展创造条件。 然而，一个好的格局不是一蹴而就的，需要我们付出持续的努力和不断的改进。为了打造一个好的格局，我们应该注重规划和设计，避免随意安排和不合理的布局。同时，我们也需要不断地反思和调整，适应实际情况的变化和发展。只有不断地改进和提升，我们才能打造一个更加合理、有序的格局。 综上所述，格局是一个事物的组织结构和整体布局，对于我们的生活和工作都起着重要的作用。一个好的格局可以提高效率和效果，改善社会的秩序和和谐，促进个人的成长和发展。因此，我们应该重视格局，努力塑造一个合理、有序的格局，为我们的生活和社会的发展创造良好的条件。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Select an option 75 days 4 days 5 days 8 days","output":"First, let's find the rate at which men, women, and children work. We are told that 10 men can finish the task in 4 days. So, the work rate for men is: Work (for men) = 1 task/4 days. Thus, one man's work rate is: 1 man = (1 task/4 days) / 10 men = 1 task / (4 * 10) days = 1/40 tasks per day. Next, we are told 12 women can finish the task in 10 days. So, the work rate for women is: Work (for women) = 1 task/10 days. Thus, one woman's work rate is: 1 woman = (1 task/10 days) / 12 women = 1/120 tasks per day. We also know that 20 children can finish the task in 15 days. So, the work rate for children is: Work (for children) = 1 task/15 days. Thus, one child's work rate is: 1 child = (1 task/15 days) / 20 children = 1/300 tasks per day. Now we need to find out the combined work rate for 4 men, 8 women, and 10 children working together. For 4 men: 4 men = 4 * (1/40) = 1/10 tasks per day. For 8 women: 8 women = 8 * (1/120) = 1/15 tasks per day. For 10 children: 10 children = 10 * (1/300) = 1/30 tasks per day. Add up these work rates to get the total work rate: Total work rate = (1/10) + (1/15) + (1/30) = (3/30) + (2/30) + (1/30) = 6/30 = 1/5 tasks per day. This means that 4 men, 8 women, and 10 children can complete 1/5 of the task in one day.

Among these, lateral flow assays (LFAs) have gained immense popularity due to their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of use, particularly in resource-limited settings. However, as the field of antigen detection continues to evolve, it becomes crucial to assess the performance and limitations of LFAs compared to more quantitative antigen testing methodologies. This review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the literature on lateral flow assay antigen detection in comparison to established quantitative antigen testing assays, such as Lumipulse and Elecsys assays, using the widely-used scientific database, PubMed. The potential use of LFAs in various diagnostic applications has resulted in a remarkable increase in research exploring their performance characteristics, sensitivity, specificity, and overall accuracy. PubMed, a widely recognized and extensively utilized database of scientific literature, serves as an indispensable resource for identifying relevant studies in the field. By searching PubMed, we aim to synthesize the available evidence surrounding LFA antigen detection and compare it to quantitative methods, specifically focusing on the performance of Lumipulse and Elecsys assays. Lumipulse and Elecsys assays are examples of quantitative antigen testing platforms, which employ advanced technologies, including chemiluminescent immunoassays, to provide quantitative results with high accuracy. These assays often find utility in clinical laboratories and research settings, where precise and quantitative measurements are essential for diagnostic decisions and therapeutic monitoring. However, their reliance on dedicated laboratory infrastructure and skilled personnel may restrict their widespread utilization, particularly in resource-limited or decentralized settings. In contrast, LFAs offer the advantages of rapid and user-friendly point-of-care testing, which have played a crucial role in the detection and containment of various infectious diseases, including viral and bacterial infections. These assays typically involve the visualization of antigen-antibody interactions through the appearance of colored bands, which can be interpreted without the need for specialized equipment. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised regarding the sensitivity, specificity, and limited quantification capabilities of LFAs compared to the quantitative techniques like Lumipulse and Elecsys assays. By conducting a thorough search on PubMed, we aim to explore the available literature to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of lateral flow assay antigen detection in comparison to quantitative antigen testing using Lumipulse and Elecsys assays. This review will contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the current state of antigen detection methodologies and aid in informing decision-making regarding their appropriate selection and implementation in various diagnostic scenarios."},{"instruction":"请用FAB法分析介绍朱迪斯.汉弗莱写的《即兴演讲》这本书的特征、优势和利益。","output":"FAB法是指Feature（特征）、Advantage（优势）和Benefit（利益）的缩写，可以帮助分析和介绍一本书的特点、优势和读者的受益点。下面是对朱迪斯·汉弗莱所写的《即兴演讲》这本书运用FAB法的分析： 特征： 1. 作者：朱迪斯·汉弗莱是一位经验丰富的即兴演讲专家和教练，为读者提供了可靠的指导和建议。 2. 主题：《即兴演讲》是一本关于如何在现场演讲时自如地应对即兴情况的实用指南。 3. 内容：书中包含了各种即兴演讲技巧、技巧和策略的详细解释和示范，以及实际演讲案例的分析。 优势： 1. 实用性：朱迪斯·汉弗莱在书中提供了大量的技巧和策略，读者可以通过学习和实践来改善自己的即兴演讲技巧，从而在各种场合中获得更好的反馈和表现。 2. 全面性：书中涵盖了广泛的即兴演讲技巧，包括提高思维敏捷性、处理紧急情况、应对意外问题等方面的技能，读者可以全面掌握面对各种挑战的方法和技巧。 3. 实例分析：朱迪斯·汉弗莱通过分析实际演讲案例，提供了针对不同情境下的即兴演讲的实际策略和建议，使读者能够更好地理解和应用所学内容。 利益： 1. 提升职业能力：通过学习《即兴演讲》这本书，读者可以获得提高自己的即兴演讲技巧的方法和策略，从而在职业生涯中获得更多成功和机会。 2. 提高自信心：掌握了即兴演讲的技巧和策略，读者可以更自信地应对各种演讲场合，无论是在工作中还是社交活动中，都能更好地表达自己的想法和观点。 3. 提升影响力：通过熟练掌握即兴演讲的技巧，读者能够更好地传达信息、引起他人的共鸣和影响他人的观点，从而在与他人交流和沟通中取得更大的效果和影响力。 总之，《即兴演讲》这本书通过其作者朱迪斯·汉弗莱的专业知识和经验，为读者提供了一系列实用的技巧和策略，帮助读者成为更出色的即兴演讲者。通过阅读这本书，读者可以提升自己的职业能力，增加自信心，并提高自己的影响力。"},{"instruction":"假设你是推销人员，你会如何运用FAB法介绍朱迪斯.汉弗莱写的《即兴演讲》这本书。","output":"作为一位推销人员，我会运用FAB法向潜在客户介绍朱迪斯·汉弗莱所写的《即兴演讲》这本书，让他们了解这本书的特点、优势和受益点。以下是一个例子： 特征： 这本书是朱迪斯·汉弗莱的作品，她是一位经验丰富的即兴演讲专家和教练。她将她多年的专业知识和经验结合在一起，帮助读者掌握即兴演讲的技巧。 优势： 首先，这本书的优势在于它的实用性。朱迪斯·汉弗莱提供了大量的技巧和策略，从思维敏捷性到应对紧急情况，你将学会如何在即兴演讲的过程中从容应对各种挑战。 其次，这本书的全面性也是一个优势。朱迪斯·汉弗莱涵盖了各种即兴演讲技巧，包括如何处理意外问题和应对紧急情况等等。无论你在什么场合做即兴演讲，这本书都会为你提供全面的指导。 最后，这本书利用实际案例进行分析，使你能够更好地理解和应用所学内容。通过朱迪斯·汉弗莱对实际演讲案例的分析，你将能够更快地掌握技巧并应用于实践中。 利益： 学习这本书会给你带来很多利益。首先，你将提升你的职业能力。无论是在工作中还是在社交活动中，即兴演讲都是一项重要的技能。通过学习这本书，你将能够在职业生涯中获得更多的成功和机会。 其次，学习并掌握即兴演讲的技能会帮助你提高自信心。你将能够更自信地应对各种演讲场合，无论是在会议上还是在团队中表达你的观点和想法。 最后，学习即兴演讲将提升你的影响力。通过运用这些技巧和策略，你能够更好地传达信息，引起他人的共鸣，并在与他人的交流中获得更大的影响力。 所以，我强烈推荐你阅读朱迪斯·汉弗莱写的《即兴演讲》这本书。它将帮助你成为一个出色的即兴演讲者，并提升你在职业和社交领域的能力和影响力。"},{"instruction":"假设你是一名教练，你会如何设计关于应用 抓手，要点，论点/论据，呼吁行动这4个步骤的应用场景","output":"作为一名教练，我会设计一个关于应用抓手、要点、论点/论据和呼吁行动这4个步骤的应用场景。这个场景可以是一个训练班、研讨会或演讲活动。以下是一个具体的案例： 场景：训练班 - 学习销售技巧 1. 抓手（Grabber）： 在训练班开始时，我会分享一个引人入胜的情境故事，描述一个销售人员利用他的销售技巧成功地促成一笔大单。这个故事将吸引学员的注意力，激发他们的兴趣和好奇心，引起他们对销售技巧的关注。 2. 要点（Key Points）： 接下来，我会介绍一些关于销售技巧的关键要点。我会解释什么是有效的沟通和演示技巧，如何建立良好的人际关系和信任，以及如何识别和满足客户的需求。这些要点将帮助学员了解销售技巧的重要性和应用方法。 3. 论点/论据（Arguments/Evidence）： 为了支持这些要点，我会提供各种实际案例和研究数据，证明这些销售技巧是成功的关键因素。我会分享成功销售人员的经验故事，以及市场调研和数据分析的结果，展示有效销售技巧对于提高销售业绩的重要性。 4. 呼吁行动（Call to Action）： 最后，我会呼吁学员将所学的销售技巧应用到他们的工作中，并设定明确的行动计划。我会鼓励他们在训练班后立即开始实践，并提供支持、反馈和指导，帮助他们在实际工作中逐步提升销售能力。 通过设计这样一个应用场景，学员将被吸引并感兴趣，他们将学习到具体的销售技巧和策略，并得到了实证的案例和数据支持。最终，他们将被鼓励采取行动，并得到支持和指导，以确保他们能够成功应用所学的销售技巧到实际工作中。"},{"instruction":"假设你是一名老师，你会如何设计关于 抓手，要点，论点/论据，呼吁行动这4个步骤的应用场景","output":"作为一名老师，我会设计一个关于抓手、要点、论点/论据和呼吁行动这4个步骤的应用场景。这个场景可以是一堂语文课，教授学生写作技巧。以下是一个具体的案例： 场景: 语文课 - 教授学生写作技巧 1. 抓手（Grabber）: 在课堂开始时，我会给学生呈现一幅引人入胜的图片或提出一个具有争议性的问题，引起学生的兴趣和好奇心。例如，我会展示一幅美丽的风景图片，或者提出一个有关社会问题的引人思考的问题。这个抓手将激发学生思考和参与课堂讨论的积极性。 2. 要点（Key Points）: 接下来，我会介绍写作的关键要点。我会讲解如何构思、组织和表达一个清晰的观点，如何使用恰当的词汇和句型，以及如何运用修辞手法和文学技巧来增强文章的吸引力和表达力。这些要点将帮助学生理解写作的重要性和技巧。 3. 论点/论据（Arguments/Evidence）: 为了支持这些要点，我会提供各种实际的写作例子和文学作品，作为论据。我会分享名人的演讲或优秀作家的文章，展示他们如何运用写作技巧有效地传达和表达观点。我还会引用研究和调查数据，证明优秀的写作能力与学业成绩和职业成功之间的关联性。 4. 呼吁行动（Call to Action）: 最后，我会呼吁学生在课后进行写作练习，并给予他们具体的指导和反馈。我会鼓励他们运用所学的写作技巧，并鼓励他们分享和展示自己的作品，以便能够得到更多的实践和反馈。我还会提供写作比赛或展览的机会，激励学生在写作上取得更高的成就。 通过设计这样一个应用场景，学生将被吸引并参与到课堂中，他们将学习到具体的写作技巧和策略，并得到了实例和数据的支持。最终，他们将被鼓励进行实践，并得到指导和奖励，以确保他们能够在写作中取得进步并展示出自己的才华。"},{"instruction":"不需要应用这4个步骤，设计一个详细应用的场景就行","output":"抱歉对此有所误解，以下是一个详细的应用场景，不涉及抓手、要点、论点/论据和呼吁行动这4个步骤。 场景：中学历史课 - 教授学生研究和分析历史事件 在中学历史课上，我会设计一个应用场景，让学生能够主动参与并深入研究历史事件。 1. 主题选择： 首先，我会让学生从历史事件中选择一个他们感兴趣的主题，比如二战中的某一战役或一个重要的历史人物。他们可以自由选择自己喜欢的主题，这样能够激发他们对研究该主题的兴趣。 2. 资料搜集： 在他们选择主题后，我会要求学生搜集相关的资料，包括书籍、文章、影片、图片和互联网资源。他们需要从不同的来源获取信息，以便获得全面的了解和视角。 3. 数据整理： 学生需要对收集到的资料进行整理和分析，提取出关键的事件、人物和背景信息。他们可以使用图表、表格、图像和笔记等工具，以便更好地组织和呈现所收集到的数据。 4. 研究报告： 基于整理的数据和分析，学生需要撰写一份研究报告，详细介绍他们选择的历史主题，包括事件的背景、起因、过程和影响。他们需要运用逻辑和推理，以支持他们的观点和提供相关证据。 5. 学生展示： 最后，学生将有机会分享他们的研究报告和分析结果。他们可以通过口头报告、海报展示、小组讨论或者制作短视频等形式展示他们对历史事件的理解和分析。这样做可以提高他们的口头表达能力和团队合作技巧。 通过这个详细的应用场景，学生将有机会深入研究历史事件，并通过整理、分析和呈现信息的过"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The invisible battles waged within the bodies of those with conditions like rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and multiple sclerosis, to name a few, can cause immense suffering and a profound impact on the quality of life. The confluence of genetics, environment, and lifestyle factors have made autoimmunity an area of both concern and intense study. **Understanding Autoimmune Diseases** Autoimmune diseases arise from an overactive immune response of the body against substances and tissues normally present in the body. Essentially, the body mistakes its own cells for foreign invaders and attacks them, resulting in a myriad of health issues. The diversity of symptoms and the complex nature of these disorders have long made treatment a challenge. Yet, hope resides in the growing understanding that diet and lifestyle can profoundly influence the course of these conditions. **The Principles of the Autoimmune Protocol (AIP)** The Autoimmune Protocol, or AIP, is a diet and lifestyle program aimed at healing the immune system and gut mucosa. It is an extension of the Paleolithic diet, but with an even greater emphasis on nutrient-rich foods and the avoidance of potential food allergens or substances known to stimulate the immune system or harm gut health. By reducing inflammation and healing gut dysfunction, the AIP diet can help mitigate the symptoms of autoimmune disorders. But the AIP is more than just a list of foods to eat or avoid; it represents a new way of thinking about food and its relationship to our bodies. It's an approach that acknowledges and harnesses the power of nutrition to aid in healing and establish a new equilibrium. The AIP diet is also inherently personalized; what works for one individual may need adjustment for another. In this book, \\"The AIP Solution: Personalized Meal Planning for Autoimmune Wellness,\\" you'll discover not just the biology of autoimmunity and the science of nutrition that underpins the AIP diet, but also the practical steps you can take to incorporate this approach into your life. Whether you're dealing with severe symptoms or are looking to optimize your overall health, this book will offer a blueprint tailored to your situation. The following pages will unlock the tools to reclaim control over your body and wellness. They will guide you through the initial stages of dietary changes, the refinement of your personal AIP plan, AIP cooking and meal preparation, and the integration of lifestyle adjustments to support your journey toward improved health. Here is where your story changes. Here is where you find empowerment in each meal and each choice. \\"The AIP Solution\\" is not just about changing what's on your plate; it's about changing your life for the better.

Here are the foundational principles that guide the AIP approach: - **Nutrient Density:** The AIP emphasizes the consumption of nutrient-dense foods that are rich in vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and essential fatty acids. These nutrients are crucial for optimizing immune function and repairing bodily tissues. - **Gut Health Focus:** A pivotal aspect of the AIP is to support gut health. Healing a compromised gut barrier ('leaky gut') is considered foundational since it may reduce the immune system's exposure to triggering substances. - **Immune System Regulation:** By removing foods and lifestyle factors that are known to provoke the immune system, the AIP aims to downregulate the immune response. This can help mitigate the self-attack that characterizes autoimmune conditions. - **Food Elimination and Reintroduction:** The AIP begins with an elimination phase, cutting out potential dietary triggers such as gluten, grains, legumes, dairy, nuts, seeds, nightshades, and others. After a period of healing, there is a structured reintroduction phase to identify which, if any, foods can be tolerated. - **Anti-Inflammatory Support:** Foods chosen for the AIP are high in anti-inflammatory properties, supporting the body's healing process and reducing autoimmune flare-ups. - **Lifestyle Considerations:** The AIP is not just about diet—it also encompasses lifestyle factors such as stress management, sufficient sleep, moderate exercise, and connections with community and nature, which are all integral to the healing process. - **Personalized Approach:** A vital part of the AIP is the recognition that every person is unique. The diet and lifestyle plan is meant to be tailored to the individual's specific health status, responses to food, and overall lifestyle needs. - **Evolutionary Perspective:** The AIP is rooted in the hypothesis that eating more in line with how our ancestors ate can help reduce the modern burden of chronic diseases, though it is adjusted to address the specific needs of those with autoimmune conditions. - **Scientific Backing & Anecdotal Evidence:** We will discuss the research that supports the principles of the AIP as well as the anecdotal evidence from many who have seen improvements in their autoimmune symptoms while following the protocol. - **Holistic Healing Journey:** The AIP is considered part of a holistic approach to healing, which means it should ideally be integrated into a comprehensive plan that includes medical treatment and monitoring. In this chapter, we'll further break down each of these principles, providing readers with a deeper understanding of the rationale behind AIP's recommendations. The goal is to empower individuals with the knowledge they need to embark on the AIP with clarity and confidence, aware of both the challenges and the potential for life-changing benefits.

Its primary duty is to distinguish between self and non-self, protecting the integrity of the body by identifying and eliminating potentially harmful invaders like bacteria, viruses, and parasites—a process known as the immune response. Meanwhile, the system must also recognize and preserve the body’s own cells and tissues, a concept recognized as self-tolerance. To appreciate this complex dance, one must understand how the immune system operates: **Defense Against Pathogens** - **Surveillance and Recognition:** The immune system continuously monitors the body for signs of foreign invaders. Using specialized cells and receptors, it can discern between familiar (self) components and unfamiliar (non-self) entities. - **Response and Elimination:** Once an invader is detected, the immune system launches an attack. This involves a range of cells, including macrophages that devour pathogens and T-cells which can kill infected cells. Antibodies are also produced by B-cells, binding to antigens – the unique molecules on pathogens – to neutralize or mark them for destruction. **Maintaining Self-Tolerance** - **Central and Peripheral Tolerance:** The body's mechanisms to prevent an immune attack on itself are established during the development of immune cells (central tolerance) and continue throughout life (peripheral tolerance). These mechanisms ensure that immune cells which might react against the body’s tissues are removed or inactivated. - **Regulatory Cells:** Regulatory T-cells (Tregs) play a pivotal role in maintaining tolerance. They suppress immune responses that could become too strong and damage the body's own tissues, thus acting as guardians against autoimmunity. **Breakdown of Self-Tolerance** - Despite these safeguards, sometimes the immune system can become misguided. Mistakes in self/non-self recognition can lead to autoimmunity, where the body's own tissues are mistaken for harmful invaders and attacked, leading to a range of autoimmune diseases. This finely tuned balance between defense and self-tolerance is what keeps us healthy. The immune system has evolved to defend us from countless external threats, while exercising restraint to prevent harm to our own cells. Understanding this balance is crucial, as it provides the basis for approaches like the AIP diet aimed at restoring and maintaining this equilibrium when it comes to autoimmunity.

Self-tolerance is a critical concept that refers to the immune system's ability to recognize and coexist with the body’s own cells. But what happens when this system of recognition and tolerance fails? **The Breakdown of Self-Tolerance** - **Immune Confusion:** In some cases, the immune system can become confused and improperly label 'self' cells as 'non-self.' This can occur due to genetic predisposition, environmental factors, or both. It can also stem from issues such as molecular mimicry—where foreign antigens resemble the body's own molecules closely enough to provoke an immune response against both. - **The Initiation of Autoimmune Reactions:** When self-tolerance breaks down, immune cells, such as auto-reactive T-cells that were not properly inactivated or eliminated, may start attacking the body's own tissues. This response can lead to chronic inflammation and tissue damage characteristic of autoimmune diseases. **Consequences of Self-Attack** - **Chronic Inflammation:** Autoimmune reactions often result in continuous inflammation as the immune system relentlessly targets self-tissues. This inflammation can cause a range of symptoms and contribute to the progressive damage of organs and tissues over time. - **Tissue and Organ Damage:** The immune system's ability to destroy and remodel tissues is a central part of its defense arsenal. But when turned against the body's own cells, this capability can lead to dysfunction and destruction of organs, as seen in diseases like type 1 diabetes (pancreas), rheumatoid arthritis (joints), and multiple sclerosis (nerve insulation). **Factors Contributing to Breakdown** - **Genetic Susceptibility:** Certain genes can predispose an individual to develop autoimmune diseases. These genes can affect immune system regulation, making the breakdown of self-tolerance more likely. - **Environmental Triggers:** Infections, stress, and exposure to certain chemicals or dietary components can act as catalysts that disrupt self-tolerance, either initiating or exacerbating autoimmune reactions. Understanding the delicate process of self-tolerance and the factors that can contribute to its failure is a cornerstone in the management and treatment of autoimmune diseases. The AIP diet is one approach that aims to minimize potential dietary triggers, support gut health, and reduce inflammation to help restore immune balance.

These substances play a central role in the development and perpetuation of autoimmune conditions. Understanding autoantigens is key to grasping why the immune system, which is designed to protect us, can sometimes turn against us. **What Are Autoantigens?** - **Self-Proteins as Targets:** Autoantigens are typically proteins or protein complexes that naturally exist within our bodies. They are 'self' substances that, under normal circumstances, should not elicit an immune response. - **Erroneous Identification:** When the immune system malfunctions, these autoantigens are mistakenly identified as threats, like pathogens. This misidentification leads to the launch of an immune response against the body's own cells that contain these substances. **Recognition Gone Wrong** - **Immune Response to Self:** The immune system uses a vast array of receptors to recognize proteins, including those on the surface of cells. If a self-protein is erroneously classified as dangerous, immune cells will target it for removal or destruction. - **Autoantibody Production:** B-cells can produce antibodies against these autoantigens called autoantibodies. This condition results in a state of autoimmunity where the body's normal protective actions result in self-damage. **Contribution to Autoimmune Diseases** - **Specificity to Conditions:** Autoantigens are often associated with specific autoimmune diseases. For instance, the presence of certain autoantibodies can be indicative of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, where antibodies against joint tissue are developed, or type 1 diabetes, where antibodies attack insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. **Autoantigens and Disease Progression** - **Amplifying the Immune Assault:** Autoimmune reactions can create a vicious cycle, as the destruction of tissues by the immune system releases more autoantigens, leading to further immune activation. - **Challenges in Treatment:** Effective management and treatment of autoimmune disorders are complicated by the fact that one cannot simply eliminate autoantigens as they are natural components of the body. Instead, approaches like the AIP diet focus on modulating the immune response and reducing inflammation to mitigate autoimmunity’s harmful effects. By delving into the role of autoantigens in autoimmune disease, we open the door to a better understanding of the intricate relationship between what we consume, our immune function, and our overall health.

Serving as the interface between the outside world and the internal milieu, the gut barrier is on the frontlines of our bodily protection. The gut barrier's primary role is to ensure that vital nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream while keeping out pathogens, toxins, and undigested food particles. Its strategic layers, including a lining of epithelial cells and a sticky mucosal layer teeming with beneficial microbes, build a fortress that's selective yet permeable. **The Gatekeeper: Epithelial Layer** - The gut's epithelial cells are tightly bound by structures called tight junctions, which regulate what passes through the barrier. - Within and beneath this cellular layer lives the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), an extensive network of immune cells ready to defend against invaders. **Protective Forces: Mucus and Microbiota** - A mucus layer safeguards the epithelium from mechanical damage and chemical irritants. This mucus also houses components of the microbiota that play defense roles. - The gut microbiota, with its array of beneficial bacteria, acts as an immune regulator, educating immune cells and competing with potential pathogens for space and resources. **Challenges to the Gut Barrier** - When the gut barrier is compromised, a condition known as increased intestinal permeability or \\"leaky gut\\" occurs, which can lead to translocation of substances that trigger immune responses elsewhere in the body. - Factors such as chronic stress, infections, a diet high in processed foods, and the presence of certain medications can all threaten the integrity of the gut barrier. **Implications for Autoimmunity** - A compromised gut barrier allows antigens that would normally be contained to encounter the immune system, potentially resulting in sensitization and an inappropriate immune response. - Chronic exposure to unwelcome antigens due to a leaky gut may contribute to the development or exacerbation of autoimmune diseases as the body tries to defend against these perceived threats.

Balancing spirituality with other aspects of life and 3. Embracing lifelong learning and growth on the spiritual journey. Do not copy paste similar content in the internet. Rephrase and paraphrase to make it original.","output":"Chapter 5: Sustaining Spiritual Nourishment in the Modern World Section 1: Creating a Personalized Spiritual Practice in a Busy, Modern Lifestyle In the fast-paced and demanding world we live in, finding time for spiritual nourishment can often feel like an insurmountable challenge. However, it is within this very struggle that our true spiritual growth lies. Creating a personalized spiritual practice that aligns with our individual needs and values is crucial in maintaining a connection to the divine amidst the chaos of daily life. To begin, it is important to carve out sacred space and time for spiritual practice. This doesn't mean we need hours of free time each day; a few minutes dedicated solely to connecting with our inner selves can yield profound results. Whether it's during a morning walk, a few minutes of meditation, or journaling before bed, finding a consistent and personal ritual allows us to anchor ourselves and cultivate spiritual nourishment. Modern technology can be both a blessing and a curse in our quest for spiritual nourishment. With constant distractions and the ever-present allure of social media, it is vital to create boundaries and establish a healthy relationship with technology. Implementing digital detoxes, limiting screen time, and designating device-free zones can help create a sacred space. By embracing simplicity, we create room for spirituality to flourish in our daily lives. Section 2: Balancing Spirituality with Other Aspects of Life Maintaining a harmonious balance between spirituality and the various facets of our lives is undoubtedly challenging. However, it is essential to recognize that spirituality does not exist in isolation; rather, it permeates every aspect of our being. By integrating spirituality into our daily routines and relationships, we can embody our beliefs and live from a place of authenticity. One way to achieve this balance is by infusing spirituality into our work. Whether we find ourselves in a corporate environment or pursuing creative endeavors, perceiving our work as a spiritual practice can transform mundane tasks into meaningful experiences. Recognizing the interconnectedness of all life and the opportunity for growth and service allows us to approach even the most demanding responsibilities with intention and devotion. Another vital aspect of balancing spirituality is nurturing our relationships. Deepening connections with loved ones and engaging in compassionate dialogue fosters spiritual growth and supports our overall well-being. Cultivating empathy, active listening, and practicing forgiveness and gratitude allows our spiritual journey to flourish within the context of our relationships. Section 3: Embracing Lifelong Learning and Growth on the Spiritual Journey The pursuit of spiritual nourishment is an ever-evolving journey, with growth and learning serving as constant companions. Embracing a mindset of lifelong learning not only expands our spiritual understanding but also fuels our personal and intellectual growth. Reading spiritual texts, exploring various religious or philosophical traditions, and seeking out wise mentors are powerful vehicles for expanding our spiritual horizons. By engaging in continuous learning, we open ourselves up to different perspectives, fostering a deeper understanding of our own beliefs while uncovering new spiritual insights. Additionally, embarking on challenging spiritual practices facilitates growth and transformation. Stepping outside our comfort zones, whether through practices like meditation or participating in spiritual retreats, helps us confront our fears and limitations, allowing us to transcend them. Embracing the unknown and surrendering to the process of growth nurtures spiritual nourishment, propelling us closer to our authentic selves. Lastly, embracing the interconnectedness of all beings and our role in the greater cosmic balance is fundamental for sustaining spiritual nourishment. Recognizing that our actions have far-reaching consequences and striving to live in harmony with the Earth and all sentient beings deepens our spiritual connection. Conserving nature, practicing mindfulness, and reducing our environmental impact are tangible ways to embody this connection and sustain the spiritual nourishment we seek. Conclusion: In a world dominated by busyness and distraction, sustaining spiritual nourishment can be a complex endeavor. However, by intentionally creating a personalized spiritual practice, balancing spirituality with other aspects of life, and embracing lifelong learning and growth, we can navigate the modern world with grace and remain connected to the profound spiritual essence within us. By nurturing our spirituality, we cultivate a reservoir of strength and wisdom that can illuminate our path, giving us the resilience to face any challenges that come our way."},{"instruction":"What are principles and guidelines of media relations","output":"1.

Откройте UiPath Studio и создайте новый проект. Дайте ему имя и сохраните его. 2. В окне проекта перейдите на вкладку \\"Activities\\" (Действия) и найдите активность \\"Input Dialog\\" (Диалог ввода). Перетащите эту активность на рабочую область. 3. Настройте активность \\"Input Dialog\\" (Диалог ввода), чтобы она запрашивала необходимые данные у пользователя. Нажмите на поле \\"Result\\" (Результат) и введите имя переменной, в которую будет сохранено значение, внесенное пользователем. 4. В следующей активности на рабочей области укажите путь к файлу Excel, в котором будет выполняться поиск. Для этого используйте активность \\"Excel Application Scope\\" (Область применения Excel). Введите путь к файлу Excel в поле \\"WorkbookPath\\" (Путь к книге Excel). 5. Внутри активности \\"Excel Application Scope\\" добавьте активность \\"Read Range\\" (Чтение диапазона) для чтения данных из таблицы Excel. Укажите диапазон ячеек таблицы, в которой будет выполнен поиск, и сохраните результат в переменную. 6. Добавьте активность \\"For Each Row\\" (Для каждой строки), чтобы перебирать строки таблицы Excel. 7. Внутри активности \\"For Each Row\\" (Для каждой строки) добавьте условие проверки. Используйте активность \\"If\\" (Если) и указывайте условие, согласно которому будет выполняться поиск. Оно будет зависеть от данных, введенных пользователем в диалоговом окне. Например: Если значение в столбце \\"Имя\\" равно значению, указанному пользователем, то выполнить определенные действия. 8. Добавьте нужные Вам действия внутри условия \\"If\\" (Если) для обработки результатов поиска. Например: выводите найденные данные в диалоговое окно с помощью активности \\"Message Box\\" (Диалоговое окно сообщения). 9. После выполнения операций в диалоговом окне и обработки результатов, сохраните и запустите проект для проверки. Это простой пример, но вы можете настроить более сложные и специфичные операции в зависимости от ваших требований.

Each angle in triangle ABC is 60^circ, and the altitudes are also angle bisectors and medians. 3. **Calculate the sum of specific angles involving the orthocenter H**: - Let H be the orthocenter of triangle ABC. We need to show that H satisfies the condition that angle HAX + angle HBC + angle HCA = 90^circ. 4. **Use properties of altitudes**: - Suppose A_1, B_1, C_1 are the feet of the altitudes from vertices A, B, C respectively. The angles formed by the altitudes and the sides are: [ angle HAX = angle HA_1X, quad angle HBC = angle HB_1C, quad angle HCA = angle HC_1A ] 5. **Establish relationships between angles**: - Given that H lies on the altitudes, we can break down the angles around H: [ angle HAX = frac{180^circ - 90^circ - 60^circ}{2} = 15^circ ] [ angle HBC = 60^circ - angle HBC = 45^circ ] [ angle HCA = 90^circ - (45^circ - 15^circ) = 30^circ ] 6. **Sum of the angles property check**: - Calculating we have: [ angle HAX + angle HBC + angle HCA = 15^circ + 45^circ + 30^circ = 90^circ ] 7. **Conclusion**: - Using these steps, we verify that in a regular triangle ABC, the orthocenter H has the necessary property that the sum of the specified angles is 90^circ. Thus, X must lie on one of the altitudes of triangle ABC. This matches the given property. Therefore, the location of X is exemplified by orthocenter points inside the regular triangle ABC. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Machine A produces 100 parts at a certain speed as Machine B does.

Since Machine A produces 50 parts in 10 minutes, its rate is: Rate of Machine A = Number of parts / Time (in minutes) Rate of Machine A = 50 parts / 10 minutes Rate of Machine A = 5 parts per minute Now we can find the ratio of the speed of Machine A to Machine B: Ratio of speeds = Rate of Machine A / Rate of Machine B Ratio of speeds = 5 parts per minute / 2.5 parts per minute Ratio of speeds = 2/1 or simply 2 Therefore, the ratio of the speed of Machine A to Machine B is boxed{2:1} ."},{"instruction":"Given the inequality about x: left{begin{array}{l}xm＜0 52x≤1end{array}right. has 2 integer solutions.

A swap consists of picking two distinct cards, and then swapping them. After three swaps, the cards form a new fivedigit number n when read from left to right. Compute the expected value of n .","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:** We start with the five-digit number (13579) and perform three swaps. We need to compute the expected value of the new five-digit number (n). 2. **Linearity of Expectation:** By the linearity of expectation, the expected value of (n) can be computed by finding the expected value of each digit independently and then combining them. 3. **Probability of a Digit Remaining in Place:** Let's calculate the probability that a digit remains in its original position after three swaps. For a digit to remain in its original position, it must not be involved in any of the three swaps. The probability that a specific digit is not involved in a single swap is (frac{3}{5}) (since there are 2 out of 5 positions that are swapped, leaving 3 positions untouched). Therefore, the probability that a digit remains in its original position after three swaps is: [ left(frac{3}{5}right)^3 = frac{27}{125} ] 4. **Expected Value of Each Digit:** If a digit does not remain in its original position, it can be any of the other four digits. The expected value of a digit that is swapped is the average of the other four digits. The average of the digits (3, 5, 7, 9) is: [ frac{3 + 5 + 7 + 9}{4} = frac{24}{4} = 6 ] Therefore, the expected value of each digit can be computed as: [ text{Expected value of a digit} = left(frac{27}{125} cdot text{original digit}right) + left(frac{98}{125} cdot 6right) ] 5. **Calculating Expected Values:** - For the first digit (1): [ text{Expected value} = left(frac{27}{125} cdot 1right) + left(frac{98}{125} cdot 6right) = frac{27}{125} + frac{588}{125} = frac{615}{125} = 4.92 ] - For the second digit (3): [ text{Expected value} = left(frac{27}{125} cdot 3right) + left(frac{98}{125} cdot 6right) = frac{81}{125} + frac{588}{125} = frac{669}{125} = 5.352 ] - For the third digit (5): [ text{Expected value} = left(frac{27}{125} cdot 5right) + left(frac{98}{125} cdot 6right) = frac{135}{125} + frac{588}{125} = frac{723}{125} = 5.784 ] - For the fourth digit (7): [ text{Expected value} = left(frac{27}{125} cdot 7right) + left(frac{98}{125} cdot 6right) = frac{189}{125} + frac{588}{125} = frac{777}{125} = 6.216 ] - For the fifth digit (9): [ text{Expected value} = left(frac{27}{125} cdot 9right) + left(frac{98}{125} cdot 6right) = frac{243}{125} + frac{588}{125} = frac{831}{125} = 6.648 ] 6. **Combining the Expected Values:** The expected value of the five-digit number (n) is: [ 10000 cdot 4.92 + 1000 cdot 5.352 + 100 cdot 5.784 + 10 cdot 6.216 + 6.648 ] Calculating this: [ 10000 cdot 4.92 = 49200 ] [ 1000 cdot 5.352 = 5352 ] [ 100 cdot 5.784 = 578.4 ] [ 10 cdot 6.216 = 62.16 ] [ 6.648 ] Summing these values: [ 49200 + 5352 + 578.4 + 62.16 + 6.648 = 55200.208 ] The final answer is (boxed{55200.208})."},{"instruction":"f 70 players on a cricket team , 37 are throwers . the rest of the team is divided so one third are left handed and the rest are right handed . assuming that all throwers are right handed , how many right handed players are there total ?","output":"If there are 70 players on the cricket team and 37 are throwers (who are all right-handed), we need to find out how many of the remaining players are right-handed. First, let's find out how many players are not throwers: Total players - Throwers = Non-throwers 70 - 37 = 33 non-throwers Now, we know that one third of these non-throwers are left-handed. To find out how many are left-handed, we divide the number of non-throwers by 3: Left-handed non-throwers = 33 / 3 = 11 Since the rest of the non-throwers are right-handed, we subtract the left-handed non-throwers from the total non-throwers to find the number of right-handed non-throwers: Right-handed non-throwers = Total non-throwers - Left-handed non-throwers Right-handed non-throwers = 33 - 11 = 22 Now, we add the right-handed non-throwers to the number of throwers (who are also right-handed) to find the total number of right-handed players: Total right-handed players = Throwers + Right-handed non-throwers Total right-handed players = 37 + 22 = 59 So, there are boxed{59} right-handed players in total on the cricket team."},{"instruction":"Compute the value of k such that the equation [frac{x + 3}{kx + 2} = x] has exactly one solution.","output":"First, assume k neq 0.

This action does not involve any choice, so we move on to the next step with 8 dogs left (10 total dogs minus Fluffy and Nipper). 2. **Fill the remaining spots in Fluffy's group**: After placing Fluffy, there are 2 spots left in the 3-dog group. We have 8 dogs to choose from for these spots. The number of ways to select 2 dogs out of 8 is calculated using the combination formula binom{n}{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}, where n is the total number of items, and r is the number of items to choose. Therefore, the number of ways to fill Fluffy's group is binom{8}{2} = frac{8!}{2!(8-2)!} = frac{8 times 7}{2 times 1} = 28 ways. 3. **Fill the remaining spots in Nipper's group**: After filling Fluffy's group, 6 dogs remain for the last 4 spots in Nipper's group. Using the combination formula again, the number of ways to select 4 dogs out of 6 is binom{6}{4} = frac{6!}{4!(6-4)!} = frac{6 times 5}{2 times 1} = 15 ways. 4. **The 2-dog group**: The last 2 dogs automatically go into the 2-dog group. Since there are no choices to be made here, this step does not involve any calculations. 5. **Calculate the total number of possibilities**: To find the total number of ways to form the groups, we multiply the number of ways to fill Fluffy's group by the number of ways to fill Nipper's group. This gives us 28 times 15 = 420.

Since Patrick is 1.5 times the age of Robert, we multiply Robert's current age by 1.5: 27.8 years * 1.5 = 41.7 years Next, we'll find Elizabeth's current age.

Trying out possible digits from 0 to 9: [ begin{align*} 3 cdot 0 &= 0, 3 cdot 1 &= 3, 3 cdot 2 &= 6, 3 cdot 3 &= 9, 3 cdot 4 &= 12, 3 cdot 5 &= 15, end{align*} ] We find that when ( Z = 5 ), ( 3Z = 15 ) which ends in 5. So, ( Z = 5 ). This also results in a carry of 1 to the tens place due to the 15. 2. **Analyzing the Tens Column:** Next, we examine the tens place where ( Y ) is involved. Considering the carry from the previous column, we have: [ 1 + Y + Y + Y = 1 + 3Y ] The result must have a units digit of 7. We need to determine the digit ( Y ) for which this is true. Trying out possible digits from 0 to 9: [ begin{align*} 1 + 3 cdot 0 &= 1, 1 + 3 cdot 1 &= 4, 1 + 3 cdot 2 &= 7, end{align*} ] We find that when ( Y = 2 ), ( 1 + 3Y = 7 ). Thus, ( Y = 2 ). Importantly, no carry is created in this step. 3. **Analyzing the Hundreds Column:** Finally, we look at the hundreds place where ( X ) is involved. Using the digits from the adjacent columns: [ X + X = 2X ] This must equal 16 (as from the sum ( 825 + 825 + 25 )). Hence, [ 2X = 16 implies X = 8 ] 4. **Verifying Our Values:** To validate ( X = 8 ), ( Y = 2 ), and ( Z = 5 ), substitute these values back into the original problem: [ begin{align*} 825 + 825 + 25 &= 1675 end{align*} ] We confirm that this is correct. 5. **Calculating ( X + Y + Z ):** Finally, we sum the digits ( X, Y, ) and ( Z ): [ 8 + 2 + 5 = 15 ] **Conclusion:** [ boxed{15} ]"},{"instruction":"When Greenville State University decided to move its fine arts collection to a new library, it had to package the collection in some boxes with specific dimensions.

Thus, there exist distinct ( a, b, c in L ) such that ( a, b, c in S_k ). 2. **Express the integers in terms of their slot:** - Since ( a, b, c in S_k ), we have ( v_2(a) = v_2(b) = v_2(c) = k ). - We can write ( a = 2^k cdot m ), ( b = 2^k cdot n ), and ( c = 2^k cdot t ) where ( m, n, t ) are odd integers. 3. **Calculate ( |b^2 - 4ac| ):** - Substitute the expressions for ( a, b, ) and ( c ): [ |b^2 - 4ac| = |(2^k cdot n)^2 - 4 cdot (2^k cdot m) cdot (2^k cdot t)| ] - Simplify the expression: [ |b^2 - 4ac| = |2^{2k} cdot n^2 - 4 cdot 2^{2k} cdot mt| = 2^{2k} |n^2 - 4mt| ] 4. **Analyze ( n^2 - 4mt ) modulo 8:** - Since ( m, n, t ) are odd, consider ( n^2 - 4mt ) modulo 8. - For odd integers ( m, n, t ), we have: [ n^2 equiv 1 pmod{8} quad text{and} quad 4mt equiv 4 pmod{8} ] - Therefore: [ n^2 - 4mt equiv 1 - 4 equiv -3 equiv 5 pmod{8} ] - Hence, ( |n^2 - 4mt| equiv pm 3 pmod{8} ). 5. **Conclude that ( |b^2 - 4ac| ) is not a perfect square:** - Since ( |n^2 - 4mt| equiv pm 3 pmod{8} ), it follows that ( |b^2 - 4ac| = 2^{2k} |n^2 - 4mt| ) cannot be a perfect square. This is because a perfect square modulo 8 can only be ( 0, 1, ) or ( 4 ), but ( pm 3 ) modulo 8 is not among these values. Thus, we have shown that it is always possible to choose three integers ( a, b, ) and ( c ) from the given list such that ( |b^2 - 4ac| ) is not a perfect square.

Given the ratios of the segments derived from the problem, let's follow the steps: 1. **Symmetry Consideration**: - The tetrahedron AA_{1}PP_{1} is symmetric with respect to the line MN. 2. **Projection onto Plane ACC_{1}A_{1}**: - Let's consider the projection P' of point P onto the plane of the face ACC_{1}A_{1}. - Since the tetrahedron is symmetric, the projection P' lies on the midpoint of the segment's projections. 3. **Determining P'**: - P' divides the segment B'B_{1}', the projection of BB_{1} onto the plane ACC_{1}A_{1}, in the ratio 1:2. - Therefore, P' is the midpoint of the segment AP_{1}, which assures that plane APP' is perpendicular to plane AA_{1}P_{1}. 4. **Angle Discussion**: - As a result, the dihedral angles between the planes at edges AP_{1} and AA_{1}P are right angles. - Similarly, the planes at edges A_{1}PP_{1} and AA_{1}P are also perpendicular.

Therefore, for ( y = 0 ), the expression cannot equal 33. 3. **Considering Non-zero (y)**: Now, consider ( y neq 0 ). In this case, the value of the expression is the product of five distinct terms: [ (x-2y), (x-y), (x+y), (x+2y), (x+3y) ] We need to show that this product can never be 33. To understand why, note that 33 has the following prime factorization: [ 33 = 3 times 11 = (-3) times (-11) ] Thus, the divisors of 33 are: [ {-33, -11, -3, -1, 1, 3, 11, 33} ] 4. **Analyzing the Distinct Factors**: If we try to express 33 as a product of five distinct factors, none of which are repeated, we immediately observe: - The five distinct factors must be either positive or negative but must multiply to 33. - Including ( pm33 ) or ( pm11 ) immediately limits factor combinations because there wouldn't be enough unique values among the small set of divisors. Let's argue by contradiction: - If the polynomial evaluates to 33, then we would have to find five distinct integers among ({-33, -11, -3, -1, 1, 3, 11, 33}) whose product is 33. - Notice the unique factors and their signs: picking 5 unique values is impossible in achieving 33 because: - Neither 33 nor -33 nor 11 nor -11 facilitate forming five distinct combinations to multiply to 33. Therefore, no combination of five distinct factors from these values exists such that their product is 33. # Conclusion: Hence, the polynomial expression ( x^{5}+3 x^{4} y-5 x^{3} y^{2}-15 x^{2} y^{3}+4 x y^{4}+12 y^{5} ) for any integer values (x) and (y) cannot equal 33.

Hence, John will find the train at the station if his arrival time x satisfies y leq x leq y+30. This inequality represents a region in the coordinate system. **Plotting the region**: 1. When y + 30 leq 60 (or y leq 30), the area forms a right triangle from (0,0) to (30,30) and down to (0,30). 2. When y > 30, the segment from (y,y) to (60,y) and (60,y+30) forms a trapezoid until y=30. **Calculating the area**: - The triangle's area (y leq 30): frac{1}{2} times 30 times 30 = 450 square minutes. - The trapezoid's area is calculated as the total area minus the area of the triangle up to y = 30. For y > 30, the trapezoid extends from 30 to 60 on the y-axis, and from y to 60 on the x-axis, so the average height is 30 and width is also 30.

Therefore, 2 must be colored differently from 4, 8, and 16. - Similarly, 4 divides 8 and 16, so 4 must be a different color than both 8 and 16. - Finally, 8 divides 16, meaning 8 and 16 must be colored differently. - Hence, these four numbers (2, 4, 8, 16) must all have different colors, implying that at least 4 colors are needed: k geq 4. 3. **Construct a valid coloring with 4 colors:** - **Red color (R):** Color the integers from 2 to 3. - **Blue color (B):** Color the integers from 4 to 7. - **Green color (G):** Color the integers from 8 to 15. - **Yellow color (Y):** Color the integers from 16 to 31. 4. **Verification of the constructed coloring:** - Check that for any m > n where m is a multiple of n, m and n have different colors: - Suppose m = kn.

The nth term of the sequence can be expressed as: a_n = left(30^{n-1}right) left(frac{5}{6}right). To be divisible by two million (2 times 10^6 = 2^7 times 5^6), the nth term must contain at least 7 factors of 2 and 6 factors of 5. Since 30 = 2 times 3 times 5, each term contributes one factor of 2 and one factor of 5.

Consider the sum of cosines first. Notice the trigonometric identity: [cos alpha + cos (alpha + 180^{circ}) = 0] This follows because: [cos (alpha + 180^{circ}) = -cos alpha] Therefore: [cos alpha + (-cos alpha) = 0] 3. With this, we deduce: [cos alpha + cos (alpha + 1^{circ}) + cos (alpha + 2^{circ}) + cdots + cos (alpha + 179^{circ}) = 0] 4. We group and analyze: [cos 2880^{circ} + cos 2881^{circ} + cdots + cos 6479^{circ}] Since it incorporates exactly 1800 terms (from 2880 to 6479), each term pairs with another to sum to 0: [cos (n^{circ}) + cos (n + 180^{circ})^{circ} = 0 ] Thus, the entire sum from (cos 2880^{circ}) to (cos 6479^{circ}) will be 0. 5. At the end of this range: [cos 6480^{circ} = cos (6480 - 360 cdot 18)^{circ} = cos 0^{circ} = 1] 6. Therefore: [cos 2880^{circ} + cos 2881^{circ} + cdots + cos 6480^{circ} = 0 + 1 = 1] 7. Focus next on the sum of sines: [sin 2907^{circ} + sin 2908^{circ} + cdots + sin 6507^{circ}] 8. Similarly applying a trigonometric identity: [sin alpha + sin (alpha + 180^{circ}) = 0!] Simplifies each pair of terms: [sin (n^{circ}) + sin (n + 180^{circ}) = 0 ] Thus: [sin 2907^{circ} + sin 2908^{circ} + cdots + sin 6506^{circ} + sin 6507^{circ} = 0 + sin 27^{circ}] Because: [sin 6507^{circ} = sin (6507 - 360 cdot 18)^{circ} = sin 27^{circ}] 9.

Since there are two consecutive reductions, the final price can be represented as the initial price multiplied by (1-x)^2.

Specifically, we will use the double properties of conics, particularly the Penta-Chord theorem or the Butterfly theorem, which will help us generalize our solution. 1. **Setup Coordinates and Initial Condition:** Place point M at the origin (0,0) and set the line PQ as the x-axis. 2. **Equation of the Ellipse:** Recall that the general equation of an ellipse centered at the origin is: [ ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + dx + ey + f = 0. ] Given M is the midpoint of chord PQ and lies on the x-axis, assume P has coordinates (k,0) and Q has coordinates (-k,0). Since M is the midpoint: Later, we will conclude from: [ a(k)^2 + d(k) + f = 0, ] [ a(-k)^2 - d(k) + f = 0. ] Subtracting these two equations immediately yields d = 0. 3. **Lines Through the Intersection at M:** Let the lines AC and BD intersect at M. Thus, assume without loss of generality that: [ AC text{ has equation } y = gx, ] [ BD text{ has equation } y = hx, ] where g and h are constants. 4. **Conics Through Points A, B, C, D:** The intersection of two conics through these points can be generically described. Thus, the pair of lines AC, BD (treated as a conic) intersect and take the form: [ (y - gx)(y - hx) = 0. ] Any conic that goes through these four points must then have an equation of the form: [ r(ax^2 + bxy + cy^2 + ey + f) + s(y - gx)(y - hx) = 0, ] where r and s are constants. 5. **Intersection of Conic with PQ:** Suppose we set PQ (which is the x-axis y = 0). We now analyze the intersection of such a conic with our line: [ r(ax^2 + f) + s(ghx^2) = 0. ] We notice there is no linear term in this equation. Thus, solve for x: [ r(ax^2 + f) + s(gh)x^2 = 0, ] [ x^2(ra + sgh) + rf = 0. ] 6. **Equidistant Solutions:** Without the x term, the roots x are symmetric about origin 0. Therefore, the roots representing R and S on the x axis are symmetrically placed about M which substantiates that: [ M text{ is the midpoint of } RS. ] # Conclusion: Thus, based on the symmetry and involvement of the Penta-Chord theorem, M is confirmed to be the midpoint of RS.

Speed of first train = 60 km/hr Speed of second train = 40 km/hr Relative speed = Speed of first train + Speed of second train Relative speed = 60 km/hr + 40 km/hr Relative speed = 100 km/hr Now, we need to convert this speed into meters per second to be consistent with the lengths of the trains which are given in meters. 1 km/hr = (1 km/hr) * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) 1 km/hr = 1000/3600 m/s 1 km/hr = 5/18 m/s Therefore, the relative speed in meters per second is: Relative speed = 100 km/hr * (5/18 m/s per km/hr) Relative speed = (100 * 5/18) m/s Relative speed = (500/18) m/s Relative speed ≈ 27.78 m/s The total distance to be covered for the trains to cross each other is the sum of their lengths: Total distance = Length of first train + Length of second train Total distance = 200 m + 300 m Total distance = 500 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the trains to cross each other using the formula: Time = Distance / Speed Time = Total distance / Relative speed Time = 500 m / 27.78 m/s Time ≈ 17.99 seconds So, it takes approximately boxed{18} seconds for the two trains to cross each other."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = ax^2 4x + 2, and the function g(x) = (1/3)^f(x).

Given 97 pairwise distinct integers ( a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{97} ), we need to prove that there exist four of these integers that can be combined using addition, subtraction, multiplication, and parentheses to form a multiple of 1984. 2. Since ( 1984 = 64 times 31 ), we will consider the congruences of these integers modulo 64 and 31. 3. **Step 1**: Considering modulo 64. - Among the 97 integers (a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{97}), at least two must have the same remainder when divided by 64. This is due to the Pigeonhole Principle, as there are only 64 possible remainders (from 0 to 63). - Let these two integers be (a_{1}) and (a_{2}) such that: [ a_{1} = 64k_{1} + r quad text{and} quad a_{2} = 64k_{2} + r ] where (0 leq r < 64). 4. **Step 2**: Evaluating the difference modulo 64. - The difference (a_{1} - a_{2}) is then: [ (64k_{1} + r) - (64k_{2} + r) = 64(k_{1} - k_{2}) ] - Clearly, (64 mid (a_{1} - a_{2})). 5. **Step 3**: Considering modulo 31. - Among the remaining 32 integers (a_{66}, a_{67}, cdots, a_{97}), at least two must have the same remainder when divided by 31. By the Pigeonhole Principle, there are only 31 possible remainders (from 0 to 30). - Let these two integers be (a_{66}) and (a_{67}) such that: [ a_{66} = 31m_{1} + s quad text{and} quad a_{67} = 31m_{2} + s ] where (0 leq s < 31). 6. **Step 4**: Evaluating the difference modulo 31. - The difference (a_{66} - a_{67}) is then: [ (31m_{1} + s) - (31m_{2} + s) = 31(m_{1} - m_{2}) ] - Clearly, (31 mid (a_{66} - a_{67})). 7. **Step 5**: Combining both conditions. - Since ( (a_{1} - a_{2}) ) is divisible by 64 and ( (a_{66} - a_{67}) ) is divisible by 31, and since 64 and 31 are coprime ((gcd(64, 31) = 1)), their product (64 times 31 = 1984) will divide the product ( (a_{1} - a_{2})(a_{66} - a_{67}) ): [ 1984 mid (a_{1} - a_{2})(a_{66} - a_{67}) ] 8. **Conclusion**: - Therefore, the integers (a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{66}, a_{67}) are the required four integers, and we have proved that there exist four integers among ( a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{97} ) such that their appropriate combination is a multiple of 1984.

A subset of ( B_n ) is called divided if no two of its members have a common descendant. Find the largest possible cardinality of a divided subset of ( B_n ).","output":"For a string ( s ), denote its twist by ( f(s) ), and the number of blocks of consecutive digits it has by ( b(s) ). Let's construct an undirected graph ( G ) on ( B_n ) with edges ((s, f(s))) for all ( s in B_n ). Note that the largest possible cardinality of a divided subset of ( B_n ) is the number of connected components of the graph. Each connected component of ( G ) contains exactly one cycle, and we aim to show that each cycle in the graph has a length of exactly 2. 1. **Assuming there exists a cycle ( A subseteq B_n ) which is not of length 2:** - Fix some ( s in A ). - We wish to show that ( 1 < b(s) < n ). - If ( b(s) = 1 ), then ( s ) is either the string with all ones or the string with all zeroes. Then, ( f(s) = 1 - s ) and it follows that ( f(f(s)) neq s ), contradicting ( s in A ). - Similarly, if ( b(s) = n ), then ( s ) is one of the two alternating strings, leading to the same conclusion ( f(f(s)) neq s ). 2. **Analysis of twist and block behavior:** Consider ( x = s_{b(s)-1} ), ( y = s_{b(s)} ), ( z = s_{b(s)+1} ). A twist replaces ( y ) with ( 1 - y ), and: - If ( x = z neq y ), then ( b(f(s)) = b(s) - 2 ). - If ( x = y = z ), then ( b(f(s)) = b(s) + 2 ). - If ( x neq y = z ) or ( x = y neq z ), then ( b(f(s)) = b(s) ). Moreover, in this case, ( f(f(s)) = s ) causing the connected component to have a cycle of length 2. Thus, ( s notin A ). We observe that if ( s in A ), then ( b(f(s)) = b(s) pm 2 ). 3. **Considering cycles in ( A ):** Take ( s in A ) such that ( b(s) geq b(f^m(s)) ) for any ( 1 leq m < k ), i.e., the element with the largest ( b(s) ) in the cycle. - We have ( b(f(s)) = b(s) - 2 ) and by maximality ( b(s) = b(f^{-1}(s)) + 2 ). - Position ( s_j ) only changes at positions ( j ) with the same parity as ( b(s) ). - From ( s_{b(s)-1} = s_{b(s)+1} neq s_{b(s)} ), and minimal ( t > 0 ) such that ( b(f^t(s)) = b(s) ), it follows ( f^t(s)_{b(s)} = 1 - s_{b(s)} ). Since ( s_{b(s)+1} = 1 - s_{b(s)} = s_{b(s)-1} ), this contradicts the maximality assumption. This contradiction proves no such component ( A ) can exist other than a length-2 cycle. 4. **Counting the possible cycles of length 2:** Each cycle of length 2 occurs when ( f(f(s)) = s ) and ( b(s) = b(f(s)) ), which gives ( 2 leq b(s) leq n-1 ). - Fix either the left or right position ( b(s) = k ) in ( s ), considering ( k-1 ) \\"break\\" points between ( 0/1 ) blocks in ( s ). - The remaining ( k-2 ) block \\"breakpoints\\" can be assigned in (binom{n-3}{k-2}) ways on the ( n-3 ) spots between symbols of ( s ). Each gives two distinct outcomes due to the ( 0/1 ) block choice.

We denote by ( M ) the midpoint of the external tangent segment to these circles, which does not lie on ( l ). Our goal is to find the geometric locus of points ( M ). Step-by-step Solution: 1. **Setup and Drawing Circles**: Let's consider two circles that are tangent to each other at some point ( P ) and tangent to the line ( l ) at points ( A ) and ( B ). These two circles must have their centers aligned along the same line perpendicular to ( l ). 2. **Tangent Segment Lengths**: For such pairs of circles, let the centers be at points ( C_1 ) and ( C_2 ) respectively. Accordingly, the tangent segments from ( A ) and ( B ) to the points of tangency on the circles are equal due to symmetry. Let the lengths of these tangent segments be ( r ), the radii of the circles. 3. **Midpoint Calculation**: The external common tangent line to both circles at points ( A ) and ( B ) implies symmetry of those segments. If we denote the middle of the external tangent not lying on ( l ) as ( M ), we need to calculate the midpoint ( L ) of the segment ( AB ). 4. **Using Midpoint Theorem**: - Let point ( L ) be the midpoint of the segment ( AB ). - Since the circles have symmetrical positions relative to ( L ), and taking symmetry into account, the midpoint ( M ) of the common external tangent segment lies at a distance twice that of the distance from ( L ) to ( A ) or ( B ). - Explicitly, if ( A ) and ( B ) are separated by a distance ( AB ), then: [ LM = 2 cdot LA = 2 cdot frac{AB}{2} = AB ] 5. **Geometric Description**: - Hence, the circle centered at ( L ) (midpoint of ( AB )), with radius ( AB ), and excluding points lying on ( l ), is the geometric locus of all points ( M ) where ( M ) is the midpoint of the external tangent segments of pairs of circles meeting the criteria. In conclusion, the geometric locus of point ( M ) is a circle centered at the midpoint of segment ( AB ) with a radius equal to ( AB ), excluding the points that lie on line ( l ).

Since there are 7 numbers in the set, the median will be the fourth number when the set is arranged in ascending order. Therefore, the median is b. To find the mean, we add up all the numbers in the set and divide by the number of elements in the set. The mean (M) of the set is: M = (8 + 16 + a + b + 32 + 40 + 48) / 7 We are given that the product of the mean and median is 784: M * b = 784 Substituting the expression for M, we get: ((8 + 16 + a + b + 32 + 40 + 48) / 7) * b = 784 Simplifying the sum in the numerator: (144 + a + b) / 7 * b = 784 Multiplying both sides by 7 to get rid of the denominator: (144 + a + b) * b = 5488 Now we have an equation with two variables, a and b. We need another equation to solve for both variables. We know that a < b and that b is the median, so b must be one of the numbers between 16 and 32. Since 784 is the product of the mean and median, and the median is b, b must be a factor of 784. The factors of 784 that are between 16 and 32 are 28 and 32. Since 32 is already in the set, b must be 28.

The midpoint formula tells us that the coordinates of M are the averages of the coordinates of A and B. Given M(2,2), we can set up equations based on the midpoint formula and the equation of the parabola to find the coordinates of A and B. However, the specific coordinates of A and B are not necessary for finding the area of triangle ABF. The key is to notice that the line segment AB is perpendicular to the axis of the parabola (the x-axis) because the parabola is symmetric and M lies on the axis of symmetry of the parabola. Therefore, the triangle triangle ABF is a right triangle with AB as its hypotenuse. The distance from F to the directrix of the parabola is 1 (since the focus is at (1,0) and the directrix is x = -1). The point M is 2 units away from the focus along the x-axis, so the length of the perpendicular from F to AB (which is the height of triangle ABF) is also 2 units because it lies on the parabola's axis of symmetry.

A number ( r ) is prime saturated if the product of all the different positive prime factors of ( r ) is less than the square root of ( r ).

The prime factors of 99 are 3 and 11, and their product is ( P = 3 times 11 = 33 ). The square root of 99 is approximately 9.95. Since ( P > sqrt{99} ), 99 is not prime saturated.

The next number, 97, is a prime number, so it has only one prime factor, which is 97 itself. Since the product of its prime factors is 97, which is not less than its square root, 97 is not prime saturated.

Since X is paid 120% of what Y is paid, X's payment (X_USD) can be expressed as 1.2 * Y_INR. Z is paid 150% of what X is paid, so Z's payment (Z_EUR) can be expressed as 1.5 * X_USD.

Since 90% of the land was cleared, we can calculate the cleared land as follows: Cleared land = 90% of total land Cleared land = 0.90 * 3999.9999999999995 acres Now, let's calculate the actual amount of cleared land: Cleared land = 0.90 * 3999.9999999999995 Cleared land ≈ 3599.9999999999995 acres (since the total land is very close to 4000, we can round it to 3600 acres for simplicity) Next, we know that 60% of the cleared land was planted with grapes. Let's find out how much land that is: Land with grapes = 60% of cleared land Land with grapes = 0.60 * 3600 acres Land with grapes = 2160 acres We also know that 360 acres of the cleared land was planted with tomato.

Let (P_{ij}) be the point located at row (i) and column (j). If (P_{ij}) is white, the condition for the grid to be balanced translates to: [ B F(i) = B C(j) ] 2. **Analyzing a Specific Point:** Assume ( P_{11} ) (the point in row 1 and column 1) is black, and let (k) be the number of black points in the first row. By rearranging columns if necessary, we can assume these black points are the first (k) points (P_{11}, ldots, P_{1k}). According to the balancing condition for ( P_{11} ), the first column must also have exactly (k) black points.

Suppose ( P_{ij} ) is white.

Otherwise, we would have a situation where a rectangle has three vertices being white and one black, implying ( n = m ). However, if all these points are to be black, then: [ n - k = N F(i) = N C(j) = m - k ] which contradicts the assumption ( n > m ). 6. **Conclusion:** To avoid contradictions, ( m - k = 0 ) leading to: [ k = n - k implies k = frac{n}{2} ] Thus, ( n = 2m ).

Consider the triangles (triangle XOA) and (triangle XOZ) formed by the radius (OA) and the tangent (XY): - Since both (XA) and (XZ) are tangents from the same exterior point (X), they are equal ((|XA| = |XZ|)). - (angle XOA) and (angle XOZ) both involve the radius (OX), which is equal in length to (OZ). 4. From the above, (triangle XOA cong triangle XOZ) via the RHS (right-angle-hypotenuse-side) congruence criterion, therefore: [ angle XOA = angle XOZ. ] 5.

Therefore, at most one statement can be true. 4. **Suppose Each Statement** We evaluate the truth of each statement starting with the lowest number. If one statement is true, then the number of false statements should match its claim. 5. **Evaluate Statement by Statement** - If statement 1 is true: \\"There is exactly one false statement in this notebook.\\" This creates a paradox because if exactly one statement is false, then statement 1 itself must be false, contradicting our assumption. - If statement 2 is true: \\"There are exactly two false statements in this notebook.\\" This should mean that only one other statement is false, but this leads to a similar contradiction as above. Let's move to general evaluation: - If statement n is true: \\"There are exactly n false statements in the notebook.\\" - This implies that 100 - n statements should be true. - However, this doesn't align well with the condition above unless n=99. 6. **Consider Statement 99** - If statement 99 is true: \\"There are exactly 99 false statements in this notebook.\\" - This means that there is only one true statement, and if statement 99 itself states there are 99 false statements, which is consistent.

Let us define a new polynomial function ( Q(x, y, z) ) as follows: [ Q(x, y, z) = x P(x) + y P(y) + z P(z) - xyz left( P(x - y) + P(y - z) + P(z - x) right). ] 2. The given condition implies that for all non-zero real numbers ( x, y, z ) satisfying ( 2xyz = x + y + z ), we have: [ Q(x, y, z) = 0. ] 3. Subsequently, considering all ( x ), ( y ) satisfying the conditions: [ xy neq 0, quad xy neq frac{1}{2}, quad x + y neq 0, ] it should hold for the specifically chosen ( z = frac{x + y}{2xy - 1} ): [ Qleft( x, y, frac{x + y}{2xy - 1} right) = 0. ] 4. This leads us to understand ( Q ) has infinitely many zeros, meaning ( R(x, y) ) as a function of ( x ) must be identically zero for all valid ( y ): [ R(x, y) equiv 0. ] 5. By treating the coefficients in ( P ) and ( Q ) as complex numbers, we claim: [ Q(x, y, z) = 0 text{ for all } x, y, z text{ satisfying } 2xyz = x + y + z text{ and } xyz neq 0. ] 6. Consider the particular values ( (x, y, z) = (t, -t, 0) ). Substituting these, [ tP(t) - tP(-t) equiv 0. ] This indicates that ( P(x) ) is an odd function. 7. Next, substituting ( (x, y, z) = left( x, frac{i}{sqrt{2}}, -frac{i}{sqrt{2}} right) ), we have: [ xP(x) + frac{i}{sqrt{2}} left( Pleft( frac{i}{sqrt{2}} right) - Pleft( -frac{i}{sqrt{2}} right) right) equiv frac{1}{2}x left( Pleft( x - frac{i}{sqrt{2}} right) + Pleft( x + frac{i}{sqrt{2}} right) + Pleft( sqrt{2}i right) right). ] 8.

Thus, we deduce: [ Pleft( x - frac{i}{sqrt{2}} right) + Pleft( x + frac{i}{sqrt{2}} right) - 2P(x) equiv Pleft( sqrt{2}i right). ] This is recognized as a second finite difference being constant, implying ( P ) is a quadratic polynomial at most: [ operatorname{deg}P leq 2. ] 10.
