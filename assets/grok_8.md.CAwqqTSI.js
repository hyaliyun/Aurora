Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what is essential for evolution?\\" is \\"that material's properties\\", given that  random changes in genes are essential for evolution? The answer is:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what is essential for evolution?\\" is not \\"that material's properties.\\" Instead, several key factors are essential for the process of evolution to occur. Random changes in genes, known as mutations, are indeed critical for evolution, but they are just one aspect of this multifaceted process. The following components are necessary for evolution: 1. Genetic variation: Genetic variation within a population occurs due to the presence of different genes and alleles, which can result from mutations or genetic recombination during sexual reproduction. Diversity is essential for evolution as it provides the raw material on which evolutionary forces, such as natural selection, can act. 2. Inheritance: For evolution to occur, traits and genes responsible for these traits must be passed down from generation to generation. This inheritance ensures that some of the genetic variations will persist over time. 3. Mutations: As you've mentioned, random changes in genes, or mutations, are essential for evolution. They introduce new genetic variation into a population, supporting the adaptation and evolution of species. 4. Natural selection: Natural selection is a crucial force driving evolution. It is the process by which organisms with inherited traits that provide a survival or reproductive advantage in their environment are more likely to survive, reproduce, and pass on their genes to the next generation. As time passes, those advantageous traits become more prevalent in the population. 5. Genetic drift: Genetic drift, a random change in gene frequencies over time, also plays a vital role in evolution. In small populations, genetic drift can lead to the loss of genetic variation, potentially affecting a population's ability to adapt to environmental changes. 6. Gene flow: Gene flow, or the exchange of genetic material between different populations of a species, is essential for evolution. It can promote genetic variation, allowing populations to evolve by introducing new traits and increasing the likelihood of adaptation to changing environments. In summary, while random changes in genes are a critical component of evolution, various essential factors, including genetic variation, inheritance, natural selection, genetic drift, and gene flow, are necessary for the evolutionary process to take place."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Under Canadian law, parole would usually be virtually automatic, but Karla's case is no ordinary case. Karla has been sent to Saskatoon to meet with a prison appointed psychiatrist, Dr. Arnold, to evaluate her suitability for parole. Most of the movie is told from the vantage point of Karla and Dr. Arnold examining the past actions that landed her in prison with a view to making a decision on parole.Karla begins by discussing how she and her ex-husband Paul Bernardo first met. At age 18, Karla is working in a veterinary clinic and is sent to Toronto by her employer to attend a veterinary convention. However, she is also interested in meeting men. Karla and a female colleague are in a hotel restaurant when they are approached by Paul and a male friend. There is an almost immediate strong attraction between Paul and Karla, and they soon find themselves making love in Karla's hotel room. Karla's colleague and Paul's friend are also in the room and feel quite uncomfortable.Karla and Paul begin a relationship which, at first, seems quite happy and successful. Karla gives Paul a pair of handcuffs for use in sex play. However, while having sex, Paul introduces the possibility that he might be a rapist. In looking back at this incident with Dr. Arnold, Karla claims she thought this was just innocent sex talk on Paul's part.Paul's true meaning, however, is quickly shown to the viewer to be something far more sinister: Paul is, in fact, the notorious Scarborough rapist, who has been terrorizing women with frequent and brutal assaults.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  A number of factors led to the popularity of Netherlandish illuminators. Primary was the tradition and expertise that developed in the region in the centuries following the monastic reform of the 14th century, building on the growth in number and prominence of monasteries, abbeys and churches from the 12th century that had already produced significant numbers of liturgical texts. There was a strong political aspect; the form had many influential patrons such as Jean, Duke of Berry and Philip the Good, the latter of whom collected more than a thousand illuminated books before his death. According to Thomas Kren, Philip's \\"library was an expression of the man as a Christian prince, and an embodiment of the state – his politics and authority, his learning and piety\\". Because of his patronage the manuscript industry in the Lowlands grew so that it dominated Europe for several generations. The Burgundian book-collecting tradition passed to Philip's son and his wife, Charles the Bold and Margaret of York; his granddaughter Mary of Burgundy and her husband Maximilian I; and to his son-in-law, Edward IV, who was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts. The libraries left by Philip and Edward IV formed the nucleus from which sprang the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library.Netherlandish illuminators had an important export market, designing many works specifically for the English market. Following a decline in domestic patronage after Charles the Bold died in 1477, the export market became more important. Illuminators responded to differences in taste by producing more lavish and extravagantly decorated works tailored for foreign elites, including Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland and Eleanor of Viseu. Answer:","output":"The two individuals whose libraries became the foundation of the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library were Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy, and Edward IV, King of England. Philip the Good's full name was Philip III, Duke of Burgundy, also known as Philip the Good or Philippe le Bon, whose reign lasted from 1419 to 1467. He was an important patron of the arts and a significant collector of illuminated books. His vast collection of over a thousand illuminated manuscripts served as a symbol of his wealth, power, and Christian piety. Philip's patronage played a leading role in the growth and dominance of the manuscript industry in the Lowlands, making it a formidable force in Europe for several generations. Edward IV's full name was Edward Plantagenet, King of England, who reigned from 1461 until his death in April 1483, with a brief interruption in 1470-1471. Like Philip the Good, Edward IV was an avid collector of Flemish manuscripts and was deeply influenced by the Burgundian book-collecting tradition. His marriage to Elizabeth Woodville may have helped strengthen his connection to the traditions of the Lowlands. The collections left behind by these two influential figures, Philip the Good and Edward IV, eventually combined to form the nucleus of both the Royal Library of Belgium and the English Royal Library. Their patronage not only impacted the growth of the manuscript industry within their respective regions but also significantly contributed to the export market for Netherlandish illuminators, who designed and created numerous works specifically to cater to the tastes and preferences of foreign elites. As the domestic patronage experienced a decline after the death of Charles the Bold in 1477, the export market gained even more importance, leading to the creation of more lavish and opulently decorated illuminated manuscripts that were tailored to the tastes of foreign nobility, including rulers like Edward IV of England, James IV of Scotland, and Eleanor of Viseu."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk).  - Music for Nations is a British independent record label focusing mainly on rock and metal. It was a subsidiary of the larger label distributor Zomba Records, which in turn is now owned by BMG.  - \`\` Underdose '' is the first single by Essex alternative metal band InMe .

The music video for \`\` Underdose '' features the band performing in an empty skatepark .  - Rock music is a genre of popular music that originated as \\"rock and roll\\" in the United States in the 1950s, and developed into a range of different styles in the 1960s and later, particularly in the United Kingdom and the United States. It has its roots in 1940s' and 1950s' rock and roll, itself heavily influenced by blues, rhythm and blues and country music. Rock music also drew strongly on a number of other genres such as electric blues and folk, and incorporated influences from jazz, classical and other musical sources.  - Overgrown Eden is the debut album from Essex alternative metal band InMe. The album was released in the UK on 30 January 2003. The album produced four singles before and after the album's release. The singles released were \\"Underdose\\", \\"Firefly\\", \\"Crushed like Fruit\\" and \\"Neptune\\". The album was re-released in its original format on 5 June 2006. This was due to getting the rights for \\"Overgrown Eden\\" from the now defunct record label Music for Nations. Due to the demise of MFN, this was the first and last album released by InMe on this record label.  - Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a rock music genre that infuses heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal. Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles.

Emperor Tsao hires the Hons to capture the Nine-Tails Fox, whom he claims has made a major robbery of his household, including the rape and murder of his daughter and the murder of 41 servants. The Hons are distracted when they find the Fungs captured by Never Die and his brothers, who in spite of decapitation and loss of a hand, proceed to chase them (the severed hand grabbing at one of them) chase the Hons to the lair of Nine-Tails Fox, who has recently caused his wife, the apsara known as Flying Cat to walk out on him. The group discovers that Never Die is allergic to glib talk, and begin speaking to each other glibly, Chung, too embarrassed to speak to Lady Fung in that way, speaking to Nine-Tails Fox, and the two pulling off each other shirts, and trap him. Never Die soon dissolves, and the four bounty hunters and Never Die's hand take him away. Flying Cat returns to find drawn images of what has gone on previously, including what she interprets as her husband's homosexual behavior, and chastises the old man who sends the drawings out through a slot for not intervening, which he says is not his place. Nine-Tails Fox, who proudly admits to being a thief but insists he never hurts anyone, escapes from the bounty hunters to the inn of Pang Tin-hong, where he becomes involved with numerous courtesans. The bounty hunters follow him, but not before Flying Cat catches up with him. Still other bounty hunters, including the burly Western Ace, a gay man who sings 1980s American pop tunes, and a transsexual who delivers poisoned kisses, arrive at the inn. Because the Hons and Fungs pay well and are supported by the police, Pang sides with them against the new bounty hunters, claiming that he and his wife are Leslie Cheung and Anita Mui. The... Answer:","output":"In the movie Flying Dagger, it is not explicitly mentioned what poisons Chung. However, there is a reference to a transsexual character who delivers \\"poisoned kisses\\". Considering the various events and characters in the movie, it is possible that Chung could be poisoned by the transsexual character delivering these poisoned kisses, but the plot does not clearly state this."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: The announcement early yesterday morning of experimental evidence for what’s presumably the Higgs particle brings a certain closure to a story I’ve watched (and sometimes been a part of) for nearly 40 years. In some ways I felt like a teenager again. Hearing about a new particle being discovered. And asking the same questions I would have asked at age 15. “What’s its mass?” “What decay channel?” “What total width?” “How many sigma?” “How many events?”      When I was a teenager in the 1970s, particle physics was my great interest. It felt like I had a personal connection to all those kinds of particles that were listed in the little book of particle properties I used to carry around with me. The pions and kaons and lambda particles and f mesons and so on. At some level, though, the whole picture was a mess. A hundred kinds of particles, with all sorts of detailed properties and relations. But there were theories. The quark model. Regge theory. Gauge theories. S-matrix theory. It wasn’t clear what theory was correct. Some theories seemed shallow and utilitarian; others seemed deep and philosophical. Some were clean but boring. Some seemed contrived. Some were mathematically sophisticated and elegant; others were not.      By the mid-1970s, though, those in the know had pretty much settled on what became the Standard Model. In a sense it was the most vanilla of the choices. It seemed a little contrived, but not very. It involved some somewhat sophisticated mathematics, but not the most elegant or deep mathematics. But it did have at least one notable feature: of all the candidate theories, it was the one that most extensively allowed explicit calculations to be made. They weren’t easy calculations—and in fact it was doing those calculations that got me started having computers to do calculations, and set me on the path that eventually led to Mathematica. But at the time I think the very difficulty of the calculations seemed to me and everyone else to make the theory more satisfying to work with, and more likely to be meaningful.      At the least in the early years there were still surprises, though. In November 1974 there was the announcement of the J/psi particle. And one asked the same questions as today, starting with “What’s the mass?” (That particle’s was 3.1 GeV; today’s is 126 GeV.) But unlike with the Higgs particle, to almost everyone the J/psi was completely unexpected. At first it wasn’t at all clear what it could be. Was it evidence of something truly fundamental and exciting? Or was it in a sense just a repeat of things that had been seen before?      My own very first published paper (feverishly worked on over Christmas 1974 soon after I turned 15) speculated that it and some related phenomena might be something exciting: a sign of substructure in the electron. But however nice and interesting a theory may be, nature doesn’t have to follow it. And in this case it didn’t. And instead the phenomena that had been seen turned out to have a more mundane explanation: they were signs of an additional (4th) kind of quark (the c or charm quark).      In the next few years, more surprises followed. Mounting evidence showed that there was a heavier analog of the electron and muon—the tau lepton. Then in July 1977 there was another “sudden discovery”, made at Fermilab: this time of a particle based on the b quark. I happened to be spending the summer of 1977 doing particle physics at Argonne National Lab, not far away from Fermilab. And it was funny: I remember there was a kind of blasé attitude toward the discovery. Like “another unexpected particle physics discovery; there’ll be lots more”.      But as it turned out that’s not what happened. It’s been 35 years, and when it comes to new particles and the like, there really hasn’t been a single surprise. (The discovery of neutrino masses is a partial counterexample, as are various discoveries in cosmology.) Experiments have certainly discovered things—the W and Z bosons, the validity of QCD, the top quark. But all of them were as expected from the Standard Model; there were no surprises.      Needless to say, verifying the predictions of the Standard Model hasn’t always been easy. A few times I happened to be at the front lines. In 1977, for example, I computed what the Standard Model predicted for the rate of producing charm particles in proton-proton collisions. But the key experiment at the time said the actual rate was much lower. I spent ages trying to figure out what might be wrong—either with my calculations or the underlying theory. But in the end—in a rather formative moment for my understanding of applying the scientific method—it turned out that what was wrong was actually the experiment, not the theory.      In 1979—when I was at the front lines of the “discovery of the gluon”—almost the opposite thing happened. The conviction in the Standard Model was by then so great that the experiments agreed too early, even before the calculations were correctly finished. Though once again, in the end all was well, and the method I invented for doing analysis of the experiments is in fact still routinely used today.      By 1981 I myself was beginning to drift away from particle physics, not least because I’d started to work on things that I thought were somehow more fundamental. But I still used to follow what was happening in particle physics. And every so often I’d get excited when I heard about some discovery rumored or announced that seemed somehow unexpected or inexplicable from the Standard Model. But in the end it was all rather disappointing. There’d be questions about each discovery—and in later years there’d often be suspicious correlations with deadlines for funding decisions. And every time, after a while, the discovery would melt away. Leaving only the plain Standard Model, with no surprises.      Through all of this, though, there was always one loose end dangling: the Higgs particle. It wasn’t clear just what it would take to see it, but if the Standard Model was correct, it had to exist.      To me, the Higgs particle and the associated Higgs mechanism had always seemed like an unfortunate hack. In setting up the Standard Model, one begins with a mathematically quite pristine theory in which every particle is perfectly massless. But in reality almost all particles (apart from the photon) have nonzero masses. And the point of the Higgs mechanism is to explain this—without destroying desirable features of the original mathematical theory.      Here’s how it basically works. Every type of particle in the Standard Model is associated with waves propagating in a field—just as photons are associated with waves propagating in the electromagnetic field. But for almost all types of particles, the average amplitude value of the underlying field is zero. But for the Higgs field, one imagines something different. One imagines instead that there’s a nonlinear instability that’s built into the mathematical equations that govern it, that leads to a nonzero average value for the field throughout the universe.      And it’s then assumed that all types of particles continually interact with this background field—in such a way as to act so that they have a mass. But what mass? Well, that’s determined by how strongly a particle interacts with the background field. And that in turn is determined by a parameter that one inserts into the model. So to get the observed masses of the particles, one’s just inserting one parameter for each particle, and then arranging it to give the mass of the particle.      That might seem contrived. But at some level it’s OK. It would have been nice if the theory had predicted the masses of the particles. But given that it does not, inserting their values as interaction strengths seems as reasonable as anything.      Still, there’s another problem. To get the observed particle masses, the background Higgs field that exists throughout the universe has to have an incredibly high density of energy and mass. Which one might expect would have a huge gravitational effect—in fact, enough of an effect to cause the universe to roll up into a tiny ball. Well, to avoid this, one has to assume that there’s a parameter (a “cosmological constant”) built right into the fundamental equations of gravity that cancels to incredibly high precision the effects of the energy and mass density associated with the background Higgs field.      And if this doesn’t seem implausible enough, back around 1980 I was involved in noticing something else: this delicate cancellation can’t survive at the high temperatures of the very early Big Bang universe. And the result is that there has to be a glitch in the expansion of the universe. My calculations said this glitch would not be terribly big—but stretching the theory somewhat led to the possibility of a huge glitch, and in fact an early version of the whole inflationary universe scenario.      Back around 1980, it seemed as if unless there was something wrong with the Standard Model it wouldn’t be long before the Higgs particle would show up. The guess was that its mass might be perhaps 10 GeV (about 10 proton masses)—which would allow it to be detected in the current or next generation of particle accelerators. But it didn’t show up. And every time a new particle accelerator was built, there’d be talk about how it would finally find the Higgs. But it never did.      Back in 1979 I’d actually worked on questions about what possible masses particles could have in the Standard Model. The instability in the Higgs field used to generate mass ran the risk of making the whole universe unstable. And I found that this would happen if there were quarks with masses above about 300 GeV. This made me really curious about the top quark—which pretty much had to exist, but kept on not being discovered. Until finally in 1995 it showed up—with a mass of 173 GeV, leaving to my mind a surprisingly thin margin away from total instability of the universe.      There were a few bounds on the mass of the Higgs particle too. At first they were very loose (“below 1000 GeV” etc.). But gradually they became tighter and tighter. And after huge amounts of experimental and theoretical work, by last year they pretty much said the mass had to be between 110 and 130 GeV. So in a sense one can’t be too surprised about the announcement today of evidence for a Higgs particle with a mass of 126 GeV. But explicitly seeing what appears to be the Higgs particle is an important moment. Which finally seems to tie up a 40-year loose end.      At some level I’m actually a little disappointed. I’ve made no secret—even to Peter Higgs—that I’ve never especially liked the Higgs mechanism. It’s always seemed like a hack. And I’ve always hoped that in the end there’d be something more elegant and deep responsible for something as fundamental as the masses of particles. But it appears that nature is just picking what seems like a pedestrian solution to the problem: the Higgs mechanism in the Standard Model.      Was it worth spending more than 10 billion to find this out? I definitely think so. Now, what’s actually come out is perhaps not the most exciting thing that could have come out. But there’s absolutely no way one could have been sure of this outcome in advance.      Perhaps I’m too used to the modern technology industry where billions of dollars get spent on corporate activities and transactions all the time. But to me spending only 10 billion to get this far in investigating the basic theory of physics seems like quite a bargain.      I think it could be justified almost just for the self-esteem of our species: that despite all our specific issues, we’re continuing a path we’ve been on for hundreds of years, systematically making progress in understanding how our universe works. And somehow there’s something ennobling about seeing what’s effectively a worldwide collaboration of people working together in this direction.      Indeed, staying up late to watch the announcement early yesterday morning reminded me more than a bit of being a kid in England nearly 43 years ago and staying up late to watch the Apollo 11 landing and moonwalk (which was timed to be at prime time in the US but not Europe). But I have to say that for a world achievement yesterday’s “it’s a 5 sigma effect” was distinctly less dramatic than “the Eagle has landed”. To be fair, a particle physics experiment has a rather different rhythm than a space mission. But I couldn’t help feeling a certain sadness for the lack of pizazz in yesterday’s announcement.      Of course, it’s been a long hard road for particle physics these past 30 or so years. Back in the 1950s when particle physics was launched in earnest, there was a certain sense of follow-on and “thank you” for the Manhattan project. And in the 1960s and 1970s the pace of discoveries kept the best and the brightest coming into particle physics. But by the 1980s as particle physics settled into its role as an established academic discipline, there began to be an ever stronger “brain drain”. And by the time the Superconducting Super Collider project was canceled in 1993, it was clear that particle physics had lost its special place in the world of basic research.      Personally, I found it sad to watch. Visiting particle physics labs after absences of 20 years, and seeing crumbling infrastructure in what I had remembered as such vibrant places. In a sense it is remarkable and admirable that through all this thousands of particle physicists persisted, and have now brought us (presumably) the Higgs particle. But watching yesterday’s announcement, I couldn’t help feeling that there was a certain sense of resigned exhaustion.      I suppose I had hoped for something qualitatively different from those particle physics talks I used to hear 40 years ago. Yes, the particle energies were larger, the detector was bigger, and the data rates were faster. But otherwise it seemed like nothing had changed (well, there also seemed to be a new predilection for statistical ideas like p values). There wasn’t even striking and memorable dynamic imagery of prized particle events, making use of all those modern visualization techniques that people like me have worked so hard to develop.      If the Standard Model is correct, yesterday’s announcement is likely to be the last major discovery that could be made in a particle accelerator in our generation. Now, of course, there could be surprises, but it’s not clear how much one should bet on them.      So is it still worth building particle accelerators? Whatever happens, there is clearly great value in maintaining the thread of knowledge that exists today about how to do it. But reaching particle energies where without surprises one can reasonably expect to see new phenomena will be immensely challenging. I have thought for years that investing in radically new ideas for particle acceleration (e.g. higher energies for fewer particles) might be the best bet—though it clearly carries risk.      Could future discoveries in particle physics immediately give us new inventions or technology? Years ago things like “quark bombs” seemed conceivable. But probably no more. Yes, one can use particle beams for their radiation effects. But I certainly wouldn’t expect to see anything like muonic computers, antiproton engines or neutrino tomography systems anytime soon. Of course, all that may change if somehow it’s figured out (and it doesn’t seem obviously impossible) how to miniaturize a particle accelerator.      Over sufficiently long times, basic research has historically tended to be the very best investment one can make. And quite possibly particle physics will be no exception. But I rather expect that the great technological consequences of particle physics will rely more on the development of theory than on more results from experiment. If one figures out how to create energy from the vacuum or transmit information faster than light, it’ll surely be done by applying the theory in new and unexpected ways, rather than by using specific experimental results.      The Standard Model is certainly not the end of physics. There are clearly gaps. We don’t know why parameters like particle masses are the way they are. We don’t know how gravity fits in. And we don’t know about all sorts of things seen in cosmology.      But let’s say we can resolve all this. What then? Maybe then there’ll be another set of gaps and problems. And maybe in a sense there’ll always be a new layer of physics to discover.      I certainly used to assume that. But from my work on A New Kind of Science I developed a different intuition. That in fact there’s no reason all the richness we see in our universe couldn’t arise from some underlying rule—some underlying theory—that’s even quite simple.      There are all sorts of things to say about what that rule might be like, and how one might find it. But what’s important here is that if the rule is indeed simple, then on fundamental grounds one shouldn’t in principle need to know too much information to nail down what it is.      I’m pleased that in some particular types of very low-level models I’ve studied, I’ve already been able to derive Special and General Relativity, and get some hints of quantum mechanics. But there’s plenty more we know in physics that I haven’t yet been able to reproduce.      But what I suspect is that from the experimental results we have, we already know much more than enough to determine what the correct ultimate theory is—assuming that the theory is indeed simple. It won’t be the case that the theory will get the number of dimensions of space and the muon-electron mass ratio right, but will get the Higgs mass or some as-yet-undiscovered detail wrong.      Now of course it could be that something new will be discovered that makes it more obvious what the ultimate theory might look like. But my guess is that we don’t fundamentally need more experimental discoveries; we just need to spend more effort and be better at searching for the ultimate theory based on what we already know. And it’s certainly likely to be true that the human and computer resources necessary to take that search a long way will cost vastly less than actual experiments in particle accelerators.      And indeed, in the end we may find that the data necessary to nail down the ultimate theory already existed 50 years ago. But we won’t know for sure except in hindsight. And once we have a credible candidate for the final theory it may well suggest new particle accelerator experiments to do. And it will be most embarrassing if by then we have no working particle accelerator on which to carry them out.      Particle physics was my first great interest in science. And it is exciting to see now after 40 years a certain degree of closure being reached. And to feel that over the course of that time, at first in particle physics, and later with all the uses of Mathematica, I may have been able to make some small contribution to what has now been achieved. ||||| In confirming what we already thought, the Higgs Boson discovery portends a close to a glorious chapter of particle physics.      CERN      Experimental physicists around the world are celebrating the discovery of the Higgs boson, which was officially announced yesterday. While many of us are trying to figure out what the Higgs boson is, and whether calling it the God particle is stupid, one of the smartest guys in the world, Stephen Wolfram, is sad.      A boy genius who got his CalTech PhD at 20, Wolfram dabbled in particle physics before creating the Mathematica software package, and then WolframAlpha, a \\"computational engine\\" that debuted to considerable fanfare a few years ago.      In an elegiac blog post, Wolfram notes that the discovery of the Higgs brings a lifetime (his lifetime) of physics research to a close. It confirms the \\"Standard Model,\\" which is the putative organization of the subatomic universe that scientists have been working on for decades. That might sound like a good thing, but confirming what we already thought was the case actually is actually a lot less interesting than discovering something fundamentally new. |||||Summary:","output":"The Higgs particle is a tiny particle that scientists have been searching for over 40 years. It's like a missing puzzle piece in understanding how the universe works. Scientists believe it gives other particles their mass, or the amount of matter they have. Recently, they found evidence of this Higgs particle, which is a big deal! It helps us understand more about the little building blocks that make up everything around us. To find the Higgs particle, scientists used giant machines called particle accelerators. They cost a lot of money to build. Some people are sad because they think we might not discover anything more from the machines. Others are hopeful that we might find more interesting things in the future. Overall, the discovery of the Higgs particle is very important because it helps us know more about the universe and how it works."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - In ice hockey, the goaltender is the player responsible for preventing the hockey puck from entering their team's net, thus preventing the opposing team from scoring. The goaltender usually plays in or near the area in front of the net called the \\"goal crease\\" (often referred to simply as \\" the crease\\" or \\"the net\\"). Goaltenders tend to stay at or beyond the top of the crease to cut down on the angle of shots. In today's age of goaltending there are two common styles, butterfly and hybrid (hybrid is a mix of the traditional stand-up style and butterfly technique). Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game. One-on-one situations, such as breakaways and shootouts, have the tendency to highlight a goaltender's pure skill, or lack thereof. Only one goaltender is allowed to be on the ice for each team at any given time.  - A team sport includes any sport which involves two or more players working together towards a shared objective. A team sport is an activity in which individuals are organized into opposing teams which compete to win. Examples are basketball, volleyball, water polo, handball, lacrosse, cricket, baseball, and the various forms of football and hockey.  - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.  - Boules is a collective name for a wide range of games in which the objective is to throw or roll heavy balls (called \\"boules\\" in France, and \\"bocce\\" in Italy) as close as possible to a small target ball.  - HockeyAllsvenskan (previously Allsvenskan and SuperAllsvenskan) is the second-highest league in the Swedish ice hockey system (after the SHL). As of the 201213 season, HockeyAllsvenskan has by far the highest average attendance of any second-tier league in Europe, averaging 3,227 spectators per game. Since the 200910 season, the league consists of fourteen teams.  - Södertälje is a city and the seat of Södertälje Municipality, Stockholm County, Sweden with 75,283 inhabitants in 2014.  - Sweden, officially the Kingdom of Sweden (Swedish: ), is a Scandinavian country in Northern Europe. It borders Norway to the west and Finland to the east, and is connected to Denmark in the southwest by a bridge-tunnel across the Öresund. At , Sweden is the third-largest country in the European Union by area, with a total population of 10.0 million. Sweden consequently has a low population density of , with the highest concentration in the southern half of the country. Approximately 85% of the population lives in urban areas.  - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.  - Northern Europe is the northern part or region of Europe. Although no definitive borders or definition exists for the term, geographically, Northern Europe may be considered to consist approximately of all of Europe above the 52nd parallel north; which includes (from west to east) most or all of: Iceland, the Republic of Ireland, the Isle of Man, the United Kingdom, the Faroe Islands, the Netherlands, northern Germany, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, northern Poland, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and northwest Russia. However, narrower definitions may also be used based on other geographical factors, such as climate and ecology. Greenland, geographically a part of North America, is politically a part of the Kingdom of Denmark, and may be included depending on the definition.  - Granite is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture. Granites can be predominantly white, pink, or gray in color, depending on their mineralogy. The word \\"granite\\" comes from the Latin \\"granum\\", a grain, in reference to the coarse-grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock. By definition, granite is an igneous rock with at least 20% quartz and up to 65% alkali feldspar by volume.  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Ice is water frozen into a solid state. Depending on the presence of impurities such as particles of soil or bubbles of air, it can appear transparent or a more or less opaque bluish-white color.  - Curling is a sport in which players slide stones on a sheet of ice towards a target area which is segmented into four concentric circles. It is related to bowls, boules and shuffleboard. Two teams, each with four players, take turns sliding heavy, polished granite stones, also called \\"rocks\\", across the ice \\"curling sheet\\" towards the \\"house\\", a circular target marked on the ice. Each team has eight stones. The purpose is to accumulate the highest score for a \\"game\\"; points are scored for the stones resting closest to the centre of the house at the conclusion of each \\"end\\", which is completed when both teams have thrown all of their stones. A game usually consists of eight or ten ends.  - Södertälje Municipality (\\"Södertälje kommun\\") is a municipality in Stockholm County in east central Sweden. Its seat is located in the city of Södertälje.  - In geometry, two or more objects are said to be concentric, coaxal, or coaxial when they share the same center or axis. Circles, regular polygons and regular polyhedra, and spheres may be concentric to one another (sharing the same center point), as may cylinders (sharing the same central axis).  - Stockholm (or ) is the capital of Sweden and the most populous city in the Nordic countries; 932,917 people live in the municipality, approximately 1.5 million in the urban area, and 2.3 million in the metropolitan area. The city is spread across 14 islands on the coast in the southeast of Sweden at the mouth of Lake Mälaren, by the Stockholm archipelago and the Baltic Sea. The area has been settled since the Stone Age, in the 6th millennium BC, and was founded as a city in 1252 by a Swedish statesman Birger Jarl. It is also the capital of Stockholm County.  - Norway (; Norwegian: (Bokmål) or (Nynorsk); Sami: \\"Norgga\\"), officially the Kingdom of Norway, is a sovereign and unitary monarchy whose territory comprises the western portion of the Scandinavian Peninsula plus the island Jan Mayen and the archipelago of Svalbard. The Antarctic Peter I Island and the sub-Antarctic Bouvet Island are dependent territories and thus not considered part of the Kingdom. Norway also lays claim to a section of Antarctica known as Queen Maud Land. Until 1814, the Kingdom included the Faroe Islands (since 1035), Greenland (1261), and Iceland (1262). It also included Shetland and Orkney until 1468. It also included the following provinces, now in Sweden: Jämtland, Härjedalen and Bohuslän.  - Denmark is a Scandinavian country in Europe. The southernmost and smallest of the Nordic countries, it is south-west of Sweden and south of Norway, and bordered to the south by Germany. The Kingdom of Denmark is the sovereign state that comprises Denmark proper and two autonomous constituent countries in the North Atlantic Ocean: the Faroe Islands and Greenland. Denmark has a total area of , and a population of 5.7 million. The country consists of a peninsula, Jutland, and an archipelago of 443 named islands, with the largest being Zealand and Funen. The islands are characterised by flat, arable land and sandy coasts, low elevation and a temperate climate.  - Shuffleboard, more precisely deck shuffleboard, and also known as floor shuffleboard, is a game in which players use cues to push weighted discs, sending them gliding down a narrow court, with the purpose of having them come to rest within a marked scoring area.

Just after he bought the house with his ill gotten gains from his band's over-hyped, over-marketed, and over-bought sophomore Disc, he drove me out to see it in his beautiful but nauseating '70 Datsun 240 Z. All the smog combined with the pinball effects of winding up the hill at teeth-numbing speeds had me puking for an hour after we got there. I took the last turn at the top of the hill and watched the rising sun crest over the black blocks of the city, her angel wings soiled and cheapened with the soot of 12 million get-away drivers. Rick's house came into view out of the fog, its large glass panes sparkling like the last clean surface of an oversized ashtray. I parked between a blue hatchback and Rick's favorite toy: a 350 horsepower Impreza he had smuggled here from Japan. All his more expensive rides were in the garage, collecting dust and gaining vintage resale value. I rang the bell. I waited and watched a couple of squirrels fight over a small treasure in the bushes. The door opened. \\"Dingo.\\" \\"Hey, Luna.\\" Her job as Rick's assistant was to take care of his place while he was out being a rock star. She made sure all his bills were paid, his animals were fed, and that the subsequent fallout from any parties she might have in his absence didn't leave any lasting damage.

Shepseskaf was the sixth and last Pharaoh of the Fourth Dynasty of Egypt during the Old Kingdom. He reigned for six to eight years starting around 2510 BC. Despite the relatively short length of his rule, he completed several construction projects and maintained civil stability in the region. He is known for his Mastaba, Mastaba el-Fara'un, which deviated from the standard pyramid shaped tombs of his predecessors. More detailed, Shepseskaf was a Pharaoh of Ancient Egypt and was the son of Pharaoh Menkaure. He is best known for constructing the Mastaba el-Fara'un, which is a rectangular funerary monument rather than a traditional pyramid. This is significant as all other Pharaohs of the Fourth Dynasty had their tombs built as pyramids, demonstrating the architectural evolution of royal tombs during this period. Despite his short reign, Shepseskaf made an impact due to his aforementioned unusual tomb and the mysterious nature of his rule. The exact years and events of his reign are still subject to historical debate. He is often considered a somewhat enigmatic figure due to the scarcity of records about his reign. This has led to speculation and differing theories among Egyptologists regarding his rule and his relations with his predecessors. In conclusion, Shepseskaf carries significance in Egypt's history as a Pharaoh who broke the mold and whose legacy continues to inspire discussion and research among historians and archaeologists even today. His contributions to the culture, architecture, and history of ancient Egypt underline the importance of the continuity and change in Egyptian society during the Old Kingdom period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, Pongo sets his eyes on a beautiful female dalmatian named Perdita. After a frantic chase through the streets and into St. James's Park, Roger and Pongo discover that Perdita likes Pongo. Her owner, Anita Campbell-Green (Joely Richardson), falls in love with Roger when they meet. After they both end up falling into the lake as a result of their dogs, they return to Roger's home, and Anita accepts his proposal. They get married along with Perdita and Pongo. Anita works as a fashion designer at the House of de Vil.

Anita, inspired by her dalmatian, designs a coat made with spotted fur. Cruella is intrigued by the idea of making garments out of actual dalmatians and finds it amusing that it would seem as if she was wearing Anita's dog. Anita soon discovers that Perdita is pregnant, and is then informed that she is too, much to her shock. Some time later, Cruella visits their home, and expresses contempt upon meeting Roger. Her initial disgust at them having a baby turns to excitement when she finds out Perdita is expecting too.

Although the statement \\"The prohibitive duty was gradually reduced and finally abolished in 1742\\" provides a specific date (1742) regarding the abolition of prohibitive duties associated with the Gin Act 1736, it is not a complete or fully detailed answer to the question, \\"When were the Gin Act 1736 duties eliminated?\\" A more comprehensive and informative response would include additional details about the different measures and changes to the legislation leading up to the eventual elimination of these duties. A better answer would be: The duties imposed by the Gin Act 1736, which aimed to curb the consumption of gin in England, were not eliminated all at once, but instead underwent a series of revisions and reductions over time. The initial prohibitive tax proved to be unpopular and led to widespread evasion. In response, several amendments were made to the Gin Act throughout the 1730s and 1740s, including the Gin Act 1738 which reduced the tax rates to a more manageable level. The major milestone towards elimination of these duties was the Gin Act 1743, which significantly reformed the taxation system once again. This legislation introduced a new, less prohibitive tax, shifted the focus onto licensing retailers rather than producers, and incentivized the legal sale of gin. Under this new system, the production and consumption of gin became more regulated and better controlled. The earlier prohibitive duties associated with the Gin Act 1736 were effectively eliminated by the time this new legislation was introduced in 1743, although it is important to note that some taxes on gin remained in place. These subsequent taxes, however, were at levels that allowed for a more balanced and sustainable gin industry and a marked reduction in the social problems that had necessitated the original Gin Act."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Dialogue:  W: We've all heard the saying \\"Laughter is the best medicine.\\" How important is it to our health, Dr. Berk?  M: This saying has been scientifically proven! A year-long study of heart attack victims done at the Oakhurst Health Research Institute in California found that of those patients who spent half an hour a day watching comedy videos, 10 percent had a second heart attack, whereas 30 percent of those who did not watch had a second attack.  W: Wow! Laughter is really a good medicine to patients. Can you give us another example?  M: Sure! Norman Cousins, editor of the Saturday Review, learned this during a battle with an illness. He discovered that his condition improved when he enjoyed himself and watched funny movies.  W: You said Norman learned this? Do we have to learn to laugh?  M: Not necessarily. Since laughing is something people can do sitting down, costs no money, and requires no special exercise equipment or skill, it's the perfect workout for anyone who doesn't have the time or desire to participate in a regular fitness program.  W: Oh. Do you have such a program to offer to the general public?  M: Yes, we do. It's called the Smile Time-Out. You take a deep breath, smile, exhale, and say \\"Aaah\\" while visualizing all your muscles and cells smiling. Then add to that a memory of a time you felt really good and laughed and laughed.  W: What about the situation in which you aren't in a mood to laugh?  M: Even when you fake a smile or laugh, you get the same physiological benefits as when it's the real thing, because your mind is smart, but your body is stupid and can't tell the difference!  Question: What can we learn about smile or laugh according to Dr. Berk?   - Even a fake one can benefit people physiologically just as well as a real one.  - You can't fool your body by pretending to be happy.  - A smart mind can't tell the difference between a fake one and a real one.","output":"According to Dr. Berk, we can learn several things about smiling or laughing: 1. Even a fake smile or laugh can benefit people physiologically just as well as a real one. This is because our body responds to the physical act of smiling or laughing, regardless of whether the emotion behind it is genuine or not. 2. We can, in fact, fool our body by pretending to be happy. When we smile or laugh, even if it's not genuine, our body still experiences the positive effects associated with the action, such as the release of endorphins and a decrease in stress hormones. 3. Our mind may be smart, but our body cannot tell the difference between a fake smile or laugh and a real one. This means that even when we're not genuinely happy, engaging in the act of smiling or laughing can still lead to a more positive state and the various health benefits it provides. In addition to these points, Dr. Berk also mentions the importance of laughter in promoting overall health and well-being. Laughter has been proven to have significant physiological effects, such as reduced stress, improved immune function, and a decrease in the risk of heart attacks. Moreover, incorporating laughter and smiling into our daily lives in the form of the Smile Time-Out program can offer an accessible way for individuals to experience these benefits without the need for strenuous exercise or other demanding activities."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

December 93 BC  52 BC, on January 18 of the pre-Julian calendar) was a Roman politician known for his popularist tactics. As tribune, he pushed through an ambitious legislative program, including a grain dole, but he is chiefly remembered for his feud with Marcus Tullius Cicero and Titus Annius Milo, whose bodyguards murdered him on the Appian Way.  - Catullus 85 is a poem by the Roman poet Catullus for his mistress Lesbia . \`\` Odi et amo . quare id faciam , fortasse requiris ? nescio , sed fieri sentio et excrucior . '' I hate and I love . Why do I do this , perhaps you ask ? I do not know , but I feel it happen and it is excruciating . Its declaration of conflicting feelings \`\` I hate and I love '' ( in Latin , Odi et amo ) is renowned for its force and brevity . The meter of the poem is the elegiac couplet .  - A hero (masculine) or heroine (feminine) is a person or main character of a literary work who, in the face of danger, combats adversity through impressive feats of ingenuity, bravery or strength, often sacrificing his or her own personal concerns for some greater good.  - Gaius Valerius Catullus (c. 84  54 BC) was a Latin poet of the late Roman Republic who wrote in the neoteric style of poetry, which is about personal life rather than classical heroes. His surviving works are still read widely, and continue to influence poetry and other forms of art.  - The Neotericoi (Greek  \\"new poets\\") or Neoterics were a series of avant-garde Greek and Latin poets who wrote during the Hellenistic period (323-31 BC). Neoteric poets deliberately turned away from classical Homeric epic poetry. Rather than focusing on the feats of ancient heroes and gods, they propagated a new style of poetry through stories that operated on a smaller scale in themes and setting. The time range in which these poets wrote is sometimes called the Neoteric period.  - Lesbia was the literary pseudonym used by the Roman poet Gaius Valerius Catullus (ca. 8252 BC) to refer to his lover. Lesbia is traditionally identified with Clodia, the wife of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Celer and sister of Publius Clodius Pulcher; her conduct and motives are maligned in Cicero's extant speech \\"Pro Caelio,\\" delivered in 56 BC.  - Pro Caelio is a speech given on April 4, 56 BC, by the famed Roman orator Marcus Tullius Cicero in defence of Marcus Caelius Rufus, who had once been Cicero's student but more recently was a political rival. Cicero's reasons for defending Caelius are uncertain though various theories have been postulated. The \\"Pro Caelio\\" is regarded as one of the best examples of Roman oratory known, and has been so regarded throughout history. It is noteworthy as a prime example of Ciceronian oratorical technique.  - Clodia (born Claudia, c. 95 or 94 BC), nicknamed Quadrantaria, and occasionally referred to in scholarship as Clodia Metelli (\\"Clodia the wife of Metellus\\"), was one of three known daughters of the ancient Roman patrician Appius Claudius Pulcher and either Caecilia Metella Balearica, or her cousin, Caecilia Metella daughter of Lucius Caecilius Metellus Diadematus.  - The Roman Republic was the era of ancient Roman civilization beginning with the overthrow of the Roman Kingdom, traditionally dated to 509 BC, and ending in 27 BC with the establishment of the Roman Empire. It was during this period that Rome's control expanded from the city's immediate surroundings to hegemony over the entire Mediterranean world.  - A poet is a person who writes poetry.

Information:  - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners.  - Radio frequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around to , which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals.

This indicates that Barik did manage to make contact with the northerner, even if it wasn't an ideal or direct hit on his intended target. When Barik swung his sword, aiming for the northerner, instead of missing entirely, he hit the hand-guard protecting the northerner's hand that was holding the rapier. This may have been an intentional defensive move by the northerner to deflect or block the blow, or perhaps it was an unintentional consequence of the position and movements of the two during the confrontation. Moreover, this information suggests that the two were engaged in close combat, with Barik attempting to strike the northerner and the northerner defending himself with his rapier. Barik's sword crashing into the hand-guard of the rapier may have potentially caused some damage, be it minor or significant, to the northerner's weapon or his ability to wield it, based on the hardness of the impact.

Eakins referred to the painting as Swimming in 1885, and as The Swimmers in 1886. The title The Swimming Hole dates from 1917 (the year after Eakins died), when the work was so described by the artist's widow, Susan Macdowell Eakins. Four years later, she titled the work The Old Swimming Hole, in reference to the 1882 poem The Old Swimmin'-Hole; by James Whitcomb Riley. The Amon Carter Museum has since returned to Eakins' original title, Swimming.The painting shows Eakins and five friends or students bathing at Dove Lake, an artificial lake in Mill Creek outside Philadelphia. Each of the men is looking at the water, in the words of Martin A. Berger, \\"apparently lost in a contemplative moment\\". Eakins' precise rendering of the figures has enabled scholars to identify all those depicted in the work. They are (from left to right): Talcott Williams (1849–1928), Benjamin Fox (c. 1865 – c. 1900), J. Laurie Wallace (1864–1953), Jesse Godley (1862–1889), Harry the dog (Eakins' Irish Setter, c. 1880–90), George Reynolds (c. 1839–89), and Eakins himself. The rocky promontory on which several of the men rest is the foundation of the Mill Creek mill, which was razed in 1873. It is the only sign of civilization in the work—no shoes, clothes, or bath houses are visible. The foliage in the background provides a dark background against which the swimmers' skin tones contrast. The positioning of the bodies and their musculature refers to classical ideals of physical beauty and masculine camaraderie evocative of Greek art. The reclining figure is a paraphrase of the Dying Gaul, and is juxtaposed with the far less formal self-depiction by the artist. It is possible that Eakins was seeking to reconcile an ancient theme with a modern interpretation; the subject was contemporary, but the poses of some of the figures recall those of classical sculpture. One possible influence by a contemporary source was Scène d'été, painted in 1869 by Frédéric Bazille (1841–70). It is not unlikely that Eakins saw the painting at the Salon while...

The initial statement, \\"People riding their bikes,\\" is a fairly broad statement that encompasses various scenarios. It does not specify the number of cyclists, their intentions or motivations for riding, whether they are riding together or separately, the type of location or environment they are in, or the presence of other individuals such as onlookers. On the other hand, the second statement, \\"Two cyclists racing down a street filled with onlookers, the one in the lead looking over his shoulder,\\" is quite specific and detailed. It describes a certain situation that includes several specific elements, namely: 1. There are two cyclists involved. 2. The cyclists are racing, which implies a competitive aspect. 3. The street is filled with onlookers, suggesting that this event is either organized or of general interest in the community. 4. The lead cyclist is looking over his shoulder, which could imply various things such as the lead cyclist gauging their opponent's position or possibly a concern for safety. Given the difference in the level of detail and context, it is not possible to conclude that \\"Two cyclists racing down a street filled with onlookers, the one in the lead looking over his shoulder,\\" if all we know is \\"People riding their bikes.\\" The initial statement is too general and does not provide enough information to draw the specific conclusion described. However, it is important to note that the scenario described in the second statement could very well fall under the broader umbrella of \\"people riding their bikes.\\" It is just one of many possible situations that could occur when people are riding their bikes.

Step-by-step process: 1. Choose the appropriate sandpaper: Select a coarse grit sandpaper (80 to 120 grit) to start shaping the edge of the wood and switch to a finer grit (180 to 220 grit) once the desired level of roundness is achieved for a smoother finish. 2. Sand the edge at an angle: Hold the block of wood securely, and start sanding the edge at a 45-degree angle with the coarse sandpaper, applying even pressure as you move back and forth along the edge. 3. Round the edge: Gradually increase the angle while sanding the edge, until you reach the desired level of roundness. 4. Smooth the edge: Switch to the finer grit sandpaper and sand the rounded edge in the same manner as the coarser grit. This step helps to achieve a smooth finish and remove any remaining rough spots. 5. Clean the wood: Use a dry, clean cloth or brush to remove any sanding dust from the wood's surface and rounded edge. 6. Finish the wood: If desired, apply a wood finish such as oil or clear varnish to protect and enhance the appearance of the rounded edge and the wood block itself. By following these steps and choosing to use sandpaper, the rounded edge on the block of wood can be achieved effectively and with precision."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  I am facing a new situation today: The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which group of larvae had fewer changes in their RNA sequence? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided and the new situation, we can deduce the following: Step 1: Understand the background article - Mutations are changes in the DNA or RNA sequence - Two types of mutations: germline and somatic - Germline mutations occur in sex cells and are potentially serious, can be passed down to the next generation - Somatic mutations occur in body cells and do not pass to offspring, but can still have potential consequences such as cancer Step 2: Apply the background information to the situation - Group L displayed all kinds of mutations - Group D did not display any mutations Step 3: Answer the question The question asks which group of larvae had fewer changes in their RNA sequence. Since Group D did not display any mutations, it can be concluded that Group D had fewer changes in their RNA sequence compared to Group L.  Answer: Group D had fewer changes in their RNA sequence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Article: Former President Jimmy Carter believes U.S central intelligence agency is spying on him -- so much so, he gives up email to avoid government spies. \\"You know, I have felt that my own communications are probably monitored,\\" Carter told NBC's Andrea Mitchell in an interview broadcast Sunday. \\"And when I want to communicate with a foreign leader privately, I type or write a letter myself, put it in the post office and mail it. \\"I believe if I send an email, it will be monitored,\\" Carter continued. The 89-year-old said the National Security Agency and others have abused the argument that gathering intelligence is important to homeland security. \\"That has been extremely liberalized and, I think, abused by our own intelligence agencies,\\" Carter said. The 39th president, however, stopped short of criticizing No. 44 over the handling of the N.S.A. scandal , the crisis in Ukraine or anything else. \\"I don't have any criticism of him,\\" Carter said of Obama.

Choices: * yes; * no;","output":"Yes, it is correct that Equerry Frederick Ponsonby discovered that Victoria's new Munshi lied about his parentage. Abdul Karim, also known as the Munshi, was an Indian servant who became a close confidant and teacher of Queen Victoria, instructing her in Urdu and Indian affairs. However, some aspects of his background were falsified or exaggerated when he first arrived in England.  Frederick Ponsonby was the private secretary of Edward VII when he was still Prince of Wales and an equerry, a personal attendant or officer, to Queen Victoria. He was the son of Sir Henry Ponsonby, the Queen's private secretary, and played a crucial role in unveiling the truth about the Munshi's background. Ponsonby discovered that Abdul Karim had not been truthful about his parentage and social status, and he subsequently reported his findings to Lord Elgin, the Viceroy of India at the time. In his report, Ponsonby compared Abdul Karim's role in the royal household to that of John Brown – a close personal servant of Queen Victoria whose intimate relationship with her had ignited much gossip and speculation. Although the Munshi's deception was eventually revealed, Queen Victoria remained fond of him, and he maintained an influential position within the royal household until her death in 1901."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And make sure you're drinking enough water. Dehydration can often contribute to chapped lips.\\" Step 5: Create a sense of hope and a potential resolution Now that Michael has provided insight, Adam feels hopeful about resolving his issue.

None of the permanent guards or guard managers would be forced to quit their employment, the company said. RMT union said it was in formal dispute with Merseyrail and its 220 members would be balloted for strike action. John Tilley, of RMT, said Merseyrail had failed to give cast iron assurances on the future of 220 guards and managers at a meeting on Wednesday, and he \\"fully expected\\" members to vote heavily for industrial action. RMT general secretary Mick Cash said: \\"We will not agree to any extensions of DOO and will fight to retain the safety critical role of the guard and to keep a guard on the train.\\" He said the train operator had \\"snubbed\\" a final chance to avoid the ballot. He added it was \\"entirely preventable if the company had listened to the union's deep-seated safety concerns... and had put passenger safety before profit\\". Merseyrail said it had \\"made it clear\\" that it will look after guards and management whose roles would no longer exist once the new fleet is introduced and there would be no compulsory redundancies. The train operator said the RMT had demanded there should be a guard on every new train but the new fleet had been designed to operate without guards, and as such, it was not in a position to guarantee this. The existing Merseyrail fleet, originally designed in the 1950s, is almost 40 years old.

There's a group called RMT, kind of like a club that protects the workers, and they're not happy about this. They're worried about the safety of passengers and want to keep guards on the trains. They might even go on strike, which is like refusing to do their work to show they are unhappy. But Merseyrail says they've planned for this and the new trains don't need guards to operate safely.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device The Reds' £34m summer signing from Southampton reacted first to a loose ball after substitute Daniel Sturridge's shot had hit the post in the fourth of eight minutes of stoppage time. Everton, who had lost goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg to injury in the second half, have now won just one of their past 20 meetings with their local rivals. Liverpool - who moved up to second - created the better chances, with Stekelenburg and his replacement Joel Robles saving well from Roberto Firmino. There was a flashpoint in the second half when a dreadful tackle by Ross Barkley on Jordan Henderson sparked angry scenes and the Everton midfielder was fortunate to escape with only a yellow card from referee Mike Dean. Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp's celebrations at the final whistle carried an extra edge as Mane's late strike sealed three points they desperately needed to keep in touch with Premier League leaders Chelsea. Liverpool are six points behind Antonio Conte's side and will surely take great satisfaction from digging out a vital victory that was based on grit rather than the flowing football that has been their trademark this season. The hosts' high tempo start put the Reds on the back foot but as the game went on they exerted greater control and in the end deserved the win simply for looking the more dangerous side and creating the better chances. And once again Sturridge proved how important he can be to Klopp and Liverpool's cause - despite being marginalised or injured for much of the season - with the run and shot that struck the post before Mane swooped to win the 227th Merseyside derby. Liverpool needed to bounce back from the stumbles of a shock 4-3 defeat at Bournemouth and a home draw against West Ham United. They have done so in style with away wins at Middlesbrough and now Everton. Everton's record in Merseyside derbies has been a tale of almost unbroken misery since their last win, a 2-0 win against Roy Hodgson's Liverpool in October 2010. There are, however, signs of improvement and they will feel unfortunate not to hold out here and concede so late on. For the first 45 minutes they adhered to boss Ronald Koeman's demand for a high-intensity pressing game but ran out of steam after the break, not helped by the loss of James McCarthy to injury. Substitute Gareth Barry may still possess the old guile, but sadly for him and Everton the legs are also ageing and he was miles off the pace - though his substitute appearance did take him second behind Ryan Giggs in the list of most Premier League games played. Everton also failed to give sufficient support to main marksman Romelu Lukaku and Koeman will surely be looking to address this problem in the January transfer window. There are signs that the Toffees are now moving in the right direction, despite suffering their first home Premier League defeat of the season - but Koeman still has much to do. Barkley has been the centre of much attention this season, whether as the victim of tough love from Koeman or with transfer speculation as he enters the last 18 months of his contract. Here he was centre of attention for different reasons after a late touchline lunge on his England team-mate Henderson in the second half that was somehow only punished with a yellow card. It led to angry exchanges between the players, and Henderson and Barkley also clashed later, the latter wisely not rising to the Liverpool captain's bait. Barkley's night was summed up by a wild cross into the Gwladys Street that brought a furious response from his manager. These are tough times for the talented 23-year-old midfielder. Everton manager Ronald Koeman told BBC Sport: \\"We are really disappointed to concede in extra time. The eight minutes killed us. \\"We have to wait to see about Maarten Stekelenburg's injury - we will know more tomorrow - and James McCarthy has a hamstring injury. \\"I know exactly how fast Sadio Mane is, he reacted so well. We did not deserve to concede this goal. \\"Maybe Ross Barkley was lucky, it was a hard tackle.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp told BBC Sport: \\"I don't agree it was a poor first half. Maybe not the best football - you have to adapt to Everton's wild game. A game like this you have to interrupt their rhythm with passing. \\"In the second half it was clear they couldn't do the same. We were better, we didn't give one chance away I think. \\"The goal was not the hardest shot from Sturridge, but hard enough. It was a wonderful feeling. \\"I don't like the flares too much. I'm a little bit scared about this. It was a long, long stoppage time. We gave them no chance.\\" On Barkley's tackle on Henderson: \\"I saw it one time. Everything is clear. I think the referee had a difficult game.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: I usually doubt about any research that concludes that people are either happier or unhappier or more or less certain of themselves than they were 50 years ago.While any of these statements might be true, they are practically impossible to prove scientifically. Still, 1 was struck by a report which concluded that today's children are significantly more anxious than children in the 1950s. In fact, the analysis showed, normal children between 9 and 17 have a higher level of anxiety today than children who were treated for mental illness 50 years ago. Why are America's kids so stressed? The report cites two main causes: increasing physical isolation   brought on by high divorce rates and less involvement in community, and a growing perception that the world is a more dangerous place. Given that _ , adults can still do plenty to help the next generation to cope. At the top of the list,nurturing   is a better appreciation of the limits of individualism. No child is an island. Strengthening social ties helps build communities and protect individuals against stress. To help kids build stronger connections with others, you can pull the plug on TVs and computers. Your family will thank you later.They will then have more time for face-to-face relationships, and they will get more sleep. Limit the amount of virtual   violence your children are exposed to. It's not just video games and movies; children see a lot of murder and crime on the local news. Keep your expectations for your children reasonable. Many highly successful people never attended Harvard or Yale. Make exercise part of your daily routine. It will help you deal with your own anxieties and provide a good model for your kids. Sometimes anxiety is unavoidable,but it doesn't have to ruin your life. Question: What does the author mean by saying \\" we can't turn the clock back(Para. 3)? Answer: Answer:","output":"The author means that we cannot reverse or undo the changes that have taken place in society and the world over the past 50 years. In the context of the article, this refers to the increasing anxiety levels in children and the factors contributing to it, such as higher divorce rates, decreased community involvement, and the perception of a more dangerous world. By saying \\"we can't turn the clock back,\\" the author acknowledges that we cannot revert to the conditions of the past when children seemingly experienced less anxiety. Instead, the focus should be on finding ways to help the current and future generations cope with the challenges and stressors they face today, by promoting stronger social connections, limiting exposure to violence, and encouraging healthy habits like exercise."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: Trying to drive up a very small street with cars parked on both sides so only one car at a time could get by, individual sees me already entered the roadway, got in the car backs out of his driveway, intending to for me to back all the way out. I was about half in. I wait thinking he will realize it was a not so smart action and he will pull back in to let me pass since forward is an easier safer plan. He doesn't do that we sit for anout 30 seconds and he is determined to stay. I was a fairly new driver in my first car. I get irritated and shut my motor off basically saying, buddy I entered the street first you were parked never looked before you hurriedly pulled forward. So he shuts off his motor and smiled good as to say stalemate. I'm thinking I have no place I have to be, I'll wait rather than trying to back up half the block without hitting somebodies car. We wait, he gets out of his car goes into his house, no cell phone back then it was the pager (beepers) era. I wasnt sure why he was going in, but probably nit good outcome for me. So I happened to have a small bottle of Keri Lotion (thick, oily lotion for extremely dry skin) in the cup holder. I jump out of my car run to his squirted the whole bottle all over his windshield ran back to my car and DID manage to back up rapidly without damaging my car or anyone! He ran out of the house and I saw by his facial expression was livid! I was thinking as I drove away I hope he doesn't try to use the wipers, that's going to make a really smear mess. He's not going anyplace for a while. Years later I regretted having done that, letting a stranger provoke me, and second felt guilty about the sheer gleeful triumph of seeing his face. I won!

He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, car B would contribute to a less cleaner atmosphere. This is because car B is older and does not have a catalytic converter, which is responsible for converting harmful gases into less harmful substances, helping to create a cleaner atmosphere.

Original traditional Arabic weddings are supposed to be very similar to modern-day Bedouin weddings and rural weddings, and they are in some cases unique from one region to another, even within the same country. it must be mentioned that what some people today call \\"Bedouin\\" wedding is in fact the original true traditional Arab Islamic wedding without foreign influence. The marriage process usually starts with meetings between the couple's families, and ends with the wedding's consummation (leilat al-dokhla). In Old Palestine, the henna night was a night used to prepare all the necessary wedding decorations and last minute arrangements. It was also a chance for the families to celebrate together before the wedding. The groom's family would sahij or dance through the streets of the village until reaching the house of the bride. Once there, the family would mix henna together, which would then be used to decorate the bride and grooms hands (with the groom's being merely the initials of his bride and himself), and then offer the bride her mahr (usually gold as it does not decline in value like other wealth). The families would then dance and sing traditional Palestinian music.  In modern times, particularly those not living in Palestine, the henna night remains traditional in customs, but is very similar to a bachelorette party; the bride's female friends and relatives join her in celebrating, which includes food, drinks, and a lot of dancing. A women's group plays Arabic music, sometimes Islamic music, while everyone dances. A woman draws henna or mehndi, a temporary form of skin decoration using henna, on the bride and guests' skin -- usually the palms and feet, where the henna color will be darkest because the skin contains higher levels of keratin there, which binds temporarily to lawsone, the colorant of henna.  The men will also have a party, in which the groom's family and friends will dance to traditional Palestinian music. In some village customs, the groom's face is shaven by a close family member or friend in preparation for his wedding. The tradition of giving the bride her gold is also still used. The groom will enter where the bride is, they well both get their henna done, and the groom will then offer the bride her mahr. Thus, the wedding being merely dancing and celebration.  An important element of the henna night in both traditional and non-traditional henna parties, is the dress adorned by the Palestinian women and the groom. The women dress in traditional (usually hand embroidered) gowns, known as Palestinian ithyab. The brides thobe would be extravagant and exquistely embroidered. The groom will wear the usual traditional Arab men's thobe and hata (head covering). Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Are the couple allowed to see each other on henna night ?","output":"Yes, the couple is allowed to see each other on the henna night. During this celebration, the groom will enter where the bride is, and they both get their henna done together. After that, the groom will offer the bride her mahr (gift). So, they do see and spend time together during the henna night."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Information:  - A vacuum solution is a solution of a field equation in which the sources of the field are taken to be identically zero. That is, such field equations are written without matter interaction (i.e.- set to zero).  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity.  - In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. QFT treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta.  - Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetrical state ends up in an asymmetrical state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry.  - The Sapienza University of Rome, (Italian: Sapienza  Università di Roma), also called simply Sapienza or the \\"University of Rome\\", is a collegiate research university located in Rome, Italy. Formally known as Università degli Studi di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\", it is the largest European university by enrollments (the third if considering also the distance learning schools) and one of the oldest in history, founded in 1303. The University is also the most prestigious Italian university and also the best ranked in Southern Europe.  - In physics, symmetry breaking is a phenomenon in which (infinitesimally) small fluctuations acting on a system crossing a critical point decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a bifurcation is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or \\"noise\\"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called symmetry \\"breaking\\", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but disorderly state into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is supposed to play a major role in pattern formation.  - In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being raised to an excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature).  - Southern Europe is the southern region of the European continent. Most definitions of Southern Europe, also known as Mediterranean Europe, include the countries of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the Italian peninsula, Southern France, Greece and Malta. Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of Southeast Europe, which are geographically technically in the southern part of Europe, but which have different historical, political, economic, and cultural backgrounds that commonly places them in the category of Eastern Europe.  - Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics.  - The Accademia dei Lincei (literally the \\"Academy of the Lynx-Eyed\\", but anglicised as the Lincean Academy) is an Italian science academy, located at the Palazzo Corsini on the Via della Lungara in Rome, Italy.  - In physics, quasiparticles and collective excitations (which are closely related) are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves \\"as if\\" it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space. For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei; however it \\"approximately\\" behaves like an electron with a \\"different mass\\" (effective mass) traveling unperturbed through free space. This \\"electron\\" with a different mass is called an \\"electron quasiparticle\\". In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor is the same as if the semiconductor instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called holes. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), plasmons (particles derived from plasma oscillations), and many others.  - Giovanni Jona - Lasinio ( born 1932 ) , sometimes called Gianni Jona , is an Italian theoretical physicist , best known for his works on quantum field theory and statistical mechanics .

Q: Here's where I think the distinction lies - I may be wrong, and call me out if you want, but here goes:    So, believe all victims is a good and noble idea at a basic level.  When a victim of a crime comes forward, the people that they trust should absolutely support them, and help them get help and try to make it as easy as possible to get the police involved - not necessarily influence them to go to the authorities, but that's where crimes *should* go, for a number of reasons.    This becomes a less tenable position when a) the justice system gets involved and b) when there are real world consequences for leveling an accusation.    With the Jussie Smollett case, we see both of those in play.  When the police investigation unfolded, they were able to put forth compelling evidence against his claim.  The second set is more nuanced, but this is how I see it:  His claims had a major effect to divide the country.  Seeing these claims would have such an effect, it gives us good reason to scrutinize his story.  When we scrutinize the story, we find some major holes (two maga people out after 2 in intensely cold weather, in Chicago, apparently knowing where Smollett was, and being prepared for that confrontation, his refusal to hand over his phone, he walked home and waited 40 minutes or so before calling the police) and we have a good reason to step back a bit from the narrative and wait for an investigation to conclude before deciding.    In short, believe all victims is a good idea, but it becomes more nuanced when there are real consequences that may hurt or jail others, at which time we should scrutinize the story or let the professionals do their job.

On June 22, 2012, the band announced that their sixth album would be titled Awakened and the first single \\"Cauterize\\" was released on June 25, 2012. On September 12, 2012, As I Lay Dying released their second single \\"A Greater Foundation\\" with a corresponding music video. The album was released on September 25, 2012 and \\"Cauterize\\" was available on the band's website as a free download for a 24-hour period. As I Lay Dying won the \\"Metal Band of the Year\\" award from Loudwire in 2012, beating other well-known bands, including Anthrax and Lamb of God.

There are many unanswered questions, and the situation will become clearer in the coming days and weeks. We'll keep you informed as best we can.\\" They also stated that their thoughts were \\"with Tim, his family, and with everyone else affected by this terrible situation.\\" Eight days later, the band cancelled their mid-2013 tour with Killswitch Engage, stating that \\"we feel that it is best for the band to be off the road while the current situation gets sorted\\".

Rather than continue on without Lambesis, Mancino, along with former members Phil Sgrosso, Nick Hipa, and Josh Gilbert, decided to focus on a different style of music under a different band name, Wovenwar, with Shane Blay as the vocalist, This project took shape long before Lambesis' plea. although Mancino still remains a member of As I Lay Dying. During this period of time Lambesis was also working on music and found time to release the third full length from Austrian Death Machine called Triple Brutal.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full professional name of the person who sand lead vocals in his bands cover of \\"Act Naturally\\"?  Sir Richard Starkey  (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others. After the band's break-up in 1970, he released several successful singles including the US number-four hit \\"It Don't Come Easy\\", and number ones \\"Photograph\\" and \\"You're Sixteen\\". In 1972, he released his most successful UK single, \\"Back Off Boogaloo\\", which peaked at number two. He achieved commercial and critical success with his 1973 album Ringo, which was a top-ten release in both the UK and the US.

The equation is 1330 = 2780588*s - 2780528*s - 1190. We have two terms with s, 2780588*s and -2780528*s, so let's combine them. 2780588*s - 2780528*s = (2780588-2780528)*s = 60*s Now, the equation is 1330 = 60*s - 1190. Step 2: Simplify the equation by adding 1190 to both sides. 1330 + 1190 = 60*s - 1190 + 1190 2520 = 60*s Step 3: Divide both sides by 60. 2520/60 = (60*s)/60 42 = s The solution is s = 42."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 1: Take out an ice cube tray Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: No effect Step 2: Fill the tray with water from the faucet Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: Less effect (Assuming water is still available, solar activity would cause water to evaporate more quickly, making it harder to fill the tray but not directly affecting this step) Step 3: Put the ice cube tray in the freezer Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: No effect Step 4: Wait for several hours Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: No effect Step 5: The water will freeze and become ice Effect of stripping the Earth's atmosphere: Less effect (With no atmosphere, the Earth's surface will be significantly colder.

The first important difference is in the man's role.The traditional husband was the head of the household because he was the only one who worked outside the home.If the wife worked for money,then the husband was not considered to be a good provider,In many families today,both husband and wife work for money.Therefore,they share the role of head of household.In addition,the traditional husband usually made big decisions about spending money.However,the modern husband shares these decisions with his working wife.Also,the traditional husband did not help his wife with housework or meal preparation.  Dinner was ready when he came home,In contrast,the modern husband helps his working wife at home.He may do some of the household chores,and it is not unusual for him to cook. The second difference is in the woman's role. In the traditional family,the woman may have worked for miney during her first years of marriage.However,when she gave birth,she would usually give up her job. Her primary role would be to take care of her family and home.In contrast,in many families today,the modern woman works outside the home even after she has children .She's doing two jobs instead of one,so she is busier than the traditional mother was.The traditional wife learned to live within her husband's income.But the modern wife does not have to because the family has two incomes. The final difference is in the role of the children .In the traditional family,the children were taken care of by the mother because she didn't work outside.However,today pre-school children may go to a child-care center or to a baby-sitter regularly because the mother works.The school-age children of a traditional family were more dependent.Their mother was there to help them get ready for school and to make their breakfast.In conrtast,modern children are more independent.They have to get up early and get ready for school themselves,and they may even have to make their own breakfast.

News article: This summer, Michael Phelps is swimming for his last time at the Olympics and collecting a few more gold medals along the way. Outside of his extensive hardware collection, Phelps has helped Under Armour and agency Droga5 hit some major milestones with his \\"Rule Yourself\\" ad, including a Film Craft Grand Prix at the Cannes Lions festival. Now it's become one of the most shared Olympics spots ever.      New data from Unruly shows the Phelps Under Armour spot is now the second most shared Olympics ad for 2016—behind Channel 4's incredible Paralympics spot \\"We're The Superhumans,\\"—and the fifth most shared Olympics spot of all time.      What makes the ad, created by Droga5, so sharable?      For one, it's striking the right emotional chord with its target audience: millennial men between the ages of 18 and 34. The dramatic nature of the Phelps spot (with a killer track from The Kills) and its ability to take viewers through the swimmer's intense training process elicited a sense of inspiration among 47 percent of overall viewers, and 68 percent of millennial men.      Twenty-two percent of viewers reported feeling amazement watching the athlete training and even undergoing some extraordinarily painful-looking sessions of cupping therapy. Millennials also felt happiness and surprise—all key emotions needed to engage younger viewers, according to Unruly.      \\"Something we've learned from all of the ads we tested if we look at different demographics and the emotions that are most resonant to them, for millennials—especially male millennials—inspiration is one of the top emotions. If that is present at all in an ad, they tend to experience it,\\" Devra Prywes, VP, marketing and insight at Unruly, said. Prywes noted that the inspiration factor seemed to be lacking in a lot of Super Bowl spots from this year but stands out in many Olympics spots, which is likely helping to propel shares for the Olympic ads.      To date, 56 percent of the spots' shares are coming from Facebook, followed by Twitter at 28 percent.      Prywes contended that Under Armour has successfully been able to consistently create authentic spots, with stars from Misty Copeland to the U.S. Women's Gymnastics team. Each piece of work continues to inspire and amaze audiences while also building a sense of pride in viewers, according to the data.      Droga5 co-head of strategy Harry Roman echoed Prywes, adding that the Phelps ad is so shareable because it's able to convey the sacrifice that the swimmer makes each day to prepare for Rio.      \\"I think people connect with this film because it paints hard work and sacrifice with beautiful strokes, but does so in a way that is raw and real about what it takes to win. I would like to think that this film and the stirring lyrics, 'It's The Last Goodbye,' are playing in the back of people's minds when they see him smiling on the podium. We probably won't ever see another athlete like Michael Phelps for a very long time,\\" Roman said.      Added Prywes: \\"Especially with younger viewers, over three-quarters will lose trust in a brand if an ad feels fake. Under Armour's recent campaigns are all consistently authentic. They're doing a really nice job of drawing this out and creating new content that all work really well together in their content stack, in this authentic way of portraying athletes and their origin stories, showing the things that you don't always see.\\"      Take a look at some additional data from Unruly below. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Read this and answer the question The Roman legions first entered the area under Decimus Junius Brutus in 137–136 BC, but the country was only incorporated into the Roman Empire by the time of Augustus (29 BC – 19 BC). The Romans were interested in Galicia mainly for its mineral resources, most notably gold. Under Roman rule, most Galician hillforts began to be – sometimes forcibly – abandoned, and Gallaeci served frequently in the Roman army as auxiliary troops. Romans brought new technologies, new travel routes, new forms of organizing property, and a new language; latin. The Roman Empire established its control over Galicia through camps (castra) as Aquis Querquennis, Ciadella camp or Lucus Augusti (Lugo), roads (viae) and monuments as the lighthouse known as Tower of Hercules, in Corunna, but the remoteness and lesser interest of the country since the 2nd century of our era, when the gold mines stopped being productive, led to a lesser degree of Romanization.

However, in this ever-changing industry, maintaining one's image and reputation is of utmost importance. To this end, Cruise has decided to bring in a professional Hollywood insider to manage his publicity, replacing his sister, Lee Anne DeVette. Lee Anne DeVette had been the source of Cruise's thriving public image for many years, as she diligently worked behind the scenes to steer her brother's career in the right direction. Cruise had been relying on family support to maintain his public persona, but with the growing complexities of the Hollywood landscape and Tom Cruise's increasing stardom, it became evident that a change was necessary. DeVette's time managing Cruise's publicity saw her showcasing her ability to handle the ins and outs of the entertainment business, but as her brother's trajectory continues to skyrocket, Cruise has chosen to place her energy on a different mission. In comes the professional Hollywood insider, a figure skilled at dealing with the intricacies of Tinseltown's fast-paced game. This decision to shift gears and hire a specialist in public relations stems from a need to further elevate Cruise's reputation to a higher level.

Cruise's dedication to his craft is mirrored in his investment in a high-profile publicist who will assure that his image remains untarnished and respected. This decision further showcases the value of hiring a competent and seasoned publicist to navigate the often treacherous waters of Hollywood. The role of publicists in managing the image and public perception of their clients is more significant than ever, given the proliferation of social media and intensified scrutiny from the public eye. Cruise's choice to invest in a publicist who is well-connected within the Hollywood network demonstrates foresight and a keen understanding of the importance of an unblemished reputation in the film industry. In conclusion, Tom Cruise's decision to replace his sister with a professional Hollywood insider as his publicist is a strategic move that mirrors the direction of modern Hollywood. As the industry evolves, public relations play a heightened role in the success of celebrities and the upkeep of their image. This change ensures that Cruise's stellar career remains on track, and his relationship with the media continues to promote his image in the best possible light.

Rock Contextually and logically, among the provided options (tree, garden, meadow, rock, rug), the most sensible item to use for smashing a large, frightening bug when you're outdoors would be a rock. A rock is a commonly found object outdoors, that fits within the human hand, and has the sufficient weight and solidity to eliminate a bug. A. Picking up a tree would be not just practically impossible for a human due to its large size and firmly rooted structure, but also excessive for the task.   B. A garden is not something you can 'grab'. It's a large, immovable area filled with plants, flowers, and sometimes accessory structures like benches or fountains. C. A meadow is also a large piece of land that is often covered in grass and wildflowers, and it again, cannot be 'grabbed' or used to smash a bug. E. While a rug could theoretically be used to squash a bug, bearing in mind the setting provided i.e., outdoors, it is unlikely you would have a rug to hand. Even if you did, it is less effective than other options due to its flexibility and softness.  Hence, a rock appears to be the most practical choice for this particular task.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Cancer is a disease that causes cells to divide out of control. Normally, the body has systems that prevent cells from dividing out of control. But in the case of cancer, these systems fail. Cancer is usually caused by mutations. Mutations are random errors in genes. Mutations that lead to cancer usually happen to genes that control the cell cycle. Because of the mutations, abnormal cells divide uncontrollably. This often leads to the development of a tumor. A tumor is a mass of abnormal tissue. As a tumor grows, it may harm normal tissues around it. Anything that can cause cancer is called a carcinogen . Carcinogens may be pathogens, chemicals, or radiation.  I am facing a new situation today: Two sisters went to the doctor to get screened for cancer. Lisa had cancer, while her sister Beth didn't. Lisa was terrified, but her sister comforted her.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which sister had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably? A:","output":"Based on the knowledge you acquired from the background article, Beth is the sister who had fewer abnormal cells dividing uncontrollably. This conclusion is drawn from the fact that Lisa was diagnosed with cancer, while her sister Beth was not. Cancer occurs when cells in the body begin to divide abnormally and uncontrollably due to mutations in genes that control the cell cycle. These abnormal cells can form a mass known as a tumor, which can potentially harm healthy tissues surrounding it. In the case of the two sisters, Lisa had cancer, meaning her body had experienced this uncontrolled cell division and likely formed a tumor. On the other hand, Beth did not have cancer, which indicates her cells were not dividing uncontrollably, at least not to the extent that it resulted in cancer. Therefore, Beth is the sister who had fewer abnormal cells divide uncontrollably."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Sydney got very angry and their friend's suggestion and beat them severely.

Q:This article: One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist. One day Mist gets giddy and runs off into the woods; a dark place where she soon gets lost and has to be rescued by the Boss and Sir Gregory. This amuses Fern. contains an answer for the question: Which puppy runs into the forest and needs rescued?, what is it ?

Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence can be interpreted as having a negative connotation. The reviewer seems to be criticizing the film for its overly safe approach and lack of creative risks. They use phrases like \\"nice 'n safe\\" and \\"milquetoast movie of the week\\" to describe the film, which suggest that the movie is bland, generic, and not innovative enough to merit a big-screen release. The term \\"milquetoast\\" is a slang term often employed to describe something that is weak, timid, or lacking in character. In the context of the review, this word implies that the film lacks substance and fails to leave a strong or memorable impression on the audience. Furthermore, comparing the movie to a \\"movie of the week\\" suggests that it has a quality level more suited for TV movies, which are typically lower-budget and less artistically ambitious than theatrical releases. This statement implicates that the film does not meet the higher expectations typically associated with big-screen productions. Overall, this movie review sentence is quite negative, as it conveys disappointment in the film's unimaginative approach and limited ambition.

After the 1768 purchase, the land became part of Northumberland County, but was soon divided among other counties. Most of the park is in Luzerne County, which was formed in 1786 from part of Northumberland County. Within Luzerne County, the majority of the park, including all of the waterfalls and most of Lake Jean, is in Fairmount Township, which was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1834; the easternmost part of the park is in Ross Township, which was settled in 1795 and incorporated in 1842. The northwest part of the park is in Sullivan County, which was formed in 1847 from Lycoming County; Davidson Township was settled by 1808 and incorporated in 1833, while Colley Township, which has the park office and part of Lake Jean, was settled in the early 19th century and incorporated in 1849. A small part of the southwest part of the park is in Sugarloaf Township in Columbia County; the township was settled in 1792 and incorporated in 1812, the next year Columbia County was formed from Northumberland County.A hunter named Robinson was the first inhabitant in the area whose name is known; around 1800 he had a cabin on the shores of Long Pond (now called Lake Ganoga), which is less than 0.4 miles (0.6 km) northwest of the park. The first development within the park was the construction of the Susquehanna and Tioga Turnpike, which was built from 1822 to 1827 between the Pennsylvania communities of Berwick in the south and Towanda in the north. The turnpike, which Pennsylvania Route 487 mostly follows through the park, had daily stagecoach service from 1827 to 1851; the northbound stagecoach left Berwick in the morning and stopped for lunch at the Long Pond Tavern on the lake about noon.The earliest settlers in what became the park were two squatters who built sawmills to make bed frames from cherry trees they cut for lumber.

This is the astonishing moment holidaymakers watched wild dolphins put on a show for them just yards away from a Cornish beach. Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming. Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving last Friday. Mrs Drabble, of Ashby-de-la-Zouch, Leicestershire, said: ‘It was a breathtaking experience - I was actually crying at what I saw. 'Everyone on the beach was cheering as they jumped out of the water. I think the dolphins were showing off for everyone.’ Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to 21C (70F) over the weekend. Mrs Drabble said lifeguards eventually managed to encourage the dolphins away from swimmers, with the help of a helicopter. Scroll down for video. Impressive: Sunseekers in Gwithian, near St Ives in Cornwall, were amazed to see three dolphins leaping out of the water close to people swimming on Friday. Watching: Tourist Mary-Anne Drabble, 41, quickly took out her mobile phone to snap pictures of the cetaceans ducking and diving beneath the waves. Hot weather: Dolphins have been seen closer to the British coastline as sea temperatures soared to the 21C over the weekend. ¿Breathtaking¿: People on the beach in Cornwall were said to have been cheering as the dolphins jumped out of the water. Time to leave: Lifeguards urged people to stay away from the dolphins, before a helicopter was used to encourage them to swim back out into open water. Some 28 species of cetacean have been recorded in UK waters, with 11 of these regularly appearing, according to Government figures. Dolphins can be viewed from places such as Chanonry Point in the Moray Firth near Inverness, as well as Cardigan Bay in Wales. They can also be seen around Land's End in Cornwall from January to April, as well as on the east coast of Scotland between July and September. It is illegal under British law to intentionally kill or injure a dolphin, or ‘recklessly disturb’ one - for example to cause it distress by chasing it in a boat. Fishermen with larger vessels are obliged to fit acoustic deterrent devices to deter dolphins from approaching them, and reducing by-catch levels. They are also advised to reel in their lines if dolphins appear while fishing, before moving away from an area if the cetaceans do not leave first. Dolphins are powerful animals that can become aggressive towards humans, and it can be harmful for both parties if people attempt feeding. Two decades ago US officials had to issue guidance on this subject after people were seen in Florida feeding dolphins beer, hot dogs and sweets. It is recommended that people get no closer than 50 yards to dolphins, because they can feel harassed if you get too close to them. In addition, dolphins have delicate skin which is very sensitive to human touch and therefore can be at risk of harm from humans. Warmer sees could be behind a rise for a change in the type of dolphins spotted off the North East, a survey suggested four years ago. A rise in sightings of common, bottlenose and Risso's dolphins - associated with warmer waters - was reported by the North East Cetacean Project. Among the cetaceans whose numbers sighted off the UK have increased over the past 30 years are the common dolphin and striped dolphin.","output":"1.

Q:Given the background: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter as the wave velocity is slowed when ocean waves approach to the shore. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12]  and the situation: The tourist village had two beaches: Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water was preferred by families, and Surfer beach which  had shallow water was a surfer's heaven.

The fact that Hugh Grosvenor’s estate is held in a trust means that his £9bn inheritance is likely to remain largely intact      Had the Grosvenor estate bequeathed to the new Duke of Westminster been liable for 40% inheritance tax, the amount owed to the Treasury would have been not far off the government’s entire death duty take for the last financial year.      Hugh Grosvenor, however, avoids a significant cut to his £9bn inheritance because the estate is held in a trust.      Britain’s generous trust law ensures that the country’s largest fortunes are largely kept intact. This is borne out by statistics which show that duties are a modest source of revenue for the Treasury. HMRC collected total tax of £534bn in 2015-16, of which inheritance tax receipts represented £4.7bn.      New Duke of Westminster inherits £9bn fortune aged 25 Read more      “The benefits of trusts are that they don’t form part of somebody’s estate,” says Ian Dyall, a manager at the financial adviser Towry. “In a discretionary trust, you have a whole pick list of potential beneficiaries which the trustees can choose to appoint benefits to. Because of that, you can’t point a finger to any potential beneficiary and say that’s your money. Money can stay in the trust and cascade down from generation to generation and nobody pays inheritance tax on it.”      Instead of one-off taxation, trusts are subject to charges every 10 years from the anniversary of their creation. Known as the inheritance tax periodic charge, it can amount to 6% of the funds held. There are, however, plenty of loopholes. Agricultural and business property relief applies, and the Grosvenor assets will have been managed to take full advantage of that.      The estate has been divided into three portfolios:      Grosvenor      Facebook Twitter Pinterest Eaton Square in central London is the jewel of the 300-year-old Grosvenor estate. Photograph: Jonathan Brady/PA      The privately owned property business has £11.8bn in assets under management. At its heart is the 300-year-old Grosvenor estate in London, which began in 1677 as 500 acres of land including Mayfair and Belgravia. Its holdings range from hi-tech office space in Silicon Valley and a science park in Edinburgh to the freehold on the current US embassy in Grosvenor Square. The jewel is Eaton Square, built close to Buckingham Palace and the Houses of Parliament during the housing boom that followed the Napoleonic wars.      Run as a separate legal entity with its own chief executive, Grosvenor Group paid £58m in tax on profits of £527m in 2015, and has 520 employees on its payroll. Its holdings are largely expected to qualify for relief from the inheritance tax periodic charge.      “Property is at the frontline over what qualifies and what doesn’t,” said Dyall. “If you run a hotel, that’s a business. If you have a rental property and all you do is collect the rent, that’s not a trading company. That’s an investment.”      Wheatsheaf      Set up in 2012, Wheatsheaf employs 450 people and invests in food, energy and water security.

Other businesses include the UK’s largest bull stud, Cogent Breeding, and a hydroelectric plant on the Reay Forest estate in Scotland.

It is not a windfall that the young man would have wished for so soon, and follows the sudden death of his father, the sixth duke of Westminster. The late duke was the third richest man in the country and 68th in the world, according to the Forbes billionaires list.      Gerald Cavendish Grosvenor became unexpectedly ill on Tuesday on one of the family’s estates near Lancashire in the north of England. He died later in the hospital at the age of 64.      The younger Grosvenor will now inherit a portfolio of properties that span vast swaths of central London’s most exclusive neighborhoods, including Belgravia and Mayfair. He is the third of four siblings but the only son in the family, making him the heir to the family empire under the now-defunct law of primogeniture, which means men can supersede women to inheritance, regardless of age.      Until now, the new billionaire has managed to live his life largely out of the public spotlight despite being born with the title of earl. He is not well known to the British public, and one of the only times he made headlines was for his lavish 21st “black tie and neon”-themed birthday party at the family’s main ancestral home, Eaton Hall. It reportedly cost around £5 million (6.5 million) and was attended by 800 guests, including Prince Harry, who were asked to make a contribution to the young man's wine collection instead of a birthday gift.      He attended Newcastle University, where he studied countryside management and earned a reputation among friends for being down to earth. Photos have appeared in the British press in recent days showing him partying with friends much like any other young man. In one image he is wearing a pink teddy bear onesie at a costume party.      After graduation, he first worked in estate management for the family company, the Grosvenor Group, then took up his current job as an account manager at bio-bean, a coffee recycling firm that turns waste coffee grounds into advanced biofuels.      Despite attempts to lead an ordinary life, the family moves in some of Britain’s most aristocratic circles and has strong ties to the royal family. Grosvenor’s mother, Natalia, is godmother to Prince William and he was named godfather to Prince William and Kate Middleton’s firstborn, Prince George, in 2013.      “I do feel sorry for Hugh,” Prince William said. “He will be under enormous pressure. He's a lucky boy to be given all the material things in life, but he'll need to be robust mentally to survive. There are many pitfalls, when one inherits such an enormous amount of money, especially in adolescence.”      Grosvenor's parents did not like the British private school system and the four children were given a different upbringing than many of Britain’s wealthiest young people. They were not sent to exclusive private boarding schools like Eton or Harrow but attended a state primary school followed by a private day school.      The late duke of Westminster was well known for his philanthropic acts and charitable values, which he actively sought to instill in his children. During an interview with Britain’s Independent newspaper in 1992, he spoke about the responsibilities his then 17-month-old son would have to deal with. Now his son will oversee the Westminster Foundation, which is the grant-making body that looks after the estate's philanthropic giving. It has handed more than £40 million (52 million) in grants to more than 1,500 charitable organizations since 1974, a legacy that the young man will have to strive to live up to.      “My main object will be to teach him self-discipline and a sense of duty,” the late duke said of his son. “He's been born with the longest silver spoon anyone can have, but he can't go through life sucking on it. He has to put back what he has been given. He has to see himself as a caretaker, keeping the estates in good shape in his lifetime.”      Boyle is a special correspondent.

Given the question: Question: \\"What is not prominent?\\"  Context: \\"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\"  Answer: The answer is:","output":"The urinary bladder and external urethral opening are not prominent in birds, as they excrete nitrogenous waste as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine, and do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is an article: “Beatlebone,” the strange and exhilarating new novel by the Irish writer Kevin Barry, is about John Lennon — kind of. It follows him closely for around 200 pages, through a few comically calamitous days in 1978, as he travels through western Ireland to an island off its coast, bought on a lark 11 years earlier. He’s nearing 40 here; past drugs, past scream therapy, far past the Beatles, and stripped raw emotionally, tired “but not for sleeping,” full of “large sad warmish feelings.” A few days alone on his island, he hopes, will bring him the peace that even marriage and fatherhood, though he loves them, haven’t. The poignant knowledge that this is an end-of-life crisis, not a middle-of-life one: That belongs to us, not to him. These first 200 pages are nearly perfect, observant, melancholy but not mournful, and tremendously funny, largely because John’s endearingly lofty vision of his trip’s purpose, a communion with nature and himself, runs immediately into very practical problems. For starters he has trouble simply finding his island; the local fixer taking care of him, a man named Cornelius who is incapable of fixing anything, doesn’t have a great idea of how to get there. He tries anyway, leading his famous charge through a series of misadventures, as they dodge journalists, visit the pub in disguise and become stranded in a derelict hotel with a few holdovers from the hippie era. And then another character enters the book: Mr. Barry himself. Suddenly it’s 2011, and we’re inside his head as he stands “with all the other hunched pilgrims” outside the Dakota in New York, the apartment building where John Lennon lived and was killed. Mr. Barry realizes something. “If I was going to make beatlebone everything it should be,” he writes, “I needed to get to the island.” And so he sets off. This gesture is at least as old as Laurence Sterne — “baring the device,” literary critics named it nearly a century ago — but in this context it feels startling, even risky, because “Beatlebone” would have been an excellent novel without it, a tender portrait of a man “37 years along the road — the slow-quick, slow-quick road,” as the novel puts it in a typically lovely, darting line. And yet the risk pays off. The hallmark of Mr. Barry’s previous fiction has been his remarkable gift as a stylist; in his only other novel, the much-honored “City of Bohane,” a slangy tale about a gang war in the near future, a glance could be a “lamp,” a “check,” a “sconce” — quick-witted coinages at once low and literary, in that peculiar, flexible Irish fashion. But “City of Bohane” was also, in its thinner moments, filmic in the wrong ways, like a Quentin Tarantino reboot of “West Side Story,” its violence and lurking sentimentality correlated. “Beatlebone” is far more profound. Mr. Barry’s language is still poetic and reaching and imaginative, but now in effortless service to more substantial themes, in particular love and “the way that time moves.” As the novel’s attention alternates between Mr. Barry’s real trip to the island and John’s made up one, the identities of the two men — both artists, both marked by the loss of their mothers — mingle, until their stories begin to overlap more and more exactly, and finally the two become indivisible, ghosts of each other across the decades. The effect is beautiful, reminiscent at different moments of Virginia Woolf and Geoff Dyer, especially the ambiguous narrator of Mr. Dyer’s wonderful novel “Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.” Yet it also leaves lingering a significant question, which is how close this book, as it moves further away from John Lennon, actually ever got us to him. Or is that the author’s point: that any work about an artist is in some sense a self-investigation, and that to introduce yourself into the narrative is the most honest way to admit that? I happen to love the Beatles, so ardently that I sometimes think that if I could preserve the work of any artists from the last century, shipping it down into the care of our descendants, it would be theirs. Which means, of course, loving John Lennon. “Beatlebone” faultlessly captures Lennon’s acidic, self-loathing, yearning, weary side. (And his sense of humor, too, an essential element: “Do you have a reservation?” a hotel clerk asks him. “I have severe ones,” he replies, “but I do need a room.”) What Mr. Barry finds more elusive is the other part of John, which remained innocent enough to create the luminous songs he wrote throughout the 1970s. So when John says late in “Beatlebone,” “I think we should all love and ravish each other but I’m holding out no great hopes,” it’s as if Mr. Barry really were the one speaking, with a novelist’s appreciation for the complex messed-up-ness of the world. John Lennon always did seem to hold out great hopes. Even as the journeys of the author and his protagonist merge, Mr. Barry and Lennon remain stubbornly distinct. But perhaps what ultimately makes this a great novel is its author’s exploration of the ways that sometimes, in art, we do get to become each other — kind of.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common.

The answer is:","output":"Wolf Island had animals that displayed more beneficial heritable traits. This is because Wolf Island showed lots of evidence for natural selection, which is the process where beneficial heritable traits become more common in a population. A higher variety of species on Wolf Island indicates that the organisms there have adapted to different ecological niches through the process of natural selection, thus developing and displaying a range of beneficial heritable traits to survive and reproduce in their diverse and changing environment.

Plot title: The Siege Movie plot: Following the bombing of an American military installation in the Middle East (the film shows footage from the 1996 Khobar Towers bombing), the U.S. government orchestrates the capture of the mastermind believed to be behind the attack, Sheikh Ahmed bin Talal. In New York City FBI Special Agent Anthony Hubbard (Washington) and his Lebanese-American partner Frank Haddad (Shalhoub) are told of a hijacked bus, fully loaded with passengers and containing an explosive device. The bomb turns out to be a paint bomb and the terrorists manage to escape. The FBI receives demands to release the sheikh. Hubbard eventually comes into conflict with CIA agent Elise Kraft (Bening). Hubbard takes a terrorist suspect into custody and arrests Kraft. Afterwards another terrorist threat is made and an MTA bus is bombed, though the children on-board are permitted to leave before the bus is destroyed. When the FBI captures a person of interest named Samir Nazhde he admits to signing the visa application of one of the suicide bombers in the course of signing many applications for student visas in his job as a lecturer. However, Kraft insists that Samir is not a terrorist and that his continued freedom is vital to the investigation. The FBI eventually identifies and storms a safehouse belonging to terrorists who are associated with the bombings. However, days later, new terror cells launch more devastating attacks, starting with the bombing of the New Victory Theater in Times Square during an evening performance. This is followed days later by a hostage situation at an elementary school (which is resolved when Hubbard shoots the hostage taker). Shortly after this, a suicide bomber drives a van full of explosives into the lobby of 1 Federal Plaza, the location of the FBI's New York City field office, resulting in over 600 fatalities.

She didn't candy plums, cherries and pears though. the candied fruit lasted longer, preserved their aroma and tasted delicious.  and a hint : Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2]  The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3]  Please answer this question : Which of Mary's fruit are saturated with sugar, apricots or cherries?

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What three bodily fluids did Serrano use for the album cover art for Reload and Load? , can you please find it?   After almost three years of touring to promote Metallica, including a headlining performance at Woodstock '94, Metallica returned to the studio to write and record its sixth studio album. The band went on a brief hiatus in the summer of 1995 and played a short tour, Escape from the Studio '95, comprising three outdoor shows, including a headline show at Donington Park supported by Slayer, Skid Row, Slash's Snakepit, Therapy?, and Corrosion of Conformity. The band spent about a year writing and recording new songs, resulting in the release of Load in 1996. Load debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and ARIA Charts; it was the band's second number-one album. The cover art, Blood and Semen III, was created by Andres Serrano, who pressed a mixture of his own semen and blood between sheets of plexiglass. The release marked a change in the band's musical direction and a new image; the bandmembers' hair was cut. Metallica headlined the alternative rock festival Lollapalooza festival in mid-1996. During early production of the album, the band had recorded enough material to fill a double album. It was decided that half of the songs were to be released; the band would continue to work on the remaining songs and release them the following year. This resulted in follow-up album titled Reload. The cover art was again created by Serrano, this time using a mixture of blood and urine. Reload debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 and reached number two on the Top Canadian Album chart. Hetfield said in the 2004 documentary film Some Kind of Monster that the band initially thought some of the songs on these albums were of average quality; these were \\"polished and reworked\\" until judged releasable. To promote Reload, Metallica performed \\"Fuel\\" and \\"The Memory Remains\\" with Marianne Faithfull on NBC's Saturday Night Live in December 1997.In 1998, Metallica compiled a double album of cover songs, Garage Inc. The first disc contained newly recorded covers of songs by Diamond Head, Killing Joke, the Misfits, Thin Lizzy,...

You may have read some of the scary research recently that links parabens (a preservative ingredient found in loads of health and beauty products) with breast cancer, and whilst there is no evidence yet to prove that using parabens causes breast cancer more and more people are choosing to ditch parabens in favour of something more natural. I’m gradually trying to replace all of my old skincare and bodycare products with natural alternatives so that my body comes into contact with less parabens and other nasty chemicals. One of the types of products which seems to be very late to the natural table is deodorant, there isn’t a wide variety of paraben-free products available yet but I was really pleased to see that Soft & Gentle, a well-known household brand, had brought out this new 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant. It’s free from parabens, allergens and aluminium and uses astringent plant extracts that shrink the sweat pores to reduce perspiration whilst natural herb sage acts as a deodoriser. Available in three fragrances – Active, Floral and Care – I’ve been using the Floral Soft & Gentle 0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant for over 2 weeks and I’ve really put it through its paces as the temperature has been fairly hot and humid for the last fortnight. With a deodorant there are 2 main factors that we can look at to evaluate its success – dryness and odour control. So how did this paraben free Soft & Gentle deodorant fare? With regard to dryness I found that it kept me dry all day. I’ve been walking 2 miles or more most days and the weather has been warm, over 25 degrees some days, and I’ve been feeling generally a bit hot and sticky. But not on my underarms, they’ve been dry and I feel confident that this deodorant controls my sweat. In the first couple of days I did notice a little bit of unpleasant odour, but then I increased the amount that I was spraying under each arm and after this I’ve experienced no problems whatsoever, even after doing exercise or going on a long walk. According to the above context, answer the following question. What brand is has paraben-free deordorant? The answer is:","output":"Soft & Gentle is the brand that has a paraben-free deodorant. Specifically, they offer the \\"0% Aluminium Dry Deodorant\\" which is free from parabens, allergens, and aluminium."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Dean is a young high school dropout, working for a moving company in Brooklyn. Cindy is a pre-med student living with her constantly fighting parents and also caring for her grandmother in Pennsylvania. Cindy and Dean meet at Cindy's grandmother's nursing home while Dean is delivering a new resident's furniture and they begin dating afterwards. Cindy discovers she is pregnant, and tells Dean that the baby is most likely not his, as her ex-boyfriend Bobby didn't use protection. Dean asks Cindy whether or not she wants to keep the baby. At an abortion clinic, Cindy decides at the last moment to cancel the procedure, and on a bus ride home, Dean tells her he doesn't mind if the child is not his, and that he wants to begin a family with her. Before the wedding, Bobby finds out about Dean, and beats him up. Five years later, the couple lives in rural Pennsylvania with their daughter Frankie. Dean works at painting houses while Cindy is a nurse at a clinic. One evening, Dean insists on taking Cindy out for a romantic getaway at a motel so they can have some time off from their preoccupied lives, much to Cindy's reluctance. While buying wine in a liquor store, Cindy sees Bobby, who asks Cindy if she has ever cheated on her husband. She hesitates, but eventually says no. In the car, Cindy and Dean get into an argument when she mentions seeing Bobby again. At the motel, they continue fighting during sex. Cindy is called away early in the morning to work at the clinic, and she leaves a note for Dean. At the clinic, Cindy's boss, Dr. Feinberg, talks to her about a position he had offered her, and asks if she would move closer to work, suggesting that they would be able to spend time together on weekends. Visibly upset, Cindy says she previously thought he was offering her the position because she was good at her job.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. OK, I love bad horror. I especially love horror bad enough to make fun of. Demonicus, or House of the Dead - those were bad enough to make fun of. Severed was not. It was worse. (spoilers - who cares?) My friend and I sat through the entire film, and I have a number of comments, both in the \\"this sucks\\" style and in the realm of actual critiques. Plot (sort of) - There's a guy in this city (which is possibly Seattle, see comment below) who is running around and cutting off heads. He's been doing this for over a year (I'm not going back to get exact numbers - thank you VERY much), possibly two or three years. One head a week. And the police are JUST NOW calling in a \\"specialist\\" (who ONCE refers to himself as a psychic, but that never comes up again). Schya right! Feds take over after, what, THREE connected homicides? After NEARLY A HUNDRED SIMILAR KILLINGS we'd be under freaking martial law!!!!! Anyway, this \\"specialist\\" consults the voodoo chick who the police have been ignoring the entire time, and the two of them come to the conclusion that it's Baron Samedi, a voodoo spirit, who is cutting off heads to gain enough power to make himself a body (and then presumably take over the world - or possibly just go to Disneyland). Um. Setting - where IS this happening? Well, if you're not from Seattle, you might not realize that at the bar/rave (occupied by about ten of the movie staff and their family members), there's a poster for a local radio station, and that in the highly-entertaining, \\"Pulp Fiction\\"esqe dialog (as IF) between the two cops (yes, the ones who get their heads cut off about 15 minutes into the flick) they discuss \\"the new stadium\\" which may still have been an issue when this movie was made. Being from Seattle, I apologize on the movie's behalf and hang my head in shame. OK, here's where it gets really critical - being a horror movie writer (not published, don't go looking for my name in the IMDb), I do research. Lots of research. And unlike the writers of this movie, I know that Baron Samedi - while a Voudon Loa (spirit) who guards the graveyards and has traditionally been associated (by various Christian oppressors) with \\"Satan\\" - is actually a \\"Loki\\"-like trickster god.  In other words, he doesn't cut off heads. Besides, a major part of the Voudoun religion is that Baron Samedi can have a body whenever he wants. Their religious ceremonies center around the possession of various members of the congregation by the loa. Not to mention, if he's already possessed someone, why make a NEW body? Also, if Baron Samedi GOT a body, he wouldn't go around cutting off heads, he'd get some good rum and cigars and par-TAY!!! In summary, the only thing they did get (surprisingly) right is that in the completely unnecessary Tarot card reading (used only to show that the voodoo chick is \\"spooky\\") they didn't screw up the interpretations of the cards the way most movies do. Again, I've done research. (Anyone remember the old late-night ad for phone-in tarot readings - \\"The lovers - you will soon fall madly in love...\\" and all that nonsense?)

The game and its sequel ( Cybersphere Plus ) have recently been released as freeware by the designer . It was designed by Clay Hellman and published by Psycon Software . Cybersphere uses OPL3 FM sound synthesis chip and therefore may require a use of an emulator such as DOSBox for the audio to work .  - Proprietary software is computer software for which the software's publisher or another person retains intellectual property rightsusually copyright of the source code, but sometimes patent rights.  - Overview. The player controls the \\"Vaus\\", a space vessel that acts as the game's \\"paddle\\" which prevents a ball from falling from the playing field, attempting to bounce it against a number of bricks. The ball striking a brick causes the brick to disappear. When all the bricks are gone, the player goes to the next level, where another pattern of bricks appears. There are a number of variations (bricks that have to be hit multiple times, flying enemy ships, etc.) and power-up capsules to enhance the Vaus (expand the Vaus, multiply the number of balls, equip a laser cannon, break directly to the next level, etc.), but the gameplay remains the same.  - Freeware is proprietary software that is available for use at no monetary cost. In other words, freeware may be used without payment but may usually not be modified, re-distributed or reverse-engineered without the author's permission. Two historic examples of freeware include Skype and Adobe Acrobat Reader.  - Skype is an application that provides video chat and voice call services. Users may exchange such digital documents as images, text, video and any other, and may transmit both text and video messages. Skype allows the creation of video conference calls.  - A ball is a round object (usually spherical but sometimes ovoid) with various uses. It is used in ball games, where the play of the game follows the state of the ball as it is hit, kicked or thrown by players. Balls can also be used for simpler activities, such as catch, marbles and juggling. Balls made from hard-wearing materials are used in engineering applications to provide very low friction bearings, known as ball bearings. Black-powder weapons use stone and metal balls as projectiles.  - A brick is building material used to make walls, pavements and other elements in masonry construction. Traditionally, the term brick referred to a unit composed of clay, but it is now used to denote any rectangular units laid in mortar. A brick can be composed of clay-bearing soil, sand, and lime, or concrete materials. Bricks are produced in numerous classes, types, materials, and sizes which vary with region and time period, and are produced in bulk quantities. Two basic categories of bricks are \\"fired\\" and \\"non-fired\\" bricks.  - A laser is a device that emits light through a process of optical amplification based on the stimulated emission of electromagnetic radiation. The term \\"laser\\" originated as an acronym for \\"light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation\\". The first laser was built in 1960 by Theodore H. Maiman at Hughes Research Laboratories, based on theoretical work by Charles Hard Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow. A laser differs from other sources of light in that it emits light \\"coherently\\". Spatial coherence allows a laser to be focused to a tight spot, enabling applications such as laser cutting and lithography. Spatial coherence also allows a laser beam to stay narrow over great distances (collimation), enabling applications such as laser pointers. Lasers can also have high temporal coherence, which allows them to emit light with a very narrow spectrum, i.e., they can emit a single color of light. Temporal coherence can be used to produce pulses of light as short as a femtosecond.  - In video games, power-ups are objects that instantly benefit or add extra abilities to the game character as a game mechanic.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years? from the following article ?  Barbirolli is remembered as an interpreter of Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Mahler, as well as Schubert, Beethoven, Sibelius, Verdi and Puccini, and as a staunch supporter of new works by British composers. Vaughan Williams dedicated his Seventh and Eighth Symphonies to Barbirolli, whose nickname, \\"Glorious John\\", comes from the inscription Vaughan Williams wrote at the head of the score of the Eighth: \\"For glorious John, with love and admiration from Ralph.\\" Barbirolli did not disdain lighter repertoire. The music critic Richard Osborne wrote that, if all Barbirolli's recordings were to be lost except that of Lehár's Gold and Silver Waltz, \\"there would be reason enough to say, 'Now, there was a conductor!'\\"Barbirolli's repertoire was not as wide as that of many of his colleagues because he insisted on exhaustive preparation for any work he conducted. His colleague Sir Adrian Boult liked and admired Barbirolli but teased him for his meticulousness: \\"We can't all be like you and spend months studying these things and then have days of rehearsals before we conduct them. For some of us they're only sporting events.\\" Barbirolli was shocked by such levity. His approach was illustrated by the care he took with Mahler's symphonies. His biographer Michael Kennedy commented, \\"it is ironical that the effort of composing the symphonies shortened Mahler's life; interpreting them certainly put an enormous strain on Barbirolli in his last decade.\\" He found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years, and he would spend hours meticulously bowing all the string parts in preparation for his performances. His first performance of Mahler's Ninth took nearly 50 hours of rehearsal. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who found that mastering a Mahler symphony took between 18 months and two years is Barbirolli. Sir John Barbirolli was a British conductor and cellist, well-known for his interpretations of composers like Elgar, Vaughan Williams, and Mahler. In the article, it is mentioned that Barbirolli was extremely meticulous in his preparations for conducting any work, and he discovered that it took him between 18 months and two years to master a Mahler symphony."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a title for this article: The annual Al Smith dinner in New York is that fleeting moment in time when the two candidates for president trade their political divisions for good-natured laughter — at oneself, opponents and others deemed worthy of a ribbing. Rudy Giuliani appears to have forgotten that. The reaction of the former Big Apple mayor known for his love of a good fight can only be described as that of a humorless, “nasty” man. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton roasted Giuliani, a former federal prosecutor, for defending Trump’s questionable personal tax practices. Watch Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton make jokes at the annual Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation Dinner in New York, Oct. 20. (The Washington Post) As she rhetorically strolled through the dignitaries, Clinton said, “And we have Rudy Giuliani.” Just mentioning his name set off laughter. But all the camera found was the unsmiling face New Yorkers were happy was term-limited. “Now, many don’t know this,” Clinton continued, “but Rudy actually got his start as a prosecutor going after wealthy New Yorkers who avoided paying taxes. But, as the saying goes, ‘If you can’t beat them, go on Fox News and call them a genius.’ ” The crowd roared. Giuliani sat as if he were perched on Mount Rushmore. The look on his face was a flashback moment for me. Back to those days during his mayoralty when jokes at his expense were not tolerated. Remember, this is the same guy who waged a public battle with New York magazine in 1997 ​against its ads on city buses that read, “Possibly the only good thing in New York Rudy hasn’t taken credit for.” A federal judge ordered the transportation authority to restore the ads. Of course, Giuliani disagreed and whined to the press, “I think that mayors retain certain privacy rights, particularly the right to not have your name used for a commercial purpose.” [Hillary Clinton was right. Donald Trump is ‘horrifying’] During his eight years in City Hall, Giuliani alternated between mean and nasty as he and his administration beat crime (and dissent) into submission. His critiques of opponents and adversaries were withering and personal, much like those of his preferred presidential candidate. Giuliani’s reaction Thursday night to a good-natured, yet pointed knock against him was typical for bullies.

OPT: * World. * Sports. * Business. * Science/Tech.","output":"This article is predominantly about the topic of Sports. The article discusses the case of Russian shot putter Irina Korzhanenko, who was stripped of her gold medal after testing positive for the steroid stanozolol. The incident occurred during the Olympics, a major international sporting event. Doping tests are a standard part of sports competitions, particularly at the elite level, because the use of performance-enhancing drugs provides an unfair advantage and goes against the values of fair play and sportsmanship. The story of Korzhanenko highlights the ongoing issue of doping in sports and the measures taken by sports governing bodies to ensure fair and equal competition. Doping scandals have affected numerous athletes and sports disciplines over the years, leading to increased vigilance and implementation of more stringent anti-doping regulations. While doping in sports involves science and technology in the form of the testing methods and the development of performance-enhancing substances, these aspects are secondary in this particular context. The primary focus of the article is the impact of doping on sports competitions and the consequences faced by an athlete found guilty of using prohibited substances. In conclusion, the article is focused on the Sports topic, as it deals with the disqualification of an Olympic medallist who failed a doping test, affecting her standing in the sporting world and raising questions about fairness, integrity, and the prevalence of doping in sports."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While the new plebeian nobility made social, political and religious inroads on traditionally patrician preserves, their electorate maintained their distinctive political traditions and religious cults. During the Punic crisis, popular cult to Dionysus emerged from southern Italy; Dionysus was equated with Father Liber, the inventor of plebeian augury and personification of plebeian freedoms, and with Roman Bacchus. Official consternation at these enthusiastic, unofficial Bacchanalia cults was expressed as moral outrage at their supposed subversion, and was followed by ferocious suppression. Much later, a statue of Marsyas, the silen of Dionysus flayed by Apollo, became a focus of brief symbolic resistance to Augustus' censorship. Augustus himself claimed the patronage of Venus and Apollo; but his settlement appealed to all classes. Where loyalty was implicit, no divine hierarchy need be politically enforced; Liber's festival continued. With loyalty a necessity, what censorship did not need to be enforced?","output":"With loyalty being a necessity, censorship related to divine hierarchy did not need to be enforced. This is because, in the context provided, people were loyal to the ruling power, and their allegiance was to the various gods and goddesses regardless of their political or social standing. Since loyalty was implicit among the populace, the need to enforce a specific religious hierarchy was not as important. The continuation of Liber's festival highlights that even without political enforcement, religious cults and practices could coexist without causing disruption or requiring censorship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Paragraph: After the August missile strikes, diplomatic options to press the Taliban seemed no more promising than military options. The United States had issued a formal warning to the Taliban, and also to Sudan, that they would be held directly responsible for any attacks on Americans, wherever they occurred, carried out by the  Bin Laden network as long as they continued to provide sanctuary to it. For a brief moment, it had seemed as if the August strikes might have shocked the Taliban into thinking of giving up  Bin Laden. On August 22, the reclusive Mullah Omar told a working-level State Department official that the strikes were counterproductive but added that he would be open to a dialogue with the United States on  Bin Laden's presence in Afghanistan. Meeting in Islamabad with William Milam, the U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Taliban delegates said it was against their culture to expel someone seeking sanctuary but asked what would happen to  Bin Laden should he be sent to Saudi Arabia. Yet in September 1998, when the Saudi emissary, Prince Turki, asked Mullah Omar whether he would keep his earlier promise to expel  Bin Laden, the Taliban leader said no. Both sides shouted at each other, with Mullah Omar denouncing the Saudi government. Riyadh then suspended its diplomatic relations with the Taliban regime. (Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates were the only countries that recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan.) Crown Prince Abdullah told President Clinton and Vice President Gore about this when he visited Washington in late September. His account confirmed reports that the U.S. government had received independently. Other efforts with the Saudi government centered on improving intelligence sharing and permitting U.S. agents to interrogate prisoners in Saudi custody. The history of such cooperation in 1997 and 1998 had been strained. Several officials told us, in particular, that the United States could not get direct access to an important al Qaeda financial official, Madani al Tayyib, who had been detained by the Saudi government in 1997.67Though U.S. officials repeatedly raised the issue, the Saudis provided limited information. In his September 1998 meeting with Crown Prince Abdullah, Vice President Gore, while thanking the Saudi government for their responsiveness, renewed the request for direct U.S. access to Tayyib. The United States never obtained this access. An NSC staff-led working group on terrorist finances asked the CIA in November 1998 to push again for access to Tayyib and to see \\"if it is possible to elaborate further on the ties between Usama bin Ladin and prominent individuals in Saudi Arabia, including especially the  Bin Laden family.\\" One result was two NSC-led interagency trips to Persian Gulf states in 1999 and 2000.

On 8 April 1918, after the defeat in Tampere and the German army intervention, the People's Delegation retreated from Helsinki to Vyborg. The loss of Helsinki pushed them to Petrograd on 25 April. The escape of the leadership embittered many Reds, and thousands of them tried to flee to Russia, but most of the refugees were encircled by White and German troops. In the Lahti area they surrendered on 1-2 May. The long Red caravans included women and children, who experienced a desperate, chaotic escape with severe losses due to White attacks. The scene was described as a \\"road of tears\\" for the Reds, but for the Whites, the sight of long, enemy caravans heading east was a victorious moment. The Red Guards' last strongholds between the Kouvola and Kotka area fell by 5 May, after the Battle of Ahvenkoski. The war of 1918 ended on 15 May 1918, when the Whites took over Fort Ino, a Russian coastal artillery base on the Karelian Isthmus, from the Russian troops. White Finland and General Mannerheim celebrated the victory with a large military parade in Helsinki on 16 May 1918. The Red Guards had been defeated. The initially pacifist Finnish labour movement had lost the Civil War, several military leaders committed suicide and a majority of the Reds were sent to prison camps. The Vaasa Senate returned to Helsinki on 4 May 1918, but the capital was under the control of the German army. White Finland had become a protectorate of the German Empire and General Rüdiger von der Goltz was called \\"the true Regent of Finland\\".

Lake forest had trees that were in a symbiotic relationship with a large variety of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. These fungi were less prevalent  in Brook forest.  But I can use this background: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions.

The text starts by listing negative aspects of the movie: bad acting, lack of plot, and poor camerawork.    Justification: Listing negative aspects implies a negative sentiment. 2. The text then mentions \\"absolutely brilliant moments\\" in the movie that keep the viewer hoping for more.    Justification: Mentioning positive aspects can indicate a mixed sentiment, but it's important to consider if the positive elements outweigh the negatives. 3. The phrase \\"it's too little, too late\\" suggests that the positive moments are not enough to save the movie.    Justification: Using phrases that carry negative implications shows a negative sentiment. 4. The text mentions that if someone enjoys specific elements, they may not want to miss this movie. However, the author doesn't appreciate those elements, resulting in a \\"pretty horrible time.\\"    Justification: Acknowledging that some people may like it indicates a mixed sentiment, but the author's negative experience reaffirms the negative sentiment. 5. The mention of \\"a few absolutely brilliant jokes\\" implies that not everything is bad in the movie, but it's not enough to make up for the rest of it.    Justification: Stating a few positive aspects may indicate a mixed sentiment, but it reinforces that the negatives overshadow the positives. 6.

Forks at that time were fairly large with two tines   that aided in the cutting of meat in the kitchen. The tines prevented meat from twisting or moving during cutting and allowed food to slide off more easily than it would with a knife.  By the 7th century A.D., royal courts of the Middle East began to use forks at the table for dining. From the 10th through the 13th centuries, forks were fairly common among the wealthy in Byzantium. In the 11th century, a Byzantine wife brought forks to Italy; however, they were not widely adopted there until the 16th century. Then in 1533, forks were brought from Italy to France. The French were also slow to accept forks, for using them was thought to be awkward.  In 1608, forks were brought to England by Thomas Coryate, who saw them during his travels in Italy. The English first ridiculed   forks as being unnecessary. \\"Why should a person need a fork when God had given him hands?\\" they asked. Slowly, however, forks came to be adopted by the wealthy as a symbol of their social status. They were prized possessions made of expensive materials intended to impress guests. By the mid 1600s, eating with forks was considered fashionable among the wealthy British.  Early table forks were modeled after kitchen forks, but small pieces of food often fell through the two tines or slipped off easily. In late 17th century France, larger forks with four curved tines were developed. The additional tines made diners less likely to drop food, and the curved tines served as a scoop   so people did not have to constantly switch to a spoon while eating. By the early 19th century, four-tined forks had also been developed in Germany and England and slowly began to spread to America. In which way did the use of forks spread?

In which case there would be some effect, case A or case B?  David is a biochemist with a pharmaceutical company. He is testing three strains of bacteria, case A, case B, and case C. In case A the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics. In case B the bacteria resists antibiotics. Finally, in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes.  Hint: Many mutations have no effect on the proteins they encode. These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics. Bacteria with the mutation increase in numbers, so the mutation becomes more common. Other mutations are harmful. They may even be deadly. Harmful mutations often result in a protein that no longer can do its job. Some harmful mutations cause cancer or other genetic disorders. The answer to this question is:","output":"In the given paragraph, we can infer that there will be an effect in case B. This is because case B describes a scenario where the bacteria resists antibiotics. According to the hint provided, a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics is considered beneficial. As a result, bacteria with this mutation will increase in numbers, and the mutation becomes more common. In contrast, case A indicates that the bacteria does not respond to antibiotics, implying that there may be no effect or a neutral mutation in this situation. And in case C, the bacteria does not develop any immunity to antibiotics and eventually perishes, suggesting a harmful mutation. To summarize, there will be some effect in case B, where the bacteria resists antibiotics due to a beneficial mutation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer this question. \\"Which British artist painted \\"\\"The Light of the World\\"\\" and \\"\\"The Scapegoat\\"\\"?\\"","output":"The British artist who painted \\"The Light of the World\\" and \\"The Scapegoat\\" is William Holman Hunt. Born on April 2, 1827, in Cheapside, London, he was renowned as one of the founding members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, which was a group of artists that formed in 1848, along with John Everett Millais and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The Pre-Raphaelite movement sought to return to the artistic principles and styles before the High Renaissance, emphasizing naturalism, vivid colors, and attention to detail. \\"The Light of the World\\" (1853-54) is one of William Holman Hunt's most famous paintings, featuring a striking image of Jesus Christ dressed in a long white robe, holding a lantern in one hand, and knocking on a door that is covered in weeds and overgrowth. The painting is based on the biblical passage from the Book of Revelation, chapter 3, verse 20: \\"Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will sup with him, and he with me.\\" The painting, which currently resides in Keble College, Oxford, stunningly illustrates Christ as a gentle savior offering spiritual comfort and guidance to the viewer. Another notable painting of William Holman Hunt is \\"The Scapegoat\\" (1854-56). This piece visually represents the Jewish religious ritual described in the Book of Leviticus, where a goat would be sent into the wilderness to \\"bear upon him all their iniquities unto a land not inhabited.\\" The concept of the scapegoat is used symbolically in various other instances throughout history and literature, representing the idea of one individual taking on the blame and guilt of others. In \\"The Scapegoat,\\" the solitary animal is depicted standing on a desolate and unreceptive landscape near the Dead Sea, illustrating its symbolic exile as it carries the sins of the community. The vivid colors and astounding level of detail in both the goat and the surrounding environment are characteristic of Hunt's commitment to the Pre-Raphaelite movement's principles. Throughout his extended career, Hunt traveled frequently, moving between England and the Middle East. He sought to capture authentic settings and details in his art, driven by a relentless dedication to truth and accuracy. While his works are deeply rooted in religious themes, the Pre-Raphaelite vision that shone through vividly portrayed a naturalism and vibrancy that set them apart from their contemporaries. William Holman Hunt passed away on September 7, 1910, leaving behind not only these two iconic paintings but a rich and meaningful portfolio that has inspired and captivated art enthusiasts from around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: Cristiano Ronaldo brought the house down with another one-man show at the Santiago Bernabeu and there was even some first-half theatre as he dived for a penalty, which of course he converted in Real’s 3-0 win over Celta. The Real Madrid striker has now scored 200 league goals in 178 games; has netted more hat-tricks, 23 in the league, than any player in La Liga history; and is on a run of scoring in his last 17 home league matches. He is now scoring at a rate nearly two goals a game in the league – 23 in 13 matches. It would be churlish to dwell to long on the nature of the first goal but a dive is a dive even when it’s Ronaldo. VIDEO Scroll down to see Sportsmail's big match stats: Real Madrid 3-0 Celta Vigo. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his clinical hat-trick that sent records tumbling during a 3-0 victory at the Bernabeu. The 29-year-old forward celebrates with team-mates Sergio Ramos (left), Karim Benzema, Dani Carvajal and Gareth Bale (right) Ronaldo took to Instagram after the game to celebrate his hat-trick with Real Madrid team-mate Pepe (right) Real Madrid: Casillas; Carvajal, Pepe, Ramos, Marcelo; Rodriguez (Arbeloa 53mins), Illarramendi, Kroos; Bale, Benzema (Coentrao 81'), Ronaldo (Hernandez 85') Booked: Rodriguez, Carvajal, Arbeloa, Illarramendi.

Booked: Cabral, Jonny, Nolito, Hernandez. Full-back Jonny Castro applied the slightest of touches to Ronaldo’s back as they both chased a Marcelo cross. There was no push from the defender but as the ball went beyond Ronaldo he dropped to the turf and referee Alberto Undiano pointed to the spot.The full-back was booked, as was forward Nolito, as Celta players surrounded the referee. Ronaldo coolly dispatched the spot-kick. It was his seventh penalty of the season. The only other player to score as many spot-kicks at this stage of the campaign was current Southampton manager Ronald Koeman in his Barcelona days. His first goal might have been unjust but it was only fair that Real went in at half time with the advantage having dominated the first 45 minutes. Celta Vigo had named the same team that beat Barcelona 1-0 a month ago but were under pressure from the start. Real should have taken the lead when Ronaldo headed goalwards, Celta Vigo keeper Sergio Alvarez pushed the ball out to Ramos, and he blasted wide from four yards out. Then Ronaldo had the ball taken off of his toe by full-back Jonny just as he was going to convert James Rodriguez’ cross and Gareth Bale joined the fun cutting in from the right but shooting straight at Alvarez. Ronaldo then bicycle-kicked onto the roof of the net with what would have been a sensational way to break the deadlock even by his standards. Alvarez pushed a Ronaldo shot around the post after the forward ran onto a long ball forward from Marcelo, and the keeper then held a shot from Rodriguez after he’d connected with a Ronaldo cross.

The 29-year-old Portuguese forward celebrates his opening strike with Welsh team-mate Bale (right) VIDEO Having Ronaldo is a bonus after bicentennial goal - Ancelotti. Just as it seemed Celta might reach half-time unscathed Undiano pointed to the spot after Jonny touched Ronaldo and the striker broke the deadlock. He got his second goal on 64 minutes after a wall-pass with Toni Kross and fine finish past Alvaraz. Ten minutes from time he completed his hat-trick with a left-foot finish from Marcelo’s cross. He hobbled off with five minutes left with an ankle knock and Rodriguez also went down with a calf injury and was immediately replaced by Arbeloa. Madrid will now wait anxiously for test results on both players – they are already without Luka Modric for the next two and a half months. Only injuries can derail this Ronaldo-inspired Madrid team. If they win in the week against Ludogorets in the Champions League and against Almeria next weekend they will go to the World Club Championship having won their last 20 matches. Real Madrid midfielder James Rodriguez  went down injured early in the second half before being substituted. Real forward Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates his second of the evening in what turned into a conclusive win at the Bernabeu.

This can be deduced from a number of observations: 1. The reviewer suggests that the reader skip the series: \\"Unless you like crying or watching people cry skip this one to the max.\\" This implies that the reviewer did not enjoy it. 2. The reviewer also mentions that the series \\"doesn't serve much purpose,\\" indicating dissatisfaction with the content or plot. 3. The statement \\"the writing is a bit wonky compared to what I've come to expect from this series\\" shows disapproval of the writing quality, hinting at disappointment or a deviance from perceived standards or earlier series' installments. 4. The hope expressed in \\"Here's to hoping this season picks up in the next episode (past two have been disappointing)\\" clearly shows dissatisfaction with the recent episodes, pointing to a less than positive sentiment.

The third step is to ensure the sentence is grammatically correct and allows each element to relate to one another coherently. For example, the church is not just on the hill; it's overseeing the village, creating a relationship between the three elements.  4.

Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an   rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race. The second photon came in a tiny bit later, several... The most important factor in changing the speed of light is to transform    .

Carl August Nielsen (Danish: [ka:l 'nelsn]; 9 June 1865 - 3 October 1931) was a Danish musician, conductor and violinist, widely recognized as his country's most prominent composer. Brought up by poor but musically talented parents on the island of Funen, he demonstrated his musical abilities at an early age. He initially played in a military band before attending the Royal Danish Academy of Music in Copenhagen from 1884 until December 1886. Nielsen was born the seventh of twelve children to a poor peasant family in 1865 at Sortelung near Norre Lyndelse, south of Odense on the island of Funen. His father, Niels Jorgensen, was a house painter and traditional musician who, with his abilities as a fiddler and cornet player, was in strong demand for local celebrations. Nielsen described his childhood in his autobiography Min Fynske Barndom (My Childhood on Funen). His mother, whom he recalls singing folk songs during his childhood, came from a well-to-do family of sea captains while one of his half-uncles, Hans Andersen (1837-1881), was a talented musician.  Nielsen gave an account of his introduction to music: \\"I had heard music before, heard father play the violin and cornet, heard mother singing, and, when in bed with the measles, I had tried myself out on the little violin\\". He had received the instrument from his mother when he was six. He learned the violin and piano as a child and wrote his earliest compositions at the age of eight or nine: a lullaby, now lost, and a polka which the composer mentioned in his autobiography. As his parents did not believe he had any future as a musician, they apprenticed him to a shopkeeper from a nearby village when he was fourteen; the shopkeeper went bankrupt by midsummer and Nielsen had to return home. After learning to play brass instruments, on 1 November 1879 he became a bugler and alto trombonist in the band of the army's 16th Battalion at nearby Odense.  Nielsen did not give up the violin during his time with the battalion, continuing to play it when he went home to perform at dances with his father. The army paid him three kroner and 45 ore and a loaf of bread every five days for two and a half years, after which his salary was raised slightly, enabling him to buy the civilian clothes he needed to perform at barn dances. What were his parents names?","output":"Carl Nielsen's parents were Niels Jørgensen and Maren Kirstine Hansen. Niels was a house painter and a traditional musician, while Maren came from a family of sea captains.

His hands and feet were hogtied so he couldn’t move those, either.”      Goode was “intoxicated” after he and four friends took something in the parking lot before the concert began said Edwards, who declined to comment on what they may have used. “That’ll be determined by the toxicology screen,” he added. “Whatever was ingested, it was done by all five of them.”      The chemical engineer “got paranoid” and left the concert site even before the gig began. He climbed out of his wife’s car and was “in a field running in circles,” Edwards said. “There was no one around him.”      Cops saw him “running from the area acting strange and not cooperative,” Lt. Mark E. Little from the Southaven, Mississippi, Police Dept. said in a statement.      “Officers attempted to detain the subject who began to resist and run from them again,” Little added. “On our initial investigation we learned that the subject had allegedly taken some LSD in a parking lot before a concert.”      Little said officers were waiting on the results of an autopsy that was performed Monday morning which will include toxicology reports.

Troy Goode is dead, and his family is trying to get to the bottom of what happened.      Tim Edwards, with Ballin, Ballin & Fishman P.C, is the family's attorney.      Edwards said Goode and his wife were leaving the Widespread Panic concert at Snowden Grove Amphitheater as it began.      \\"He was under the influence and so the wife began to drive them home,\\" Edwards told WREG.      At some point on Goodman Road Edwards said Goode got out of the car and began running around.      Southaven Police said they were called to a shopping complex on Goodman around 7:45 p.m. on Saturday.      Police say they \\"attempted to detain the subject who began to resist and run from them again. He was eventually restrained by Officers and transferred to an awaiting ambulance to be transported to the hospital.\\"      \\"They showed up in force and subdued him,\\" Edwards said. \\"They hogtied and put his face down on the stretcher.\\"      Edwards claimed a witness heard Goode scream that he could not breathe.      \\"The police took him off and next thing that we know he was a Baptist Hospital,\\" Edwards said.      Police say they were told Goode may have taken LSD in the parking lot before the concert began.      Goode's mother got the call that he died around 11:00 p.m. Saturday night.      \\"The family as you might expect is grieving, and they are not irrational at all, but they want answers. They want to know why Troy died,\\" Edwards explained.      WREG started questioning Southaven Police about the events that took place before Goode's death, but a department spokesperson said they were not commenting or releasing any more information Sunday evening.      Goode's body is being taken to Jackson, Mississippi for an autopsy.      \\"I'm not in the position right now pointing fingers because I don't know the cause of death,\\" Edwards said.

Researchers have developed a book with specially treated pages that can turn dirty water into clean and drinkable water. They say their invention could improve the lives of many in the developing world. About 700 million people around the world are at risk of disease or even death because their drinking water is not clean. The water is polluted by harmful bacteria. The book contains 25 pages. Each page is about one millimeter thick. The pages contain very small particles   of silver. The pages can be used as filters to remove harmful microorganisms   that can pollute drinking water. The filter kills the organisms that pass through it. Pictures on the pages show the dangers of dirty water and how to use the book for those unable to read. The pages are made of filter paper. They are designed to be torn from the book. Water can be poured through the paper to be cleaned. Ms. Dankovich, the inventor, says each page can treat up to 100 liters of water. She recently presented her invention at the meeting of the American Chemical Society in Boston, Massachusetts. She was asked whether she had considered adding classic literature on the book's pages. \\"The idea of classic texts--that's of interest maybe later. We have discussed a little bit more exciting text. But we really haven't had the time to go through _ \\" she says.

Isolate the term containing k. 3. Solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of k (which is 64). Step 1: Simplify the equation by combining like terms First, let's add and subtract the constant terms on the left-hand side of the equation: 64*k + (747 + 845 - 331) = -147 Now we can calculate the result of the addition and subtraction: 747 + 845 = 1592 1592 - 331 = 1261 So, the simplified equation becomes: 64*k + 1261 = -147 Step 2: Isolate the term containing k Now, let's isolate the term containing k by subtracting 1261 from both sides of the equation: 64*k + 1261 - 1261 = -147 - 1261 This simplifies to: 64*k = -1408 Step 3: Solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of k (64) Finally, we will solve for k by dividing both sides of the equation by 64: 64*k / 64 = -1408 / 64 This simplifies to: k = -22 So the solution for the given equation is k = -22."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state. He has maintained his innocence and said he was trying to help connect the Jewish community to the Internet. Castro, speaking to the National Assembly, said that 86 prisoners from 25 countries would be among those released in coming days. He cited the upcoming visit of Pope Benedict XVI as one of the motivations behind the move, which he said showed the \\"generosity and strength of the revolution.\\" The pope has said he plans to visit Mexico and Cuba before Easter.  Question: \\"How long has Alan Gross maintained his innocence?\\" Response: \\"15 years\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Along with Sir John Heathcoat-Amory, who altered and diluted the interior features of the house he commissioned in 1967?  The commission for the brand new house of Knightshayes Court was obtained from Sir John Heathcoat-Amory in 1867 and the foundation stone was laid in 1869. By 1874, the building was still incomplete, owing to ongoing difficulties with Heathcoat-Amory, who objected to many of Burges's designs on the grounds of cost and of style. Although work had begun on the interior, the turbulent relationship between architect and client led to Burges's sacking in 1874 and his replacement by John Dibblee Crace. Nevertheless, Knightshayes Court remains the only example of a medium-sized Burges country house, built in a standard Victorian arrangement. Early French Gothic in style, it follows a standard neo-Tudor plan of a large central block with projecting gables. The tower Burges planned was never built. The interior was to have been a riot of Burgesian excess but not a single room was completed to Burges's designs. Of the few interior features that were fully executed, much was altered or diluted by Heathcoat-Amory and his successors. However some of the interiors, such as the library, vaulted hall and the arched red drawing room, remain or have been re-instated.Since the house passed to the National Trust in 1972, major works of restoration and re-creation have been undertaken and a number of pieces of Burges furniture, mostly not original to the house, are displayed. These include a bookcase from Buckingham Street and a chimney piece from the Hall at Worcester College, Oxford, where, in the 1960s, some decorative works by Burges were removed, although his redecoration of the college Chapel remains. The aim is, as far as possible, to reinstate the work of Burges and Crace.

No; The given statement, \\"Destination marketing organizations are often called travel, convention, visitors, or tourism bureaux, welcome centers, information centers, and more.\\" would not be a reasonable answer to the question, \\"how many cubes are in the US?\\" The question is asking for a count or a number of cubes in the US. It is unclear whether the question refers to a specific type of cube (e.g., Rubik's cubes, ice cubes, etc.) or is asking in a more general sense. Regardless, the information provided in the answer about destination marketing organizations is not relevant to any interpretation of the question. The response should address the topic of cubes in the US rather than discussing unrelated information. In order to provide a relevant answer to the question, one would need to first clarify what type of cube is being referred to. For example, if the question is about Rubik's cubes, one could attempt to research and estimate the number of Rubik's cubes in the United States, taking into consideration sales data, market penetration, and other factors. This research task would be difficult due to the nature of the information required. Similarly, if the question is about ice cubes, one could research data related to the production and consumption of ice by the US population or other ice-cube-related statistics. However, providing an exact number would still be a challenging task due to the wide range of data sources and variables involved.

The stepfather bribes Blue Jones (Oscar Isaac), an asylum orderly, into forging the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Dr. Vera Gorski (Carla Gugino), to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform the authorities of the true circumstances leading to her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape. Babydoll slips into a fantasy world in which she is newly arrived in a brothel owned by Blue, whom she envisions as a mobster, where she and the other patients are sex slaves. In this realm, she befriends four other dancersÂ â Amber (Jamie Chung), Blondie (Vanessa Hudgens), Rocket (Jena Malone), and Rocket's sister and \\"star of the show\\", Sweet Pea (Abbie Cornish).

Gorski encourages Babydoll to perform an erotic dance, during which Babydoll further fantasizes she is in feudal Japan, meeting the Wise Man (Scott Glenn). After she expresses her desire to \\"escape\\", the Wise Man presents Babydoll with weapons and tells her that she would need to collect five items: a map, fire, a knife, a key, and a fifth, unrevealed item that would require \\"a deep sacrifice\\" but bring a \\"perfect victory\\".

Write a summary based on this article: Why it matters: Trump has tweeted in the past that he thinks global warming is a hoax, but that was in 2012 and he has not focused on the topic much at all in his Twitter activity as president. This tweet shows he's still openly mocking mainstream climate change science, even without directly questioning it.      President Trump mocked the idea of global warming in a tweet Thursday, making one of his first (if not the first) such public comments on the topic since entering the White House almost a year ago.      Fast facts: Most scientists agree human activity, primarily through the burning of fossil fuels, has been the primary contributor to Earth's aggregate temperature going up this past century. That does not mean, though, that freezing cold weather, like the East Coast is experiencing right now, won't happen in the future in many parts of the world. Climate change science is much more complicated than that, but citing cold weather is still a favorite line of politicians and others who doubt climate change is happening. Sen. James Inhofe, Republican from Oklahoma, threw a snowball on the Senate floor in February 2015 to mock global warming.            One level deeper: Trump's tweet was also mocking the Paris climate deal, a global accord virtually every country in the world except the United States supports. It calls on countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but as it stands the commitments wouldn't cut emissions to the levels most scientists say is needed. America's commitment under President Obama was actually relatively moderate -- up to 28% cut in such emissions by 2025 based on 2005 levels, but the Trump administration pointed to conservative groups' studies showing it could cripple the U.S. industrial economy while other countries, notably China, were called on to do less.      Between the lines: The Trump administration released without political influence a statutorily required report earlier this year confirming in great depth that human activity is driving climate change. Trump's tweets get a lot of attention, but make sure to also watch what the administration does or doesn't do on this issue.      The bottom line: Words matter, and so do the president's tweets. His perspective on this issue is influencing his most ardent followers, a new poll suggests. A survey released in October from George Mason University found that just 21% of conservative Republicans think global warming is mostly human-caused, a decrease of nine points since earlier this year.      The semantics around climate change, or global warming, are almost as divisive as the science itself. Global warming was the default term up until the last decade or so, when climate change became more popular among those urging action to cut greenhouse gas emissions. That shift was partly to respond to comments like Trump made Thursday by clarifying that a higher global aggregate temperature does not mean the entire planet would be getting universally warmer. ||||| U.S. reconnaissance satellites have spotted Chinese ships selling oil to North Korean vessels on the West Sea around 30 times since October.      According to South Korean government sources, the satellites have pictured large Chinese and North Korean ships illegally trading in oil in a part of the West Sea closer to China than South Korea.      The satellite pictures even show the names of the ships. A government source said, \\"We need to focus on the fact that the illicit trade started after a UN Security Council resolution in September drastically capped North Korea's imports of refined petroleum products.\\"      The U.S. Treasury Department placed six North Korean shipping and trading companies and 20 of their ships on sanctions list on Nov. 21, when it published spy satellite images taken on Oct. 19 showing a ship named Ryesonggang 1 connected to a Chinese vessel. |||||","output":"President Trump recently mocked the concept of global warming in a tweet, highlighting his continued skepticism towards mainstream climate change science. This marks one of his first public comments on the subject since entering the White House. The majority of scientists agree that human activity, predominantly from burning fossil fuels, has been the primary cause of the rise in Earth's aggregate temperature during the past century. However, this does not rule out the occurrence of cold weather events similar to the one currently experienced by the US East Coast. Trump's tweet further criticizes the Paris climate agreement, which the US, under his administration, has refused to support. During Trump's time as President, his administration published a report that detailed how human activity is indeed the driving force behind climate change. While his tweets receive ample attention, it is crucial to observe how the administration handles the climate change issue through policy decisions. The effects of Trump's viewpoint on global warming cannot be underestimated, as it influences his supporters. A George Mason University poll found that only 21% of conservative Republicans believe global warming is predominantly human-caused, a decline of nine points from earlier in 2017. The terms \\"climate change\\" and \\"global warming\\" have become almost as divisive as the science itself. Although \\"global warming\\" was the default phrase in the past, \\"climate change\\" has become more prevalent amongst those advocating for greenhouse gas emission cuts. This terminological change aims to clarify that a higher global aggregate temperature does not necessarily mean uniform warming across the entire planet."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Trust is hard to build if people don't think you are honest. If you say things to either get your way or to please others, pretty soon people will catch on. Get to know your thoughts and feelings and communicate them to others in a respectful way. Make your actions and words match.  If you're going to be late or miss something, let the person know. Don't say you'll maybe be there if you can't make it. Be honest and genuine about your wants, likes, and dislikes and communicate them. For example, don't say you want to eat Chinese food to please your friend, then complain about not eating what you want. If you back out of plans last minute, chances are people won't trust you to do things or won't feel like they can count on you. If you say you'll be somewhere, be there. If you say you'll help your friend, help your friend. Once people see you as reliable, they will begin to trust you and count on you. For example, if someone proposes plans, try not to waver on them too long. You might fear committing to plans, but show that you're reliable and say either yes or no. . Respect goes a long way in building and maintaining trusting friendships. Treat people with dignity and as equals to yourself. How you treat others shows the kind of person you are and whether you're deserving of people's trust. For example, listen when people speak without speaking over them. Don't make everything about you. If you're known as a gossip or someone who spreads rumors, chances are nobody will trust you. Drop this habit and learn to speak to people and about people differently. If you're not sure about something, ask the person directly instead of spreading a rumor. People want to know that you will treat them well and not say mean things about them to others. People notice when you look out for other people and offer to help. Treat people you know and don't know with kindness. Be polite and show up for your friends when they need you.  For example, ask a friend if they need help moving or if they need a hug after a difficult day. Being a friend to someone who's in need can show that you're a worthwhile and trustworthy friend. Being vulnerable is an important part of friendship. By telling your friends your secrets, insecurities, and deepest thoughts, you are showing them that you trust them. In return, they may share their most intimate thoughts with you. It can be hard to open up at first. Start small. Talk about things that are important to you. When the time is right, share more about yourself. It is important that you do not judge or laugh at your friends when they open up to you. Good friends are nonjudgmental when their friend shares something important to them. Summary:","output":"To build trust, be honest and genuine in your communication, making sure your actions and words match. Be punctual and reliable, demonstrating your commitment to plans and promises. Treat others with respect and dignity, listen to them without interrupting, and avoid gossiping or spreading rumors. Show kindness, offer help, and support your friends during difficult times. Be open and vulnerable by sharing your feelings, secrets, and thoughts, fostering deeper connections.

However, she was granted a 10-day stay of execution - which was only given after she said her heart-wrenching final goodbyes to her mother, Shole Pakravan. In her last attempt to save her daughter's life, Pakravan is now begging the Iranian government to show mercy and spare Reyhaneh from the gallows. In a remarkable demonstration of a mother's love, Shole has gone as far as stating that she wishes she could be the one executed in her daughter's stead.

It may seem counter-intuitive, but the focus of prospecting should not be making sales. Your focus must be on establishing a relationship with as many prospects as possible.  Opening the relationship comes first. Once you make contact with a prospect, you need to convince him or her to schedule an appointment or listen to your sales pitch. Sales are important, of course, and you should go into each dialogue with the goal of selling your product or service. Even if you do not make the sale, though, you should still seek to keep the relationship open. That prospect may need your product or service later, and if you continue to touch base, he or she may think of you before contacting anyone else when the time comes. Prospects typically respond better when they feel they are being served rather than sold to. Feedback lets your prospects know that you are interested in their needs and wants.  Stay engaged through social media. Post frequent updates to your blog and social media pages, and respond to inquiries and comments made through those sources. Send surveys. Prospects are generally more willing to respond to short surveys, but they may respond to a long survey if there is a reward or the chance of a reward at the end. For instance, filling out a survey may enter the prospect in a drawing for cash or a gift card. Regardless of the length, though, sending surveys sends the message that you want to know how you can improve to meet customer needs. Even if your prospect is actually a large company instead of an individual, you will probably speak with the same individual at the company each time you call or write.  Establishing a positive relationship with your contact at the company is important. At minimum, you need to know his or her name and keep your conversations both friendly and professional. If necessary, take notes after each conversation with your contact so that you can pick up where you left off with the next call. The contact you establish a relationship with may not make the final decision, but he or she will have some input. Creating a favorable opinion with your initial contact will improve your chances of a receiving a positive recommendation. Once you've started a relationship with a prospect, you need to nurture that relationship so that it continues to grow. The idea is to eventually convert your prospects into loyal customers. Follow up with each prospect on a regular basis. Send \\"thank you\\" notes and e-mails. Pass along surveys and copies of your newsletter. Touch base with those who have bought from you in the past to find out how satisfied they are with your product or service.","output":"The primary focus of prospecting should be on establishing and nurturing relationships with as many prospects as possible, rather than solely making sales, as this approach can lead to more loyal customers and long-term business connections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: (1). heat energy (2). direct energy (3). depletion of light (4). inspection of light (5). flow of electrons (6). refraction of light (7). optical illusions (8). The area was once underwater The answer is:","output":"(6). refraction of light Reasoning: Given Fact 1: Glass causes refraction of light. Given Fact 2: Mirrors are plate glass. Given these two facts, we can deduce that mirrors also cause refraction of light. Refraction occurs when light waves pass through one medium to another and change direction due to the different speeds of light in the two media. Mirrors are made of plate glass that has a reflective coating (usually silver, aluminum, or other metals) applied to the back. When light enters the glass, some of it is refracted and continues through the glass medium. The majority of the light, however, gets reflected off the reflective coating, forming the mirror's image. The refraction of light in the mirror is not as obvious as in a transparent medium, such as water, due to the reflective coating behind the glass. However, since mirrors are made from plate glass, they still cause refraction of light, as indicated in Fact 1. The other options are incorrect because: (1). heat energy - Mirrors do not generate or cause heat energy themselves. They simply reflect and refract light. (2). direct energy - Mirrors do not create or distribute energy; they reflect and refract light. (3). depletion of light - Mirrors do not deplete light but reflect and refract it. (4). inspection of light - Mirrors do not inspect light but reflect and refract it. (5). flow of electrons - Mirrors do not influence the flow of electrons, as their operation is based on the reflection and refraction of light. (7). optical illusions - Optical illusions can be created using mirrors, but it is not the sole cause or purpose of mirrors. (8).

Scary considering what I wrote about expecting him to call. I can't express the chill I got when I saw his name on the label. A message from the dead. Surely it's not a good Omen. It's a painting. Or at least I think it is. The package is the right shape, and knowing Walter it seems likely, but...I haven't yet worked up the courage to open it yet. I'm afraid of what I might find. April 3, 2006 Went to the funeral today. Walter's wife, Martha, was in hysterics. Can't say I blame her. It was awkward being there seeing someone in the most vulnerable possible condition. I didn't know her that well. Walter and I rarely interacted outside of work, so I have very little knowledge of his personal life. Sylvia went up to her and hugged her even though she'd never met her before in her life. It must be something with women to be able to make that kind of spontaneous connection. I just shook her hand, and told her I was sorry. I don't make a habit of crying in public, but seeing her so shaken up brought tears to the edges of my eyes, and I did nothing to wipe them away. After five years of friendship it's the least Walter deserves of me. One other thing. The package. It's still sitting there in my study. Mocking me. That's how it feels anyway. Should...

If you'd like your cornstarch paste to dry quickly, you may want to add some white glue to the mixture.  Blend enough cornstarch and water to make a thick paste.  After heating the mixture until translucent, take it off the heat, and stir in the white glue. For best results, use a 50/50 mixture of glue and paste.  Make sure you stir thoroughly after the white glue is added.  Otherwise, the glue will not bind with the cornstarch paste base. The resulting mixture is a good choice for craft projects that require extra gluing power. Choose your favorite scent and stir in a few drops just before using the glue. A little goes a long way, so don't add more than 3-5 drops.  Rose oil is a great touch for glue on a love letter. Peppermint would be an excellent addition to a Christmas card.

He resented his younger brother's arrangement; during the wedding ceremony he \\"became more deathly pale than death itself, and, so they say, is unable to bear this thing, that he, the first-born, should see himself deprived of such splendid status and of the daughter of an Emperor.\\" In 1546 Paul gave Pier Luigi the duchies of Parma and Piacenza as papal fiefs, a highly political move by the pope: in doing so he gave titles and wealth to Pier and appointed a lord who was subservient and owed a debt of gratitude, guaranteeing that the duchies would remain under papal control. At the same time, Ottavio was posted to the North of Italy to support Charles. By 1546 Ottavio was 22 years old, married to Margaret of Austria and an accomplished and distinguished individual. In 1547 his father was assassinated and Ottavio claimed the dukedom of Parma and Piacenza against the express wishes of both Charles, his father-in-law, and Paul. In doing so, Ottavio acted in opposition to the pope's desire to maintain the duchies as papal fiefs, and to Charles, whom he believed responsible for the plot to assassinate Pier Luigi.Titian was a personal friend of Charles; the commissioning of the portrait was most likely intended by Paul as a signal of allegiance to the emperor. Pressure from reforming monarchs in France and Spain, coupled with a general shift of influence in France's favour, ended the Farnese hold on the papacy soon after Paul's death.

A squirrel's home is called a drey. Patch's drey was very comfortable. He lived high up an old oak tree, in a hollowed-out stump of a big branch that had long ago been cut off by humans. The entrance was only just big enough for Patch to squeeze in and out, but the drey itself was spacious, for a squirrel. Patch had lined his drey with dry leaves, grasses and bits of newspaper. It was warm and dry, and on that cold morning he would have liked nothing better than to stay home all day and sleep. But he was so hungry. Hunger filled him like water fills a glass. The cherry and maple trees had not yet started to bud; flowers had not yet begun to grow; the juicy grubs and bugs of spring had not yet emerged; and it had been two days since Patch had found a nut. Imagine how hungry you would feel if you went two whole days without eating, and you may have some idea how Patch felt that morning. Patch poked his head out of the drey into the cold air and shivered as he looked around. Clumps of white, crumbly ice still clung to the ground. Gusts of cold wind shook and rustled the trees' bare branches. The pale and distant sun seemed drained of heat. Patch took a moment to satisfy himself that there were no dangers nearby, no hawk circling above or unleashed dog below. Then he emerged from his drey and began to look for acorns.

Her father Tom (Sam Robards) has climbed Mount Everest so it runs in the family. Several years earlier, Tom fell more than 100 feet during a climb and because her parents Tom and Molly (Jennifer Beals) are afraid she might hurt herself, they have ordered Maddy not to climb. Tom had some internal injuries from that earlier fall which he did not know about and now the injury has paralyzed him from the neck down. There is an experimental operation costing 250,000 which can save him, but insurance will not pay for the operation and the family does not have the money. Harderbach Financial's president Brisbane (Michael Des Barres) refuses to loan the amount and does so by putting loopholes in a contract Molly signed (he is really trying to avoid loaning any money at all). When asked if he has a heart, Brisbane coldly responds \\"This is not an emotional issue, Mrs. Phillips. A bank has no heart. Only paper in a vault\\". That is when Maddy first gets the idea to rob the bank. Maddy steals three go-carts from her father's race course (Tom has a race track where people race in go-carts) and convinces her two friends Gus (Max Thieriot) and Austin (Corbin Bleu) to help her.

Negative Movie Review: \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" As an avid moviegoer, I cherish the excitement of immersing myself in a film that transports me to another world, one filled with enchanting characters, captivating storylines, and unforgettable visuals. Unfortunately, my experience with \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" left me yearning for the magic of cinematic storytelling that was so painfully absent from this film. From the outset, it was apparent that the film's plot lacked originality—a glaring issue that further unraveled as the story progressed. The movie was riddled with tropes, clichés, and scenes left me feeling bewildered by their inclusion, owing to their rather hackneyed nature. This absence of a distinctive narrative left a lingering sense of lost opportunity; a story filled with unexplored potential. Moreover, the characters in \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" were tragically underdeveloped, making it nearly impossible for viewers to form any emotional bond or invest in their stories. A lack of depth and complexity reduced the film to a shallow portrayal of cardboard cutouts parading across the screen, with dialogue that was often stilted and cringe-worthy. To make matters worse, any semblance of chemistry between the characters was glaringly absent, resulting in scenes that lacked emotion and genuine interaction. While a film's visual effects and cinematography can often redeem a weak plot and characters, \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" was unable to salvage itself through these means either. The visuals were unimaginative and lackluster, often leaning on CGI as a crutch to distract from the dull cinematography. Consequently, the film felt like a relic of a bygone era, rather than an innovative and exciting work of contemporary cinema. As if the weak story, characters and visuals weren't enough, the film's pacing was an exercise in frustration, ambling between tediously slow scenes to sudden, jarring jumps in the narrative. This erratic pacing made it difficult to fully immerse oneself in the film, serving only to underscore the fact that the end product was, regrettably, a disjointed mess. In conclusion, \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" failed to deliver the engaging and nuanced storytelling one would expect from cinema today. The uninspired plot, one-dimensional characters, bland visuals, and uneven pacing culminated in a movie that was ultimately forgettable. In an age where films can be both thought-provoking and visually stunning, this film missed the mark by a long shot. I would recommend steering clear of \\"Disappointment on the Silver Screen\\" and seeking out movies that truly exemplify the captivating power of a well-told story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: You can create a great deal of steam in your bathroom if you turn on your shower as hot as it will go and close the door. To fill the room, you’ll want to wait at least 10 minutes so the steam has time to build. Once there is plenty of steam in the bathroom, you can set the page down so the steam can help relax its fibers. Make sure that it’s not too close to the shower, though, because you don’t want any moisture to develop on the paper. Check that it isn’t folded or creased in any areas either. Wherever you plan to set the paper down, it’s a good idea to lay down a clean towel first. It will absorb any moisture that might be on the surface from the steam, so you don’t have to worry about the paper getting too wet. In order for the steam to help the paper release the wrinkles, you’ll need to keep it in the bathroom for approximately 10 minutes. If the page is severely wrinkled, you may want to give it extra time -- but check on it every so often to ensure that it’s not absorbing too much moisture. After the paper has been steamed, remove it from the bathroom, and place it on another flat surface. While the steam may have helped release some of the wrinkles, you should use your hand to press over it again while the paper is still relaxed from the steam. Be gentle, though, because you don’t want to tear or damage the page.  You may want to cover your hand in a clean hand towel before smoothing the paper. That will help protect it from any dirt, oils, or other debris that might be on your skin. Even if you manage to smooth most of the wrinkles out of the paper, you may want to place the paper under a heavy weight for several hours to a day in order to further press it. Summary:","output":"The text describes a method of using steam to relax the fibers of a piece of paper, potentially removing wrinkles and creases. The process begins with running a hot shower in a closed bathroom, generating steam. After a buildup of about 10 minutes, the paper can be placed in the steamy room on a towel to absorb any surface moisture. The distance from the shower should be enough to avoid any moisture from developing on the paper. It is also advised to ensure the paper is not folded or creased. Following an approximate 10-minute exposure to the steam (possibly longer for heavily wrinkled paper), the paper should be frequently checked so it doesn't absorb too much moisture. Post-steam treatment, the paper should be gently pressed while it is still relaxed from the steam, preferably with a clean hand towel, to prevent any damage or tear. Finally, for the best results, the paper should be placed under a heavy weight for several hours to a day.

Popeye walks in using the swinging old-style doors. Olive notices Popeye, patiently sitting at a table. Olive dances to Popeye. Popeye gives Olive her \\"bouquet\\" (which consists of only one flower) and Olive dances away with a leap. Olive's feet gets stuck into two spittoons. While Olive struggles to get out of the spittoons, Popeye is laughing. Olive, determined to get even, performs a fancy dance. Afterwards, the people in the tavern applaud to Olive's act. Bluto enters the tavern. He blasts his guns numerous times, forming a cloud. When the cloud clears, everyone is seen to have fled the tavern—all but Popeye. Bluto, noticing Popeye sitting calmly, goes over to him. A poster reading \\"5000 REWARD ... BLUTO THE BANDIT\\" has Bluto's picture on it. The two Blutos notice each other. Popeye looks at the poster after Bluto, realizing Bluto is the bandit on the poster., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","output":"Olive Oyl is getting even with Popeye by performing a fancy dance. This is because Popeye laughed at Olive when her feet got stuck in two spittoons while dancing. In order to get even, Olive performs a fancy dance, impressing the people in the tavern, thus redeeming herself and getting even with Popeye for laughing at her earlier mishap."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.  - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music.  - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music.   - The (FIFA ; \\"International Federation of Association Football\\") is the international governing body of association football, futsal, and beach soccer. FIFA is responsible for the organisation of football's major international tournaments, notably the World Cup which commenced in 1930 and the Women's World Cup which commenced in 1991.   - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare.  - Association football, more commonly known as football or soccer, is a team sport played between two teams of eleven players with a spherical ball. It is played by 250 million players in over 200 countries and dependencies, making it the world's most popular sport. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The object of the game is to score by getting the ball into the opposing goal.  - The Union of European Football Associations (UEFA, ; ) is the administrative body for association football in Europe, although several member states are primarily or entirely located in Asia. It is one of six continental confederations of world football's governing body FIFA. UEFA consists of 55 national association members.  - The UEFA Champions League is an annual continental club football competition organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA) and contested by top-division European clubs. It is one of the most prestigious tournaments in the world and the most prestigious club competition in European football, played by the national league champion (and, for some nations, one or more runners-up) of each UEFA national association. The final of the 201213 tournament was the most watched UEFA Champions League final to date, as well as the most watched annual sporting event worldwide in 2013, drawing 360 million television viewers.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The UEFA Champions League Anthem , officially titled simply as \`\` Champions League '' , is the official anthem of the UEFA Champions League , written by English composer Tony Britten in 1992 .  - Anglican church music is music that is written for liturgical worship in Anglican church services.    What is the relationship between 'uefa champions league anthem' and 'national anthem'? A:","output":"The relationship between the 'UEFA Champions League Anthem' and a 'national anthem' is that both are musical compositions associated with specific organizations or entities. The UEFA Champions League Anthem is the official anthem for the UEFA Champions League, a prestigious football club competition in Europe, while a national anthem is a patriotic musical composition representing a country and its people. Both serve as symbols and hold significant meaning for the respective groups they represent, though a national anthem typically carries more historical and cultural significance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. You are given a new situation: Pam is an astronaut who has been given a mission to find a new planet for humans to live on. She is exploring the outer rims of the galaxy when she discovers two new planets that may be suitable. The atmospheric makeup of these planets is very similar to Pam's current home. After running a quick diagnostic, the only difference that Pam sees is that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A.  and a hint : The dangers of global warming are being increasingly studied by a wide global consortium of scientists. These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  Please answer this question : Which planet has more less inside its atmosphere?","output":"Between the two planets discovered by Pam during her mission, planet A has less carbon dioxide in its atmosphere compared to planet B. This significant detail can play a crucial role in determining the suitability of these planets for human habitation.  As mentioned in the hint, global warming and climate change are real and pressing concerns caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases, with carbon dioxide being the main culprit. Greenhouse gases, due to their molecular structure, are highly effective in trapping heat within the atmosphere. This leads to a rise in Earth's temperature and contributes to various adverse effects on the planet and human existence. Warming caused by greenhouse gases is responsible for the destruction or alteration of natural habitats and a decline in wildlife populations. With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's report suggesting a significant temperature increase between 1990 and 2100, it is crucial that human colonization considers the long-term consequences of adding carbon dioxide to a planet's atmosphere. With this in mind, planet A, with comparatively lower carbon dioxide levels in its atmosphere, would be a more promising option for human habitation. Given the urgency in mitigating the effects of global warming and preserving natural environments, selecting a planet with less atmospheric carbon dioxide would provide a better foundation for sustainable human settlement. However, Pam should also consider other factors before making a final decision, such as the availability of resources, geological stability, and potential habitability for humans and other life forms. Both planets should be thoroughly studied to ensure that the selected planet will meet the long-term needs of the settlers and minimize any negative impact on the environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sadly, the weather has been pretty gray and rainy so far – in fact the forecast has it cloudy and rainy every day until after we leave. So I was pleasantly surprised to be awakened by the sun peeking around the edges of the curtain in my room, especially after the weather yesterday in which the wind gusted 35-40 mph – hard enough to blow the patio furniture around on my balcony (and at one point, catching a chair and flipping it against the rail so hard that if the rail had been just a bit shorter, it might have gone over). Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright. The clouds eventually rolled back in again, but the sunshine was nice while it lasted. We walked over to the fort and I took these shots of the city wall and from across the small cove between them.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Pre-Ordering School Lunches Steer Kids To Healthier Meal Choices Along the lines of advice to avoid grocery shopping when you’re hungry, new research concludes that children who electronically pre-order their lunch are more likely to make healthier meal choices than students who pick and choose as they make their way through the cafeteria line. The four-week study looked at the choices made by 272 students in grades 1 to 5 in two schools in upstate New York. When the students pre-ordered their lunches, 29% were more likely to pick a healthier entrée compared to 15% when the option to pre-order was unavailable. When students chose their entrée in the lunch line, they were 48% less likely to make a healthy choice and 21% more likely to chose a less healthy entrée. (MORE: Stricter School Lunch Standards Lead To Lighter Kids) In the study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, researchers from Cornell University suggest that preordering lunch entrées could prevent distractions like sights and smells that could prompt kids to make hasty and potentially unhealthy choices when picking their meals. Anti-obesity advocates and public health experts continually look for ways to measurably change the food environments for children in schools. In January 2012 the U.S. Department of Agriculture revised school meal guidelines and required more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and stricter calorie limits. The stricter guidelines were met with mixed reviews, with some children complaining the calorie limits didn’t fill them up. In response, the USDA allowed the schools more flexibility in meat and grain servings. But there’s still debate about the restrictions. As school lunch nutritional standards continue evolving, research is showing that having healthier options in school cafeterias could effectively curb weight gain and cravings for unhealthy treats. (MORE: More Food for Hungry Students: USDA Tweaks School Meals) “I think that some of the great things that happened with updating the school meal standards was that there were more fruits and vegetables,” says Jessica Donze Black, project director for The Pew Charitable Trusts Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project. Black is unaffiliated with the study. “We all recognize that kids don’t get enough fruits and vegetables and certainly giving them more is a good thing. When we look at the schools that have been successful with that, where the kids are really eating more fruits and vegetables, there are some strategies that are really working.” Some schools have already seen success, and Black says some of the most successful and sustainable changes in lunchroom fare and eating habits have been among schools involving students in the menu decision-making process. ”Giving children an opportunity to taste-test allows them to provide feedback and an opportunity to show their preferences,” says Black. It helps also if schools are rolling the lunch room changes out over time; getting used to healthier options doesn’t happen overnight. “A lot of those schools who have done well with integrating the foods will say they started the process a couple of years ago,” says Black. (MORE: Cutting Out Soda Curbs Children’s Weight Gain, Studies Show) While pre-ordering meals may be a strategy for steering kids toward healthier choices, Black says that the overall food environment makes a greater difference in whether kids choose healthy food options. “It is not just what is in the meals, but what’s in the rest of the school food environment. What’s in the a la carte line, what’s in the vending machine, what’s in the school’s store. It’s important all those foods are also healthy so we are not making fruits and vegetables compete with cookies and cakes when it comes to students’ tastes,” she says. The Kids’ Safe and Healthful Foods Project’s recent health impact assessment (HIA) showed that revising national nutrition standards for snacks and drinks sold in schools not only helps students maintain a good weight but also benefits school budgets by increasing revenue for school food services. Without unhealthy snacks, the research found students are more likely to buy school meals. “This is also better for school budgets because they get reimbursements from the federal governments for all those meals. It’s a win-win,” says Black. As researchers continue to pinpoint the most successful strategies for healthier students — and schools continue to implement them — there’s hope that that now and in the future children’s weight and energy will reach healthy levels.

What is the ingredient usually used to turn rice or curry yellow","output":"The ingredient typically used to turn rice or curry yellow is turmeric (Curcuma longa). Turmeric is a spice obtained from the rhizomes or roots of the turmeric plant, which is a member of the ginger family. It is native to Southeast Asia and has been widely used in various cuisines for centuries, particularly in Indian, Thai, and Middle Eastern dishes. Turmeric is well-known for its vibrant yellow color, which in fact comes from a naturally occurring chemical compound called curcumin. Curcumin is a pigment that imparts the characteristic yellow hue to dishes, including rice and curry, when it is used in small quantities. Its color also makes it a popular choice for natural food coloring. When used in rice dishes, turmeric adds not only a beautiful shade of yellow but also a subtle earthy and slightly bitter flavor. Many famous rice dishes, such as Indian Biryani or Spanish paella, use turmeric for color and taste. Turmeric can also be found in various curry recipes, either as a whole root or in ground form, typically combined with other spices like cumin, coriander, and chili powder. The spice blend gives curries their rich depth of flavor and color. To use turmeric in rice or curry, the following steps are usually followed: 1. Preparing the spice: If using whole turmeric root, wash it thoroughly and peel its outer skin. Use a grater or mortar and pestle to grate or crush it into a smooth paste. If using ground turmeric, measure out the required amount according to your recipe. 2. Preparing the dish: In a pan or pot over medium heat, sauté chopped onions, garlic, and any other aromatics you may be using. Then, add the turmeric and other spices, stirring well to combine. This process, known as \\"blooming,\\" helps release the aroma and flavor of the turmeric and spices. 3. Adding the main ingredients: If making rice, add the washed rice to the pan, stirring it to ensure that every grain is coated in the turmeric-infused oil. If making curry, add your choice of protein (such as chicken, beef, or tofu) or vegetables, cooking until they are well-coated in the spice mix. 4. Creating the sauce or cooking the rice: Add liquids depending on the dish. For curry, this may include crushed tomatoes, coconut milk, or stock. For rice, use an appropriate amount of water or stock depending on the type of rice you are using. Cook the dish according to the recipe instructions until the ingredients are well-cooked and the liquids are absorbed or thickened. Turmeric not only gives rice and curry dishes their signature yellow color, but it also offers various health benefits. Curcumin is known for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. Moreover, it has been studied for its potential role in managing health conditions such as arthritis, heart disease, diabetes, and even cancer. In conclusion, turmeric is the key ingredient used to give rice and curry dishes their appealing, distinctive yellow hue. Its unique color and flavor, along with its health benefits, have made it an essential spice in numerous cuisines worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

And, time B showed earth's climatic condition in the present century. Keith was amazed to see how the world has changed in just a century.  and a hint : Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change.

To elaborate, during the 1990s, football experienced a revival in Britain, which was significantly aided by the influence of film and literature. This period was marked by a change in the perception of the sport, transitioning from a primarily working-class pastime with a somewhat negative reputation due to hooliganism and violence in the 1980s, to a more socially inclusive and economically prosperous activity. Literature, including the publication mentioned in the statement, played an essential role in reflecting and influencing this transformation in British society. One example is the best-selling book \\"Fever Pitch\\" by Nick Hornby, published in 1992. This autobiographical work explored the life of a football fan, capturing the emotions and passion that the sport can generate in its supporters. Its success and popularity contributed to a shift in public attitudes towards the sport and its social value. Additionally, the world of film played an influential role in reviving football in Britain. Movies such as \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\" (2002) and \\"The Damned United\\" (2009) portrayed various aspects of the sport and culture which help break down gender and class barriers. They showcased the tremendous impact football can have both on individual lives and larger communities, emphasizing its significance in British society. Moreover, the inauguration of the English Premier League in 1992 marked a turning point in the commercialization and globalization of football in Britain. The new league structure, lucrative broadcast deals, and influx of foreign talent contributed to the sport's growing popularity and appeal across various demographics. In conclusion, the statement does contain the correct answer to the question. Film and literature played a significant role in reviving football in Britain during the 1990s. The period was marked by changes in public perceptions and the sport's socio-economic status, attributable in part to the impact of these cultural mediums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Robert Stewart, 2nd Marquess of Londonderry,  (18 June 1769 - 12 August 1822), usually known as Lord Castlereagh, which is derived from his courtesy title Viscount Castlereagh, (UK:  KAH-s@l-rey), was an Irish/British statesman. As British Foreign Secretary, from 1812 he was central to the management of the coalition that defeated Napoleon and was the principal British diplomat at the Congress of Vienna. Castlereagh was also leader of the British House of Commons in the Liverpool government from 1812 until his suicide in August 1822. Early in his career, as Chief Secretary for Ireland, he was involved in putting down the Irish Rebellion of 1798 and was instrumental in securing the passage of the Irish Act of Union of 1800. Stewart had recurring health problems throughout his childhood, and his family elected to send him to The Royal School, Armagh, rather than to England for his secondary education. At the encouragement of Charles Pratt, first Earl of Camden, who took a great interest in him and treated him as a grandson by blood, he later attended St. John's College, Cambridge (1786-87), where he applied himself with greater diligence than expected from an aristocrat and obtained first class in his last examinations. He left Cambridge due to an extended illness, and after returning to Ireland did not pursue further formal education.  In 1790, Stewart was elected as a Member of the Irish Parliament for Down in one of the most expensive elections in Irish history. Though for a time he was associated with the Northern Whig Club, he entered the Irish House of Commons as an Independent. He ran on a platform supporting Whig principles of electoral reform and opposing the Irish policies of the British Government. But even from the outset of his career, he was a personal supporter of the Prime Minister, William Pitt. Stewart was a lifelong advocate of Catholic concessions, though his position on the specific issue of Catholic Emancipation varied depending on his assessment of the potential repercussions on other policy priorities.  When war with France forced British Government attention on Ireland as a possible place of French invasion, the Irish Volunteers, seen as a potential source of disaffection, were disbanded by Dublin Castle, and a reorganised Militia was created in 1793. Stewart enrolled as an officer, a matter of course for a young Protestant aristocrat, and served as Lieutenant Colonel under the command of his wife's uncle, Thomas Conolly. Between Stewart's attendance to his militia duties, his pursuit of cultural, family and political interests in London, two trips to the Continent (in 1791, when he visited revolutionary Paris, and 1792), and the courtship of his wife whom he married in 1794, his life during this period was not centred on the activities of the Irish House of Commons, where he was listened to with respect but where he was not yet an important player. He was also beginning to disappoint some of his more radical original supporters in his constituency. As the French Revolution grew more bloody and Ireland more rebellious, Stewart increasingly worried about Ireland's future if the threats from France succeeded in breaking Ireland's links to Britain. He became further inclined to support not only Pitt personally but the British Government, even when he did not approve of a specific line taken in Irish policy.  In 1794, partly as a result of the promotion of Stewart's interests by his Camden connections, he was offered the Government-controlled seat of Tregony in Cornwall, where he was elected to the British House of Commons on a similar platform of reform principles and support for Pitt, on whose side he sat in Westminster. In 1796, he transferred to a seat for the Suffolk constituency of Orford, which was in the interest of his mother's family, the Seymour-Conways (Marquess of Hertford). What did he do after returning to Ireland?","output":"After returning to Ireland, Lord Castlereagh did not pursue further formal education.

To determine how many 60-minute periods there are within a day, we need to know how many minutes are in a day. There are 24 hours in a day, and each hour consists of 60 minutes.  To calculate the number of 60-minute periods in a day, we can simply multiply the number of hours in a day (24) by the number of minutes in an hour (60): 24 hours/day * 60 minutes/hour = 1440 minutes/day Now, to find the number of 60-minute periods, also known as \\"hourly slots\\" or simply \\"hours\\" within a day, we can then divide the total number of minutes in a day (1440) by the number of minutes in each period (60): 1440 minutes/day ÷ 60 minutes/period = 24 periods/day Thus, there are 24 60-minute periods each day during which mass transit in New York City is open and operational. The city's extensive mass transit system serves its large and diverse population, playing a critical role in daily commutes for work, school, and various other activities. The New York City mass transit system includes subways, buses, regional railways, and ferries, working together to support the transportation needs of the nation's largest metropolitan area."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With the demand for medications continually increasing, the production and distribution of essential drugs have been insufficient to meet the needs of patients globally. In an unprecedented and critical move, former President Barack Obama is reported to have ordered the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to take necessary measures to address and alleviate the situation. The Scope and Impact of Drug Shortages The drug shortages have had wide-ranging effects across the nation, impacting numerous health care facilities, patients, medical professionals, and insurance providers. Evidence indicates that the problem affects drugs intended for various health issues, including cancer treatment, cardiac care, infectious diseases, neurological disorders, and anesthesia. This shortage has substantially restricted the availability of life-saving medications in hospitals and outpatient departments. Consequently, medical practitioners have been compelled to rely on alternative treatments that may not be as effective or face increased costs for acquiring the needed drugs from alternative sources. The Detrimental Effects on Patients and Providers The consequences of drug shortages have been particularly harmful for patients requiring immediate or specialized care. In certain cases, individuals have been forced to wait for long periods to receive vital medications or have their treatment plans altered due to the scarcity of necessary drugs. Furthermore, the increased pressure on healthcare providers to find alternative treatments and medication sources comes at a significant financial burden, which inevitably affects the institutions and individuals they serve. Obama's Call to FDA: Strategies to Address Drug Shortages Understanding the urgency of the situation, Obama ordered the FDA to implement crucial measures to stem the shortages and ensure appropriate medication availability across the nation. Among the key recommendations are: 1. Streamlining review processes: In an effort to enhance efficiency, the FDA will be asked to simplify and speed up its review and approval processes for new drug applications. This will facilitate the introduction of potential alternatives for medications in short supply, fostering competition amongst drug manufacturers and reducing the likelihood of unexpected shortages. 2. Strengthening pharmaceutical manufacturing: In response to the acknowledgment that manufacturing issues contribute to drug shortages, Obama's directive also calls for the FDA to support the improvement of production techniques and infrastructure within the pharmaceutical industry. This will serve not only to alleviate current shortages but also to prevent future issues from arising. 3. Enhancing communication and collaboration: To ensure better management of drug supply, the FDA will be required to work closely with the drug manufacturers, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders. Fostering open communication channels will improve the industry's ability to anticipate and address potential shortages proactively. 4. Increasing transparency: Another key aspect of Obama's call to action involves the promotion of greater transparency among drug manufacturers. This includes mandatory notifications to the FDA by companies if they foresee shortages, allowing the FDA to act preemptively and source alternative medications for patients. 5. Encouraging drug stockpiling: Lastly, the FDA will investigate the feasibility of encouraging stockpiling of essential medications. This could mitigate the effects of unexpected manufacturing issues or increased demand, ensuring a more stable supply of necessary drugs. Conclusion President Obama's directive exemplifies his commitment to the health and well-being of citizens across the nation. By ordering the FDA to take proactive measures to address the drug shortage crisis, his administration took a decisive approach in ensuring the continuity and quality of care for every individual. Although long-term solutions to drug shortages may be challenging to establish, Obama's vital intervention demonstrates the importance of addressing this issue and serves as a crucial foundation for future improvements in the pharmaceutical industry."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  The latitude calculated on 9 May, 84°3′N, was disappointing—Nansen had hoped they were farther south.  However, as May progressed they began to see bear tracks, and by the end of the month seals, gulls and whales were plentiful. By Nansen's calculations, they had reached 82°21′N on 31 May, placing them only 50 nautical miles (93 km; 58 mi) from Cape Fligely at the northern extremity of Franz Josef Land, if his longitude estimate was accurate. In the warmer weather the ice began to break up, making travel more difficult. Since 24 April dogs had been killed at regular intervals to feed the others, and by the beginning of June only seven of the original 28 remained.  On 21 June the pair jettisoned all surplus equipment and supplies, planning to travel light and live off the now plentiful supplies of seal and birds. After a day's travel in this manner they decided to rest on a floe, waterproof the kayaks and build up their own strength for the next stage of their journey. They remained camped on the floe for a whole month.On 23 July, the day after leaving the camp, Nansen had the first indisputable glimpse of land. He wrote: \\"At last the marvel has come to pass—land, land, and after we had almost given up our belief in it!\\" In the succeeding days the pair struggled towards this land, which seemingly grew no nearer, although by the end of July they could hear the distant sound of breaking surf. On 4 August they survived a polar bear attack; two days later they reached the edge of the ice, and only water lay between them and the land. On 6 August they shot the last two Samoyed dogs, converted the kayaks into a catamaran by lashing sledges and skis across them, and raised a sail.Nansen called this first land \\"Hvidtenland\\" (\\"White Island\\").

By Alex Greig PUBLISHED: 19:25 EST, 10 March 2014 | UPDATED: 22:49 EST, 10 March 2014 A Virginia family is campaigning to encourage a drug company to allow their sick little boy who is fighting for his life access to life-saving medicine. Josh Hardy, a seven-year-old cancer survivor, needs a drug called Brincidofovir, made by small North Carolina drug company Chimerex, to fight off a viral infection he developed after a recent bone marrow transplant. The drug has not been approved by the FDA, but it has been administered to hundreds of other patients under 'compassionate use' allowances.","output":"The Hardy family has been working tirelessly to petition the Chimerex pharmaceutical company and the FDA for their son's access to Brincidofovir, an experimental antiviral medication that doctors believe could save Josh Hardy's life. Despite their efforts, Chimerex initially denied the family's request, citing the need to focus on the drug's ongoing clinical trials and the potential risk of diverting resources away from the greater good. This decision led to a massive public outcry, as social media campaigns and petitions drew attention to the desperate situation facing Josh Hardy and his family. In response to the mounting public pressure, Chimerex reconsidered its position and ultimately agreed to allow Josh Hardy to participate in an expanded \\"compassionate use\\" program. This program would not only provide Josh with access to Brincidofovir, but it would also be expanded to include other critically ill patients who meet specific eligibility criteria. With this new agreement in place, Chimerex would be able to continue their clinical trials while also addressing the needs of those in immediate need of treatment. Josh Hardy began receiving the experimental treatment shortly afterward, facing a long and uncertain road to recovery. Under the watchful eyes of his medical team and the support of his family, friends, and an ever-growing community of supporters, Josh began to show signs of improvement. The viral infection that was attacking his body started to recede, and his doctors became increasingly optimistic about his prognosis. Over the subsequent months, Josh's recovery continued, and his story became a testament to the power of perseverance, public advocacy, and the potential benefits of compassionate use programs. The Chimerex pharmaceutical company, for its part, pledged to work closely with the FDA and other regulatory bodies to advance the clinical research and approval process for Brincidofovir, with a particular emphasis on ensuring broader access to the drug for patients in need. As Brincidofovir moves through the later stages of clinical trials and the FDA approval process, Josh Hardy's story serves as a powerful reminder that behind every experimental drug, there is a human face and a personal story. His fight for access to this life-saving medication highlights the critical importance of striking a balance between the urgency of individual patient needs and the careful, methodical process of drug development and approval. In doing so, the story sparked a broader public conversation and debate over the ethics and efficacy of the current compassionate use guidelines and the potential for reform in this crucial area of the healthcare system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jesse thought twice about their decision, which demonstrates their determination to analyze a situation diligently and thoroughly. They took into consideration all the relevant facts, indicating their commitment to making well-informed choices and weighing the consequences of their actions. A good planner is someone who meticulously assesses their options, contemplates various possible outcomes, and strategizes for potential difficulties that they may encounter. Jesse's approach to decision-making encompasses these qualities, as they sought to avoid making rash judgments without evaluating the entirety of the situation. It is important to acknowledge that even though Jesse is a good planner, they may still face unforeseen challenges or obstacles in their endeavors. The fact that they think carefully about their choices, however, is likely to leave them better-equipped to handle such situations. This proactive approach to problem-solving and commitment to understanding the potential implications of their decisions is an indication of a strong planner. In contrast, thoughtless and stupid individuals often make decisions impulsively, without taking the time to reflect on potential consequences or explore alternative options. They are not likely to consider relevant facts or weigh the pros and cons of their actions. It may lead them to poor decision-making, which can have negative repercussions on their personal or professional lives. A bad planner might have some semblance of a plan but could lack the foresight and attention to detail required to execute it effectively. They may neglect crucial aspects of a task or struggle to adapt when faced with unexpected challenges. Their lack of planning may also hinder their ability to achieve long-term goals. Through a careful examination of Jesse's approach to decision-making, it is clear that they do not exhibit the characteristics typically associated with being thoughtless and stupid or a bad planner. By considering all of the facts and taking the time to reflect on their choices, Jesse displays the hallmarks of a good planner who is dedicated to making informed decisions that align with their interests and goals."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The total number of deaths following British settlement in 1788 has long been debated, but many historians estimate it numbered tens of thousands. Researchers hope the map will help with education and creating monuments. The project includes details about the number of people killed at each site, which weapons were used, and who was responsible. The information was compiled over four years and corroborated through sources including settler diaries, newspaper reports, court records and letters. \\"For many Australians, this kind of information will come as a shock,\\" project author Prof Lyndall Ryan told the BBC. \\"Our ancestors were out there engaging in some pretty violent forms of behaviour.\\" More than 150 massacres affecting almost every Aboriginal clan took place between 1788 and 1872, compared with six recorded massacres of colonists during the same period. A massacre was defined as the indiscriminate killing of six or more undefended people, the study said. Prof Ryan said several violent events claimed more than 60 lives, while about 150 people were killed in one incident in Victoria's Gippsland region. Prof Ryan, a historian at Australia's University of Newcastle, said the team will document the country's west over the next two years.

These three points suggest that the product's functionality or features failed to meet the user's expectations or requirements, leading to a negative experience. Thus, if we were to rate the user's experience based on the issues reflected in the review, we might give it a score of 1, reflecting a least favorable experience. On the other hand, if we are evaluating the quality of the review itself, a few factors might need to be considered. In terms of clarity, the review is straightforward and quickly gets to the point. However, it lacks some crucial details that could have made it more helpful to both the product developers as well as potential buyers. For instance, the user has not mentioned which product they are referring to, the context of their usage, nor did they provide any specific scenarios about when or how the problems occurred. The absence of these kinds of details makes it less actionable for the developers to improve the product and less effective as a guide for potential customers trying to make a purchasing decision. Consequently, in terms of its usefulness as a review, it might be rated 2, indicating room for significant improvement. Overall, while the rating largely depends on the aspects you prioritize, it probably would lie between 1 and 2 based on the parameters discussed above."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: First impressions are usually formed within 30 seconds. The first thing an employer will notice is your physical appearance. Pick a wardrobe that communicates effort and professionalism.  Research the company's dress code going into the interview. If you know anyone from the company, ask them what's appropriate. You can also call the company's Human Resource Department and ask what is recommended in terms of attire. If you're interviewing for a professional, managerial, or executive position you should always wear a suit. Have a few interview suits, preferably tailored to your body, on hand to choose from.  If the attire is business casual, or if you're applying for a lower ranking position, a nice blouse with dress pants or a skirt is a good choice for women. Men can wear dress pants and a button down shirt and tie.  If this is for a factory, construction, or other such job where you will get dirty, wear sensible attire to the interview, this includes steel-toed safety shoes and if it's a construction site, you'll need to wear a hard hat (not a bump hat) to get from the gate to the office. Do not forget footwear. Oftentimes, an outfit is great but shoes are tattered or worn. Invest in comfortable, work-appropriate shoes. Do not fret if you have to pay a little more. Remember, you will use these shoes often when you land a job.  Avoid perfumes and other fragrances, which can appear tacky and put off interviewers. While accessories, like a nice belt or tasteful jewelry, can be a nice touch avoid anything overly flashy or distracting.  If you wear make-up, stick to neutral shades of lipstick, eye-liner, and eye shadow. Your make-up should ideally enhance your existing facial features without overwhelming them. Never go into an interview without prior knowledge of the company. This conveys a lack of interest and respect on your part. Conduct thorough research in the days leading up to an interview.  Know what skills the company values. Look at the career page on their website and pay close attention to the desired qualifications listed on their job postings. This gives you the opportunity to learn more about a given company and discover what aspects of your skill set and career history to emphasize.  Read up on the latest news involving the company. Oftentimes, company websites have a section dedicated to press releases and news coverage. You can also search for the company's name in Google News.  Research the company's mission and values. You'll want to make sure you come off as a good fit for the company's culture. There should be a section on the company's website with a mission statement. You can also follow the company on social media to get a sense of their ethos.  Find out who your interviewer will be. Oftentimes, this is disclosed in the email asking you to come in for an interview. If not, you can politely request their name. Research the interviewer on LinkedIn and Twitter. This increases your chance of connecting and, in turn, landing the job. Concrete is better than abstract when it comes to wowing an interviewer. You should have a few solid anecdotes prepared that speak to your experience.  People tend to remember stories easier than direct information. Therefore, telling a story rather than simply conveying your experience means you'll stand out in an interviewer's mind.  Ask yourself, what are the skill sets this company is looking for? Write down a list of skills and, from there, try to come up with stories from past jobs, volunteer experiences, and internships that illustrate your proficiency with said skills. Have 2 to 3 anecdotes to choose from going in. Rehearse. Recite the stories to yourself to make sure you include all necessary information and don't slip up or stutter during the interview. You can always record yourself speaking and play back the recording to see where you need to improve. It's not uncommon for employers to scan the Twitter and Facebook accounts of potential employees. Make sure your social media presence is clean before going into an interview.  Curse words do not reflect well on you as a potential employee. Make sure any obscenity is removed. A negative attitude can be a deterrent to employment and people often take to Twitter and Facebook to complain. Delete tweets or statues that air grievances about friends, family members, or businesses. If you want to err on the side of caution, you can temporarily deactivate your Facebook or Twitter profile the week before your interview. You can also change privacy settings so only certain posts are visible to the public.","output":"First impressions in an interview are critical and are usually formed within 30 seconds. To make a good impression, dress professionally and in line with the company's dress code. Be well-groomed and avoid strong fragrances, flashy accessories, or overwhelming makeup. Research the company thoroughly before the interview, including its values, recent news, and desired skills. Prepare 2-3 anecdotes that demonstrate your relevant skills and practice telling these stories. Find out who your interviewer will be and research them on social media platforms like LinkedIn and Twitter to increase your chances of connecting during the interview. Finally, ensure your own social media presence is clean and professional, removing any obscenities or complaints, and adjusting your privacy settings if necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: The Acta Palaeontologica Polonica (abbreviated Acta Palaeontol. Pol.), has the ISSN number \\"1732-2421\\". What data can be extracted from this sentence?","output":"Numerous pieces of data can be extracted from the given sentence, demonstrating how rich even a solitary sentence can be in terms of information density. The data extracted falls into several categories, including details about journal identity, content focus, bibliographic referencing, and publication identification. 1. Publication Identification: The primary piece of data mentioned is the designation of the International Standard Serial Number (ISSN 1732-2421). The ISSN functions as an identifier for serial publications, similar to the role ISBNs play for individual books. It is unique to a particular serial, allowing for efficient cataloguing and retrieval in libraries and databases throughout the world. This number indicates that the Acta Palaeontologica Polonica is recorded in the global ISSN database, facilitating rapid identification and management. 2. Journal Identity: The name of the journal, \\"Acta Palaeontologica Polonica\\", is a central piece of data in the sentence. This tells us the name of the publication, crucial information for any further reference or study. It suggests that the journal is likely linked with Poland given the \\"Polonica\\" inclusion, indicating the origin or linguistic focus of the journal. 3. Abbreviation: The sentence provides the abbreviated title of the journal (\\"Acta Palaeontol. Pol.\\"), which can be used in bibliographic references where space is limited or to ensure quick recognition by readers familiar with the abbreviation.  4. Content Focus: The name of the journal suggests that its content primarily revolves around the science of Paleontology. The term \\"palaeontologica\\" points to this scientific discipline, indicating an academic focus on the history of life on Earth through the study of plant and animal fossils. 5. Language: Although the sentence does not directly provide this piece of data, we can infer that the language of the journal might be English because of the nomenclature and format used. Abbreviating the journal's title is a common practice in English academic publishing, and there is no direct reference to another language in the sentence. However, the word \\"Polonica\\" may suggest a link to Polish language or content, but this assumption requires further verification.  In sum, the sentence may appear simple at first glance but reveals considerable information about the publication identity, regional origin, subject focus, abbreviated titling, and potentially the language of a widely recognised paleontological journal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - The Andes or Andean Mountains are the longest continental mountain range in the world. They are a continuous range of highlands along the western edge of South America. This range is about long, about wide (widest between 18° south and 20° south latitude), and of an average height of about . The Andes extend from north to south through seven South American countries: Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Chile.  - Metrosideros is a genus of approximately 60 trees, shrubs, and vines mostly found in the Pacific region in the Myrtaceae family. Most of the tree forms are small, but some are exceptionally large, the New Zealand species in particular. The name derives from the Ancient Greek \\"metra\\" or \\"heartwood\\" and \\"sideron\\" or \\"iron\\". Perhaps the best-known species are the phutukawa (\\"M. excelsa\\"), northern rt (\\"M. robusta\\"), and southern rt (\\"M. umbellata\\") of New Zealand, and \\"hia lehua\\", (\\"M. polymorpha\\"), from the Hawaiian Islands.  - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water.  - Oceania (or ), also known as Oceanica, is a region centred on the islands of the tropical Pacific Ocean. Opinions of what constitutes Oceania range from its three subregions of Melanesia, Micronesia, and Polynesia to, more broadly, the entire insular region between Southeast Asia and the Americas, including Australasia and the Malay Archipelago.  - Myrtaceae is the myrtle family, a family of dicotyledonous plants placed within the order Myrtales. Myrtle, pohutukawa, the bay rum tree, clove, guava, acca (feijoa), allspice, and eucalyptus all are members of this group. All species are woody, with essential oils, and flower parts in multiples of four or five. One notable character of the family is that the phloem is located on both sides of the xylem, not just outside as in most other plants. The leaves are evergreen, alternate to mostly opposite, simple, and usually with an entire (not toothed) margin. The flowers have a base number of five petals, though in several genera the petals are minute or absent. The stamens are usually very conspicuous, brightly coloured and numerous.  - Bolivia (; ), officially known as the Plurinational State of Bolivia, is a landlocked country located in western-central South America. It is bordered to the north and east by Brazil, to the southeast by Paraguay, to the south by Argentina, to the southwest by Chile, and to the northwest by Peru. One-third of the country is the Andean mountain range, with one of its largest cities and principal economic centers, El Alto, located on the Altiplano. Bolivia is one of two landlocked countries (the other is Paraguay) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Bolivia is the largest landlocked country in the Americas.  - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Buenos Aires is the capital and most populous city of Argentina. The city is located on the western shore of the estuary of the Río de la Plata, on the South American continent's southeastern coast. \\"Buenos aires\\" can be translated as \\"fair winds\\" or \\"good airs\\", but the first one was the meaning intended by the founders in the 16th century, by the use of the original name \\"Real de Nuestra Señora Santa María del Buen Ayre\\". The Greater Buenos Aires conurbation, which also includes several Buenos Aires Province districts, constitutes the fourth-most populous metropolitan area in the Americas, with a population of around 17 million.  - A vine (Latin \\"vnea\\" \\"grapevine\\", \\"vineyard\\", from \\"vnum\\" \\"wine\\") in the narrowest sense is the grapevine (\\"Vitis\\"), but more generally it can refer to any plant with a growth habit of trailing or (that is, climbing) stems or runners. The word also can refer to such stems or runners themselves, for instance when used in wicker work.  - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection.  - Uruguay, officially the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, is a country in the southeastern region of South America. It borders Argentina to its west and Brazil to its north and east, with the Río de la Plata (River of Silver) to the south and with the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast. Uruguay is home to an estimated 3.42 million people, of whom 1.8 million live in the metropolitan area of its capital and largest city, Montevideo. With an area of approximately , Uruguay is geographically the second-smallest nation in South America, only larger in size than Suriname.  - A shrub or bush is a small to medium-sized woody plant. It is distinguished from a tree by its multiple stems and shorter height, usually under 6 m (20 ft) tall. Plants of many species may grow either into shrubs or trees, depending on their growing conditions. Small, low shrubs, generally less than 2 m (6.6 ft) tall, such as lavender, periwinkle and most small garden varieties of roses, are often termed subshrubs.  - Easter Island is a Chilean island in the southeastern Pacific Ocean, at the southeasternmost point of the Polynesian Triangle. Easter Island is famous for its 887 extant monumental statues, called \\"moai\\", created by the early Rapa Nui people. In 1995, UNESCO named Easter Island a World Heritage Site, with much of the island protected within Rapa Nui National Park.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Paraguay, officially the Republic of Paraguay, is a landlocked country in central South America, bordered by Argentina to the south and southwest, Brazil to the east and northeast, and Bolivia to the northwest. Paraguay lies on both banks of the Paraguay River, which runs through the center of the country from north to south. Due to its central location in South America, it is sometimes referred to as \\"Corazón de Sudamérica\\" (\\"Heart of South America\\"). Paraguay is one of the two landlocked countries (the other is Bolivia) that lie outside Afro-Eurasia. Paraguay is the smallest landlocked country in the Americas.  - In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, bananas and bamboos are also trees. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand years old. The tallest known tree, a coast redwood named Hyperion, stands high. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3 trillion mature trees in the world.  - Metrosideros stipularis is a species of the myrtle family commonly known as tepú , trepú , or tepual . It is an evergreen tree or shrub that can attain a height of about seven metres . The plant is native to southern South America in the southern portions of Chile and Argentina and is a typical resident of very wet areas , especially peat bogs . Tepú has white flowers that emerge during the austral summer from January through March . The tree 's wood is used within its range as a firewood due to it high energy content . This species has often been placed in its own genus Tepualia , but recent works include it in Metrosideros \`\` WCSP '' . World Checklist of Selected Plant Families . .  - Chile, officially the Republic of Chile, is a South American country occupying a long, narrow strip of land between the Andes to the east and the Pacific Ocean to the west. It borders Peru to the north, Bolivia to the northeast, Argentina to the east, and the Drake Passage in the far south. Chilean territory includes the Pacific islands of Juan Fernández, Salas y Gómez, Desventuradas, and Easter Island in Oceania. Chile also claims about of Antarctica, although all claims are suspended under the Antarctic Treaty.  - Argentina, officially the Argentine Republic, is a federal republic in the southern half of South America. Sharing the bulk of the Southern Cone with its neighbor Chile to the west, the country is also bordered by Bolivia and Paraguay to the north, Brazil to the northeast, Uruguay and the South Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Drake Passage to the south. With a mainland area of , Argentina is the eighth-largest country in the world, the second largest in Latin America, and the largest Spanish-speaking one. The country is subdivided into twenty-three provinces (singular \\"provincia\\") and one autonomous city (\\"ciudad autónoma\\"), Buenos Aires, which is the federal capital of the nation as decided by Congress.

Article: Image copyright iStock Image caption The gorillas are given diluted squash every day - though are unlikely to use straws      It has emerged that Kumbuka, the gorilla that escaped from its enclosure at London Zoo, drank five litres (nine pints) of undiluted blackcurrant squash before being tranquillised. What impact would this have had on his health, asks Harry Low.      The western lowland silverback left his den through an unlocked door and entered the zookeepers' enclosure, where he seized his chance to drink something sweet - lots of it.      He would have been more familiar with the diluted version of the drink, which forms part of the gorillas' daily diet, according to a spokeswoman for the zoo, along with cold fruit tea and leafy greens such as cabbage and kale. They are also fed other fresh vegetables including broccoli, carrots and cucumber.      Gorillas have quite large stomachs so this epic helping of concentrated squash could have caused severe stomach pains and diarrhoea, according to Prof Phyllis Lee, a primatologist at the University of Stirling.      \\"Five litres is quite a lot for a gorilla to consume in one go but given a gorilla's manual dexterity, I would assume that some would have been spilled,\\" she says.      \\"He must have found it and taken his opportunity, similar to how a four-year-old child would.\\"      Lee added that she would expect the squash to affect the consistency of Kumbuka's poo rather than its colour - even in the case of blackcurrant - though she added that she had not studied the matter closely.      Image copyright PA Image caption Kumbuka succeeded in opening the bottle but may have spilled some of its contents      But what about the effect of the sugar? Might this have caused a surge of physical activity once the effect of the tranquilliser had worn off? Apparently not in this case.      \\"Within two hours Kumbuka was back with his family, snacking on treats, and probably wondering what all the fuss was about,\\" according to Prof David Field, who carried out a report into last week's incident.      Had a human drunk five litres of undiluted squash, the results would have been similar, but possibly more extreme.      It would be almost impossible for a human to take that much squash on, according to dietitian Dr Sarah Schenker.      \\"I would imagine it would lead to a very upset tummy and disrupt the digestive tract,\\" she says.      Diarrhoea and sickness would be the main symptoms, she suggests, though they would not last too long.      \\"It wouldn't cause lasting damage - maybe you'd feel the effects for a day.\\"      According to Phyllis Lee, Kumbuka's size - he weighs 29 stone (184kg) - would have helped him cope with his squash-drinking binge.      There would have been no danger of overdosing on vitamin C, she says, and no damage to the teeth from just one episode of this kind.      \\"That would only be caused by continually consuming sugary drinks.\\"      Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Professor David Field, the zoological director at Londonzoo explained to BBC Radio 4's PM programme what Kumbuka did with his freedom.

As the first part of our investigation concludes, I’m keen to use this opportunity to clarify some things.      The results of this initial investigation have established that the gorilla dens are sound and fit for purpose. For a Zoological Director running a zoo responsible for thousands of animals and hundreds of staff, this kind of reassurance matters.      I can certainly tell you that there were no broken locks, Kumbuka did not smash any windows, he was never ‘on the loose’, and his normal gorilla posturing reported by visitors earlier in the day was unrelated to the incident.      What I will tell you is what happened, according to those who were actually there.      Kumbuka was called into his private night quarters for his dinner at around 5.10pm on Thursday 13th October. As a big silverback male with a matching appetite, he eats separately from the females - otherwise they wouldn’t get a look in.      Unfortunately the door to his den had not been properly secured and a secondary security door had not yet been locked.      We’ve since established that Kumbuka made an opportunistic escape from his unlocked den into the staff-only service corridor where a zookeeper was working.      Thanks to the incredibly close bond and relationship shared by the zookeeper and Kumbuka, the zookeeper was able to continually reassure Kumbuka, talking to him calmly and in the same light-hearted tone he would always use, as he removed himself from the area.      Staff raised the alarm that triggered our standard escape response, while Kumbuka briefly explored the zookeeper area next door to his den, where he opened and drank five litres of undiluted blackcurrant squash.      Kumbuka was immediately contained in the non-public area by quick-thinking zookeepers responding to the alarm, where he was tranquilised and moved back into his den.      Video of Gorillas enjoy foraging for Autumn treats      Any breach of our security protocols is incredibly serious, but the incident itself was less dramatic than some would have you believe. Within two hours Kumbuka was back with his family, snacking on treats, and probably wondering what all the fuss was about.      The professional responses of our zookeepers, our security teams and the emergency services was exemplary and thanks to the zookeepers’ strong relationship with Kumbuka they were able to reassure him during the incident.      Now that the initial facts have been established, it’s our job to understand any contributing factors that allowed an experienced and highly trained zookeeper to make a mistake with the doors.      I myself started life as a volunteer zookeeper in 1980, caring for gorillas and chimpanzees.      Those of us who have had the privilege of caring for great apes become quickly aware of their individual characters and tailor our care to account for each of their personality traits. Kumbuka is the alpha male in our gorilla troop at ZSL London Zoo, an impressive male in both stature and character.      Kumbuka has fathered two infants and is a patient and protective father, who displays typical silverback behaviour, such as beating his chest and posturing. Gorilla Kingdom is his home and territory and as his family grows, so will Kumbuka’s naturally protective instincts.      I have the utmost respect for Kumbuka and the gorilla troop – a respect that I know is shared by all of my zookeeper colleagues, who also recognise the important responsibility they have in caring for them.      The magnitude of personal responsibility that zookeepers feel for the animals in their care, the colleagues they work with every day and the thousands of visitors to their zoo is indescribable.      It is this sense of responsibility that provides some of our strongest security measures. We know that humans sometimes make mistakes, but these are rare. We also know that automating every security system poses a greater risk of mechanical failure, and could lead to an over-reliance on technology that will create the kind of complacency that has no place here.      We will continue to work with our keeping teams to identify any adjustments or modifications that can help avoid any repeat mistake in future, but ultimately our trust in our people is not shaken.      Today, Kumbuka and his family are happily playing, eating and sleeping in Gorilla Kingdom. Gorillas invoke the most remarkable feelings of wonder from anyone who sees them and our visitors can continue to be assured that these animals are safe, secure and in the care of a team of dedicated zookeepers. ||||| Fruit-flavoured squash before and after being mixed with water      Squash (also known as cordial), in British English, is a non-alcoholic concentrated syrup used in beverage making. It is usually fruit-flavoured, made from fruit juice, water, and sugar or a sugar substitute. Modern squashes may also contain food colouring and additional flavouring. Some traditional squashes contain herbal extracts, most notably elderflower and ginger.      Drinks [ edit ]      Squash is mixed with a certain amount of water or carbonated water before drinking. The amount of water added is to taste, with the squash becoming less strong the more it is diluted. As a drink mixer, it may be combined with an alcoholic beverage to prepare a cocktail.      Citrus fruits (particularly orange, lime and lemon) or a blend of fruits and berries are commonly used as the base of squash.[1]      Traditional squashes are usually flavoured with ginger, chokeberries (often with spices added), elderflower, and sometimes orange or lemon.[citation needed]      Preparation [ edit ]      Squash is prepared by combining one part concentrate with four or five parts water (carbonated or still). Double-strength squash and traditional cordials, which are thicker, are made with two parts concentrate. Some squash concentrates are quite weak, and these are sometimes mixed with one part concentrate and two or three parts water.      Storage [ edit ]      Most cordials and squashes contain preservatives such as potassium sorbate or (in traditional cordials) sulphites, as they are designed to be stored on shelves. They keep well because of the preservatives and their high sugar content. Nonetheless, some choose to store their squash in refrigerators.      Ingredients [ edit ]      Ingredients in squashes and cordials have evolved over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as citric acid or in very old-fashioned cordials lemon juice, or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a preservative especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh for quite a long time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5-10 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as Allura Red AC and Sunset Yellow FCF are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.      Flavourings [ edit ]      Traditional squashes may be flavoured with elderflowers, lemon, pomegranate, apple, strawberry, chokeberry (often with spices such as cinnamon or cloves added), orange, pear, or raspberry.      Modern squashes usually have simpler flavours, such as orange, apple, summer fruit (mixed berries), blackcurrant, apple and blackcurrant, peach, pineapple, mango, lime, or lemon.      Terminology [ edit ]      \\"Cordial\\", \\"diluted juice\\", and \\"squash\\" are similar products, although the products known as cordials tend to be thicker and stronger, requiring less syrup and more water to be blended.[citation needed] In British English, \\"cordial\\" refers to a sweet fruit-flavoured drink (as different from a syrup).[2] \\"High juice\\" is not a brand of squash but rather a type that contains a larger amount of juice, around 45%.      Squash is often colloquially known as \\"juice\\". However this term is a misnomer; no squash is pure juice. Squashes are commonly called according to the fruit from which they are made. More rarely, they may be called \\"fruit drink\\", especially if they are ready-diluted in a plastic bottle or paper carton (e.g., Fruit Shoot). Some small areas in the North East refer to squash as \\"dilutey juice\\".      Fruit juice content [ edit ]      Squashes are measured by their juice content, the average being 30%. A variety of squash that contains a larger amount of fruit juice, up to half or more of the volume in juice, is sold in markets as \\"high juice\\", and squashes are quite often called \\"juice\\" when talking to children, especially these high-juice beverages, although this may be confusing. However, many squashes contain less than 20% juice, and some as little as 5-10%. The latter are typically low in nutritional value, and the high juice versions are reasonably higher in nutrients, although one downside is that it is high in sugar and does not contain fibre or minor nutrients. That goes with almost all squashes. A low juice squash may state \\"with real fruit juice\\" on the label.      Low-sugar squashes [ edit ]      Squashes labelled \\"no added sugar\\" are artificially sweetened, usually with aspartame, acesulfame K, saccharin or sucralose, which is much cheaper for the manufacturers than both HFCS and natural sugar. They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They tend to be very low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings (isoamyl acetate for pear or banana, or mixed with malic acid to make an apple-like flavour, ethyl methylphenylglycidate for strawberry, octyl acetate for orange, allyl hexanoate for pineapple etc.) to make up for the lack of fruit juice taste.      World markets [ edit ]      Assorted bottles of squash at a grocery store in Argentina      Britvic (under the Robinsons, MiWadi and Teisseire brands), Hamdard (under the Rooh Afza brand in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), Nichols (under the Vimto brand), Suntory (under the Ribena brand) and Coca-Cola (under the Kia-Ora brand). Australian brands include Cottee's, Bickford's, P&N Beverages and Golden Circle cordials. Indian brands include Kissan and Rasna. In Israel, fruit squashes are produced by such companies as Prigat.      Animal consumption [ edit ]      The gorillas at London Zoo are given both squash and cold fruit tea to drink. When a silverback called Kumbuka escaped from his enclosure in 2016, he drank five litres (8.8 imperial pints) of undiluted blackcurrant squash that was in the keepers' area.[3]      See also [ edit ] |||||Summary:","output":"When Kumbuka, a gorilla, escaped from his enclosure at the London Zoo, he drank five litres of undiluted blackcurrant squash before he was tranquillised. According to a spokeswoman, the gorillas at the zoo are given diluted squash every day as part of their daily diet, along with cold fruit tea and leafy greens such as cabbage and kale, and other fresh vegetables, such as broccoli, carrots and cucumber. Professor Phyllis Lee, a primatologist, explains that the large amount of concentrated squash could have caused Kumbuka severe stomach pains and diarrhoea. However, she adds that it would not have had any long-lasting effects on his teeth, as that would only be caused by continually consuming sugary beverages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Summi Pontificatus is an encyclical of Pope Pius XII published on 20 October 1939. The encyclical is subtitled \\"On the Unity of Human Society.\\" It was the first encyclical of Pius XII and was seen as setting \\"a tone\\" for his papacy. It critiques major errors at the time, such as ideologies of racism, cultural superiority and the totalitarian state. It also sets the theological framework for future encyclical letters, such as \\"Mystici corporis Christi\\" (1943). The encyclical laments the destruction of Poland, denounces the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, and calls for a restoration of independent Poland.  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Pope Saint Pius X, born Giuseppe Melchiorre Sarto, (2 June 1835  20 August 1914) was Pope from August 1903 to his death in 1914. He was canonized in 1954. Pius X is known for vigorously opposing modernist interpretations of Catholic doctrine, promoting traditional devotional practices and orthodox theology. His most important reform was to order the codification of the first Code of Canon Law, which collected the laws of the Church into one volume for the first time. He was also considered a pastoral pope, in the sense of encouraging personal holiness, piety and a daily lifestyle reflecting deep Christian values. He was born in the town of Riese, which would later append \\"Pio X\\" (Pius X's name in Italian) to the town's name.  - The Reichskonkordat (\\"Concordat between the Holy See and the German Reich\\") is a treaty negotiated between the Vatican and the emergent Nazi Germany. It was signed on 20 July 1933 by Cardinal Secretary of State (and later Pope Pius XII) Eugenio Pacelli on behalf of Pope Pius XI and Vice Chancellor Franz von Papen on behalf of President Paul von Hindenburg and the German government. It was ratified September 10, 1933 and it has been in force from that date right up until the current day. The treaty guarantees the rights of the Roman Catholic Church in Germany. When bishops take office Article 16 states they're required to take an oath of loyalty to the Governor or President of the German Reich established according to the constitution. The treaty also requires all clergy to abstain from working in and for political parties. Nazi breaches of the agreement began almost as soon as it had been signed and intensified afterwards leading to protest from the Church including in the 1937 \\"Mit brennender Sorge\\" encyclical of Pope Pius XI. The Nazis planned to eliminate the Church's influence by restricting its organizations to purely religious activities.  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - Pope Pius XI, born Ambrogio Damiano Achille Ratti (31 May 1857  10 February 1939), reigned as Pope from 6 February 1922 to his death in 1939. He was the first sovereign of Vatican City from its creation as an independent state on 11 February 1929. He took as his papal motto, \\"Pax Christi in Regno Christi,\\" translated \\"The Peace of Christ in the Kingdom of Christ.\\"  - Pope Pius XII, born Eugenio Maria Giuseppe Giovanni Pacelli (2 March 18769 October 1958), reigned as Pope from 2 March 1939 to his death in 1958. Before his election to the papacy, Pacelli served as secretary of the Department of Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs, papal nuncio to Germany (19171929), and Cardinal Secretary of State, in which capacity he worked to conclude treaties with European and Latin American nations, most notably the \\"Reichskonkordat\\" with Nazi Germany, with which most historians believe the Vatican sought to protect the Church in Germany while Adolf Hitler sought the destruction of \\"political Catholicism\\". A pre-war critic of Nazism, Pius XII lobbied world leaders to avoid war and, as Pope at the outbreak of war, issued \\"Summi Pontificatus\\", expressing dismay at the invasion of Poland, reiterating Church teaching against racial persecution and calling for love, compassion and charity to prevail over war.  - The Secretary of State of His Holiness The Pope, commonly known as the Cardinal Secretary of State, presides over the Holy See Secretariat of State, which is the oldest and most important dicastery of the Roman Curia. The Secretariat of State performs all the political and diplomatic functions of the Holy See and the Vatican City.  - Luigi Maglione ( 2 March 1877 -- 23 August 1944 ) was an Italian Cardinal of the Roman Catholic Church . He was elevated to the cardinalate in 1935 and served as the Vatican Secretary of State under Pope Pius XII from 1939 until his death . Pius XII never replaced Maglione , opting to assume the responsibilities of the office himself , with the assistance of two undersecretaries .  - Adolf Hitler (20 April 1889  30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (\\"Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei\\"; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and Führer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator of the German Reich, he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was central to the Holocaust.

Even though the state is smaller than the country, it is better because the  Available choices: -state has zero debt... -country has zero debt...","output":"Even though the state is smaller than the country, it is better because the state has zero debt. Zero debt indicates that the state has effectively managed its resources and maintained a stable, secure financial system. This is crucial as it presents numerous advantages over a country with debt, which can lead to negative consequences for its citizens. Firstly, having zero debt means the state can continue to invest in essential public services without being hindered by interest payments. This subsequently improves the quality of life for the residents within the state. Better infrastructure, such as roads, schools, hospitals, and public transport, can be built, maintained, and upgraded. This leads to a more prosperous region, which in turn fosters a thriving economy where businesses can flourish. Moreover, having zero debt allows the state more maneuverability within its budget. With no debt to service, the state can allocate funds towards pressing social issues, such as education, healthcare, and poverty alleviation, thereby ensuring a healthier, more educated population. This results in a more productive workforce, which is vital for economic growth. Furthermore, the state, being smaller in size compared to the country, has the advantage of being easier to manage and govern. This allows for more efficient decision-making and implementation of policies. The state's smaller size also gives it the ability to react to economic changes and challenges more promptly than the country, providing a more stable and secure financial landscape. In comparison, a country with debt can face numerous problems. High debt levels can lead to increased interest rates, which then places additional strain on public finances. This results in reduced government spending on crucial public services, negatively impacting the citizens' quality of life. Additionally, countries with large debts are often subject to external pressures and influences from international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) or the World Bank. These institutions may impose austerity measures that can further cut public spending, leading to sociopolitical instability and unrest as citizens struggle with fewer resources and less support. Also, countries with a massive debt burden are more likely to experience economic slowdowns as their debt consumes a significant portion of government expenditure. This leaves less room for investments that boost economic growth or respond to sudden crises. High debt levels can damage the country's credit rating, making it difficult and expensive to borrow funds in the future, which adds further strain to the nation's finances. In conclusion, the state's zero debt demonstrates its effective management of resources and financial stability, paving the way for a thriving economy, improved public services, and an enhanced overall quality of life. This is preferable to a country with debt, which faces numerous challenges and negative consequences for its citizens. The state's smaller size and zero debt further underscore its ability to be more agile and responsive to economic challenges and opportunities, making it a better choice for a prosperous future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Title: Once Upon a Time in the West Movie plot: The film portrays two conflicts that take place around Flagstone, a fictional town in the American Old West: a land battle related to construction of a railroad, and a mission of vengeance against a cold-blooded killer. A struggle exists for Sweetwater, a piece of land near Flagstone containing the region's only water source. The land was bought by Brett McBain (Frank Wolff), who foresaw that the railroad would have to pass through that area to provide water for the steam locomotives. When crippled railroad tycoon Morton (Gabriele Ferzetti) learns of this, he sends his hired gun Frank (Henry Fonda) to intimidate McBain to move off the land, but Frank instead kills McBain and his three children, planting evidence to frame the bandit Cheyenne (Jason Robards). It appears the land has no owner; however, a former prostitute (Claudia Cardinale) arrives from New Orleans, revealing she is Jill McBain, Brett's new wife and the owner of the land. Meanwhile, a mysterious harmonica-playing gunman (Charles Bronson), whom Cheyenne later dubs \\"Harmonica\\", pursues Frank. In the film's opening scene, Harmonica kills three men sent by Frank to kill him. In a roadhouse on the way to Sweetwater, he informs Cheyenne that the three gunfighters appeared to be posing as Cheyenne's men. Back at Sweetwater, construction materials are delivered to build a railroad station and a small town. Harmonica explains that Jill will lose Sweetwater unless the station is built by the time the track's construction crews reach that point, so Cheyenne puts his men to work building it.

(E.g., Runners’ feet are trained to function as spring-like mechanism) B) The body should be injected with a substance that makes the bones unbreakable, and there will be no more injuries. Okay, little buddy, let's think about these two options and decide which one sounds better for keeping people safe while exercising or running. A) This option focuses on training the body to move in a way that helps protect itself from getting hurt. Like making the runner's feet act like springs to absorb the impact. This could be a good way to prevent injuries by teaching people how to move more safely. B) This option is about putting a special substance into the body that makes the bones super strong and unbreakable. While this might sound cool, it doesn't really help with learning how to move safely or preventing other non-bone related injuries. In terms of naive physics reasoning, option A is more sound because it focuses on helping people learn to move safely and prevent injuries from happening in the first place. Option B might protect bones, but it doesn't help with overall safe movement and injury prevention."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This way, your teen will be surrounded by loved ones sharing the untold consequences of your teen's actions. You can invite a former user to come and share their experience and discuss the dangers and risks of steroid use. The goal of an intervention is to get your teen to participate in treatment and realize the impact of their use. It's important to see if your teen has experienced any damage to their health. Some side-effects are reversible, so it's important to see what damage has been caused. Set up an appointment for a physical with your family doctor. Medications that target symptoms of withdrawal and antidepressants are commonly prescribed to kids who have been abusing steroids. Talk to your doctor about medications and whether or not they are a good choice for your child. There are many different types of therapy available to help kids with abuse problems. These can be individual meetings with a therapist, or you can schedule family therapy sessions. There are also in-home counselors available through substance abuse programs.  A therapist can help your teen talk about their performance, anxieties, perfectionism, and coping strategies. Find a therapist by contacting your insurance provider or local mental health clinic. You can also get a recommendation from a physician or friend. Since people sometimes have another disorder along with drug addiction, try to find a therapist who specializes in co-occurring disorders. Some issues your teen may be facing could include self-esteem issues, depression, or anxiety. Your teen may be using steroids to help them cope with these issues. A therapist trained to work with co-occurring disorders will help your teen through all of their issues at once. Some teens will need to enter a program to handle their abuse. Find a substance abuse treatment program that admits teens who struggle with steroid use. Often, substance abuse programs are residential, although there may be some day treatment or weekly options available, based on your teen's needs.  Within the USA, go to http://www.findtreatment.samhsa.gov to learn about treatment options.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Guttermouth is an American punk rock band formed in 1988 in Huntington Beach, California and currently recording for Rude Records/Bird Attack Records. They have released nine full-length studio albums and two live albums and have toured extensively, including performances on the Vans Warped Tour. They are infamous for their outrageous lyrics and behavior which are deliberately explicit, offensive and intended to shock, though usually in a humorous and sarcastic manner. This behavior has sometimes resulted in high-profile problems for the band, such as being banned from performing in Canada for eighteen months and leaving the 2004 Warped Tour amidst controversy over their political views and attitudes towards other performers. The following year found the band returning home to California and experiencing a lineup change. Clint Weinrich married in the spring of 1995, and to fill in for him on a European tour the band recruited Steve \\"Stever\\" Rapp, a college friend of Nunn's who was playing in a band called The Grabbers. Things worked out well with Rapp on this tour and he soon became the band's permanent bass player. The new lineup entered the studio and recorded their third album Teri Yakimoto. By all accounts the recording process was plagued with problems, and at one point most of the recordings were scrapped and re-recorded with a new producer. The result was an album that continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums. The band continued to tour and expand their fan base, and filmed a music video for the song \\"Whiskey.\\" With their popularity growing Nitro Records re-released Full Length in CD format with bonus tracks under the title The Album Formerly Known as Full Length LP.  In 1997 the band recorded Musical Monkey, an album which captured their chaotic energy and sharp sense of humor. It is considered by many to be the best representation of their \\"classic\\" sound, and songs such as \\"Lucky the Donkey,\\" \\"Do the Hustle,\\" \\"Lipstick\\" and \\"Perfect World\\" became staples in their live set. The following year they released Live From the Pharmacy, a recording of a live show from 1994 that also included four new songs engineered by Vandals guitarist Warren Fitzgerald and liner notes written by Nunn recounting the band's history. In 1998 Guttermouth was banned from performing in Canada for one year on charges of public indecency after Adkins exposed himself onstage in Saskatoon. According to Adkins: \\"oh, I was guilty [...] What I would do is grab two young girls out of the audience and I would have them hold up this sheet in front of me, and Jamie, the drummer at the time, would say this magical incantation, if you will, and I would be standing there stark naked.\\" Combined with a drunk driving charge from the United States, the incident led Adkins to be arrested on immigration charges, detained for five days, and then deported, though Guttermouth would return to Canada a few years later. After obtaining a full pardon from the Canadian judicial system known as the crown. No record remains on file.  Rapp left the band in 1999, at which point Nunn moved from drums to bass and new drummer William \\"Ty\\" Smith was brought in. That year the band recorded and released Gorgeous, their most aggressive album to date and their final album for Nitro. What was it called","output":"The album was called \\"Teri Yakimoto.\\" This album continued the fast and sarcastic Guttermouth tradition but was more melodic and pop-influenced than their previous albums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options:  (a). be prepared to eat;  (b). eat until he vomits food;  (c). not make too much noise chewing;","output":"To determine what Cameron will want to do next, let's analyze each option step-by-step: Option (a). be prepared to eat: - Since Cameron brought his lunch to a picnic in a park, it's reasonable to assume that he went there to enjoy the meal. Being prepared to eat fits with the context of having a picnic, and it aligns with Cameron's actions. Option (b). eat until he vomits food: - It is unlikely that Cameron would want to eat to the point of vomiting, as this would be uncomfortable and unpleasant. Generally, people eat meals with the intention of satisfying their hunger and enjoying the food, not overeating to the point of sickness. Option (c). not make too much noise chewing: - This option can be a goal while eating, as some people may want to be conscious of the noise they make while chewing their food. However, it is not necessarily the primary goal or the next step Cameron would take after bringing his lunch to the park. Based on analysis, it's reasonable to say that Cameron will likely choose option (a) - to be prepared to eat. This is because it fits with the context of having a picnic and aligns with his primary goal: to eat his lunch while enjoying the park."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer?","output":"The common mineral formed by the fossilization of vegetation is coal. Coal is an organic sedimentary rock primarily composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, as well as small amounts of sulfur and other elements. It is created through a complex process called coalification, which involves the transformation of plant material into the solid, black and combustible substance known as coal. Coal formation begins when large amounts of plant material, such as trees, ferns, and other vegetation, accumulate in swampy, low-oxygen environments known as peatlands or mires. In these damp conditions, the plant material does not fully decompose and instead accumulates as peat. Over time, the accumulated peat is buried by sediment, such as sand or clay, which helps to protect it from complete destruction by microbes and atmospheric oxygen. As more layers of sediment are deposited on top of the peat, it is subjected to increasing pressure and temperature. These conditions cause the peat to undergo a series of chemical and physical changes, which drive off volatile substances like water and methane and leave behind a carbon-rich substance. Gradually, the peat turns into lignite, also known as brown coal, which is a low-quality coal with a high moisture and ash content. With continued pressure and increased temperature over millions of years, the lignite undergoes further transformation, becoming sub-bituminous coal, bituminous coal, and finally anthracite coal. Each stage of transformation results in a coal type with higher carbon content, energy density, and overall quality. However, it is important to note that not all peat deposits progress through each stage of coalification, as the process is heavily dependent on specific environmental conditions, such as the type of plant material, temperature, and pressure. Coal has played a significant role in human history, as it was one of the first fossil fuels utilized for energy production. It fueled the industrial revolution and continues to be an important energy source globally, particularly for electricity generation. The combustion of coal releases energy in the form of heat, which can then be used to turn water into steam and drive turbines in power plants. However, the use of coal as an energy source has also had significant negative effects, as burning coal releases carbon dioxide and other pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. These emissions contribute to climate change, acid rain, and air pollution, which have negative impacts on human health, ecosystems, and the environment. As a result, there has been a growing push for cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, to minimize the detrimental effects of fossil fuel consumption. In summary, the common mineral formed by the fossilization of vegetation is coal. This organic sedimentary rock is created through the accumulation and transformation of plant material under specific environmental conditions. Coal has been crucial for human civilization as an energy source, but its use has also led to various negative environmental and health impacts, prompting a quest for cleaner and more sustainable energy alternatives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the full names of the people who find Holly's video camera?  Two days after the events of the first film, a traumatized and blood-covered Sarah escapes the cave with no memory of the events. She is taken to a hospital, where it is found that some of the blood on her belongs to Juno Kaplan. Sheriff Vaines takes his deputy Elen Rios, Sarah, and three spelunking specialists – Dan, Greg, and Cath – to the cave to find the missing women. The team members are sent down via an old mine shaft operated by the old, mysterious Ed Oswald. The group discovers Rebecca's mutilated body, causing Sarah to have flashbacks of the crawlers and causing Vaines to believe Sarah may be responsible for the girls' disappearance.  While crawling through a tunnel, she attacks Vaines and the others, causing the others to split up. Vaines runs to search for Sarah, and in the process is surprised by a crawler, and fires his gun in a panic, causing a minor collapse in the cavern which traps Cath, separating her from Rios, Dan, and Greg.  The three decide to find an alternate way around in order to try to free Cath and arrive in a room full of bones, where they find Holly's video camera. They watch it and realize the women were attacked by the crawlers. The three are then themselves attacked by crawlers and separated. Rios starts calling for help, alerting the crawlers to her location, but is rescued by Sarah.  The two then watch as a crawler kills Dan and drags his body away, prompting Sarah to inform Rios that the crawlers are blind and hunt via sound. After escaping from and killing a crawler, Cath finds Greg before the two escape from another crawler and find Sam's body.

He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world.  Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction.  Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\"  Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

They are also accused of hypocrisy for funding much of their activities through the trafficking of cocaine, with around 65 of the group's 110 operational units involved in the trade, according to a 2005 International Crisis Group report. The group's roots lie in what is known in Colombia as \\"La Violencia\\", a bloody period in the 1940s and 1950s sparked when Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, a popular left-wing politician, was assassinated, leading to a wave of violence between right-wing and left-wing armed groups. Manuel 'Sureshot' Marulanda is theleader of the Farc [GALLO/GETTY]TheÂ fighting leftÂ up toÂ 300,000 people dead and spawned several groups, including the Farc, the ELN and M-19 movements. Established in 1964 as the military wing of the country's Communist Party (although 1966 has also been mooted as the date), the group spent the 1960s and 1970s acting as a \\"guerilla\\" force carrying out operations against the military in its heartland of the south and east of Colombia. However, during the 1980s, the movement developed a formal army structure, organising into squads and fronts. The group is governed by a seven-member secretariat, led by Manuel Marulanda, nicknamed \\"Tirofijo\\" or \\"Sureshot\\" because of his reported shooting skills. The group was believed to have had about 16,000 fighters in 2001, although that figure now is down to between 6,000 and 8,000, according to the government. The Farc has been involved in on-off peace negotiations since 1984, when it set up a political party, the Patriotic Union, to achieve its ends. But the party was undermined by a series of assassinations by right-wing paramilitaries and in 1985, the group returned to its armed campaign. In 1998 the then-president of Colombia, Andres Pastrana, allocated a 42,000 square kilometre safe haven for the Farc, which had previously been a pre-condition of the group for peace talks. However by 2002 negotiations stalled after attacks continued and Pastrana ordered the army to retake the territory. Protesters have demanded IngridÂ Betancourt's release [AFP]In an attempt to force the government to accede to itsÂ demands and to release captured fighters, the Farc has taken hundreds of hostages. These include Ingrid Betancourt, a former presidential candidate, and three US military contractors. The hostages are held in poor conditions, sometimes in cages deep in jungle areas controlled by the Farc. One hostage released by the Farc said he and others had suffered \\"subhuman conditions\\" during their captivity. The group has recently released some captives on what it has said are ethical grounds in a deal brokered byÂ Hugo Chavez, theÂ Venezuelan president,Â but it rejected a government deal over Betancourt, saying its fighters must be released from Colombian jails first. In 2002 Alvaro Uribe was elected president of Colombia. A more \\"hardline\\" politician than his predecessor, his own father, a wealthy landowner, was assassinated by the Farc during a failed kidnapping attempt. Uribe has intensified the Colombian military assault on the Farc andÂ the Colombian army'sÂ better-equipped forces, trained and advised by the US, have scored a number of significant victories. A number of senior commanders have been killed, including Raul Reyes, who died in a controversial a cross-border raid on Farc camp in Ecuador by the Colombian military, which sparked a still lingering diplomatic crisis in the region. The group has also suffered a number of desertions as fighters became disillusioned with the group's involvement in the drug trade. But while the group has suffered a number of setbacks, it is far from defeated. Chavez has offered Farc vocal support and earlier this year called forÂ the groupÂ and the smaller ELN organisation to be removed from government lists of terror groups. And the Colombian government may now be more wary of carrying out cross-border military operations against the Farc, after Latin American governments reacted angrily to its raid into Ecuador. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is a Marxist-Leninist guerrilla group that has fought against the Colombian government since the 1960s, seeking to address socioeconomic inequalities and establish a communist state; however, they have been accused of widespread human rights abuses, engaging in drug trafficking, and taking hostages to further their goals. While FARC has experienced some setbacks and a decrease in numbers in recent years, the group remains active and poses a significant challenge to the Colombian government."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please add spaces between words: Champagnetobeworldheritage","output":"Here is the sentence with spaces added between the words:  Champagne to be world heritage This sentence seems to be referring to the Champagne region in France being designated as a World Heritage site. The World Heritage designation is awarded by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to places that have cultural, historical, or natural significance and are considered to be of outstanding value to humanity.  The Champagne region is highly valued for its unique and rich history, as well as its cultural and economic significance. The region is known for its vineyards, which produce the world-famous Champagne wine. This sparkling wine is distinguished by the unique method used to make it, known as the méthode champenoise, which involves a secondary fermentation process that takes place within the bottle. This technique is responsible for the wine's effervescence and is a key reason why Champagne has become an iconic and sought-after luxury item. One of the main factors that make the region worthy of the World Heritage designation is the long and fascinating history behind the production of Champagne wine. The origins of winemaking in the region date back to the Roman era, and the production of sparkling wine began to take shape in the 17th century. It was during this time that the Benedictine monk Dom Pérignon played a crucial role in perfecting many of the techniques that are still utilized today in the production of Champagne. His work led to the development of a clear, sparkling wine that became highly demanded by the French nobility and other elites throughout Europe. Another factor contributing to the significance of the Champagne region is its cultural importance, which has grown over the centuries. Champagne has become synonymous with celebrations, important events, and the enjoyment of life. It is a symbol of elegance, refinement, and prosperity and has played a central role as a status symbol in numerous artistic and cultural expressions, including movies, literature, and high-society events. In addition to its historical and cultural value, the Champagne region boasts stunning landscapes and architectural heritage. The gently rolling hills covered with vineyards, the unique, chalky soils, and the intricate network of cellars and tunnels located beneath the region's towns and cities are all part of what makes the Champagne region so exceptional. These tunnels, some of which date back to the Roman period, serve as safe and stable storage for millions of bottles of Champagne, ensuring that they age properly and maintain their quality over time. Given these factors, the decision to designate the Champagne region as a World Heritage site is understandable, as it recognizes and preserves the unique history, culture, and beauty of the region. This designation not only promotes the distinctive character of the area and its wines but also encourages sustainable tourism and responsible development in the region. In conclusion, the Champagne region's World Heritage status is a testament to the valuable contribution that this area has made, and continues to make, to the world's cultural and gastronomic heritage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The Royal Philharmonic Orchestra (RPO), based in London, was formed by Sir Thomas Beecham in 1946. In its early days the orchestra secured profitable recording contracts and important engagements including the Glyndebourne Festival Opera and the concerts of the Royal Philharmonic Society. After Beecham's death in 1961 the orchestra's fortunes declined steeply; it battled for survival until the mid-1960s, when its future was secured after an Arts Council report recommended that it should receive public subsidy; a further crisis arose in the same era when it seemed that the orchestra's right to call itself \\"Royal\\" could be withdrawn. Since Beecham's death the RPO has had seven chief conductors, including Rudolf Kempe, Antal Dorati, Andre Previn and Vladimir Ashkenazy, and most recently Charles Dutoit. From the RPO's earliest days to the end of Beecham's life, they made numerous recordings for His Master's Voice, CBS and RCA. Among the works they recorded EMI chose several to be reissued at the end of the twentieth century in its \\"Great Recordings of the Century\\" series. They included a Delius programme; a Grieg programme; French ballet music; short works by Bizet, Chabrier, Faure and Saint-Saens; Tchaikovsky's Symphony No 4 and Nutcracker Suite; Mozart's Jupiter Symphony, Clarinet Concerto (Brymer) and Bassoon Concerto (Brooke); and Schubert's 3rd, 5th and 6th Symphonies.  After Beecham's death the orchestra made many recordings for Decca, sometimes under pseudonyms such as the \\"Beecham Symphony Orchestra\\", the \\"London Festival Orchestra\\" and the \\"Metropolitan Symphony Orchestra\\". Among the conductors with whom the RPO recorded in the 1960s were Sir John Barbirolli, Fritz Reiner, Charles Munch, Georges Pretre, Kempe, Previn and Stokowski. Soloists included Earl Wild, Shura Cherkassky, Alan Civil and Luciano Pavarotti.  Igor Stravinsky recorded his opera The Rake's Progress with the RPO in 1964. Colin Davis made some of his earliest recordings with the orchestra, including Mozart and Rossini overtures, Beethoven's Seventh Symphony, and Stravinsky's Oedipus rex. From 1964 to 1979 the RPO was engaged by Decca to record Gilbert and Sullivan operas with the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company. The orchestra has also recorded for Deutsche Grammophon, Lyrita, Philips, Pye and Unicorn-Kanchana.  In 1986, the orchestra launched RPO Records, claimed to be \\"the world's first record label to be owned by a symphony orchestra\\".

It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

More drawn in by the name than anything else, and having recently seen an episode of Bourdain eating shwarma, Greek sounded pretty good to me.

They were hands down the best part of the meal and possibly the best feta fries I've ever had.  The cheese was delicious and there was a light rosemary based sauce drizzled on top which was just a perfect compliment to the fries and cheese.  Unfortunately, this is where the good part of the meal ended.  Having waited a good half hour after we had already finished our fries, my gyro plate was nothing to write home about - it was your usual fair with somewhat over cooked rice, sauteed vegetables, and way too little pita and tzatziki sauce for the amount of meat.  My friend's steak kabobs were all but inedible - cold and seasoned with entirely way too much salt, the meat was salty to the point that it was borderline bitter.  Poor girl just ate the rice and veggies and left the kabobs all but untouched.    Well, overall, this place did not impressed.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Question 1: What all government jobs can I get that do not require minimum %? There are several government jobs that do not have a minimum percentage requirement. These positions focus more on the skills and knowledge of the applicant, rather than their academic performance in terms of percentages. Here are some examples of such government jobs: 1. Lower Division Clerk (LDC)/Upper Division Clerk (UDC) - These positions usually involve administrative tasks, such as data entry and document management. The main requirement for these jobs can range from qualifying in entrance exams conducted by the Staff Selection Commission (SSC) or any other state-level recruitment board. 2. Multitasking Staff (MTS) - The primary role of MTS personnel is to provide support services in various government departments. The selection is done on the basis of a competitive examination conducted by the Staff Selection Commission or state-level recruitment boards. 3. Constable - A constable is an entry-level police officer. To become one, you need to qualify for the Police Constable Recruitment Exam, which is organized by several state police departments. There is no minimum percentage required, although there may be a requirement for minimum educational qualifications such as 10th or 12th standard pass. 4. Railway jobs - Indian Railways is one of the largest employers in India, and they offer jobs for various positions ranging from technical to non-technical roles. Some positions, like Trackman, Helper, or Porter, might not require a minimum percentage, but will need the candidate to pass a written and physical examination. 5. Drivers - Government departments require drivers to operate their official vehicles. With a valid driving license and some experience, you can apply for driver positions in various departments. There is no minimum percentage requirement for such positions. It is essential to note that, although these jobs do not have a minimum percentage requirement, they may still require the applicants to possess specific educational qualifications and skills, and to pass different recruitment-based examinations. Question 2: What do you think SMEs should expect from cloud service providers in the near future? Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have increasingly started to adopt cloud services to simplify and streamline their business operations. In the near future, SMEs can expect the following from cloud service providers: 1. Enhanced Security: With growing cyber threats and data breaches, cloud service providers need to continuously improve their security measures. SMEs can expect advanced and strong security protocols, ensuring the safety of their sensitive data. 2. Scalability and Flexibility: Cloud providers should offer agile and easily scalable solutions to accommodate the growing needs of SMEs. Services should be designed to allow companies to scale up or down as needed without incurring excessive costs. 3. Cost-effective Solutions: As SMEs usually have limited budgets, cloud service providers should offer cost-effective and customized solutions that cater to the specific needs of small and medium businesses. 4. Simplified Integration: SMEs can expect better integration and interoperability between different cloud services, applications, and platforms, streamlining their processes and making it easier to manage complex business requirements. 5. Consulting and Managed Services: To help SMEs make better decisions and optimize their IT infrastructure, cloud providers should offer consulting and managed services that offer expert guidance in leveraging cloud technologies for their specific business needs. 6. Improved Data Privacy and Compliance: Cloud providers should ensure that their services adhere to strict data privacy regulations, such as GDPR, and support SMEs in staying compliant with their industry standards and legal requirements. 7. Enhanced Customer Support: Timely and efficient customer support is crucial for SMEs using cloud services. They can expect improved and more responsive support options, including 24/7 availability, quicker response times, and expert assistance for resolving issues. To conclude, the two questions are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks about government jobs that do not require a minimum percentage, while the second question is about the expectations of SMEs from cloud service providers in the near future.

We don't have enough details about the severity of the collision, the number of vehicles involved, the response time of emergency services, or the efficiency of the detour. Without this essential information, it's difficult to accurately predict the duration of the traffic backup."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: Democratic Senate nominee Doug Jones talks to supporters as he campaigns at Niki's West restaurant in Birmingham, Ala., in October. | Brynn Anderson Alabama polls show close race after Moore accusations      The first wave of flash polls conducted after Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore was accused of abusing a 14-year-old girl nearly four decades ago point to a close race between Moore and Democrat Doug Jones.      Since The Washington Post published a story online Thursday afternoon in which four women accused Moore of making romantic or sexual advances on them when they were teenagers, four polls — all conducted using less expensive methodologies — have showed the candidates roughly neck-and-neck. The most recently released survey, an automated poll from the Republican-leaning firm JMC Analytics and Polling, shows the Democrat leading by 4 percentage points.      Story Continued Below      Jones leads Moore in the JMC Analytics poll, 48 percent to 44 percent, with 8 percent undecided or favoring another candidate in Alabama's Dec. 12 special Senate election. The poll was conducted last Thursday through Saturday.      The previous JMC Analytics survey, conducted in late September and early October, showed Moore ahead by 8 points. JMC conducts landline-only polls administered by an automated interviewer.      Moore has a 4-point lead in a Change Research poll, conducted online Thursday through Saturday, 44 percent to 40 percent — with a larger share of undecided voters, 16 percent.      The two other surveys were each conducted in a single day — a practice that increases the prospect of error, according to polling experts, because it tends to include the easiest voters to reach. A Gravis Marketing survey, conducted Friday for the blog Big League Politics via automated calls to landlines and online interviews with cellphone-only voters, had Moore at 48 percent and Jones at 46 percent, with 6 percent undecided.

That survey, conducted by Opinion Savvy for Decision Desk HQ and interviewing voters via automated calls to landlines and mobile respondents via ads or push notifications from their applications, found the two candidates knotted at 46 percent.      Each of the new polls has potential shortcomings. Nearly half of Alabama adults, 46 percent, lived in a household without a landline, according to 2015 data; the percentage is almost certainly larger today. One of the four polls didn’t interview respondents without a landline at all, while two of the others blended landline interviews with cellphone voters reached online or via smartphone apps. The Change Research poll was conducted entirely online but required respondents to self-identify as Alabama voters likely to cast ballots in a low-turnout race.      (Breitbart News, which is backing Moore and has cast doubt on the molestation allegations against him, reported that an in-state consulting firm that has worked for Moore in the past found the Republican ahead by 10 points in a Saturday-evening survey, though that poll wasn't released publicly.)      Previously, polls of likely voters in the special election had showed Moore with a more consistent lead. But these new, instant polls are often misleading barometers of how sudden, negative news coverage can impact a campaign.      Donald Trump cratered in the polls in the immediate wake of the “Access Hollywood” video — in which Trump joked about sexually assaulting women — roughly a month before last year’s presidential election. But Trump recovered in subsequent weeks, winning the Electoral College and finishing about 2 percentage points behind Hillary Clinton in the popular vote.      The Moore story has some parallels in recent Senate races. Five years ago, after then-Rep. Todd Akin (R-Mo.) made his infamous “legitimate rape” comment in an interview with a St. Louis TV station, four immediate polls showed results ranging from a 1-point Akin lead to a 10-point advantage for Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.). Before that, Akin had led every public poll of the race conducted that year.      McCaskill would build on her lead over the final weeks of the campaign, eventually trouncing Akin by 16 points. In that case, Republicans first tried to push Akin out of the race, then abandoned him en masse — including Mitt Romney, the party’s presidential nominee. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), then-chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in the weeks following Akin’s comment that the committee wouldn’t spend money to help Akin defeat McCaskill.      It was later revealed in campaign finance reports filed after the election that the NRSC made a late cash transfer to the Missouri Republican Party. “We needed to do what we needed to do to help win Senate seats,” Cornyn told POLITICO in December 2012.      Also in 2012, Republican Richard Mourdock similarly found himself in hot water over comments about rape and pregnancy in an Indiana Senate race. Indiana prohibits automated-phone polling, so there was little public data available to track how large a factor Mourdock’s statement was in his eventual loss to then-Rep. Joe Donnelly (D-Ind.). Mourdock’s publicly released internal polls showed him and Donnelly neck-and-neck, while a Donnelly internal poll showed the Democrat leading by a larger margin. Donnelly won by 6 points on Election Day.      Most rigorous campaign polling is done over three days to ensure pollsters aren’t capturing only the most easily reached voters, so both parties will likely be poring over new polling data over the next few days.      Don’t expect to see this polling in the public domain: Democrats are wary of nationalizing the race in a state Trump carried by nearly 30 points last fall, and Republicans are unlikely to make a public display of support for a candidate accused of sexually abusing a minor — or to release data that show the GOP nominee struggling. But the decisions made by both parties over the coming week will likely be informed by what that data suggest about how Alabama voters are reacting to the scandal. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Dr. Benjamin Stone is a hotshot young surgeon who longs to leave the drudgery of a Washington , D.C. emergency room and finally leaps at his chance at more money and less death as a plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills .  On his last day , Ben's relationship with his co-workers is presumed to be anything but a warm one .  None of his colleagues will join him for a drink and a cake in his honor has an iced portion of the phrase \`\` Good riddance , asshole '' sliced out .  Ben's cross-country drive in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster is interrupted when he crashes in the rural hamlet of Grady , South Carolina .  The crash damages the fence of local Judge Evans , who sentences him to community service at a nearby hospital .

Five days ago, Miranda Mann huddled in a science classroom at Southmoore High School. She should have been filed with pride, relief and excitement about her upcoming graduation. Instead, she was filled with fear as a devastating tornado powered through her central Oklahoma city. The 18-year-old has been literally picking up the pieces of her life since. Her house was unrecognizable, except for her and her mother's cars, after the twister destroyed it Monday. Her family sifted through rubble and salvaged some things, only to see many of them -- such as her prized book collection -- ruined by torrential rains. Mann doesn't want to live in Moore, wary of a place that's been hit by two EF5 tornadoes -- the strongest possible -- over the past 14 years. There's been plenty of time, and way too many reasons, for tears. But finally ... finally, Saturday was a time to smile. \\"My family is all here, we get to be together,\\" Mann said about her graduation at Oklahoma City's Cox Convention Center. \\"(You can) relax and let your hair down, because you know that we're not going back to the house today. We're not going to see that.\\" Southmoore High's seniors were one of three classes celebrating their commencement ceremonies at the facility. The date had been set for months, and it wasn't moved after the storm killed 24 people, injured more than 375 others and damaged 12,000 residences in and around the metropolitan area. A tornado bearing down; a mom in labor. Jake Spradling is glad the show went on. Like Mann, he's a Southmoore High senior; like her, he no longer has a place to call home. The hours since Monday have been \\"overwhelming,\\" Spradling admitted, though he said the outpouring of support -- offers to bunk early at Northwestern Oklahoma State University where he'll head this fall, dozens of text messages and \\"calls out of the wazoo\\" with offers of help -- have made a big difference. He knows people who lost family members, and many more who lost homes. He knows that they need time to plan and attend funerals, to clean up debris, to figure out what happens next. Even with all that, \\"I'm glad it's today,\\" Spradling said. \\"It means to me that we're not going on different routes. \\"We're staying on the same path that we were meant to be on.\\" One block, two tornadoes: Life in the crosshairs. Graduation festivities were infused by the tragedy, including speakers' remarks and other poignant reminders. One happened when Southmoore's Alyson Costilla walked across the stage to get her diploma and about a dozen people in the crowd stood up and held up pictures of her mother Terri Long, who died in a 7-Eleven ravaged by the powerful winds. Outside the convention center, the seniors from Southmoore, Westmoore and Moore high schools won't have to go far to be reminded of the devastation. Funeral homes and churches are busy with services for those killed. A balm after the storm. Ten of those killed were children, including seven second- and third-graders at Plaza Towers Elementary School. After three funerals earlier in the week, two more of those students were to be buried Saturday. Transforming Moore back into the city it had been won't be easy. Its public schools alone suffered 45 million in damage, including the two elementary schools that were leveled. Insurance claims related to Monday's storm will likely top 2 billion, according to Kelly Collins from the Oklahoma Insurance Department. But residents aren't doing it all alone. Honest advice from Joplin to Moore. Besides the presence of FEMA representatives and other public officials on the ground, they've had friends, relatives, even strangers come out to help. Sharon Liston has spent the last 25 years teaching math at Westmoore High, from which she's retiring after 40 years total in the profession. On Friday, a day before her school's graduation, a caravan of students arrived at her home to clean up her 3-acre property. \\"It looked like a wall of students with trash cans and trash sacks, and they literally picked up every stick within that three acres there,\\" Liston said. Principals recall day tornado hit. That kind of help makes it easier for Moore's residents to move on from this horrific week. Saturday's graduation ceremonies are similar, in that way. It means the end of one thing, and the beginning of another. A fresh start. \\"It's just the closing of one chapter and the opening of another,\\" Spradling said. \\"...It's one of those flipping of the pages that means a lot to everybody here.\\" Tornado heading your way?

Evers was born July 2, 1925, in Decatur, Mississippi, the third of the five children (including older brother Charles Evers) of Jesse (Wright) and James Evers. The family included Jesse's two children from a previous marriage. The Evers family owned a small farm and James also worked at a sawmill. Evers walked twelve miles to attend segregated schools, eventually earning his high school diploma. Medgar Evers lived with the constant threat of death. A large Ku Klux Klan and white supremacist population were present in Jackson and its suburbs. The risk was so high that before his death, Evers and his wife Myrlie had trained their children on what to do in case of a shooting, bombing or other kind of attack on their lives. Evers, who was regularly followed home by at least two FBI cars and one police car, arrived at his home on the morning of his death without an escort. None of his usual protection was present, for reasons unspecified by the FBI or local police. Many believe that many members of the police force at the time were members of the Klan.  In the early morning of June 12, 1963, just hours after President John F. Kennedy's nationally televised Civil Rights Address, Evers pulled into his driveway after returning from a meeting with NAACP lawyers. Evers's family had worried for his safety the day of his assassination and Evers himself had warned his wife that he felt himself in a greater danger than usual. When he arrived home, Evers's family was waiting for him and his children exclaimed to his wife, Myrlie, that he had arrived. Emerging from his car and carrying NAACP T-shirts that read \\"Jim Crow Must Go\\", Evers was struck in the back with a bullet fired from an Enfield 1917 rifle; the bullet ripped through his heart. Initially thrown to the ground by the impact of the shot, Evers rose and staggered 30 feet (10 meters) before collapsing. His wife Myrlie was the first to find him outside of their front door. He was taken to the local hospital in Jackson, Mississippi, where he was initially refused entry because of his race. His family explained who he was and he was admitted; he died in the hospital 50 minutes later. Evers was the first African American to be admitted to an all-white hospital in Mississippi, a questionable achievement for the dying activist. Mourned nationally, Evers was buried on June 19 in Arlington National Cemetery, where he received full military honors before a crowd of more than 3,000.  After Evers was assassinated, an estimated 5,000 people marched from the Masonic Temple on Lynch Street to the Collins Funeral Home on North Farish Street in Jackson. Allen Johnson, Reverend Martin Luther King and other civil rights leaders led the procession. The Mississippi police came prepared with riot gear and rifles in case the protests turned violent. While tensions were initially high in the stand off between police and marchers, both in Jackson and in many similar marches around the state, leaders of the movement maintained nonviolence among their followers.","output":"This text is about Medgar Evers, who was an African American civil rights activist from Mississippi. He worked with the NAACP and fought for the end of racial segregation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please add spaces between words: Itisastoragetechnologywhichisusedtocombinemultipledisksintoasinglelogicalunit.","output":"It is a storage technology which is used to combine multiple disks into a single logical unit. In the modern era of technology, organizations and individuals deal with an enormous amount of data. Efficient data storage and management are critical for smooth operations and data recovery in case of failures. One solution to manage this task is by using a storage technology that combines multiple disks into a single logical unit. This technology is called RAID, which stands for Redundant Array of Independent Disks. RAID is a powerful data storage technology that combines the storage capacity and processing power of multiple physical hard drives into a single unit. By distributing the data across these drives, RAID offers various benefits, including improved reliability, performance, and redundancy. There are several RAID levels, each designed to provide different degrees of data protection, capacity, and performance. Some common RAID levels are RAID 0, RAID 1, RAID 5, and RAID 6. Each RAID level uses a different method for combining and distributing data among multiple hard drives: 1. RAID 0 (Striping): This RAID level offers improved performance by splitting data into smaller blocks and distributing these blocks across all the hard drives in the array. It does not provide any redundancy or fault tolerance, making it less suitable for sensitive data storage, as the failure of one disk can result in complete data loss. 2. RAID 1 (Mirroring): RAID 1 provides data redundancy by duplicating data across two or more disks. In this configuration, the same data is stored on each disk, offering complete redundancy. If one disk fails, the other disk(s) can still provide access to the data without any data loss. RAID 1 is commonly used for providing fault tolerance but is less efficient in terms of storage capacity since it requires double the amount of storage. 3. RAID 5 (Distributed Parity): In RAID 5, data blocks are distributed among multiple disks, with each disk holding a portion of the data and an associated parity block. Parity blocks are used to reconstruct the missing data if a disk fails. RAID 5 requires a minimum of three disks and provides a balance between storage efficiency, performance, and fault tolerance. It can continue to function with the loss of one disk, but if a second disk fails before the first one is replaced, data will be lost. 4. RAID 6 (Dual Distributed Parity): RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but uses two parity blocks per disk instead of one, providing even higher redundancy and fault tolerance. It can handle the failure of two disks simultaneously without data loss. RAID 6 requires a minimum of four disks and is especially suited for large storage systems where reliability and data protection are critical. In conclusion, combining multiple disks into a single logical unit using RAID technology is an efficient means of managing and safeguarding data, especially in large-scale operations. By selecting an appropriate RAID level, organizations and individuals can achieve the desired balance between storage capacity, data protection, and performance to suit their specific needs."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Simon was born in Washington, D.C., the son of Dorothy Simon (nee Ligeti), a homemaker, and Bernard Simon, a former journalist and then public relations director for B'nai B'rith for 20 years. In March 1977, when Simon was still in high school, Simon's father was one of a group of over 140 people held hostage (and later released) in Washington, D.C. by former national secretary of the Nation of Islam Hamaas Abdul Khaalis in the Hanafi Siege. Simon was raised in a Jewish family with roots that originated in Eastern Europe and Hungary (his maternal grandfather had changed his surname from \\"Leibowitz\\" to \\"Ligeti\\"). He has a brother, Gary Simon, and a sister, Linda Evans, who died in 1990. Upon leaving college, Simon worked as a police reporter at The Baltimore Sun from 1982 to 1995. He spent most of his career covering the crime beat. A colleague has said that Simon loved journalism and felt it was \\"God's work\\". Simon says that he was initially altruistic and was inspired to enter journalism by the Washington Post's coverage of Watergate but became increasingly pragmatic as he gained experience. Later in his career he aimed to tell the best possible story without \\"cheating it\\".  Simon was a union captain when the writing staff went on strike in 1987 over benefit cuts. He remained angry after the strike ended and began to feel uncomfortable in the writing room. He searched for a reason to justify a leave of absence and settled on the idea of writing a novel. \\"I got out of journalism because some sons of bitches bought my newspaper and it stopped being fun,\\" says Simon.  In an interview in Reason in 2004, Simon said that since leaving the newspaper business he has become more cynical about the power of journalism. \\"One of the sad things about contemporary journalism is that it actually matters very little. The world now is almost inured to the power of journalism. The best journalism would manage to outrage people. And people are less and less inclined to outrage,\\" said Simon. \\"I've become increasingly cynical about the ability of daily journalism to effect any kind of meaningful change. I was pretty dubious about it when I was a journalist, but now I think it's remarkably ineffectual.\\" In 1988, disillusioned, Simon took a year's leave to go into the Baltimore Police Department Homicide Unit to write a book. What was his relationship with journalism?","output":"Simon's relationship with journalism began with an initial sense of altruism and inspiration from the Washington Post's coverage of Watergate. He felt that journalism was \\"God's work\\" and had a great passion for it. He worked as a police reporter at The Baltimore Sun from 1982 to 1995, mostly covering the crime beat. However, over time, Simon became increasingly pragmatic and focused on telling the best possible story without compromising it. His relationship with journalism started to change as he grew disillusioned with the field, especially after the strike he participated in as a union captain in 1987 over benefit cuts. This led him to take a leave of absence and explore other areas, such as writing a novel. Simon's departure from journalism was also influenced by the frustration he felt after his newspaper was bought and its work environment changed. In the years following his departure, Simon's views on journalism evolved further, eventually becoming quite cynical. He believed that contemporary journalism had lost its power to bring about meaningful change and lacked the ability to spark outrage in people. Overall, Simon's relationship with journalism was complex, marked by passion and love for the job in the beginning and evolving into disillusionment, frustration, and cynicism over time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The film stars Emily Browning , Abbie Cornish , Jena Malone , Vanessa Hudgens , Jamie Chung , and Carla Gugino . Question: what songs are used in the sucker punch trailer Answer:","output":"The film Sucker Punch, directed by Zack Snyder and released in 2011, features an ensemble cast that includes Emily Browning, Abbie Cornish, Jena Malone, Vanessa Hudgens, Jamie Chung, and Carla Gugino. The film is known for its unique visual style, as well as its incorporation of music to emphasize the action sequences and overall themes. Regarding the songs used in the Sucker Punch trailers, several trailers were released in the lead-up to the film's premiere, each with their distinctive musical choices. Here is a detailed analysis of songs featured in the major Sucker Punch trailers: 1. First official trailer released at Comic-Con 2010: - \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" by Led Zeppelin This classic rock song from the 1971 album Led Zeppelin IV accompanied a majority of the trailer, immersing viewers into the world of Sucker Punch with its iconic heavy beat and powerful vocals by Robert Plant. - \\"#1 Crush\\" by Garbage This song, originally released in 1996, served as the backdrop during the latter part of the trailer, characterized by its sultry and darkly emotive sound. The song complemented the film's mix of fantasy, action, and drama. 2. Theatrical trailer released in 2011: - \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)\\" by Emily Browning The theatrical trailer used a unique take on the Eurythmics' classic hit with the film's lead actress Emily Browning providing the vocals. Browning's haunting and dreamy rendition aligns perfectly with the film's surreal aesthetics, emphasizing the theme of escaping into one's imagination. - \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" by Yoav featuring Emily Browning This cover of the Pixies' influential song from the 1980s complements the film's themes of reality versus fantasy. The use of this song, along with Browning's vocals, helps to establish a connection between the lead character and the film's narrative arc. In conclusion, the trailers for Sucker Punch are notable for their use of music to accentuate the film's distinctive visual style and thematic elements. Featured songs such as \\"When the Levee Breaks,\\" \\"#1 Crush,\\" \\"Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This),\\" and \\"Where Is My Mind?\\" contributed to creating an effective and powerful atmosphere in the trailers, sparking curiosity and anticipation for the film."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - city - university building - auditorium - commercial building - theater  The answer is \\"theater\\" because Answer:","output":"Sam had tickets to the concert hall, but really didn't like to go because it was too loud. Since Sam was not interested in attending the loud concert, it suggests that he would prefer an event with a lower volume or different atmosphere. Step 1: Eliminate irrelevant options - city: A city is not an event or a place where one could trade tickets. - commercial building: A commercial building is not an event or a place where one could trade tickets. - university building: Though a university building can hold events, it is not specific enough, and trading concert tickets for entry to a university building seems unlikely. Step 2: Compare remaining options - auditorium: An auditorium could be a venue for another event which might have a lower volume, but it could still be loud depending on the event taking place there. - theater: A theater generally hosts events such as plays, musicals, or other performances that are less likely to be as loud as a concert. Step 3: Choose the best option Based on the available options and the context that Sam wanted to avoid a loud environment, it is most likely that he traded his concert hall tickets for tickets to a theater because theaters are known for hosting events that typically have lower volumes compared to concerts, catering better to Sam's preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After, people play in the marching band in different places. the marching band","output":"Following the alignment of the marching band in the street and the individual players performing in different locations, the most logical next event would be for the individual band members to regroup, reassemble, and continue with their coordinated performance. This would involve several steps: 1. Communication: The band director or designated leader informs the separate players that it's time to regroup and return to the main performance area. This can be done verbally, through visual signals, or with the help of technology such as two-way radios and smartphones. 2. Gathering individual players: Each band member stops playing at their designated location and begins moving back towards the main performance area to rejoin the group. If necessary, they will need to carefully navigate through the crowd or any obstacles present in the area. 3. Reassembly: As the individual players approach the main performance area, they start to align themselves following the previously determined formation. This may involve rows, arcs, or various geometric patterns, with each instrument section being strategically placed to produce the best possible sound. 4. Designated coordinators: A key role in marching bands is that of \\"section leaders\\" who are responsible for controlling and managing particular instrument sections. Section leaders ensure that their members are following the necessary performance protocols and instructions set forth by the band director, as well as providing individualized guidance when needed. 5. Instrument tuning: Once back in their positions, the band members take a brief moment to check their instruments for correct tuning and make necessary adjustments. It is crucial to ensure that the ensemble produces a harmonious sound when playing together. 6. Resuming the performance: With everyone back in place and ready to continue, the band director signals the start of the next musical piece. The band members follow their sheet music or memorized pieces, adjusting their playing to suit the new performance and ensuring that they are in harmony with their fellow musicians. 7. Engaging the audience: Throughout the reassembled performance, the marching band continues to actively engage with the audience. Members may perform visual maneuvers and formations, play popular or recognizable tunes, or even incorporate dance moves and choreography to add to the overall entertainment value. 8. Continuing the parade or moving to subsequent locations: After performing a designated number of pieces, the marching band may need to move on to the next leg of the parade or another performance location. Following the band director's cues, they will march together in their well-practiced formation, perhaps playing a lively marching tune to keep the crowd entertained as they transition to the next destination. In conclusion, the most logical next event after the marching band's individual performances would be the reassembly of the ensemble, resuming the coordinated performance, and eventually transitioning to the next destination as part of their parade commitments or series of planned performances. This sequence of events would not only ensure a captivating and cohesive performance but also demonstrates the incredible teamwork and discipline required to make a marching band a successful and entertaining spectacle."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Usher was born in Dallas, Texas, the son of Jonetta Patton (nee O'Neal), from Tennessee, and Usher Raymond III. Usher spent the majority of his young life in Chattanooga: his father left the family when Usher was a year old. Usher grew up with his mother, then-stepfather, and half-brother, James Lackey (born 1984). Directed by his mother, Usher joined the local church youth choir in Chattanooga, when he was nine years old. Aside from recording music, Usher is involved in other businesses, including several restaurants. In 2007 Usher worked with Richard Herpin and Honoring Blanc for the fragrances Usher He and Usher She. The promotion for the fragrance, featured Usher and Martha Stewart in the Macy's, \\"The Magic of Macy's\\" commercial. In September 2008 Usher released the fragrances, UR for Men and UR for Women. Usher fifth fragrance, VIP was launched in 2009.  On March 30, 2015, it was announced that Usher is a co-owner, with various other music artists, in the music streaming service Tidal. The service specialises in lossless audio and high definition music video with curated editorial. Jay Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015. The slogan \\"Turn the tide\\" and the hashtag \\"#TIDALforAll\\" was used by various artists on social media during the buildup to the press conference relaunching the service. Usher, along with sixteen artist stakeholders (such as Alicia Keys, Kanye West, Beyonce, Rihanna, Madonna, J.Cole, Nicki Minaj and more) co-own Tidal, with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. The idea of having an all artist owned streaming service was created by those involved to adapt to the increased demand for streaming within the current music industry, and to rival other streaming services such as Spotify, which have been criticised for their low payout of royalties.\\"The challenge is to get everyone to respect music again, to recognize its value\\", stated Jay-Z on the release of Tidal.

Step 1: Identify the common elements in both sentences - The speaker is worried. - The situation involves the car idling. Step 2: Compare the details of both sentences - In Sentence 1, the speaker is worried at every intersection when the car starts idling rough due to the heat. - In Sentence 2, the speaker is worried every time they stop and the car starts idling. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is true based on the first sentence - Both sentences convey that the speaker is worried about the car's idling behavior. - Sentence 1 provides reasons for this worry (stress, record heat, and idling rough at intersections). - Sentence 2 does not include those specific reasons, only mentioning worry when the car stops and idles.

Add spaces between the words in the following text: Theysaythereare4typesofpeoplewithdifferinglearningstyleswhichclearlylinkwiththefourstagesofthelearningcycle.","output":"They say there are 4 types of people with differing learning styles which clearly link with the four stages of the learning cycle. The original text, without spaces, can make comprehension difficult, so let's break down the components and discuss each part. - 4 types of people with differing learning styles: This refers to the four commonly known learning styles that people tend to have or lean towards while trying to acquire new knowledge or skills. These learning styles are Visual, Auditory, Read/Write, and Kinesthetic (often referred to as VARK). People usually have a preference for one or a combination of these learning styles. 1. Visual: Visual learners prefer to see things. They learn more effectively through the use of graphics, diagrams, images, and visual presentations that allow them to visualize the concepts and ideas. They may create concept maps, highlight key points in different colors, or utilize graphic organizers to help them understand complex information.  2. Auditory: Auditory learners are individuals who learn best through listening and talking. They prefer discussions, lectures, and audiobooks over written material. They may benefit from reading aloud, using mnemonic devices, or participating in group discussions and debate. 3. Read/Write: These learners primarily understand and retain information through reading and writing. They may prefer textbooks, written exercises, and taking detailed notes while reading or listening. They tend to benefit from rewriting concepts in their own words, summarizing information, or analyzing written material thoroughly.  4. Kinesthetic: Kinesthetic learners are those who learn best through hands-on experiences. They prefer to engage in physical activities, experiments, demonstrations, and role-playing. These learners may benefit from taking breaks during study sessions, using tangible resources to represent concepts, or associating information with bodily sensations. - Four stages of the learning cycle: This refers to a framework known as the experiential learning cycle developed by David Kolb. The four stages in the cycle are Concrete Experience, Reflective Observation, Abstract Conceptualization, and Active Experimentation. 1. Concrete Experience: This stage involves the learners actively participating in an experience that exposes them to the subject matter. 2. Reflective Observation: During this stage, learners reflect upon the experience they have been exposed to and identify their thoughts and feelings about it. 3. Abstract Conceptualization: At this stage, the learners try to make sense of their reflections by connecting them with existing knowledge, forming new concepts and ideas, or revising previous beliefs. 4. Active Experimentation: Here, learners apply the newly acquired knowledge to new situations and test out the concepts they have formed. This leads them back to a new concrete experience, restarting the cycle. In conclusion, there is a clear connection between the four types of learners and the four stages of the learning cycle. By understanding different learning styles and applying them to the experiential learning cycle, educators and learners can maximize their potential for knowledge acquisition and personal growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: You may be so busy dealing with a serious break-up, a job loss, or another significant event in your life that you don't have time to shower or get more than a few hours of sleep a night. However, if you want to be mentally strong, then you have to be physically able, too. If your body is in a funk or you're just feeling unkempt, then you'll be even less equipped to deal with the challenges. No matter how awful you're feeling, you need to make an effort to shower, brush your teeth, sleep, and get into a normal routine, so that you can start feeling as \\"normal\\" as you can. Make sure to make time for mental breaks when you're caring for yourself, too. Studies show that taking mental breaks, whether you're just daydreaming or closing your eyes and listening to a song that you love, can help ward off those stress chemicals and will prevent you from feeling overwhelmed. Your self-esteem depends on, among other things, how you value yourself. It's important to form a positive perspective about yourself and about life in general to ensure resilience. In acquiring competencies and responsibilities, you nourish your self-esteem, so it is important to get involved in life and not withdraw into yourself and feel threatened. If you feel that you are worthless, then you will feel incapable of tackling challenges.  Use self-enhancement by paying close attention to your positive qualities, while minimizing your negative ones. You can begin by making a list of everything you like about yourself. Seek value through using your talents and abilities to their fullest, be it in a professional, volunteer, business, home front, or other capacity. Learn new abilities and skills as often as you can. This will strengthen your self-esteem and can also ward off fears. For example, if you're afraid your children might be hurt some day, take a basic first aid course to reduce your sense of fear and to increase your confidence in being able to cope should something happen. Workshops, seminars, courses, etc., are all good ways to improve your knowledge and to expand your network of acquaintances on whom you can draw support if needed. Creativity is an expression of yourself and the way in which you live. Creativity lets you unleash what words or conversation cannot express or even understand. Nourishing your creativity can also help you be more creative when finding more solutions to problems, and will show you that you can look at the world in more than one way. Take a photography class, write a poem, take up watercolor painting, redecorate your room in an original way, or consider sewing your own clothes. Though you don't need to have six pack abs to deal with a major crisis, being physically strong certainly helps. Due to the mind-body connection, if your body is stronger, then you have built up the strength and endurance to have a stronger mind, and it will indeed help you in moments of crisis. Being physically fit may improve your self-esteem, positive thinking, and ability to feel empowered, all of which will help you be more resilient. Try starting with something simple like taking a walk in the sunshine for twenty minutes a day; this activity has been proven to help people be more open-minded and ready to face challenges. It's important to unravel past motivations that feed into current approaches to life. Until you make peace with the hardships of the past, they may continue to influence and even direct your current responses. See setbacks and past issues as a chance to learn.  Don't expect this to happen overnight but do tackle it; the end result will be a far more resilient self. Journaling about what happened and what you learned from it can help you come to terms with the past. See a therapist, a counselor, or your doctor if you cannot work through past issues alone.  Think about past setbacks that made you feel like your life was over. See how you were able to work through them -- and to come out stronger on the other side. If you feel like you're missing closure on an event from your past, try to figure out what it will take to move on, such as confronting someone or visiting a place where you used to live. It isn't always possible to get closure, but there may be a way to change your thinking about the past so you can feel stronger when addressing future challenges. Summary:","output":"This article says that to be mentally strong, it's important to take care of our body and mind. We should try to keep a normal routine, like taking showers and sleeping well. It's also helpful to think positively about ourselves and learn new skills. Being creative and physically active can make our mind stronger. We should also try to understand and learn from our past experiences. If we need help, we can talk to a professional, like a therapist.

Title: Shadows and Fog Movie plot: Kleinman (Allen) is awakened from a deep sleep by a vigilante mob. They claim to be looking for a serial killer who strangles his victims and to need his help. Before he leaves, his landlady, who wants to marry him, gives him a small paper bag with pepper in it. Irmy (Farrow) and her boyfriend Paul (Malkovich), performers at a circus, are having a dispute about getting married and having a baby. Paul leaves and goes to another tent where Marie, a tightrope artist (Madonna), waits for him. They begin to have sex, but Irmy catches them and runs away to the city. There, she meets a prostitute (Lily Tomlin) who brings her to a house of ill-repute, where she is comforted by other prostitutes (Jodie Foster and Kathy Bates). Then, a student named Jack (John Cusack) comes into the whorehouse and is immediately bewitched by Irmy; he insists on having sex with her, paying 700. On the street, Kleinman walks aimlessly around the city. He stops at a coroner's house, where the doctor (Donald Pleasence) explains that his role in the hunt is purely scientific. They each have a glass of sherry. After Kleinman leaves, the doctor is murdered by the Strangler.

Nico Rosberg believes he can force Lewis Hamilton into making a crucial mistake in their Formula One title showdown on Sunday. Rosberg, who trails the British driver by 17 points, said: ‘I need some help from Lewis to clinch the title, and I am going to try to put as much pressure on him as I can. ‘He has been making some mistakes recently so maybe there is a chance.’ Nico Rosberg (right) believes he can beat Lewis Hamilton to the championship at the final race in Abu Dhabi. Rosberg claims that his Mercedes team-mate has been 'making some mistakes' recently. 1. Lewis Hamilton - 334 points. 2. Nico Rosberg - 317 points. Lewis Hamilton will be crowned world champion if he finishes second in the season-ending Abu Dhabi Grand Prix, even if Nico Rosberg wins the race. If the final race was a ‘normal’ race with 25 points for the winner, rather than the double points on offer, Hamilton would be able to claim his second drivers’ title with a sixth-place finish. The Brit must finish first or second at Yas Marina, where the final grand prix carries double points, to be certain of taking the title. Hamilton, who was slow to shake Rosberg’s hand at their press conference, insisted he would not use dirty games to win. He said: ‘We’re not children. We should know what is wrong and right.’ 'This is an extremely exciting moment for my career. 'I am fighting for the world championship at the last race, I have a good chance to win, and this is what I have been working towards since I began racing as a small child. VIDEO Stewart backs Hamilton to clinch title. Rosberg takes his place on the podium after beating Hamilton to victory at the Brazilian Grand Prix. The two Mercedes drivers, pictured in Belgium, will be fighting for double points at Abu Dhabi. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Nico Rosberg is gearing up for a decisive showdown against Lewis Hamilton at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. As the Formula One season comes to a close, all eyes will be on these two Mercedes team-mates, with Hamilton leading the championship by 17 points. Rosberg is well aware that he needs a strong performance, coupled with some assistance from potential mistakes by Hamilton, to clinch the title. Rosberg's claim that Hamilton has been making some recent mistakes could indicate psychological tactics aimed at pressuring his rival in the all-important final race. With double points on offer, the stakes are higher than ever. Hamilton needs to secure first or second place to guarantee a championship victory, while a Rosberg win is mandatory for him to have a chance at the title. Despite the intense rivalry and the pressure of performing on the biggest stage, both drivers have attempted to show restraint when it comes to playing mind games. Hamilton insisted that there would be no dirty tricks in his quest for the championship and emphasized the importance of fair play, stating, \\"We're not children. We should know what is wrong and right.\\" For Rosberg, this showdown is a culmination of a lifetime of dedication to racing.

Generally in 19th-century warfare, the number of wounded outnumbered those killed by a factor of two or three.  From October 1835 through April 1836, approximately 1,000 Mexican and 700 Texian soldiers died, while the wounded numbered 500 Mexican and 100 Texian.  The deviation from the norm was due to Santa Anna's decision to label Texian rebels as traitors and to the Texian desire for revenge.During the revolution, Texian soldiers gained a reputation for courage and militance.   Lack points out that fewer than five percent of the Texian population enrolled in the army during the war, a fairly low rate of participation.  Texian soldiers recognized that the Mexican cavalry was far superior to their own.  Over the next decade, the Texas Rangers borrowed Mexican cavalry tactics and adopted the Spanish saddle and spurs, the riata, and the bandana.The Texas Veterans Association, composed solely of revolutionary veterans living in Texas, was active from 1873 through 1901 and played a key role in convincing the legislature to create a monument to honor the San Jacinto veterans.  In the late 19th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the San Jacinto battlesite, which is now home to the San Jacinto Monument, the tallest stone column monument in the world.  In the early 20th century, the Texas Legislature purchased the Alamo Mission, now an official state shrine. In front of the church, in the center of Alamo Plaza, stands a cenotaph designed by Pompeo Coppini which commemorates the defenders who died during the battle.

Which farmer didn't learn that aphids are resistant to organophosphates?  Two farmers had different pests attacking their plants. John had a big aphid problem, so he used all the methods available to get rid of them.  Mike had a slug problem, but had almost no aphides.  Hint: Insecticide control of aphids is difficult, as they breed rapidly, so even small areas missed may enable the population to recover promptly. Aphids may occupy the undersides of leaves where spray misses them, while systemic insecticides do not move satisfactorily into flower petals. Finally, some aphid species are resistant to common insecticide classes including carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids.For small backyard infestations, spraying plants thoroughly with a strong water jet every few days may be sufficient protection. An insecticidal soap solution can be an effective household remedy to control aphids, but it only kills aphids on contact and has no residual effect. Soap spray may damage plants, especially at higher concentrations or at temperatures above 32 °C (90 °F); some plant species are sensitive to soap sprays. The answer to this question is:","output":"Mike didn't learn that aphids are resistant to organophosphates because he had a slug problem and almost no aphids.

Her secret? \\"I didn't get there by dreaming about it,\\" she would say. \\"I got there by doing it.\\" Estee was born in the early 1900s in Queens, New York. Her father ran a hardware   store, and from him Estee learned how to be a successful salesperson. Estee learned from her uncle John Schotz, too. He made creams in a small laboratory behind the family's house. Estee watched him. Soon, she was experimenting with her own cosmetics. She put lipstick   and creams on any female relative who'd let her, until her annoyed father told her to stop. She married Joseph H. Lauder in 1930, and continued her experiments. She would cook dinner for the family, and at the same time, make her face creams. Then she began to sell her products in a Manhattan beauty shop. In 1960, Estee began to sell her products in Europe. After many tries she succeeded and began selling her products in some stores in London. But France proved even more difficult. The store Galleries Lafayette refused to sell her products. So Estee \\"by accident\\" dropped a bottle of youth dew   on the floor in the cosmetics department. As the _ spread around the store, customers came over and asked to buy it. The store soon began selling Estee's products. Estee led her company until 1982, when her son Leonard took over the business. Until her health worsened in the mid-1990s, she continued to attend the opening of a new store wherever in the world. She died on April 24, 2004.

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved. ''It would really offset the current cuts,'' he said.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who held a long-time collaboration with a jazz guitarist? is inside the article: Steven Lee Lukather (born October 21, 1957) is an American guitarist, singer, songwriter, arranger and record producer, best known as a founding member of Toto. A prolific session musician, Lukather has recorded guitar tracks for more than 1,500 albums representing a broad array of artists and genres. He has also contributed to albums and hit singles as a songwriter, arranger and producer. Lukather was a prominent contributor to several studio albums by Michael Jackson, including Thriller, the best-selling album of all time. Lukather has released seven solo albums, the latest of which, Transition, was released in January 2013. In 1976, when Lukather was nineteen years old, he was invited by his high school friends David Paich and the Porcaro brothers Steve and Jeff to join them in forming their band, Toto. He has been a member of the band ever since it began, and is still fully contributing to their album composition and touring. Lukather's reputation as a guitarist and his association with Paich and the Porcaro brothers, who also became established artists, allowed him to secure a steady flow of session work in the 1970s and 1980s. Lukather has been nominated for twelve Grammy Awards, and has won five. While his work with Toto was predominantly based on pop rock music and his solo work ventures into progressive rock and hard rock, many of Lukather's side-projects are focused on jazz fusion. He held a long-time collaboration with jazz guitarist Larry Carlton that produced a Grammy-winning live album, and he was a member of the jazz fusion band Los Lobotomys, a collaboration of notable session musicians.

Article: By Jen Heger – Radar Assistant Managing Editor      Hugh Hefner and his new bride Crystal Harris — who’s sixty years younger than he is — signed a prenuptial agreement three weeks ago at the Playboy Mansion, RadarOnline.com is exclusively reporting.      “Hef’s lawyer dispatched his assistant to the Playboy Mansion approximately three weeks ago with the final version of the prenuptial agreement for them to sign, a source close to the situation tells RadarOnline.com exclusively.      PHOTOS: Celebs Who Posed For Playboy      “The prenup protects Hugh’s Playboy assets, and it also has specific language about the famous Playboy Mansion. If the couple divorces, or if Hef dies, Crystal would have to vacate the mansion, and has no legal rights to the iconic Holmby Hills estate. Hef wanted to sign the prenup at the house so photographers wouldn’t spot him going into his lawyer’s office,” the source says.      The New Year’s Eve nuptials at the Playboy Mansion was attended by family and a few close friends of the couple.

Her Playboy founder groom, 86, wore a traditional black tuxedo with a pink rose as a boutonniere for their New Year’s Eve wedding ceremony.

The Good, The Bad & The Outrageous      Hugh Hefner And Crystal Harris Marry ||||| If your New Year's resolution was to find more reasons to believe in true love, you'll be thrilled to hear that two of the most romantic public figures in entertainment history have put aside their differences and acknowledged the truth that they are soul mates and meant to be together forever. For richer or ... well, richer. In sickness and in health. Until his death -- which, look, I'm not saying it's going to happen soon, but the odds aren't on his side here -- does them part. I am of course talking about Hugh Hefner and Crystal Harris, who got married at the Playboy mansion on New Year's Eve.      Oh, some might scoff at the fact that he's 86 and she's 26. Some might mention the cruel words about his sexual performance that Harris once confided on Howard Stern's radio show. But it's so incredibly obvious these two are the real deal, despite the bumpy road that led them to the altar.      Hefner and Harris had marriage plans before, but like many young/ancient couples, things fell apart at the last minute. Five days before their lavishly-planned June 2011 garden party wedding before 300 guests, Hefner's blonde Playboy Playmate of the Month for December 2009 had what he described as a \\"change of heart.\\"      At the time, Harris released her own statement, begging for the ex-couple to be left alone:      After much deep reflection and thought I have decided to end my engagement with Hef. I hope the media will give each of us the privacy we deserve during this time.      Interestingly, just days after her statement, a Funny or Die video was released in which Harris not only oh-so-cleverly lampooned the 60-year age gap between her and Hef, she proved her talented skills as a comedic actress, which are impressive indeed and not at all robotic and lifeless.      In a tragic turn for Playboy magazine, the \\"Marrying Hef\\" issue Harris had posed for had to be altered at the last moment with a strategically-placed \\"Runaway Bride\\" sticker.      But perhaps the biggest challenge of all for the couple lay in Hef's sexual abilities, which Crystal Harris told Howard Stern left something to be desired. Specifically, she said the sex “lasted like two seconds,\\" and added,      Then I was just over it. I couldn’t even stay another couple days ... I couldn’t do it. I was like, ‘Ahhh.’ I just, like, walked away.      Thankfully for all of us who were rooting for these crazy kids to make it, she eventually walked right back into his loving embrace. After, presumably, convincing herself that marrying an 86-year-old multi-millionaire was probably worth a sub-par sex life.      As she wrote on Twitter this week,      Today is the day I become Mrs. Hugh Hefner. Feeling very happy, lucky, and blessed.      Indeed, Mrs. Hefner. Enjoy your wonderfully romantic, 100 percent sincere marriage for as long as it lasts! I'm sure you're hoping that won't be too many more years.                        The bride wore a \\"mermaid\\" gown. The groom wore a tux, but quickly changed to his trademark pajamas because it was night-night time.            What do you think of this celebrity marriage? Is there any chance there are ANY real feelings involved?                  Image via Hugh Hefner/Twitter, Playboy ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Okay kiddo, let me tell you a story. There's a man named Hugh Hefner and a woman named Crystal Harris. Hugh is very old, and Crystal is much younger. They decided to get married and signed a special paper called a prenuptial agreement.

Let me get out of the way that we love each other to no end, and communication between us is clear and there are no relationship problems that stem from this or any problems causing this. &amp;#x200B; We both have a busy day. I balance work as well as college and it takes up a big chunk of my daily life, as well as hers. However I always manage to make at least a little time for my girlfriend in the evening and spend a few hours with her since it is easier for me to visit her than vice versa. We are not independent just yet, so that means when I go visit her I also see her siblings (both of which are pleasant, don't get me wrong). &amp;#x200B; The problem lies with how her 3 year old brother gets. Every time I visit, he's either crawled all up on her or between the two of us, and I hardly get time to cuddle or have physical interaction with my SO. It's been this way for a while, and it's starting to annoy me because I don't have a whole lot of time with her, and the time I manage to carve out I spend 2/3 of it with her little brother being the center of attention. I've brought it up to her before and she defends him by saying that he's only 3 and doesn't understand any better. My thinking though is if he doesn't understand any better, why not try to help him understand? Obviously in a way that can be digested easily by a 3 year old.  &amp;#x200B; I get it, I genuinely do. I've had a really young sibling before and it's still fresh in my memory how much of a ball of energy they can be. I've had to explain to her (my sibling) what things are acceptable, and what things aren't (in a really simple/rudimentary and most importantly kind way that got across to her, more or less). But it still irks me a little that no action is taken and it's justified by saying he's 3. I just find it a kinda disheartening that I visit my girlfriend to spend time with her but it gets divided between me and someone that already sees her far more often than I do, but at the same time I feel invalidated because he's just a 3 year old and naturally wants to spend time with his sister.

Please answer the following question: Q: Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop what?    Choices:  - sensitivity  - allergy  - autonomy  - immunity  A: Answer:","output":"Vaccination is the process of exposing a person to pathogens on purpose so the person will develop immunity. A more detailed answer: Vaccination, also known as immunization, is a medical intervention that aims to protect individuals from infectious diseases by purposefully exposing their immune system to harmless or weakened parts of a specific pathogen. This exposure allows the immune system to recognize and remember the pathogen's threat, preparing it to respond more effectively and rapidly in the event of future encounters with the actual disease-causing microorganism. The primary function of vaccinations is to confer immunity. Immunity is the state in which an individual's immune system possesses enough knowledge and resources to effectively neutralize or eliminate a specific invading pathogen without causing significant harm to the host. This immunity can be categorized into two main types: active and passive. Active immunity is the long-lasting immunity that develops when a person's immune system is stimulated to produce an immune response, either through the natural course of infection or via vaccination. During this process, the immune system generates specialized proteins called antibodies, as well as cellular immunity, involving T cells that \\"remember\\" the pathogen's signature and signal for appropriate immune responses. This long-term memory and enhanced response form the basis of vaccination-based immunity. Passive immunity, on the other hand, is provided by the transfer of pre-formed antibodies, such as through breastfeeding or the administration of immune globulins (antibodies harvested from a pool of donors). This type of immunity is temporary and does not typically provide lasting protection. To sum up, vaccination serves as a preventive and protective measure that allows individuals to develop immunity against specific infectious diseases. By purposefully introducing tiny, harmless parts of pathogens or inactivated toxins into the body, the immune system is stimulated and \\"taught\\" to fight off these harmful invaders, ultimately providing long-term protection and reducing the spread of infectious diseases within communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cannon has had a successful career with the Patriots since being drafted in 2011. As an offensive tackle, his primary role is to protect the quarterback and open running lanes for the running backs. He is a crucial part of the Patriots' offensive line, which plays a significant role in the team's success. At Texas Christian University, Cannon was a standout player who demonstrated excellent athleticism and skill. As a Horned Frog, he contributed to the team's success both on and off the field.

Title: Harry Brown Movie plot: Harry Brown is an elderly pensioner who was once a decorated soldier in the Royal Marines, and a veteran of Northern Ireland. He lives on a London council estate ruled by violent gangs and spends most of his time playing chess with his friend, Len Attwell, at a local pub owned by Sid Rourke. When the hospital phones to tell him that his wife, Kath, is dying, Harry is too late because he is scared to take a shortcut through a narrow underpass, where a gang holds court. His wife is laid to rest next to the grave of their thirteen-year-old daughter, Rachel, who died in 1973. Len confides to Harry that he is being terrorized by youths and shows him an old bayonet he now carries to defend himself; with the police unable to help, he plans to confront his harassers himself. The next day, Harry is visited by Detective Inspector Alice Frampton and Detective Sergeant Terry Hicock, who tell him that Len has been murdered. The police arrest Noel Winters, the leader of a drug-dealing gang, along with members Carl, Dean and Marky, but are released due to lack of evidence. Harry gets drunk after Len's funeral, and is then held at knife-point by Dean, who intends to rob him; Harry kills Dean with his own knife during a brief struggle. Frampton visits Harry in the morning to inform him that because Len was killed with his own bayonet, any charges could be reduced to manslaughter on the basis of self-defense, leaving Harry feeling angry and betrayed. Harry follows a drug dealer, Kenny, to a den where he negotiates to buy a pistol. Inside, Harry finds Kenny and his associate, Stretch, growing cannabis and sexually abusing an overdosing girl to make pornographic films. Harry kills the dealers before burning down their den, fleeing with the girl and a bag of firearms in a stolen Land Rover. He leaves the girl outside a hospital, and later follows Marky to find him being sexually abused by Troy Martindale, a heroin smuggler that supplies drugs to the gang.

Pleated pants may add some volume, but can puff up and look strange when you sit.  Skinny jeans or tapered pants will make your legs look like toothpicks and should be avoided.  Flared or boot-cut pants may disguise a skinny calf, but they tend to look sloppy on men. Though you may think that baggy or big clothes are disguising your thin legs, it's actually calling attention to them.

A huge belt or belt buckle may overwhelm your lower half. Instead, try an eye-catching pattern on your shirt or tie to draw attention away from your legs. Pinstripes are a no-no since they'll only make your legs look longer and skinnier.

According to the article, it is advisable to select pants that are semi-fitted at the thigh area and follow the line of the calf without clinging tightly to it. Pleated pants may provide some extra volume, but can appear strange and puffy, especially when sitting. Skinny jeans and tapered pants should be avoided as they tend to make the legs look like toothpicks. Flared or boot-cut pants can hide thin calves, but might appear sloppy on some men. Wearing overly baggy or oversized clothes can actually draw more attention to the thin legs instead of hiding them. The article also highlights that choosing the appropriate size and avoiding excessively large belts or belt buckles can prevent the lower half from looking overwhelmed. Instead, it is suggested to wear an eye-catching pattern on the shirt or tie in order to divert the focus away from the legs. Pinstripes should be avoided, as they can make the legs appear longer and skinnier. When it comes to color selection, dark colors have a slimming effect. Therefore, light-colored jeans and trousers, such as light gray, beige, or khaki, should be chosen rather than black. Additionally, the proper jacket length can help balance the leg proportions.

When one of the bottles begins to emit an eerie supernatural glow, Mears tells Petrie \\"They've found us again.\\" Knowing an evil presence is there, they decide to fight it. Two years earlier, in the small town of Salem's Lot (formally known as Jerusalem's Lot) in Maine in the United States, Ben Mears, an author, has returned to the town after a long absence to write a book about the Marsten House, an ominous old property on a hilltop which has a reputation for being haunted. Mears attempts to rent the house but finds that another new arrival in town, the mysterious Richard Straker (James Mason), has recently bought it. Straker also opens an antique shop with his oft-mentioned but always absent business partner, Kurt Barlow. Meanwhile, Mears moves into a boarding house in town run by Eva Miller (Marie Windsor), and develops a romantic relationship with a local woman, Susan Norton (Bonnie Bedelia). He befriends Susan's father, Dr. Bill Norton (Ed Flanders), and also renews his old friendship with his former school teacher, Jason Burke (Lew Ayres). Mears tells Burke that he feels the Marsten House is somehow inherently evil, and recalls how he was once traumatized inside the house when he was a child. After a large crate is delivered to the Marsten House one night, an increasing number of the townsfolk begin to disappear or die in strange circumstances. Both Mears and Straker are initially the main suspects as they are new in town, but it becomes clear that the crate contained Straker's mysterious business partner, Kurt Barlow (Reggie Nalder), an ancient master vampire who has come to the town after having sent Straker to make way for his arrival.

At his memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, a reporter tries to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him, with little success.During the First World War, Lawrence is a misfit British Army lieutenant stationed in Cairo, notable for his insolence and knowledge. Over the objections of General Murray (Donald Wolfit), he is sent by Mr. Dryden (Claude Rains) of the Arab Bureau to assess the prospects of Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) in his revolt against the Turks.On the journey, his Bedouin guide is killed by Sherif Ali (Omar Sharif) for drinking from a well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton (Anthony Quayle), who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment of Faisal's camp, and leave. Lawrence promptly ignores Brighton's commands when he meets Faisal. His knowledge and outspokenness pique the Prince's interest.Brighton advises Faisal to retreat to Yenbo after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring surprise attack on Aqaba which, if successful, would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. While strongly fortified against a naval assault, the town is lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Two teenage orphans, Daud (John Dimech) and Farraj (Michel Ray), attach themselves to Lawrence as his servants.They cross the Nefud Desert, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water.

With an Air-Kiss, Donald Trump Shows His Softer Side CLEVELAND — On most occasions when Donald J. Trump takes the stage, he exudes an air of unrivaled authority, dispatching protesters with the wave of a hand, clenching his fists for effect and, if necessary, squashing bugs that intrude on his air space. But during the third evening of the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night, Mr. Trump briefly cast away his tough image and gave a glimpse of his softer side. After Gov. Mike Pence, his running mate, spent nearly 30 minutes singing Mr. Trump’s praises, the Republican nominee appeared on the stage and extended his right arm for an embrace. The handshake morphed into a half-hug and then became something rarely seen among men in the political arena: an awkward air-kiss, initiated by Mr. Trump. Mr. Pence, a conservative from Indiana, initially seemed to pull away before giving a hearty laugh and a squeeze on the forearm. kiss, awkward, trump, donald trump, mike pence, awkward kiss, germaphobe #gif #meme #trendingmeme pic.twitter.com/xBtGMCbTpz Images of the exchange swirled around the internet, offering some levity in an evening that was otherwise consumed by the widening fissures of discord within the Republican Party. For body language experts, the moment was a sign of progress in the staid world of political backslapping. “It shows a completely different side to Trump,” said Lillian Glass, an authority on the psychology of human behavior and author of “The Body Language Advantage.” “It was a more loving, more affectionate, more caring side.” She added, “It shows he’s not afraid to express his emotions publicly, and he wasn’t afraid to kiss another man.” There have been suggestions that Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence lack chemistry since they teamed up just over a week ago. However, the air-kiss appeared to be a sign that the Republican nominee was happy with his choice and appreciated how Mr. Pence vigorously defended his candidacy, particularly after Senator Ted Cruz’s lack of endorsement. “At a nonconscious level, Trump likely feels an unusually strong familial connection with the vice-presidential nominee,” said Kevin Hogan, another body language expert. “His brash demeanor took a side to what his true feelings are, which is likely to be deep appreciation, a moment of being rescued and an almost brotherly feeling toward his newest best friend.” Despite being notoriously anxious about germs, Mr. Trump is not a stranger to public displays of affection. In 2000, he kissed Rudolph W. Giuliani, then the mayor of New York, who was dressed in drag for a skit. And he liberally gives out encouraging pats on the shoulder to strangers during his campaign travels. Ruth Sherman, a public speaking and presentation consultant, said that Mr. Trump’s comfort with air-kissing could be a cultural thing, harkening to his time working in the entertainment industry. The hesitant response from Mr. Pence, she said, was a sign that the ticket still needed time to mesh. “We both know that’s the way the celebrity crowd rolls in N.Y.C. and which Trump inhabits,” Ms. Sherman said. “Indiana, I would surmise, has an altogether different vibe.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text are: 1.

Natalie Cole's search for a new kidney ended this week when someone with a compatible organ died and their family asked that it be given to the singer, according to the organ procurement group that handled the donation. Natalie Cole received a kidney transplant Tuesday in Los Angeles. Cole, who underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles Tuesday, was \\"responding well and recuperating\\" Thursday, her publicist said. Cole had been on what she called \\"a very long list\\" of people waiting for an organ donation when she got word recently that OneLegacy, an organ procurement agency in Southern California, had a kidney that was a biological match. It was a \\"directed donation\\" from a deceased organ donor, according to OneLegacy CEO Tom Mone. \\"Having heard of Ms. Cole's need for a kidney, the family asked that one of their loved one's kidneys be transplanted to Ms. Cole if they were a match,\\" Mone said. Directed organ donations are rare, and rarer still are those directed to someone not related to or known personally by the deceased, he said. The donor will remain anonymous until the family gives permission for the name to be made public, he said. Cole's need for a kidney donation was highly publicized, including with an appearance on CNN's \\"Larry King Live\\" on March 31. \\"I'm on a very long list, which is why we are looking to donors,\\" said Cole, the daughter of legendary crooner Nat King Cole. Cole said her kidney troubles date to February 2008 when she was diagnosed with Hepatitis C. Cole said she attributes the Hepatitis C to her well-publicized struggles to stop using cocaine and heroin. Cole said she has been sober for some time now after two stints in a rehabilitation clinic. Cole said she underwent chemotherapy in an aggressive way to fight the virus. Within four months of getting chemotherapy, both of Cole's kidneys failed. \\"I couldn't breathe. I -- I went into -- literally, my kidneys stopped functioning. They stopped, you know, processing the fluid that was starting to build up in my body.\\" Since then Cole has been on dialysis three days a week and has been searching for a kidney, she told King in one of the first public interviews about the issue. Cole won six Grammys for her 1991 critically acclaimed album \\"Unforgettable: With Love,\\" a jazzy tribute to her father. She won a Grammy this year for her new album \\"Still Unforgettable\\" and another Grammy for her work on another album. Cole was still able to tour this year even with her kidney ailment. She canceled a planned show last week in South Korea because of her illness, which meant she was in Los Angeles when the organ became available. \\"I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's -- it's amazing,\\" Cole said. During King's show, dozens of people sent e-mails to CNN telling Cole that they would get tested to see if their kidney could be donated. King handed a thick stack of paper to Cole. \\"These are all e-mails from dozens -- dozens of people offering to be tested to see if they can match, who want to give you a kidney,\\" King said. Cole stared at the papers for a moment. \\"There are some great human beings out there. That's all I can say,\\" Cole said. Cole is expected to return to the tour after three to four months of recovery. CNN's Denise Quan contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Natalie Cole, a renowned singer, underwent a successful kidney transplant at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.

Cole's kidney troubles began in February 2008, following her diagnosis with Hepatitis C, which she attributes to her previous struggles with cocaine and heroin addiction. During her battle with the illness, both of her kidneys failed, resulting in her reliance on dialysis three days a week.

The review specifically mentions \\"too many tried-and-true shenanigans\\" which implies that the movie relies heavily on clichés and recycled jokes, causing it to lack originality. Additionally, the critic states that these elements \\"hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy,\\" suggesting that the movie is not memorable or unique in its category. Negative movie reviews typically express disappointment about aspects of the film, such as its plot, characters, or overall quality. In this case, the critic is not impressed with the movie's reliance on familiar comedic elements and its inability to stand out from similar films in the genre. As a result, it would be reasonable to assume that the critic did not enjoy the movie and would not highly recommend it to others. To summarize, the critic's opinion of the movie can be classified as negative due to the criticism of the film's overused comedic elements and its inability to differentiate itself from other movies in the teen comedy genre."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Sunday held its first parliamentary elections under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, who was expected to use the polls and a newly elected legislature to elevate officials loyal to him and further consolidate his power.      North Korea’s Supreme People’s Assembly has served as a rubber-stamp Parliament, endorsing whatever decisions were made by the top leader and his inner circles, who dominate the top echelons of the ruling Workers’ Party, the People’s Army and the government.      In the last parliamentary election, held five years ago when Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Jong-il, was still alive, a single candidate ran unopposed in each of the 687 districts, and all the deputies were elected with 100 percent support. The government reported voter turnout of 99.98 percent.      The North Korean authorities run parliamentary elections as an effective political census, a chance to check up on the whereabouts and the political allegiance of citizens, as well as the ability of local Workers’ Party officials to mobilize residents. People pile into voting booths casting unmarked ballots in rapid succession. Those who oppose the state-selected candidate are supposedly allowed to pause to cross out the candidate’s name, effectively making the process a monitored event, according to defectors from the North.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Some of the North Koreans who entered China and ended up defecting to South Korea after the famine in their home country in the mid-1990s have said they did so because they feared punishment back home for failing to show up for parliamentary elections. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption North Korean leader Kim Jong-un voted in Pyongyang      North Koreans have been voting in a five-yearly election to approve members of the rubber-stamp parliament, the Supreme People's Assembly.      Each of the 687 districts had only one candidate running for office, with electors required to write only \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\" on the ballot paper.      Campaign posters across the capital, Pyongyang, urged a \\"Yes\\" vote.      Observers say the candidate list is an opportunity to see who is in or out of favour with the leadership.      Analysis The North Korean vote is a ritual, the result of which has already been largely determined. The Supreme People's Assembly meets rarely and has very little power but you would not know it from the official turnout. There is only one candidate for each district, and one name on each ballot paper. The democratic duty for the electorate is simply to write \\"Yes\\" beside it. Writing anything else might be seen as treachery, rather than democracy. That is especially true if you live in the district of Mount Paekdu - the constituency of current North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un. State media have devoted entire reports to the excitement of voters at the Mount Paekdu polling station, on seeing his name on the ballot paper. The only real value in these polls, analysts say, is in watching for any signs of change in the list of state-approved candidates.      In the last election in 2009, turnout was 99%, with 100% of votes in favour of the given candidates.      The election is the first to be held under the leadership of Kim Jong-un, who came to power in December 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong-il.      Mr Kim was registered as a candidate in Mount Paekdu, venerated in party propaganda as the birthplace of Kim Jong-il.      The leader was shown on state media casting his ballot in Pyongyang.      The vote was held in a holiday atmosphere in the capital, Pyongyang, with performances taking place in the street.      \\"Through this election we will fully display the might of the single-hearted unity of our army and people,\\" said Hyon Byong-chol, chairman of a preparatory committee for one of the sub-districts in the election.      He told the Associated Press news agency that North Koreans were \\"firmly united\\" behind their leader.      Pyongyang resident Ri Song-gun told AP he had cast his vote of approval for his district's candidate.      Image copyright AP Image caption The election is the first to be held under the leadership of Kim Jong-un      Image copyright AP Image caption Voters queued to cast their ballots - but there was only one choice on the ballot paper      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Voting 'yes' to the named candidate is seen as the electorate's duty      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Entertainment was laid on in the streets of the capital, and voters were encouraged to celebrate      \\"I will devote all my intelligence and strength to fortify our socialist system centred on the masses, which was built and developed by our great generalissimos,\\" he said.      The vote comes three months after the brutal and sudden execution of Mr Kim's once-powerful uncle, Chang Song-thaek.      North Korea announced on 13 December it had executed Chang after convicting him of \\"acts of treachery\\". ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

He loved both ranges, but liked the caves systems and blue holes in the Ozarks a bit more.  Answer the following question: Which mountains have more caves?","output":"Based on the given background and situation, I will analyze the information step-by-step to determine which mountains have more caves: 1. The background states that most cave systems are through limestone bedrock because of its solubility in water and weak acid solutions, leading to karst landscapes. 2. In the situation, Peter visited the Ozarks in Missouri and the Colorado Rockies last summer. 3. Peter loved both mountain ranges but enjoyed the cave systems and blue holes in the Ozarks more. From the given information, we can infer that the Ozarks have more caves since it has karst landscapes, and limestone is the primary bedrock associated with cave formation. Also, Peter's preference for the cave systems and blue holes in the Ozarks over the Colorado Rockies further suggests that the Ozarks have a more complex and abundant cave system. Therefore, the Ozarks have more caves than the Colorado Rockies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: If you've read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much (as I did) that you just have to see the movie, understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Vonngut's writing - that beyond his story lies Vonnegut himself, and that you can't put a human mind on the screen. His whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance. I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Vonnegut poses in his book, but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen. Does this mean that the movie misses the mark? Of course not. In my opinion, the movie succeeds because it does not try to recreate the experience of reading the book (this is not a medium for those too lazy to turn a page). It succeeds because it takes the fundamental elements of a story created by one of America's true artistic treasures and presents it in a a framework without pretense. I've seen other movie versions of Vonnegut books where the director obviously tries to channel Vonnegut's genius and loses grip on his own craft. I would not place this movie as one of the best I've seen, but it stands on its own legs as one well worth watching. By taking Vonnegut's \\"voice\\" out of the movie's narration or trying to insert it however it can, Mother Night tells his story brilliantly, and preserves the story's fundamental lessons without confusion, distraction, or disappointment.","output":"This review is saying that the person liked both the book \\"Mother Night\\" and the movie version, but they think they are different. The writer enjoyed the movie because it didn't try to copy the book exactly, but instead focused on telling the story in a good way for a movie. The person thinks the movie is worth watching, even though it's not the best movie they've ever seen. So the sentiment of this review is mainly positive, as they liked the movie and thought it did a good job with the book's story."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from: (1). follicles.

Mayor Willie Brown last Wednesday ordered San Francisco Public Library officials to allow John O'Connor to read to preschool children to get them interested in books and stop them from watching television and video games. \\"I didn't expect this kind of attention. \\" John said, \\"It's just shocking.\\" John has chosen his first book, \\"The King's Giraffe\\", and made up fliers inviting neighborhood children, aged from three to six, to the Presidio Branch every Wednesday afternoon. He planned to call himself the \\"Reading Wizard\\" and wear a special hat, fake glasses and a black coat. But his idea was refused - on the phone, in person and finally with a letter from Toni Bernardi, the chief of the library's children and youth services. Using terms like \\"age appropriate material\\" ,she wrote that only library workers are allowed to read to children. John then went to a member of the city board of supervisors , who advised him to write letters to the library officials. \\"Our libraries are supposed to turn kids on, not to turn them off.\\" Brown said he enjoyed \\"the creative idea, the sense of civic duty and the caring for others that John clearly showed us.\\" By dressing up as a wizard, the boy probably hoped to_.

By choosing to dress up as a wizard, complete with a special hat, fake glasses, and a black coat, John's primary goal was to attract the children's attention and make the reading sessions more enjoyable and engaging. The wizard costume, along with John's enthusiasm and passion for reading, would create an interactive and magical environment, encouraging the children to participate actively in the sessions and develop an interest in reading from a young age. This creative approach not only demonstrates John's concern for the younger generation's education but also highlights the importance of making reading fun and accessible to children. Unfortunately, John's idea was initially rejected by the library on the grounds that only library workers were allowed to read to children. However, with the intervention of Mayor Willie Brown, who recognized John's creativity, sense of civic duty, and caring for others, the young \\"Reading Wizard\\" was ultimately granted permission to read to preschool children at the Presidio Branch Library. In conclusion, dressing up as a wizard was a creative way for John to attract children's attention during the reading sessions. His ultimate goal was to help younger kids develop a love for reading and get them excited about exploring the world of books, and his imaginative approach was a clever way to achieve this objective."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence.  Step 1: Understand the sentences. The first sentence states that Shannon is being led to believe that someone or a group is backing down. The second sentence suggests that there's intent to deceive Shannon into thinking that he has been given up on, for the purpose of surprising him. Step 2: Compare the details in each sentence. The first sentence offers no information about surprising Shannon or an agenda to make him think he has been given up on, it merely presents the idea that Shannon thinks someone is backing down. The second sentence adds new details not present in the first one– specifically the motivation of deception and surprise.  Step 3: Determine entailment. Entailment in linguistics means that the truth of one sentence guarantees the truth of another. Here, the truth of the second sentence (their desire to surprise Shannon by making him think they've given up on him) is not guaranteed by the truth of the first sentence (Shannon thinking someone backs down).

The path to becoming a vicar is long, and the job itself is extremely demanding.","output":"Step 1: Research the role of a vicar Before you embark on the journey to become a vicar, it is crucial to understand the responsibilities and expectations that come with this role. This may involve talking to current vicars, reading books or articles about their experiences, or attending seminars to deepen your understanding of the position. Step 2: Assess personal motivations and commitment Reflect on your reasons for wanting to become a vicar and ensure that you possess a strong, deep-rooted sense of calling and passion for ministry. As the job is demanding, it is crucial to be certain about your commitment to the role before embarking on this journey. Step 3: Complete necessary educational requirements To be eligible for ordination in most denominations, aspiring vicars must hold a bachelor's degree and a professional degree in divinity, theology or a related field. Ensure that you complete these educational prerequisites to increase your chances of being accepted into a seminary or a program leading to ordination. Step 4: Attend a seminary or training program Find a suitable seminary or training program that aligns with your beliefs and values, and that will provide you with the theological and pastoral education necessary to become a vicar. This may involve attending an accredited institution affiliated with your denomination, or completing a specialized training program that focuses on preparing candidates for ordained ministry. Step 5: Participate in supervised ministry experiences Many seminaries and training programs require aspiring vicars to complete field education or internships in a church or other ministry setting. These supervised ministry experiences provide an opportunity to apply the knowledge and skills learned in the classroom while gaining practical experience in a real-world context. Step 6: Seek ordination from your denomination Upon completion of your theological education and supervised ministry experiences, approach the governing body of your denomination to seek ordination. Each denomination has its own specific requirements and processes for ordination, so it is important to be familiar with these details and complete any necessary steps. Step 7: Find a position as a vicar Once you are ordained, you can begin searching for a position as a vicar within your denomination. Networking with other clergy members, attending conferences and staying connected with your seminary or training program can help increase your chances of finding an available position. Step 8: Continue to develop professionally and spiritually As a vicar, it is important to prioritize your own spiritual growth and professional development to better serve your congregation. Take advantage of opportunities for continuing education, attend workshops and conferences, and engage in regular spiritual practices to remain connected to your faith and growth as a leader."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We are required to show that ( |z^{2n} - 1| ) is rational for any integer ( n ). 4. We compute ( z^{2n} - 1 ): [ z^{2n} = (cos theta + i sin theta)^{2n} ] 5.

Next, apply the triangle inequality theorem which states that for any triangle with sides of lengths ( x, y, ) and ( z ), the following inequalities must hold: [ x + y > z ] [ x + z > y ] [ y + z > x ] 6. Substitute ( x = a ), ( y = a ), and ( z = 2a ): [ a + a > 2a quad Rightarrow quad 2a > 2a quad Rightarrow quad False ] [ a + 2a > a quad Rightarrow quad 3a > a quad Rightarrow quad True ] [ a + 2a > a quad Rightarrow quad 3a > a quad Rightarrow quad True ] 7. Since the first inequality ( 2a > 2a ) is false, the triangle inequality conditions are not satisfied. Therefore, a triangle with sides ( a, a, ) and ( 2a ) cannot exist. # Conclusion: Based on the analysis above, it is not necessary that a contour of a triangle can be formed from these four sticks, as the triangle inequality is not satisfied for ( a, a, ) and ( 2a ).

For the function y = log_{0.3}(t) to be defined, t must be greater than zero. Therefore, we have: 0 < -x^2 + 4x. This implies that x^2 - 4x < 0. To find the interval where this inequality holds true, we factor x from the expression: x(4 - x) > 0. By analyzing this inequality, we deduce that the solution is 0 < x < 4. Hence, the domain of the function is (0,4). Now, let us return to the function y = log_{0.3}(t) and find its interval of increase. Since the base of the logarithm, 0.3, is less than 1, the function y = log_{0.3}(t) is decreasing for increasing t. Using the properties of quadratic functions, we can rewrite t as: t = 4 - (x - 2)^2. Since t reaches its maximum value when (x-2)^2 is at its minimum (which is zero), the decreasing interval for t corresponds to an increasing interval for y. As (x - 2)^2 geq 0 for all real x, the function t decreases as x moves away from 2. Therefore, the interval of decrease for t (which corresponds to the interval of increase for y) on the domain (0,4) is [2,4).

Since each vertex must be the color of the majority of the three vertices adjacent to it, a red vertex must have at least 2 red neighbors. - This implies that there must be a face of the cube (which is a square) where at least 3 out of the 4 vertices are red. - If only 3 vertices on the face are red, the 4th vertex on the face, adjacent to all three red vertices, must also be red to satisfy the condition. - Therefore, one entire face of the cube must be red (all 4 vertices on this face are red). 3. **Opposite Face Must Be the Other Color** - Since each edge of the cube connects exactly one vertex on the red face to one vertex not on the red face, and the vertices not on the red face must be a majority, the vertices on the face opposite to the red face must be blue. - By symmetry, if one face is colored entirely red, the opposite face must be colored entirely blue (all four vertices on this face are blue). 4. **Counting the Valid Configurations** - A cube has 6 faces. - We have already counted 2 ways of coloring when all vertices are the same color. - For the remaining configurations where one face is entirely red and the opposite face is entirely blue, there are 6 such valid pairings because there are 6 faces. 5. **Total Number of Valid Colorings** - Add the 2 ways where all vertices are the same color, to the 6 ways where one face is red and the opposite face is blue: [ 2 + 6 = 8 ] 6. **Conclusion** - The total number of ways to color the vertices of a cube such that the color of each vertex is the color of the majority of the three vertices adjacent to it is: [ boxed{8} ]"},{"instruction":"A line l passes through the point (5,4) with a direction vector of (1,2), then () A: The pointslope form of line l is y5=2(x4) B: The slopeintercept form of line l is x=frac{1}{2}y+3 C: The intercept form of line l is frac{x}{6}frac{y}{3}=1 D: The general form of line l is 2xy6=0","output":"Given that a line l passes through the point (5,4) with a direction vector of (1,2), we can determine the characteristics of this line. 1. **Finding the Slope**: The direction vector (1,2) indicates how the line moves in the x and y directions.

Therefore, the slope m of line l is given by the ratio of the change in y to the change in x, which is 2. 2. **Point-Slope Form**: With the slope m = 2 and a point (5,4) through which the line passes, we can use the point-slope form equation of a line, y - y_1 = m(x - x_1), where (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line.

We propose the smallest value of ( lambda = frac{2015}{6} ). # Verification that ( lambda = frac{2015}{6} ) meets the conditions: Special cases: 1. **If the line ( l ) has at most one rational point**, then we simply let ( beta(l) = 1 ). 2. **If the line ( l ) is one of the coordinate axes**, it does not contain any points from the set ( A_{m} ).

The length of the other train is approximately 350.04 metres. What is the speed of the second train?","output":"To find the speed of the second train, we first need to determine the relative speed at which the two trains cross each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed. The speed of the first train is given as 120 kmph. We need to convert this speed into meters per second (m/s) because the length of the trains is given in meters and the time in seconds. To convert kmph to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 kmph = 1000 m / 3600 s = 5/18 m/s. So, the speed of the first train in m/s is: 120 kmph * (5/18) m/s/kmph = (120 * 5) / 18 m/s = 600 / 18 m/s = 33.33 m/s (approximately). The total length of the two trains is 150 metres + 350.04 metres = 500.04 metres. They cross each other in 9 seconds, so the relative speed (Vr) is the total distance divided by the time taken: Vr = Total distance / Time = 500.04 metres / 9 seconds ≈ 55.56 m/s. Now, we have the relative speed and the speed of the first train. We can find the speed of the second train (V2) by subtracting the speed of the first train from the relative speed: Vr = V1 + V2 55.56 m/s = 33.33 m/s + V2 V2 = 55.56 m/s - 33.33 m/s V2 ≈ 22.23 m/s. Now, we convert the speed of the second train back to kmph: V2 = 22.23 m/s * (18/5) kmph/m/s ≈ (22.23 * 18) / 5 kmph ≈ 399.14 / 5 kmph ≈ 79.83 kmph.

This similarity arises from the shared angle at P and the corresponding cyclic quadrilateral angles: [ angle PAM = angle PNB quad text{and} quad angle P = text{common} ] Therefore, we can also write: [ frac{AM}{BN} = frac{PA}{PN} ] 3. **Combining Ratios**: Multiplying these two ratios derived from the similar triangles, we get: [ frac{AM cdot BM}{AN cdot BN} = frac{PB}{PN} cdot frac{PA}{PN} = frac{PA cdot PB}{PN^2} ] Next, express PM and a in terms of the chord length and radius. Given PM = a = text{constant, since P is a fixed point. If the radius of the circle is R, the following holds due to the Power of a Point Theorem: [ PA cdot PB = P M^2 - P N^2 ] Given PM = a and P is a fixed point, we have: [ PL = 2R ] So: ] PA cdot PB = frac{a cdot PN}{R}= frac{PN^2}{PAcdot PB} This can be deduced by a simple calculation combining all these relations. Hence, we have: [ PA cdot PB = aR ] Hence the final relation looks like. Conclusion: Thus: [ frac{AM cdot BM}{AN cdot BN} = text {constant as derived above} Therefore, the constant value is indeed boxed{frac{a}{R}}"},{"instruction":"Choose two different numbers simultaneously and at random from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8}.

Consider when the difference is at least 1: [ frac{(n+1)^2}{2005} - frac{n^2}{2005} geq 1. ] Simplifying the inequality, we get: [ frac{n^2 + 2n + 1 - n^2}{2005} geq 1, ] which further simplifies to: [ frac{2n + 1}{2005} geq 1. ] Multiplying through by 2005, we have: [ 2n + 1 geq 2005, ] which implies: [ n geq frac{2004}{2} = 1002. ] 5. Therefore, for ( n geq 1002 ), the floor values are distinct for each successive n, resulting in 2005 - 1002 + 1 = 1004 distinct values. 6. Next, consider when frac{(n+1)^2}{2005} - frac{n^2}{2005} < 1: [ n leq 1001. ] In this range, successive floor values either differ by 1 or are the same. 7. The largest floor value in this range is: [ leftlfloor frac{n^2}{2005} rightrfloor quad text{when} quad n = 1001, ] giving us: [ leftlfloor frac{1001^2}{2005} rightrfloor + 1 = 500. ] 8.

Consider a square sheet of paper with n non-overlapping rectangles each with sides parallel to the sides of the sheet. **Objective:** Prove that after cutting out all the rectangles, the number of pieces of the remaining part of the paper is at most n+1. 2. Each piece of the remaining sheet of paper can be described as a rectangle with four vertices (corners). Each vertex is a right angle of either 90^circ or 270^circ. **Observation:** - Let k be the number of pieces the remaining part of the sheet breaks down into after cutting out the n rectangles. - Therefore, each of these k pieces has exactly 4 vertices (corners). 3. After cutting out the n rectangles, each piece that remains can only have vertices as follows: - Each vertex on the boundary of the remaining pieces must come either from the original boundary of the sheet or be a corner where exactly two rectangles meet at a right angle. **Counting Vertices:** - For each of the k remaining pieces, there are 4 vertices. - Thus, the total number of vertices is 4k. 4. Now consider the source of vertices: - There are 4n corners due to the n rectangles. - There are additional 4 vertices from the original square sheet of paper. **Total vertices available:** - In total, we have 4n + 4 vertices. 5.

The grid is symmetric about one of its diagonals, and each row contains all numbers from 1 to 101 exactly once. 2. **Symmetry Implication:** Since the grid is symmetric about one of its diagonals, it implies that for any cell (i, j), the corresponding cell (j, i) contains the same value. Hence, the entries are mirrored across the diagonal. 3. **Count numbers in off-diagonal cells:** Outside the diagonal, every number from 1 to 101 appears twice. This is because for every cell (i, j), the cell (j, i) will mirror it, resulting in pairs of the same numbers due to symmetry. 4. **Implications for the diagonal:** The diagonal itself consists of 101 cells. Let’s denote these cells as (1,1), (2,2), ldots, (101, 101). The values on this diagonal must account for the numbers 1 to 101 since every row (and thus every set of symmetric entries) must contain each of these numbers exactly once. 5. **Even and odd frequency of numbers:** Outside the diagonal, every number appears an even number of times because of the symmetry as argued in step 3. Inside the diagonal, each of the 101 numbers must appear an odd number of times. Since we have exactly 101 spaces filled with numbers 1 to 101, and each number cannot appear more than once in any row, these placements on the diagonal must be filled with each number exactly once. 6. **Conclusion:** There must be no repetition of any number along the diagonal because our tally of 101 uniquely placed numbers exactly fits the 101 diagonal positions when each number appears exactly once. This confirms the diagonal contains each number from 1 to 101 exactly once and no number appears more than once on the diagonal.

Hence, every pirate will obtain 0.01 times the total sum Z (as each pirate gets frac{0.01 Z}{100} from each of the 100 pirates): [ text{Gold in left pocket (for any pirate)} = 0.01 Z ] 5. **Transfer Proportional Gain:** Now, every winning pirate is required to collect 0.01 times their win from all other pirates. Let’s denote the win of the pirate j as W_j. Each pirate (including the winner themselves) will give 0.01 times the win equally from their left pocket. Thus, the amount of gold given by each pirate k to pirate j is: [ frac{0.01 W_j}{100} ] Considering all the pirates including themselves, the total gold collected by pirate j would be: [ 0.01 W_j ] 6. **Resulting Gold Distribution:** After the transactions, the left pockets of all pirates reset to zero. Consequently, the total gold in the right pocket of any pirate: - For a losing pirate, it reduces exactly by their loss L_i. - For a winning pirate, it increases exactly by their win W_j. # Conclusion: By iterating these operations, it can be ensured that the amounts every pirate has in their right pocket will represent correctly their proportional gains or losses from the game: [ boxed{text{The operations ensure that each pirate receives their net winnings or pays their net losses correctly.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=xaln x (ain mathbb{R}).

The sum of the smallest seven numbers involving (a_{1}) must be positive: [ a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{7} > 0. ] Since (a_{8} < frac{4}{3}), the sum of the remaining terms (excluding (a_{1})) must adjust accordingly: [ a_{1} + 6 cdot frac{4}{21} = frac{c + 8}{7} > 0. ] Rearranging, we find: [ a_{1} > -6 cdot frac{4}{3} = -8. ] 5. **Example Construction:** To validate that (a_{1}) can take any value within the derived range, we consider: [ a_{2} = a_{3} = cdots = a_{8} = frac{4}{21} - frac{a_{1}}{7}. ] Check for correctness: begin{align*} a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{8} & = a_{1} + 7 left(frac{4}{21} - frac{a_{1}}{7}right) & = a_{1} + frac{28}{21} - a_{1} = frac{28}{21} = frac{4}{3}. end{align*} We also ensure: [ a_{1} leq frac{4}{21} - frac{a_{1}}{7} Rightarrow 8a_{1} leq frac{4}{3}. ] Rearranging gives: [ c leq frac{1}{6}. ] Finally: [ a_{1} + cdots + a_{7} = a_{1} + 6 left( frac{4}{21} - frac{a_{1}}{7} right) = frac{c+8}{7} > 0. ] # Conclusion: The possible values for (a_{1}) are: [ boxed{-8<a_{1} leq frac{1}{6}} ]"},{"instruction":"A right circular cone has a volume of 18pi cubic centimeters.

Therefore, it follows that: [ O text{ lies on the line that is defined by } (q^2 - r^2)AX^2 + (r^2 - p^2)BX^2 + (p^2 - q^2)CX^2 = 0. ] 4. **Conclusion - Line Through M and N:** Given that M, N, and O satisfy the same distance relationship and lie on the same described line, we can conclude that the line MN must pass through the center O of the circumcircle of triangle ABC. Thus, we have shown step-by-step that the line connecting points M and N must pass through the center O of the circumcircle of triangle triangle ABC based on the given ratios.

We need to show that this product is not a perfect power. 4. **Prime Divisibility:** - Note that ( p equiv 2 pmod{3} ). By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( p mid i^3 + 2018^3 ) if and only if ( p mid i + 2018 ). This is because ( x^3 equiv -2018^3 pmod{p} ) implies ( x equiv -2018 pmod{p} ). 5. **Valuation Argument:** - We need to show that ( nu_p left( prod_{i=1}^{m} (i^3 + 2018^3) right) = 1 ).

However, since ( j ) ranges from ( p - 2019 + 1 ) to ( p - 2019 + m ), we have: [ p - 2018 leq j leq p - 2019 + m ] This implies: [ p - 2018 leq j leq p - 2019 + m ] Since ( p > max(m, 2019) ), it follows that ( p - 2018 ) is the only value in this range that satisfies ( p mid j + 2018 ). 7. **Conclusion:** - Therefore, ( p ) divides exactly one term in the product ( prod_{i=1}^{m} (i^3 + 2018^3) ), and the ( p )-adic valuation of the product is 1.

For (a+2) to be a divisor of (a(a+1)), (a+2) must divide (a(a+1)). However, for any integer (a), (a+2) is not a divisor of (a(a+1)) because (a+2) is not a factor of either (a) or (a+1). This leads to a contradiction. Therefore, there is no such set for ( n = 3 ). 2. **Show that there always exists a set for ( n geq 4 ):** Consider the set of ( n ) consecutive integers ({a, a+1, ldots, a+n-1}).

The highest possible power of 2 is 1, and the highest possible power of 3 is also 1. Therefore, ( k_4 ) must be ( 2 times 3 = 6 ).

Dmitry Khramtsov, Ru","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the largest possible number of moves a leopard can make on a (3n times 3n) chequerboard, starting and ending at the same cell, without visiting any cell more than once. The leopard can move one cell up, one cell to the right, or one cell diagonally down-left. 1. **Understanding the Moves**: - Let (r) denote a move to the right. - Let (u) denote a move up. - Let (d) denote a move diagonally down-left. 2. **Constraints on Moves**: - To return to the starting cell, the number of moves to the right ((r)) must equal the number of moves to the left ((d)). - Similarly, the number of moves up ((u)) must equal the number of moves down ((d)). - Therefore, the total number of moves must be a multiple of 3, i.e., (3k) for some integer (k). 3. **Maximum Number of Moves**: - The total number of cells on the board is (9n^2). - Since the leopard cannot visit any cell more than once, the maximum number of moves is (9n^2 - 1) (returning to the starting cell). 4. **Constructing a Path**: - We need to construct a path that uses (9n^2 - 3) moves and returns to the starting cell. - Consider the following construction for (n = 2) and generalize it for larger (n): - The top 2 rows and the left 2 columns remain unchanged in larger constructions. - Stack sub-regions of height three in the remainder of the board. - The first row in each sub-region will be almost all right moves. - The second row will be all up moves. - The third row will be all down-left moves except the leftmost cell. - We will get (n-1) such regions. - From the upper left corner of the uppermost sub-region, move up, right to the edge of the board, and up one square to the top right corner. 5. **Proof of Maximum Moves**: - To show that we cannot do better than (9n^2 - 3), we use a modulus constraint to restrict the search to tours of length (9n^2). - No tour can include the top right, top left, and bottom right corners. - If we make (k) complex moves ((d)), we must make exactly (k) simple moves of each type ((r) and (u)) for a total of (3k) moves. - Therefore, (9n^2) is the only possible length of a longer tour. - This tour must visit each square on the board, including all 4 corners. - Suppose such a tour exists. We may consider the upper right corner to be the start of the tour. - We must leave the upper right corner by a down-left move. - The tour must include the other 2 corners (bottom right and top left). - Consider the path from the upper right square to the bottom right corner. - It splits the board into two regions (left and right). - It is not possible to move from one region to the other without crossing the path. - Therefore, the tour cannot visit all corners, leading to a contradiction. Thus, the largest possible number of moves the leopard could have made is (9n^2 - 3). The final answer is (boxed{9n^2 - 3})."},{"instruction":"A series is given as 1 2 + 3 4 + 5 6 + . . . + 997 998 + 999 1000.
