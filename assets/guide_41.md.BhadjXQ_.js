We need to place a 1 times 2 rectangular piece of paper on the board such that it overlaps the maximum number of black squares.  2. **Initial Configuration:**    Consider the chessboard where each square is either black or white. The pattern alternates, so each row and column contains 4 black and 4 white squares.  3. **Placing the Rectangle:**    The 1 times 2 rectangle can be placed either horizontally or vertically. We need to determine the placement that maximizes the overlap with black squares. 4. **Horizontal Placement:**    - If the rectangle is placed horizontally, it covers two adjacent squares in the same row.    - Since the chessboard alternates colors, the maximum number of black squares it can cover in this orientation is 1 (one black and one white). 5. **Vertical Placement:**    - If the rectangle is placed vertically, it covers two adjacent squares in the same column.    - Similar to the horizontal case, the maximum number of black squares it can cover in this orientation is also 1 (one black and one white). 6. **Optimal Placement:**    - To maximize the number of black squares covered, we need to consider the placement of the rectangle such that it overlaps multiple rows and columns.    - By placing the rectangle such that it spans across the intersection of four squares, we can cover more black squares. 7. **Covering Multiple Rows and Columns:**    - Consider placing the rectangle such that its center is at the intersection of four squares. This way, the rectangle can overlap parts of up to 6 black squares.    - This configuration is possible because the rectangle can be placed diagonally across the intersection of four squares, covering parts of each. 8. **Verification:**    - To verify, consider the geometry of the placement. The rectangle's center is at the intersection of four squares, and it extends frac{1}{2} unit in one direction and 1 unit in the other direction.    - This placement ensures that the rectangle overlaps parts of 6 black squares. 9. **Conclusion:**    - It is not possible to overlap more than 6 black squares with a 1 times 2 rectangle on an 8 times 8 chessboard.    - The maximum number of black squares that can overlap the paper is 6.

Consider the right triangle ( triangle ABC ) with inscribed circle center ( O ) and points of tangency ( X, Y, ) and ( Z ) on sides ( AB, BC, ) and ( CA ) respectively. 2. Since ( angle YCO = angle ZCO = 90^circ ) (as the radius ( r ) is perpendicular to the point of tangency), the quadrilateral ( CYZO ) is a square. 3. Hence, the hypotenuse ( CO = rsqrt{2} ). 4. Next, the distance ( CX ) (which is the perpendicular distance from ( C ) to ( AB )) is at least as much as the height ( m ) associated with the hypotenuse ( AB ). 5. Thus, in the triangle ( COX ), by the triangle inequality:    [    m leq CX leq CO + OX = rsqrt{2} + r    ] 6. Rearranging the above inequality, we get:    [    frac{r}{m} geq frac{1}{sqrt{2} + 1} = sqrt{2} - 1    ]    Since ( sqrt{2} - 1 approx 0.414 gg 0.4 ), the left inequality part ( frac{r}{m} > 0.4 ) holds true. 7.

This example demonstrates that {f'}(x_{0})=0 alone does not guarantee that x_{0} is an extreme point of f(x). Therefore, {f'}(x_{0})=0 is not a sufficient condition. 2. **Next, we check if {f'}(x_{0})=0 is a necessary condition for f(x) to have an extreme value at x_{0}.** - If f(x) has an extreme value at x_{0}, this means that x_{0} is either a local maximum or a local minimum of f(x). - At such points, the slope of the tangent to the curve of f(x) must be horizontal, implying that the derivative of f(x) at x_{0}, which is {f'}(x_{0}), equals 0. This reasoning shows that for f(x) to have an extreme value at x_{0}, it is necessary that {f'}(x_{0})=0.  Combining these observations, we conclude that the condition {f'}(x_{0})=0 is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the function f(x) to have an extreme value at point x_{0}.

This means that there exist at least two segments of this polygonal chain that intersect each other. 2. **Identification of Intersecting Segments**:     Consider the two intersecting segments of the polygonal chain. Let these segments be overline{AB} and overline{CD}, with the point of intersection being P. Without loss of generality, assume that P is not an endpoint of any segment. 3. **Analysis of the Replacement of Intersecting Segments**:     To resolve the intersection, we propose to replace these intersecting segments with two new segments overline{AC} and overline{BD}, or overline{AD} and overline{BC}. Choosing the combination that forms a new closed polygonal chain which connects the same vertices but avoids the intersection. 4. **Comparison of Lengths**:     Notice that the original segments overline{AB} and overline{CD} contribute to the total length of the chain. We claim that the sum of the lengths of these intersecting segments is greater than the sum of the lengths of the two new segments formed by the non-intersecting replacement:     [     |overline{AB}| + |overline{CD}| > |overline{AC}| + |overline{BD}| quad text{or} quad |overline{AD}| + |overline{BC}|      ]     This is a result of the triangle inequality as well as the fact that any convex quadrilateral has the sum of its opposite sides less than the sum of its diagonals. 5. **Formation of a New Closed Polygonal Chain**:     By replacing the intersecting segments overline{AB} and overline{CD} with, say, overline{AC} and overline{BD}, we form a new closed polygonal chain overline{A-C-dots-P-dots-B-D}, which connects the vertices A, C, dots, P, B, D without intersections. 6. **Induction on Path Length**:     Given that we assumed a minimal length self-intersecting polygonal chain, and we have derived a shorter path with the segment replacement, we reach a contradiction.

Given that the side length of the square is frac{1}{5}, the coordinates of this vertex are left(2 + frac{1}{10},  1 - frac{1}{10}right) = left(frac{21}{10}, frac{9}{10}right). Since frac{9}{10} = frac{3}{7} cdot frac{21}{10}, this point indeed lies on the line. The circle centered at (2,1), being fully enclosed by the square, does not intersect the line. Similarly, the upper left vertex of the square centered at (5,2) also lies on the line. Considering all other points listed, which are farther from a lattice point (excluding (0,0) and (7,3)), we conclude there are two squares with centers strictly between (0,0) and (7,3) that intersect the line. Since there are frac{1001}{7} = frac{429}{3} = 143 such segments, we have 143 cdot 2 = 286 squares intersecting the line. Additionally, every lattice point on the line is of the form (7k, 3k) for 0 le k le 143, resulting in 144 lattice points. At each lattice point, there is one square and one circle, totaling 288 squares and circles. Therefore, the sum m + n of squares and circles the line intersects is 286 + 288 = boxed{574}."},{"instruction":"Given the equation frac{{x}^{2}}{3+k}+frac{{y}^{2}}{2k}=1 represents an ellipse, the range of k is ____.","output":"Given the equation of an ellipse is in the form frac{{x}^{2}}{3+k}+frac{{y}^{2}}{2-k}=1, for it to indeed represent an ellipse, certain conditions must be met.

This can be derived using the triangle inequality in a geometric interpretation of sine and cosine values on the unit circle. 2. **Sum of Absolute Cosines:**    Observe the following inequality:        [    sum_{i=1}^{n} |sin alpha_{i}| + sum_{i=1}^{n} |cos alpha_{i}| geq n    ]    Now, we need to understand why the sum of absolute cosines has a particular upper bound:        [    sum_{i=1}^{n} |cos alpha_{i}| leq n-1    ] 3. **Using the Triangle Inequality:**    From the triangle inequality, we have:    [    | sin alpha_{i} | + | cos alpha_{i} | geq 1    ]    Therefore,    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} | sin alpha_{i} | + sum_{i=1}^{n} | cos alpha_{i} | geq n    ]    Since | sin alpha_{i} | = sin alpha_{i} (because sin alpha_i geq 0 for alpha_i in [0^{circ}, 180^{circ}]), this simplifies to:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} sin alpha_{i} geq n - sum_{i=1}^{n} | cos alpha_{i} |    ] 4. **Deriving the Desired Inequality:**    From the previous observations and the upper bound on the absolute values of cosines, we derive:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} sin alpha_{i} geq n - sum_{i=1}^{n} | cos alpha_{i} |    ]        Substituting the upper bound,    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} sin alpha_{i} geq n - (n - 1) = 1    ] 5. **Proving the Contradiction:**    Suppose, for contradiction, that:    [    sum_{i=1}^{n} | cos alpha_{i} | > n - 1    ]    Since 0 leq | cos alpha_{i} | leq 1, let (x_{i} = 1 - | cos alpha_{i} |).

Thus, calculating the difference between f'(x_0) and f'left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right), we have: f'(x_0) - f'left(frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}right) = lnleft(frac{x_2}{x_1}right) - frac{2left(frac{x_2}{x_1}-1right)}{frac{x_2}{x_1} + 1}.  Setting t = frac{x_2}{x_1}, where t > 1, we transform the expression to g(t) = ln t - frac{2(t - 1)}{t + 1} quad (t > 1), and by differentiating, we have g'(t) = frac{(t - 1)^2}{t(t + 1)^2} > 0.  Therefore, g(t) is monotonically increasing on (1, +infty), which implies g(t) > g(1) = 0, so lnleft(frac{x_2}{x_1}right) - frac{2left(frac{x_2}{x_1}-1right)}{frac{x_2}{x_1} + 1} > 0.

If this quadratic equation has only one positive real root, say alpha, then by setting f(x) = alpha, we can solve for x. Since f(x) is symmetric and positive, there must be two distinct real solutions for x, corresponding to the two sides of the symmetry. These solutions can be represented as {1, 3} or {1, 4}. If this quadratic equation has two distinct positive real roots, say alpha and beta, then by setting f(x) = alpha or f(x) = beta, we can solve for x. Given the symmetry and positive nature of f(x), we would have two distinct real solutions for each root, resulting in a total of four distinct real solutions for x. These four solutions can be represented by the set {1, 2, 3, 4}. From this reasoning, we observe that the solution set for x cannot have three elements, since the symmetric nature of f(x) would result in either two or four solutions. Therefore, the solution set of the equation cannot be the set with three elements, or boxed{{C: {1, 3, 4}}}. Additionally, the function's properties and the theory of real roots for a quadratic equation show that having exactly three real roots is impossible in this context."},{"instruction":"A man's regular pay is 3 per hour up to 40 hours.

Place points on this horizontal line. Specifically, place 200 points, evenly spaced, which divides the line into 201 equal segments.    [    text{Length of each segment} = frac{1}{201} < 0.005    ] 3. **Ensuring Coverage:**    Any rectangle of area 0.005 and sides parallel to the square’s sides that does not contain any points must be between two neighboring points.    Since the length of any such absence rectangle along the horizontal line is less than 0.005, the rectangle must extend fully into either the upper or lower half of the square and violate our area constraint. 4. **Further Division:**    Similarly, divide each half of the square again horizontally into four smaller rectangles by equally spaced horizontal lines. Place 100 points on each line, splitting into 101 segments.

For instance, in the next iteration, each quarter is divided further, each line getting 50 points and so forth until sufficient point density is achieved. 6. **Calculations:**        The calculations for subdivisions are as follows:       [    text{50 points on each line:} quad text{length of each segment} = frac{1}{51} < frac{1}{50} = 4 times 0.005    ]       [    text{25 points:} quad text{length of each segment} = frac{1}{26} < frac{1}{25}    ]        [    text{12 points:} quad text{length of each segment} = frac{1}{13} < frac{2}{25}    ]        [    text{6 points:} quad text{length of each segment} = frac{1}{7}    ]        [    text{3 points:} quad text{length of each segment} = frac{1}{4}    ]        Finally,    [    text{1 point on each line:} quad frac{1}{2}    ] 7. **Total Points Calculation:**    Summing all points used in each row:       [    200 + 2 times 100 + 4 times 50 + 8 times 25 + 16 times 12 + 32 times 6 + 64 times 3 + 128 times 1    ]       [    = 200 + 200 + 200 + 200 + 192 + 192 + 192 + 128 = 1504 < 1600    ] # Conclusion: Hence, it is possible to place 1600 points in a unit square so that any rectangle of area 0.005 located inside the square and parallel to its sides contains at least one point.

(b) For all integers ( a ), ( a^{n}  a ) is divisible by ( n ).","output":":  To determine whether there is an integer ( n > 1 ) that satisfies the following properties: (a) ( n ) is not a prime number. (b) For all integers ( a ), ( a^n - a ) is divisible by ( n ). We can explore some specific cases. 1. **Checking specific integer ( n = 561 ):**    Let ( n = 561 ).        - First, note that ( n = 561 ) is not a prime number because it has the prime factorization:      [      561 = 3 times 11 times 17      ] 2. **Confirming ( a^n - a ) divisible by ( n ) for all integers ( a ):**    - We need to demonstrate that for all integers ( a ), ( a^{561} - a ) is divisible by 561.            - Such a number ( n ) is square-free: this means it does not have any squared factor greater than one.      - Assume that ( m^2 > 1 ) is a divisor of ( n ) and let ( a = m ). Then ( a^n - a ) is divisible by ( m ), but not by ( m^2 ), and hence it is not divisible by ( n ).      - Therefore, ( n = p_1 cdots p_r ) must apply, where ( p_i ) are different prime numbers. 3. **Applying Fermat's Little Theorem:**    - If ( a ) is divisible by ( p_i ), then clearly ( a^n - a ) is divisible by ( p_i ).    - If ( a ) is not divisible by ( p_i ), by Fermat’s Little Theorem ( a^{p_i - 1} equiv 1 mod p_i ). Hence:      [      a^n equiv a^{n/p_i} equiv a mod p_i      ]    - Therefore,      [      p_i mid a^n - a Longleftrightarrow a^{n/p_i} equiv a quad Longleftrightarrow quad a^{n/p_i - 1} equiv 1 quad (mod p_i)      ] 4. **Finding a condition for ( n ):**    - The exponent ( n/p_i - 1 ) must be divisible by ( p_i - 1 ). Thus, for ( n ), the condition becomes:      [      p_i - 1 mid p_1 cdots p_{i-1} p_{i+1} cdots p_r - 1 quad 1 leq i leq r      ] 5. **Trying the simplest case ( r = 3 ):**    - Let's take ( p_1 = 3, p_2 = 11, ) and ( p_3 = 17 ):      [      n = 3 times 11 times 17 = 561      ]    - Verifying the conditions:      [      11-1 = 10 mid (3 times 17 -1 = 50)      ]      [      17-1 = 16 mid (3 times 11 -1 = 32)      ] We find that indeed, ( n = 561 ) satisfies all the necessary conditions. # Conclusion: [ boxed{561} ]"},{"instruction":"Let rectangle ABCD have vertices A = (1, 1), B = (101, 19), and D = (3, y) for some integer y.

Therefore, the largest integer (13) cannot be placed in any square, as it cannot be the sum of smaller integers from the list. 3. **Determine placement of large numbers:**    To maximize (x+y), we should aim to place the largest possible integers in the leftmost and rightmost squares. But the choice of these integers will be constrained by the need to satisfy the sum conditions at the circles next to these squares. 4. **Analyze possible maximum values:**    - Suppose (x = 10) and (y = 11). The numbers available for the circles directly adjacent to these squares must be greater (which is not possible because 13 cannot be the sum of two smaller integers from the set which makes sums like 23 or 24).    - Therefore, the largest integers we can reasonably use for (x) and (y) while satisfying the sum conditions will be less than 10 and 11. 5. **Choose values for (x) and (y):**    - Let us select (x = 9) and (y = 11).     6. **Check possible configurations:**    - If (x = 9) (leftmost square), then the adjacent circle could be (9 + 1 = 10).    - If (y = 11) (rightmost square), then the adjacent circle could be (11 + 2 = 13).     7. **Assign remaining values appropriately:**    - The configuration must balance adding the correct sums at all circles.    - Therefore, assigning the remaining values (4, 5,) and (6) might result in:      [      begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c|c}      textrm{Square} & 9 & 1 & 4 & 6 & 11       hline      textrm{Circle} & - & 10 & 5 & 10 & 13       end{array}      ] 8. **Verify the identified maximum sum (x + y):**    - Based on above steps, the assignment is valid and correctly fills all positions with distinct integers.    - Therefore, the highest possible sum of the leftmost and rightmost squares is 20. # Conclusion: [ boxed{20} ]"},{"instruction":"Let A, B, and C be three points on a line.

Relative speed = Speed of slower train + Speed of faster train Relative speed = 36 kmph + 45 kmph Relative speed = 81 kmph Now, we need to convert this relative speed from kilometers per hour to meters per second to match the unit of the length of the faster train, which is given in meters. 1 km = 1000 meters 1 hour = 3600 seconds So, to convert kmph to m/s, we multiply by 1000 and divide by 3600. Relative speed in m/s = (Relative speed in kmph * 1000) / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = (81 * 1000) / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 81000 / 3600 Relative speed in m/s = 22.5 m/s Now we have the relative speed in meters per second, and we know the length of the faster train is 135.0108 meters. To find out how long it takes for the man in the slower train to pass the faster train, we divide the length of the faster train by the relative speed. Time taken to pass the faster train (in seconds) = Length of the faster train / Relative speed Time taken to pass the faster train (in seconds) = 135.0108 meters / 22.5 m/s Time taken to pass the faster train (in seconds) = 6.00048 seconds Therefore, it takes approximately boxed{6.00048}  seconds for the man in the slower train to pass the faster train."},{"instruction":"space, two lines do not have a common point is a ( ) condition for these two lines being parallel.

Thus:     [     0.1 times V_{cup} = 3V implies V_{cup} = 30V     ] 3. **Taking Out the Small Ball and Introducing the Medium Ball:**     - When the medium ball (volume ( 5V )) is immersed, it displaces ( 5V ) of saltwater, but this does not change the volume of the cup.     - When each ball is removed, it retains some salt, but it gets refilled by the subsequent ball in subsequent steps.  4. **Taking Out the Medium Ball and Introducing the Large Ball:**     - Similarly, the large ball (volume ( 10V )) displaces ( 10V ) of saltwater.     - After removing the large ball, the total volume is still ( 30V ) due to it being an equilibrium displacement process. 5. **Refilling the Cup with Pure Water:**     - The final overflow volume causing the remaining water to be less (10/3) of initial salt water:     [     text{Total volume left in the cup after lose} V_{left} = 30V ,(1-frac{10}{3})     ]     - Let’s assume the re-addition of pure water makes salt amount consistent. 6. **Calculating the Final Concentration:**     [     text{Salt amount left} = 15% times initial SaltVolume = frac{15}{100} times 30V     text{Salt concentration, in final =  }left(1-frac{1}{3} right) = frac{2}{3}     ] 7.

Based on this, we can solve the problem. Let's denote the side length of the square as a. According to the problem, the total reduction in perimeter is equal to the perimeter of one square, which is 4a = 28 cm. Therefore, the side length of the square is a = frac{28}{4} = 7 cm.

Now, when the same number N is divided by 30, the remainder is 18. We can express this as: N = 30P + 18 where P is the quotient when N is divided by 30.

The system involves a 4 times 4 grid of lamps, and a switch flip changes the state (on to off, and off to on) of all lamps in a row or a column. 1. **Initial Configuration and Notation:**    - We denote the initial grid of lamps by a 4 times 4 matrix where each element can be either 0 (off) or 1 (on).    - Assume initially that only one lamp is on. Without loss of generality, we can place this lamp in position ((1, 1)).

This means that the number of lamps that are on in that row will either all turn off or all turn on (if they were all off except one or all on except one, etc.). Thus, if the initial number of '1's in that row was even, it becomes odd, and if odd, it becomes even.    - **Column flip:** Similarly, flipping a column switch changes the state of each lamp in that column, altering the parity. 3. **Invariance of Parity:**    - When considering the entire grid, every flip changes the state of an entire row or an entire column.    - Initially, there is 1 lamp on (odd parity, as (1 equiv 1 (text{mod} 2))).    - Every switch flip (either row or column) affects the total number of lamps on by an even number (the count of lamps in one row or column). This means that each operation will change the number of lamps on by an even number, thus preserving the odd parity.    4. **Consequence of Parity Analysis:**    - Since the sum of all lamps that are on stays odd regardless of how many switches are flipped, it is impossible to achieve a situation where zero lamps are on because zero is even.    - Therefore, you cannot turn off all the lamps because the parity of the total number of lamps that are on remains unchanged as odd. # Conclusion: (boxed{text{Non! car la parité du nombre de lampes allumées est invariante quand on actionne n'importe quel interrupteur, il y en aura donc toujours un nombre impair (donc non nul) d'allumées.}})"},{"instruction":"Given that f(x) = 2x^3  6x^2 + m (where m is a constant), and it has a maximum value of 3 on the interval [2, 2], find the minimum value of this function on [2, 2].","output":"Firstly, we need to determine the derivative of f(x) to find the critical points within the interval [-2, 2]. The derivative of f(x) is given by f'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(2x^3 - 6x^2 + m) = 6x^2 - 12x. Setting f'(x) to zero gives the critical points of f(x): 6x^2 - 12x = 0, x(x - 2) = 0, which implies that the critical points are x = 0 and x = 2. The function is increasing where f'(x) > 0 and decreasing where f'(x) < 0. From the derivative, f'(x) = 6x^2 - 12x, we notice that f'(x) geq 0 for x geq 2 or x leq 0. Thus, the function is increasing on the interval [2, +infty) and (-infty, 0]. As our interval of interest is [-2, 2], we can conclude that the function is increasing on [-2, 0] and decreasing on [0, 2]. Since the function has a maximum value of 3 on the interval and we know that f(x) is decreasing on [0, 2], this maximum must occur at x = 0.

When p is true and q is false, we have a in (-infty, -sqrt{3}) cup (sqrt{3}, +infty) and a in [-1, 1]. However, there is no value of a that satisfies both conditions. When p is false and q is true, we have a in [-sqrt{3}, sqrt{3}] and a in (-infty, -1) cup (1, +infty). Thus, we find a in [-sqrt{3}, -1) cup (1, sqrt{3}].

Since (x, y) is 4 units from the line y = 13, it must be either 4 units above or below this line. Thus, the y-coordinate is either 13 + 4 = 17 or 13 - 4 = 9. By the distance formula, since (x, y) is 10 units from (7,13), we have: sqrt{(x-7)^2 + (y-13)^2} = 10 For y = 17 or y = 9, (y-13)^2 = 16. Substitute into the distance formula: begin{align*} sqrt{(x-7)^2 + 16} &= 10  (x-7)^2 + 16 &= 10^2  (x-7)^2 &= 100 - 16  (x-7)^2 &= 84  x-7 &= pm sqrt{84}  x &= 7 pm 2sqrt{21}. end{align*} So, x can be 7 + 2sqrt{21} or 7 - 2sqrt{21}.

For the non-trivial case, assume that not all points are collinear.  2. **Select Maximal Triangle**:     - Consider the triangle triangle ABC with three vertices A, B, and C such that the area of triangle ABC is maximal among all binom{n}{3} possible triangles formed by the points in S.     - Let BC be the longest side of triangle ABC.  3. **Altitude Consideration**:     - Let h be the altitude of triangle ABC from vertex A to line BC.

Show that it is not possible to return to the starting point.","output":"1. **Defining the transformations:**    We start by defining the transformations from the point (x, y). Each of the transformations has a name:    - Moving to (x, y+2x) is denoted by mathrm{N}.    - Moving to (x, y-2x) is denoted by mathrm{S}.    - Moving to (x+2y, y) is denoted by mathrm{E}.    - Moving to (x-2y, y) is denoted by mathrm{O}. 2. **Understanding the constraint:**    The rule that we cannot immediately return to the previous point means that we cannot perform a mathrm{N} followed by a mathrm{S}, or a mathrm{E} followed by an mathrm{O} (and vice versa). 3. **Form of coordinates:**    Notice that the coordinates of the point after any series of transformations will be of the form (a + bsqrt{2}, c + dsqrt{2}). The transformation rules preserve this form. 4. **Using irrationality of sqrt{2}:**    Since sqrt{2} is irrational, it is observed that a, b, c, and d are integers. Given this, movements can be simplified by focusing only on integer coefficients. 5. **Equivalency to simpler problem:**    It is sufficient to show that starting from (1,0) and following the same rules, we can never return to the starting point. This equivalence is due to the linearity and independence of coefficients of sqrt{2} in the transformations. 6. **Effects of horizontal movements:**    The movements mathrm{E} and mathrm{O} affect only the horizontal direction and do not influence the initial position (1,0). Any sequence of moves can be written as:    [    a_1mathrm{N} + a_2mathrm{E} + a_3mathrm{N} + ldots    ]    where a_i in mathbb{Z} setminus {0}. 7. **Notational conventions for repeated moves:**    - \\"k N\\" denotes a move mathrm{N} repeated k times if k > 0, or mathrm{S} repeated |k| times if k < 0.    - \\"k E\\" denotes a move mathrm{E} repeated k times if k > 0, or mathrm{O} repeated |k| times if k < 0. 8. **Effect of transformations on coordinates:**    Consider a movement kmathrm{N}. Starting from (x, y), the transformation results in (x, y + 2kx). Therefore, after a kmathrm{N} movement, the vertical coordinate increases in magnitude.    Similarly, a movement kmathrm{E} from (x, y) results in (x + 2ky, y), hence the horizontal coordinate increases in magnitude. 9. **Inductive argument on coordinate magnitudes:**    By induction, we assert that after a sequence of transformations, either the |c| becomes greater than |a| after mathrm{N} or |a| becomes greater than |c| after mathrm{E}.    - Initially, let (x, y) = (a, c) be the state.    - After applying transformation kmathrm{N}, the new coordinates are (a, c + 2ka), ensuring |c'| > |a| if k geq 1.    - After transformation kmathrm{E}, the new coordinates become (a + 2kc, c), ensuring |a'| > |c| if k geq 1. 10. **Distance to origin is strictly increasing:**     This argument shows that the distance from the origin of the point (a, c) is strictly increasing after each movement since one of the coordinates increases while the other remains unchanged.

Since they are moving in the same direction, we subtract the speed of the jogger from the speed of the train: Relative speed = Speed of train - Speed of jogger Relative speed = 16.667 m/s - 1.944 m/s ≈ 14.723 m/s The train needs to cover the distance of 150 m (the initial distance between the jogger and the train) plus the length of the train (200 m) to completely pass the jogger. Total distance to cover = 150 m + 200 m = 350 m Now, we can calculate the time it takes for the train to pass the jogger using the formula: Time = Distance / Relative speed Time = 350 m / 14.723 m/s ≈ 23.77 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{23.77}  seconds for the train to pass the jogger."},{"instruction":"Let be a natural number   nge 2   and   n   positive real numbers   a_1,a_n,ldots ,a_n   that satisfy the inequalities     sum_{j=1}^i a_jle a_{i+1} ,quad forall iin{ 1,2,ldots ,n1 } .

Setting f'(x) = 0 to find critical points gives us x = 2. Analyzing the sign of f'(x) in the intervals: - For x < 2, f'(x) > 0 which implies f(x) is increasing. - For x > 2, f'(x) < 0 which implies f(x) is decreasing. Thus, f(x) is increasing on (-infty, 2) and decreasing on (2, infty). The function attains its maximum value at x=2, where f(2) = frac{1}{e^2}. (2) We have  g(x) = f(4-x) = frac{3-x}{e^{4-x}}.  Let's consider the function F(x) = f(x) - g(x) which upon substitution gives us:  F(x) = frac{x-1}{e^x} - frac{3-x}{e^{4-x}}.  Differentiating F(x) with respect to x we get:  F'(x) = left(frac{2-x}{e^x}right) - left(frac{2-x}{e^{4-x}}right) = frac{(2-x)(e^4 - e^{2x})}{e^{x+4}}.  For x > 2, we have 2-x < 0 and since 2x > 4, e^4 - e^{2x} < 0. This implies that F'(x) > 0, and hence F(x) is increasing on the interval (2, infty).

(3) To show that x_1 + x_2 > 4 given x_1 neq x_2 and f(x_1) = f(x_2), we note that x_1 and x_2 cannot be in the same monotonic interval due to the function's properties described earlier. Without loss of generality, assume x_1 < 2 < x_2. From part (2), we know that f(x_2) > g(x_2), and since g(x_2) = f(4-x_2), we get f(x_2) > f(4-x_2). As f(x_1) = f(x_2) we have f(x_1) > f(4-x_2). Given that x_2 > 2 and 4-x_2 < 2, and x_1 < 2 with f(x) increasing on the interval (-infty, 2), it follows that x_1 > 4 - x_2.

Lastly, she asked those who like fruit ice cream to raise their hands, and only one dwarf raised his hand. How many of the dwarfs are truthful?","output":"1. Let's denote the number of truthful gnomes by ( T ) and the number of lying gnomes by ( L ). Given that there are a total of 10 gnomes, we have:    [    T + L = 10    ] 2. Each truthful gnome raises their hand exactly once for their favorite ice cream flavor. Therefore, if all gnomes were truthful, the total number of hands raised would be equal to the number of gnomes, which is 10. 3. Each lying gnome, however, would raise their hand twice, because they lie about two flavors, claiming to like flavors different from their actual preference.  4. According to the problem, Snow White observes the following:    - All gnomes raise their hands for the cream-flavored ice cream: 10 hands.    - Half of the gnomes raise their hands for the chocolate-flavored ice cream: 5 hands.    - Only one gnome raises their hand for the fruit-flavored ice cream: 1 hand.    Therefore, the total number of hands raised is:    [    10 + 5 + 1 = 16    ] 5. Comparing this with the scenario where all gnomes were truthful (10 hands raised), we see there are 6 more hands raised than if all gnomes were truthful:    [    16 - 10 = 6    ] 6. Since each lying gnome raises one additional hand (compared to a truthful gnome), the 6 extra hands raised must come from lying gnomes:    [    L = 6    ] 7. Using the total number of gnomes, we can now find the number of truthful gnomes:    [    T = 10 - L = 10 - 6 = 4    ] 8.

Design a method to color all such integer points so that each point is colored either white, red, or black, so as to meet the following requirements: 1. Points of all three colors appear on infinitely many lines parallel to the horizontal axis; 2. For any white point A, red point B, and black point C, there is always a red point D such that ABCD forms a parallelogram. Prove that your designed method conforms to the above requirements. 1. **Coloring Method:** We color an integer point (x, y) according to the following rules:     - If x + y is an even number, color it red;     - If x is an odd number and y is an even number, color it white;     - If x is an even number and y is an odd number, color it black.     2. **Verifying Requirement 1:** To verify that this coloring method meets requirement (1), we observe:     - For any fixed y, if we vary x:       - When y is even, if x is even, (x+y) is even, so the point is red. If x is odd, the point (x,y) is white.       - When y is odd, if x is even, the point is black. If x is odd, (x+y) is even, so the point is red.     - Hence, for any given y, there will be infinite points of all three colors on the horizontal lines due to the parity of x and y coordinates. 3. **Verifying Requirement 2:** Consider a white point A(x_1, y_1), a red point B(x_2, y_2), and a black point C(x_3, y_3). We need to find a red point D such that ABCD is a parallelogram.     - Given that A(x_1, y_1) is white, we know x_1 is odd and y_1 is even.     - For point B(x_2, y_2), since it is red, x_2 + y_2 is even.     - For point C(x_3, y_3), since it is black, x_3 is even and y_3 is odd. 4. **Ensuring Non-collinearity:** First, we show A, B, and C are not collinear:     - (x_2 - x_1) and (y_2 - y_1) have different parity.     - Since point C is black, x_3 - x_1 is odd and y_3 - y_1 is odd, hence:     [     (x_2 - x_1)(y_3 - y_1) neq (y_2 - y_1)(x_3 - x_1)     ]     - Therefore, points A, B, and C are not collinear. 5. **Finding Point D:** Now, we need to ensure D exists such that:     - Coordinates of D are given by:     [     D = (x_1 + x_3 - x_2, y_1 + y_3 - y_2)     ]     - Coordinates of D, calculated as (x_4, y_4), must satisfy x_4 + y_4 is even, thus making it red.     - Plug in the values:     [     x_4 + y_4 = (x_1 + x_3 - x_2) + (y_1 + y_3 - y_2)     ]     - Since x_1 + y_1, x_3 + y_3, and x_2 + y_2 are all individually even (due to parity and defined coloring rules), x_4 + y_4 will also be even.

We describe a move in this scenario as a piece jumping over another piece on a neighboring square (which shares a side) onto an empty square, and then removing the piece that was jumped over. 1. **Simple Cases:**     - **1 x 2 rectangle:**      - It obviously can be reduced to a single piece because we can make one piece jump over the other.          - **2 x 2 rectangle:**      - Also can be reduced to a single piece by a sequence of jumps.          - **3 x 2 rectangle:**      - This can be reduced to exactly 2 pieces.  2. **The L Move:**    The \\"L move\\" is a specific arrangement where pieces on four 'X' squares can be reduced to a single 'X' provided the 'Y' square is empty.

X        \`\`\`      This final arrangement shows that we can reduce a 4 x 2 rectangle to a section that can be considered 1 x 2.    - Given this behavior, we conclude that any ( m times 2 ) rectangle where ( m > 3 ) can similarly be reduced by considering sections of three rows at a time. 4. **Larger Rectangles:**    - For an ( m times 3 ) rectangle with ( m > 1 ), the entire rectangle can be reduced iteratively by L moves until it becomes 3 x 1, leaving us 2 pieces.        - Now consider larger rectangles ( m times n ) with ( m geq 4 ) and ( n geq 3 ).      - We can treat such a rectangle as consisting of a 3 x n rectangle next to an ( (m-3) times n ) rectangle.            - By reducing parts of the rectangle, we eventually get to smaller units such as 3 x 3, which can be further broken down using L moves. 5. **Special Cases and General Conclusion:**    - **Final Arrangement and Reduction:**      - Reaching specific cases like 4 x 4 can be challenging, so let’s see an example:        Initially,        \`\`\`        X X X X        X X X X        X X X X        X X X X        \`\`\`        After a sequence of moves:        \`\`\`        X X X        X X        X X        X X        X        \`\`\`    - Hence, any ( m times n ) rectangle can thus be broken down maintaining ( mn mod 3 ) operations structure.    To show correctness for whether ( mn mod 3 ) influences the end number of pieces:    - **Color Argument:**      - Color the board with 3 colors in the repeating pattern: 1, 2, 3,        Thus each move will change the parity of the components.            - If ( mn ) is a multiple of 3, the initial setup (parity) won't result in a single piece (since three equal partitions won't end as single). Thus, the conclusion is: - The smallest number of pieces left is 2 if ( mn ) is a multiple of 3, and it is 1 otherwise.

Calculate the angle between the hour and minute hands:    - The angle moving clockwise from the hour hand to the minute hand:      ( 120^circ - 220^circ = -100^circ ).    - Since we need a positive angle, we take the absolute value: ( | -100^circ | = 100^circ ).    - Since we are tasked with finding the acute angle, and ( 100^circ ) is the obtuse one, we calculate ( 360^circ - 100^circ = 260^circ ) for the full circle calculation but choose ( 100^circ ) as it is the acute angle.

Determine the locus of point (A). 1. **Understanding the ellipse and its parameters**:    - The given ellipse equation is (frac{x^2}{9} + frac{y^2}{5} = 1).    - For an ellipse (frac{x^2}{a^2} + frac{y^2}{b^2} = 1), the semi-major axis (a) and semi-minor axis (b) are given by (a = 3) and (b =  sqrt{5}).    - The distance between the center and each focus is (c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{9 - 5} = sqrt{4} = 2).    - Therefore, the foci of the ellipse are (F = (2, 0)) and the left focus (F' = (-2, 0)). 2. **Setting up coordinates and points**:    - Let (z_A) and (z_B) be the complex numbers corresponding to points (A) and (B) respectively on the complex plane. The coordinates of the foci (F) and (F') are represented by ( z_F = 2 ) and ( z_{F'} = -2 ). 3. **Conditions for point (B)**:    - Since (B) lies on the ellipse, it satisfies the condition (left|z_{B} + 2right| + left|z_{B} - 2right| = 6) due to the definition of the ellipse being the sum of distances to the foci equal to the major axis length (2a = 6). 4. **Finding point (A)**:    - Given that (triangle FAB) is an equilateral triangle, the point (B) must be obtained by rotating point (A) around point (F) by (60^circ).    - In complex notation, for rotation, transformation is given by (z_{B} - 2 = (z_A - 2) left( cos frac{ pi}{3} + i sin frac{pi}{3}right) = (z_A - 2) left( frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} i right)). 5. **Computing form and locus**:    - By substituting and simplifying, we get:      [      z_{B} - 2 = (z_A - 2) left( frac{1}{2} + frac{sqrt{3}}{2} i right)      ]      [      z_B + 2 = frac{1 + sqrt{3} i}{2} (z_A - 2 sqrt{3} i)      ]    - Calculating distances, (left| z_{B} - 2 right| + left| z_{B} + 2 right| = left| z_A - 2 right| + left| z_A - 2 sqrt{3} i right|) 6. **Final locus equation**:    - Therefore, the locus of point (A) satisfies the equation:      [      left| z_A - 2 right| + left| z_A - 2 sqrt{3} i right| = 6      ]    - This forms an ellipse with foci at ((2,0)) and ((0,2sqrt{3})) and a major axis length of 6. # Conclusion: The locus of point (A) is an ellipse with foci at ((2,0)) and ((0,2 sqrt{3})) with a major axis length of 6.

Let the y-coordinate of point M be y_0. By definition of the parabola, the distance from M to the focus must also equal the distance from M to the directrix.

We aim to calculate x_1^2 + x_2^2.  We start by noting that x_1^2 + x_2^2 can be expressed as (x_1 + x_2)^2 - 2x_1x_2. This transformation is based on the algebraic identity (a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2, which implies a^2 + b^2 = (a+b)^2 - 2ab. The sum of the roots, x_1 + x_2, is given by the formula -frac{b}{a} for a quadratic equation ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Applying this to our equation, we have: [x_1 + x_2 = -frac{12}{8} = -frac{3}{2}] The product of the roots, x_1x_2, is given by the formula frac{c}{a}.

Given that point A has coordinates (-1,4) and its corresponding point C has coordinates (1,2), we can calculate the change in the x and y coordinates separately: - For the x-coordinate: The change is from -1 to 1, which is a movement of 2 units to the right. This is calculated as 1 - (-1) = 2. - For the y-coordinate: The change is from 4 to 2, which is a movement of 2 units down. This is calculated as 2 - 4 = -2. Therefore, the translation rule is to move every point 2 units to the right and 2 units down. Next, we apply this translation rule to point B(2,1) to find the coordinates of the corresponding point D: - For the x-coordinate of B: Moving 2 units to the right from 2 gives 2 + 2 = 4. - For the y-coordinate of B: Moving 2 units down from 1 gives 1 - 2 = -1.

The password for the box is an integer between 1 and 1700. Two spies, A and B, know one password each and decide to exchange this information. They use a specific method involving throwing stones into a river, where 26 stones are available. **Step 1:** Define the total possibilities of distributing some stones in the river. We are familiar with the equation (x_{1} + x_{2} + cdots + x_{7} = 14) where each (x_i) is a positive integer. The number of positive integer solutions to this equation is given by the binomial coefficient: [ binom{13}{6} = 1716 > 1700 ] This indicates there are more than 1700 ways to distribute 14 stones in 7 groups. **Step 2:** Define a bijection that maps the integers ( {1, 2, ldots, 1700} ) to valid 'stone throwing' sequences which satisfy the above distribution.

The process continues for 6 rounds, i.e., both spies throw stones in 6 turns each. **Step 4:** Verification of the number of stones thrown. Since each spy's tuple of the first 6 numbers sums up to at most 13 (because the seventh element ensures the total of 14), the combined sum of stones for each spy will not exceed 26. Hence the number of stones thrown will perfectly match the available 26 stones. **Step 5:** Determine the password from the thrown stones sequence. Once all 6 rounds of stone throwing are complete: [ a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_6 text{ from spy A and } b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_6 text{ from spy B} ] Since (f) is designed as a bijection and each tuple ((x_1, x_2, cdots, x_7)) determines a unique integer, A can decipher B's password by the sequence of stones thrown by B, and vice versa. **Conclusion:** By using the bijection ( f ), each spy can determine the other's password securely using the stone-throwing method.

Then, ( lfloor kp rfloor geq 2^q ), implying ( f^i(2^q) neq 2^q ) for all ( i = 1, 2, ldots, 2^q ), which is absurd due to circularity. Therefore, all ( p in C_q ) are at most ( 2^{q+1} - 1 ). In particular, ( 2^q ) cannot belong to ( C_{q'} ) for any ( q' < q ), so all ( C_q ) are disjoint. 4. **Inductive Step:**    - We will show by induction that ( C_q = {2^q, 2^q + 1, 2^q + 2, ldots, 2^{q+1} - 1} ).    - Base case: ( q = 1 ). Assume the result is true for ( 1, 2, ldots, q-1 ).

As ( q ) increases, the second term tends to zero, so ( k ) cannot be larger than ( frac{1}{2} ). 6. **Constructing a Circular Function with ( k = frac{1}{2} ):**    - A circular function with ( k = frac{1}{2} ) can be constructed by setting ( f(p) = p + 1 ) if ( p + 1 ) is not an integral power of 2, and ( f(p) = frac{p + 1}{2} ) if ( p + 1 ) is an integral power of 2.

To solve this problem, we calculate the base radius r=3 using the formula for the lateral surface area, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the height h= sqrt{l^2 - r^2} = 4. Substituting these values into the formula for the volume of a cone gives us the volume of this cone.

What is the probability that triangle ABP has a greater area than each of triangle ACP and triangle BCP?","output":"To solve this problem, we'll break down the solution into detailed steps, closely following the original solution's logic. **Step 1: Understanding the Relationship Between Areas and Altitudes** Given that triangle ABP, triangle ACP, and triangle BCP share a common vertex P and are within the same equilateral triangle ABC, we note that the areas of these triangles are proportional to the lengths of their altitudes because they have equal bases. This is due to the formula for the area of a triangle, frac{1}{2} times text{base} times text{height}. **Step 2: Identifying the Centroid and Drawing Medians** Let's identify O as the centroid of triangle ABC. By drawing medians overline{AOE} and overline{BOD}, we divide triangle ABC into smaller triangles. The centroid O is the point where these medians intersect, and it's known that in an equilateral triangle, the centroid also serves as the center of gravity, dividing each median into two segments, one of which is twice as long as the other. **Step 3: Determining the Position of Point P** For triangle ABP to have a greater area than both triangle ACP and triangle BCP, point P must be closer to overline{AB} than to overline{AC} or overline{BC}. This condition is satisfied if P is located above overline{BOD} and overline{AOE}, meaning it is farther from overline{AB} than from overline{BC} or overline{AC}, respectively. Therefore, P must lie inside quadrilateral CDOE for triangle ABP to have the largest area among the three triangles. **Step 4: Calculating the Probability** Extending overline{CO} to meet overline{AB} at F divides triangle ABC into six congruent smaller triangles because O is the centroid, and the medians divide the triangle into equal parts. Quadrilateral CDOE comprises two of these six congruent triangles. Therefore, the area of quadrilateral CDOE is one-third of the area of triangle ABC.

The percentage of water in the new mixture is: (280 mL water / 400 mL total mixture) * 100% = 70% The percentage of hydrochloric acid in the new mixture is: (120 mL hydrochloric acid / 400 mL total mixture) * 100% = 30% This confirms that the new mixture is 70% water and 30% hydrochloric acid, as desired. Therefore, the percentage of hydrochloric acid in the current mixture before adding the 100 mL of water is boxed{40%} ."},{"instruction":"Florida is starting a promotion where every car that arrives gets one orange per passenger.

We will label all the possible initial positions of the rook in the labyrinth. These positions can be represented as pairs ( (L, P) ), where ( L ) is the labyrinth and ( P ) is the initial position of the rook within the labyrinth. Since the number of labyrinths and positions is finite, the total number of these pairs is finite as well. 2. Next, consider a specific initial position pair ( (L_1, P_1) ). We will write a program ( Pi_1 ) that can traverse all accessible fields in the labyrinth ( L_1 ) starting from the position ( P_1 ). This program ensures that the rook visits all fields reachable from ( P_1 ) in ( L_1 ). 3. Suppose now the initial position is ( (L_1, P_2) ), a different position in the same labyrinth ( L_1 ). We will apply the program ( Pi_1 ) starting from ( P_2 ).

For each new initial position, we will extend the program to ensure that all accessible fields are covered. This iterative process will yield a final program ( Pi_f ) that can start from any initial position in ( L_1 ) and traverse all accessible fields. 5. Therefore, by constructing such an extended program for every labyrinth ( L ) and ensuring it works for all initial positions, we guarantee that the rook can traverse all accessible fields from any chosen initial position. # Conclusion: The solution lies in systematically constructing a program that covers all accessible fields, starting from each initial position, and extending it as needed.

Given the problem to show that any triangle can be divided into 2019 quadrilaterals, each of which is both inscribed and circumscribed, we start by noting that ( 2019 = 3 times 673 ).     2. First, we will divide the original triangle into 673 smaller triangles. One effective way to achieve this is by drawing segments originating from one vertex and extending to the opposite side.     Consider a triangle ( Delta ABC ). Select vertex ( A ). From vertex ( A ), draw 672 equally spaced segments to the line segment ( BC ). This creates 673 smaller triangles within ( Delta ABC ). 3. Next, we utilize the result that any triangle can be divided into three quadrilaterals, each of which is both inscribed and circumscribed. This characteristic of being both inscribed and circumscribed means that the quadrilateral can be both fitted perfectly within a circle (inscribed) and around a circle (circumscribed), suggesting it has an incircle and a circumcircle.         To perform this step, we need to demonstrate or assume a method to divide each of the 673 smaller triangles into three such quadrilaterals. 4. We repeat the division process with each of these 673 smaller triangles. For each of these triangles, we apply a method to divide it into exactly three quadrilaterals, each fulfilling the inscribed and circumscribed property. 5. As a result, dividing each of the 673 smaller triangles into three quadrilaterals yields ( 673 times 3 = 2019 ) quadrilaterals. So through this method, we ensure that any triangle can be divided into exactly 2019 quadrilaterals, each of which is both inscribed and circumscribed.

Therefore, the number of pens in a package (P) must be a factor of 60. The factors of 60 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30, and 60.

Step 1: Lower Bound First of all, for any graph G, we have [ chi'(G) geq Delta(G) ] This is because all edges incident to a vertex of maximum degree Delta(G) must be colored differently.  Step 2: Induction Hypothesis Next, we proceed by induction on the number of edges m = |E|.  For m in mathbb{N}, let mathcal{H}_{m} be the proposition:  \\"For every bipartite graph G = (V, E) such that |E| = m, we have chi'(G) = Delta(G).   Step 3: Base Case - **Initialization:**     For m = 0, if a graph G has no edges, then we have Delta(G) = 0. In this case, no colors are needed, i.e., chi'(G) = 0. Hence, the base case holds.  Step 4: Inductive Step - **Inductive Hypothesis:**     Assume mathcal{H}_{m} is true for any graph with m edges. - **Inductive Step:**     Consider a bipartite graph G = (V, E) with m + 1 edges. We need to show that chi'(G) = Delta(G).     1. Choose an arbitrary edge {v_{1}, v_{2}} in E. Let H be the subgraph obtained by removing this edge from G. Thus, |E(H)| = m.          2. By the inductive hypothesis mathcal{H}_{m}, H can be edge-colored using at most Delta(G) colors, i.e., chi'(H) leq Delta(G).          3. Consider an edge-coloring of H using Delta(G) colors. Let C_1 (respectively C_2) be the set of colors that are not used by edges incident to vertex v_{1} (respectively v_{2}) in H.          4. Since both v_{1} and v_{2} in H have degrees at most Delta(G) - 1 (note that their degrees in G are at most Delta(G), and we removed one edge incident to each), we get:              [         |C_1| = Delta(G) - deg_H(v_1) geq Delta(G) - (Delta(G) - 1) = 1         ]         [         |C_2| = Delta(G) - deg_H(v_2) geq Delta(G) - (Delta(G) - 1) = 1         ]          Therefore, both C_1 and C_2 are non-empty sets of colors.     5. - If C_1 cap C_2 neq emptyset, then we can color the edge {v_{1}, v_{2}} using any color in the intersection C_1 cap C_2.      - Otherwise, choose c_1 in C_1 and c_2 in C_2. Consider the longest path in H where edge colors alternate between c_1 and c_2, starting from v_{1}.      6. Since G is bipartite, this path cannot revisit any vertex already visited, nor can it include v_{2} (bipartite graphs do not contain odd cycles). Swap the colors c_1 and c_2 along this path.          7. This swapping ensures a valid edge-coloring for H cup {v_{1}, v_{2}} with Delta(G) colors, reducing the problem back to the scenario where C_1 cap C_2 neq emptyset. Hence, every bipartite graph G with m + 1 edges can be properly edge-colored using Delta(G) colors.   Conclusion By mathematical induction, for all m in mathbb{N}, every bipartite graph G with m edges admits a proper edge-coloring in at most Delta(G) colors. Thus, chi'(G) leq Delta(G) for any bipartite graph G, combined with the lower bound chi'(G) geq Delta(G): [ chi'(G) = Delta(G) ] Therefore, we conclude that if G is a bipartite graph, then [ boxed{chi'(G) = Delta(G)} ]"},{"instruction":"f ( 2010! = M times 10^k ), where ( M ) is an integer not divisible by 10, find the value of ( k ).","output":"To find the value of ( k ) in the expression ( 2010! = M times 10^k ), we need to determine how many times 10 is a factor in ( 2010! ).

Let's analyze the effect of drawing diagonals in (P_{100}). A diagonal in a polygon is a line segment connecting two non-adjacent vertices. 3. Any two diagonals of a convex polygon will intersect inside the polygon if and only if they share no common endpoint (vertex). Consider the task of counting the intersections formed by the diagonals. 4. Suppose we draw diagonals step by step and each time a newly drawn diagonal intersects the existing diagonals. If a new diagonal intersects (k) existing diagonals, the number of divided regions increases by (k+1). 5. If a convex (n)-gon has (m) total diagonal intersections, the total number of regions (s) formed by drawing (n-3) diagonals is given by:    [    s = (n-3) + m + 1.    ]    Here, (n-3) is the number of diagonals because for any (n)-sided polygon, any vertex connects to (n-3) vertices by a diagonal. 6. We need to apply this to a 100-gon. Specifically, we are interested in using 50 diagonals out of 100 possible diagonals to divide the 100-gon into regions. 7. Construct a scenario:     - Select 4 vertices (A, B, C,) and (D) in the 100-gon such that:         * There are 11 vertices between (A) and (B).         * There are 10 vertices between (C) and (D).         * If two vertices have 49 vertices between them, they are termed as complementary vertices. 8. Clearly, a 100-gon has 50 pairs of complementary vertices.  9. Draw diagonals between each complementary pair except for the pair ((A, B)):     - This contributes 48 diagonals. 10. The total number of intersection points these 48 diagonals create is:     [     binom{48}{2} = frac{48 cdot 47}{2} = 1128.     ] 11. Next, connect the diagonals (AB) and (CD):     - (AB) intersects other 48 diagonals in 11 points.     - (CD) intersects other 48 diagonals in 10 points. 12. The total intersections from these steps:     [     1128 + 11 + 10 = 1149.     ] 13. The regions formed are:     [     s = 50 + 1149 + 1 = 1200.     ] Thus, using 50 diagonals, a 100-gon can indeed be divided into 1200 regions: [ boxed{1200} ]"},{"instruction":"Let  a, b, c  be the lengths of sides of a triangle.

We will use the AM-GM (Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean) inequality to help prove this. Recall that for any non-negative real numbers (x) and (y), the AM-GM inequality states:    [    frac{x + y}{2} geq sqrt{xy}    ]    Applying this to each term, we get:    [    frac{a+b}{2} geq sqrt{ab}, quad frac{a+c}{2} geq sqrt{ac}, quad frac{b+c}{2} geq sqrt{bc}    ] 3. Multiply both sides of each inequality by 2:    [    a + b geq 2sqrt{ab}, quad a + c geq 2sqrt{ac}, quad b + c geq 2sqrt{bc}    ] 4. Now, multiply each inequality by the corresponding term:    [    (a+b)sqrt{ab} geq 2ab, quad (a+c)sqrt{ac} geq 2ac, quad (b+c)sqrt{bc} geq 2bc    ] 5.

Next, we need to show that:    [    2ab + 2ac + 2bc geq frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2}    ] 7. Expand the right-hand side:    [    frac{(a+b+c)^2}{2} = frac{a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + 2ab + 2ac + 2bc}{2}    ] 8. Since (a, b, c) are the lengths of the sides of a triangle, by the triangle inequality, we know that:    [    a + b > c, quad a + c > b, quad b + c > a    ]    This implies that (a^2 + b^2 + c^2 > 0). 9.

Using the geometric mean theorem (altitude theorem), we have:     [     m^2 = x(4m - x)     ]     Simplifying this, we get:     [     x^2 - 4mx + m^2 = 0     ] 3. **Solve the quadratic equation for x:**     Solving the quadratic equation, we use the quadratic formula x = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}:     [     x_{1,2} = frac{4m pm sqrt{(4m)^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot m^2}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{4m pm sqrt{16m^2 - 4m^2}}{2} = frac{4m pm sqrt{12m^2}}{2} = frac{4m pm 2sqrt{3}m}{2}     ]     Simplifying further:     [     x_{1,2} = 2m pm sqrt{3}m = (2 pm sqrt{3})m     ] 4. **Calculate the angle using the given segments:**     If the segment (2+sqrt{3})m and the corresponding leg create an angle alpha, then:     [     tan alpha = frac{1}{2 + sqrt{3}}     ]     To find alpha, we can use a calculator or trigonometric identities. The tangent addition formula confirms:     [     tan 15^circ = frac{sin 30^circ}{1 + cos 30^circ} = frac{1/2}{1 + sqrt{3}/2} = frac{1}{2 + sqrt{3}}     ]     Therefore, alpha = 15^circ.     Since 2 + sqrt{3} and 2 - sqrt{3} are reciprocal, the other angle must be:     [     boxed{75^circ}     ]  II. Solution: 1. **Calculation involving the hypotenuse and segment heights:**     Consider the height to the hypotenuse m again, and as calculated:     [     m = frac{c}{4}     ] 2. **Using the Thales' Thorem:**     Let O be the midpoint of the segment AB. By Thales' Theorem:     [     OA = OB = OC = frac{c}{2}     ] 3. **Using trigonometric properties in triangle COT:**     In triangle COT, the sine of angle COT is given by:     [     sin angle COT = frac{frac{c}{4}}{frac{c}{2}} = frac{1}{2}     ]     Since the angle is acute:     [     angle COT = 30^circ     ] 4. **Derive other angles:**     Considering the exterior angle theorem in triangle OAC:     [     angle COT = angle OAC + angle OCA = 30^circ     ]     Hence, each angle angle BAC and angle DCA in triangle BAC:     [     angle BAC = angle OAC = angle OCA = frac{30^circ}{2} = 15^circ     ]  III. Solution: 1. **Using sides and angles relation:**     Let's name the sides and angles of the triangle as usual. We know:     [     a = c sin alpha quad text{and} quad b = c cos alpha     ]     Given the area:     [     frac{c^2}{8} = t = frac{ab}{2} = frac{c sin alpha cdot c cos alpha}{2}     ]     This simplifies to:     [     frac{c^2}{8} = frac{c^2 sin alpha cos alpha}{2}     ] 2. **Solve for  alpha:**     Dividing both sides by c^2 neq 0 and multiplying by 4:     [     frac{1}{2} = 2 sin alpha cos alpha = sin 2alpha     ]     Which implies:     [     2alpha = 30^circ quad text{or} quad 2alpha = 150^circ     ]     Resulting in:     [     alpha = 15^circ quad text{or} quad alpha = 75^circ     ] Therefore, the angles of the triangle are: [ boxed{90^circ, 75^circ, 15^circ} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that f(x) is a function defined on mathbb{R} and satisfies f(x)f(x+2)=1.

One potential strategy involves symmetrical play. Specifically, the player to go second could mirror the first player's moves. Consider a strategy where the second player (Victor) can always maintain a symmetrical position on the board relative to Peter's move. 5. By mirroring Peter's move, Victor ensures that for every rectangle Peter places, Victor places an identical rectangle in a mirror position.

Comparing xyw with xy_1w_1: [ xyw - xy_1w_1 = x left(yw - frac{y+w}{3} cdot frac{2y+2w}{3} right) = frac{x(y-w)^2}{9} > 0. ] Assuming w = 2y, the sum condition gives us x + 3y = 1, which implies y = frac{1 - x}{3}.

Due to aging equipment and other reasons, the company's production capacity will decline year by year. Without technical renovation, it is predicted that the net profit will decrease by 2 million yuan each year starting from this year. At the beginning of this year, the company invested 6 million yuan at once for technical renovation. It is predicted that excluding the funds for technical renovation, the profit for the nth year (with this year being the first year) will be 500(1+ frac{1}{2^{n}}) million yuan (n is a positive integer). (Ⅰ) Suppose that the cumulative net profit of the company for the first n years, without technical renovation, is A<sub>n</sub> million yuan, and after technical renovation, deducting the investment for technical renovation, is B<sub>n</sub> million yuan. Find the expressions for A<sub>n</sub> and B<sub>n</sub>. (Ⅱ) According to the predictions, after how many years will the cumulative net profit of the company, following the technical renovation, exceed that without the renovation?","output":"(Ⅰ) According to the problem statement, A<sub>n</sub> is the sum of net profits over n years without the technical renovation, given by: A_n = (500 - 20) + (500 - 40) + ldots + (500 - 20n) = 500n - 20(1 + 2 + ldots + n). The sum of the first n positive integers is given by the formula: sum_{i=1}^{n} i = frac{n(n+1)}{2}. Using this formula, we can write: A_n = 500n - 20 cdot frac{n(n+1)}{2} = 500n - 10n^2 - 10n = 490n - 10n^2. For B<sub>n</sub>, which is the sum of net profits after the technical renovation, the profit for the nth year is 500(1+frac{1}{2^n}) million yuan. Summing up for n years and subtracting the initial investment of 600 million yuan: B_n = 500 left[(1 + frac{1}{2}) + (1 + frac{1}{2^2}) + ldots + (1 + frac{1}{2^n})right] - 600. The sum inside the square brackets is a geometric series, whose sum can be expressed as: sum_{i=0}^{n-1} frac{1}{2^i} = 2 - frac{1}{2^{n-1}}. Hence, we obtain: B_n = 500 left[n + (2 - frac{1}{2^{n-1}})right] - 600 = 500n + 1000 - frac{500}{2^{n-1}} - 600 = 500n + 400 - frac{500}{2^{n-1}}. (We subtract 1 from n since the series starts from 0 instead of 1.) (Ⅱ) To find out after how many years the cumulative net profit following the technical renovation will exceed that without the renovation, we compare A<sub>n</sub> and B<sub>n</sub>. We look for the smallest integer n where B<sub>n</sub> > A<sub>n</sub>. Setting up the inequality: B_n - A_n = (500n + 400 - frac{500}{2^{n-1}}) - (490n - 10n^2) = 10n^2 + 10n - frac{500}{2^{n-1}} - 400. Because we want to find the smallest integer n that satisfies B<sub>n</sub> > A<sub>n</sub>, we test values of n: For n=1: 10 + 10 - frac{500}{2^0} - 400 < 0. For n=2: 10 cdot 4 + 20 - frac{500}{2} - 400 < 0. For n=3: 10 cdot 9 + 30 - frac{500}{4} - 400 < 0. For n=4: 10 cdot 16 + 40 - frac{500}{8} - 400 > 0.

Note that DE is the projection of D_1E on the base ABCD. 5. Therefore, D_1E perp AF Leftrightarrow DE perp AF as projections preserve perpendicularity. 6. Observing that ABCD is a square and E is the midpoint of BC, the only way DE perp AF holds is if F is the midpoint of CD. 7. When F is the midpoint of CD, note EF parallel BD because both are diagonals in their respective planes. 8. Now, connect points AC and intersect it with EF at point H. Thus, H lies on both AC and EF and CH perp EF since diagonals of a rectangle are perpendicular at their intersection. 9. Next, connect C_1H. This gives us CH as the projection of C_1H on the base ABCD. 10. Therefore, C_1H perp EF since diagonals intersect perpendicularly. 11. Now, analyze right triangle triangle C_1CH where:     - C_1C = 1 (the height of the cube)     - CH = frac{1}{4}AC = frac{sqrt{2}}{4} since AC = sqrt{1^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{2} and H is at frac{1}{4} of AC due to midpoint and symmetry. 12.

Prove that there is a unique method such that all n balls start in the white boxes, and after a finite number of adjustments, all balls are in the black box.","output":"1. **Define the Function varphi**:    Let's denote the adjustment function mentioned in the problem as varphi. We define varphi acting on a state left(a_0, a_1, ldots, a_nright) as follows:        - If box number ( k ) (where ( 1 leq k leq n )) contains ( k ) balls, we remove those ( k ) balls. Then, we place one ball in each of the black box and the white boxes labeled from 1 to ( k-1 ).    Mathematically, it can be represented as:    [    left(a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{k-1}, k, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_nright) xrightarrow{varphi} left(a_0+1, a_1+1, ldots, a_{k-1}+1, 0, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_nright)    ] 2. **Goal**:    We are tasked with showing that there exists a unique way of distributing the balls starting initially in the white boxes, such that after a finite number of applications of varphi, all balls end up in the black box. 3. **Existence Proof**:        First, we will show that such an initial state does exist. The problem states the final state configuration. To find the initial state from the final state, we use the inverse function of varphi, denoted as varphi^{-1}. 4. **Definition of Inverse Function varphi^{-1}**:    - The inverse ( varphi^{-1} ) is defined for states left(a_0, a_1, ldots, a_nright) where ( a_k = 0 ) and ( a_i > 0 ) for ( i = 0, 1, 2, ldots, k-1 ). We have:    [    left(a_0, a_1, ldots, a_{k-1}, 0, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_nright) xrightarrow{varphi^{-1}} left(a_0-1, a_1-1, ldots, a_{k-1}-1, k, a_{k+1}, ldots, a_nright)    ]    Since varphi and varphi^{-1} are bijections, applying them successively will yield the identity transformation. 5. **Backward Induction**:    Let's trace from the final state back to the initial state using varphi^{-1} until it can no longer be applied. Suppose the final state is ((n, 0, ldots, 0)).        By iterative application of varphi^{-1}, we have:    [    begin{aligned}    (n, 0,0, cdots, 0) &xrightarrow{varphi^{-1}} (n-1, 1, 0, 0, cdots, 0)     &xrightarrow{varphi^{-1}} (n-2, 0, 2, 0, cdots, 0)     &xrightarrow{varphi^{-1}} (n-3, 1, 2, 0, cdots, 0)     &xrightarrow{varphi^{-1}} ldots     &xrightarrow{varphi^{-1}} left(a_0, a_1, a_2, cdots, a_nright)    end{aligned}    ]    We need to ensure that (a_0 = 0) in the initial state, otherwise, varphi^{-1} can still be applied. 6. **Forward Adjustment**:    Conversely, if we start from the initial state (left(a_0, a_1, ldots, a_nright)) and apply varphi iteratively, we would end up in the state ((n, 0, ldots, 0)). This confirms the consistency and existence of such a state. 7. **Example for (n = 7)**:    Let's perform the forward adjustment for an example where ( n = 7 ):    [    left(0, 1, 0, 2, 4, 0, 0, 0right)         xrightarrow[text{adjust a1}]{varphi} (5, 0, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)         xrightarrow[text{adjust a2}]{varphi} (6, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)        xrightarrow[text{adjust a1}]{varphi} (7, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)    ]    This sequence of adjustments confirms that the final state can be achieved through a unique sequence of transformations varphi. 8. **Uniqueness Proof**:    To show the uniqueness for general ( n ), we can use mathematical induction:    - **Base Case**: For ( n = 1 ):      [      (0, 1) longrightarrow (1, 0)      ]    - **Inductive Step**: Assume uniqueness holds for ( n-1 ). For ( n ), consider states (left(a_0, a_1, ldots, a_nright)) and (left(b_0, b_1, ldots, b_nright)) such that both can be transformed to ((n, 0, ldots, 0)). We need to show they must be identical.        Using the same logic, for any ( k ):      - If ( 0 < a_k < n ), then removal of ( k ) balls at any given time prohibits reaching the state.      - If ( a_k = n ), then all ( a_i = 0 ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, n-1 ), otherwise it's not possible to convert to ((n, 0, ldots, 0)).      Thus, if (left(a_0=0, a_1, ldots, a_nright)) transitions to (left(1, a_1', ldots, a_n'right)) and similarly for (left(b_0 = 0, b_1, ldots, b_nright)), removing the zero values results in states for ( n-1 ), which by the inductive hypothesis are unique. Hence, (a_i = b_i). 9. **Computational Verification**:    We can compute each value ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ) using the formulas derived for general ( n ):    [    begin{aligned}    a_1 &= S_1 - 2leftlfloor frac{S_1}{2} rightrfloor = n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor,     a_2 &= S_2 - 3leftlfloor frac{S_2}{3} rightrfloor = n - a_1 - 3leftlfloor frac{n - a_1}{3} rightrfloor,     a_3 &= n - a_1 - a_2 - 4leftlfloor frac{n - a_1 - a_2}{4} rightrfloor,    end{aligned}    ]    continuing this computation for all ( a_i ). Thus, we have shown the above process verifies the existence and uniqueness of the initial state allowing all balls to eventually move into the black box after finite adjustments described by varphi. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The Vance family walked over to the post office.

Therefore, the monotonically increasing interval of f(x) is (1,+infty), and the monotonically decreasing interval is (0,1). (2) From the question, f'(x)= frac{1}{x}- frac{a}{x^{2}}= frac{x-a}{x^{2}}.

Let's suppose we can fill the (8 times 8) international chess board with the natural numbers (1, 2, cdots, 64) such that the sum of the numbers in any given (2 times 2) sub-square is divisible by 5. Specifically, for any sub-square like the figure below:        [    begin{array}{|c|c|}    hline    a & b     hline    d & e     hline    end{array}    ]    we need:    [    5 mid a + b + d + e.    ]     2. Consider two different (2 times 2) sub-squares that share numbers (b, d) and (e):        [    begin{array}{ccccc}    & a && b &     & + && + &     & c && d &     end{array}    ]        For these shared terms, we get the conditions:    [    begin{cases}    5 mid (a + b + c + d),     5 mid (b + d + e).    end{cases}    ]        Subtracting the second equation from the first we get:    [    5 mid (a + c - e).    ] 3. In general, you can systematically apply this condition to each (2 times 2) sub-square. Beyond just pairs, we can generalize across the whole board using these differences. Notably:        - Since (a + b + c + e) and (d + b + c + e) must both be divisible by 5,      [      5 mid (a - d).      ]    - Similarly, applying the same logic to arrangements horizontally or vertically within the matrix yields:      [      5 mid (d - c), quad 5 mid (a - b), quad 5 mid (c - e).      ] 4. Further generalize for squares between more distant positions:    - Considering cases like:      [      begin{array}{|c|c|c|}      hline      a & b & c       hline      d & e & f       hline      end{array}      ]    - We get:      [      begin{cases}      5 mid (a + b + d + e),       5 mid (a + b + c + d).      end{cases}      ] 5. Simplifying this idea, each number ( mod 5 ) across black squares and white squares must be consistent:    - Introduce residues ( r_1 ) for black squares and ( r_2 ) for white squares. Clearly, the residues must be consistent across every (2 times 2) block.    - However, the distinct numbers ( 1, 2, cdots, 64 ) modulo 5 encompass all residues ({0, 1, 2, 3, 4}). 6. Counting contradiction:    - As the numbers fill the matrix, they inherently cycle through all residues ( {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} ).    - A (8 times 8) board needs 32 numbers each in black and white. We get controlled residue, contradiction occurs as some values (5 residues cycle (16 times ), clashes with equalities). # Conclusion: Because of the impossible condition set by the sum demand and residue properties, there is no way to completely fill the chessboard as demanded.

The units digit can also be 0, 1, or 2 to maintain the condition with the tens digit.   - This gives us the numbers: 110, 111, 112 with the hundreds digit as 1, and 210, 211, 212 with the hundreds digit as 2.   - Total numbers in this case: 3 + 3 = 6. - **Case 3: Tens digit is 2**   - With the tens digit as 2, the hundreds digit can be 1, 2, or 3, and similarly, the units digit can be 1, 2, or 3.   - This results in the numbers: 121, 122, 123 with the hundreds digit as 1; 221, 222, 223 with the hundreds digit as 2; and 321, 322, 323 with the hundreds digit as 3.   - Total numbers in this case: 3 + 3 + 3 = 9. - **Case 4: Tens digit is 3**   - For the tens digit at 3, the hundreds digit can only be 2 or 3 to satisfy the condition. The units digit can be 2 or 3.   - This gives us the numbers: 232, 233 with the hundreds digit as 2, and 332, 333 with the hundreds digit as 3.   - Total numbers in this case: 2 + 2 = 4.

Hence, it would be impossible to determine which number corresponds to which card, meaning no two cards participating in exactly one question should appear together in any question. 4. **Deriving the inequality:**    Since no two such cards can appear in the same question, ( k ) must be less than or equal to ( N ):    [    k leq N    ] 5. **Remaining cards participate in at least two questions:**    Thus, the remaining ( 2005-k ) cards appear at least twice. 6. **Summing up:**    When summing the participation counts for each card, we include each question three times, one for each card involved in it.

(The side with the number is considered the front.)","output":"To settle this problem, let's carefully examine each step involved in determining the minimal number of \\"reversals\\" needed to make all five cards face up. 1. **Initial Configuration:**     - We have 5 cards labeled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ordered by increasing value, with the front side initially facing up.      - We then flip cards 1, 3, and 5. This results in the new configuration: 1^prime, 2, 3^prime, 4, 5^prime where the prime symbol (^prime) denotes the back side facing up. 2. **Possible Operations:**     - We can take the stack of cards and divide it into two parts from any card. Then, the top part is flipped entirely and placed on the bottom part.     - Alternatively, we can reverse the entire stack. 3. **Analyzing the Reversal Process:**    - Observe that a single \\"reversal\\" operation can only change 1 or 2 of the cards to the correct orientation (or none if they are already correct).    - To achieve the desired outcome, we need a detailed combination of operations that lead all cards to be face up. 4. **Counting \\"Sub-Stacks\\":**    - Initially, visualizing the stack into sub-stacks formed by front-facing and back-facing cards. This stack can be seen as multiple connected sub-stacks due to the orientations mixed.    - Our goal is to merge these sub-stacks gradually until we have only one sub-stack with all cards facing front. 5. **Iterative Process:**    - Currently, the configuration has front and back orientations mixed.    - The sequence of operations can be broken down into a step-by-step transformation until it’s sorted correctly. 5. **Steps Required:**     - After initial flip: 1^prime, 2, 3^prime, 4, 5^prime     - Flip entire stack once: 5, 4^prime, 3, 2^prime, 1     - Flip 4^prime and 2^prime to maintain consistency: 5, 4, 3, 2, 1     - Next, flip the sequences as needed just by analyzing sub-orders being consistent. 6. **Verification:**    - Each result should align with the roles of flipping gradually bringing sub-structures closer to fully sorted order. 7. **Final Merging:**     - After a systematic process, at least four stack reversals based on connections forming consistent piles where each flip minimizes unsorted piles.    - **Conclusion:** [boxed{5}]"},{"instruction":"Given positive real numbers ( x_{1}, x_{2}, cdots, x_{n+1} ) satisfying the condition (frac{1}{1+x_{1}}+frac{1}{1+x_{2}}+cdots+frac{1}{1+x_{n+1}}=1), prove that ( x_{1} x_{2} cdots x_{n+1} geqslant n^{n1} ).","output":"1.

The answer is obtained by solving the system of inequalities formed by the radical expression being greater than or equal to 0 and the denominator of the fraction not being equal to 0. This problem tests the understanding of the domain of a function and how to determine it, which is a basic computational problem. Solution Enhancement: 1. First, we need to find the domain of the given function. The domain is the set of all possible values that can be inputted into the function without making it undefined. 2. In this case, there are two conditions that must be satisfied for the function to be defined:    - The square root must be non-negative (since we can't take the square root of a negative number in the real number system). So, we have the inequality 1 - x^2 geq 0. Solving this inequality gives us -1 leq x leq 1.    - The denominator cannot be zero (since division by zero is undefined). So, we have the inequality x neq 0. 3. Combining these two conditions gives us the domain of the function: -1 leq x leq 1 and x neq 0, which can be written as [-1, 0) cup (0, 1]. 4.

Consider a fraction ( frac{a}{b} ) where ( a ) is the numerator and ( b ) is the denominator. We need to find a fraction where ( a < b ) and that does not change if its digits are flipped.    2. Let us interpret flipping \\"вверх ногами\\" (upside down) as a 180-degree rotation of each digit. Therefore, the digits in the numerator and the denominator should each be one of (0, 1, 6, 8, 9), as these digits look like some other digits or themselves when rotated 180 degrees. Specifically, the full set of pairs is:     - 0 stays 0     - 1 stays 1     - 6 becomes 9     - 8 stays 8     - 9 becomes 6 3. Analyze each permissible digit pair and examine their combination in a fraction:    - The digits will rotate inversely, so we will consider fractions such as ( frac{6}{9} ) which becomes ( frac{9}{6} ) when rotated.  4. We need fractions ( frac{a}{b} ) whereby rotating the numerator and denominator results in the same fraction:      - Example:        - Given ( frac{6}{9} )       - When the fraction is rotated 180 degrees, ( 6 rightarrow 9 ) and ( 9 rightarrow 6 ), resulting in ( frac{9}{6} ), which simplifies back to the original ( frac{6}{9} ). 5. Simplifying ( frac{9}{6} ) back to its equivalent reduces to ( frac{3}{2} ), contradicting our requirement that ( a < b ) (because ( 3 > 2 )). 6. Rethinking the flipped behavior instead of considering digit rotation but as a goal, we find a fraction unchanged:    - ( frac{1}{1}, frac{8}{8} ) aren't fractions where ( a < b ). 7.

On Thursday, he washed double the number of loads he did on Wednesday, so that's 2 * 6 = 12 loads. On Saturday, he could only wash a third of the loads he did on Wednesday, so that's 1/3 * 6 = 2 loads. We know he washed a total of 26 loads during the week. So, the number of loads he washed on Friday can be found by subtracting the loads from Wednesday, Thursday, and Saturday from the total loads: Loads on Friday = Total loads - (Wednesday loads + Thursday loads + Saturday loads) Loads on Friday = 26 - (6 + 12 + 2) Loads on Friday = 26 - 20 Loads on Friday = 6 loads Now, we can find the ratio of the number of loads on Friday to the number of loads on Thursday: Ratio (Friday:Thursday) = Loads on Friday / Loads on Thursday Ratio (Friday:Thursday) = 6 / 12 Ratio (Friday:Thursday) = 1 / 2 So, the ratio of the number of loads Vincent washed on Friday to the number of loads he washed on Thursday is boxed{1:2} ."},{"instruction":"A 20quart radiator is filled with water.

Take an arbitrary point in the  interior of each circle. Prove that the four arbitrary points are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral.\\r \\r *Laurentiu Panaitopol*","output":"To prove that the four arbitrary points inside the circles are the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, we need to show that no three of these points are collinear. We will use the properties of the square and the circles to establish this. 1. **Define the Problem:**    Let the vertices of the square be ( A, B, C, D ) in clockwise order. The centers of the circles are at these vertices, and the radius of each circle is such that the sum of the areas of the circles equals the area of the square. Let ( P, Q, R, S ) be arbitrary points inside the circles centered at ( A, B, C, D ) respectively. 2. **Area of the Square and Circles:**    Assume the side length of the square is ( s ). The area of the square is ( s^2 ). The area of each circle is ( pi r^2 ). Given that the sum of the areas of the four circles equals the area of the square:    [    4 pi r^2 = s^2 implies r^2 = frac{s^2}{4pi} implies r = frac{s}{2sqrt{pi}}    ] 3. **Position of Points:**    Since ( P, Q, R, S ) are arbitrary points inside their respective circles, they are within a distance ( r ) from ( A, B, C, D ) respectively.  4. **Convex Quadrilateral Condition:**    To show that ( P, Q, R, S ) form a convex quadrilateral, we need to show that no three points are collinear. Consider the projections of ( A, B, C ) on a line ( ell ) and denote these projections as ( X_A, X_B, X_C ). 5. **Projection and Minimal Sum of Areas:**    The sum of the areas of the circles with radii ( AX_A, BX_B, CX_C ) should be greater than the area of the square. For the sum of the areas of the circles to be minimal, the line ( ell ) should intersect the segments ( BA ) and ( BC ). Let ( T_A ) and ( T_C ) be the points of intersection, and let ( a = BT_A ) and ( c = BT_C ). 6. **Minimizing the Sum of Areas:**    We need to minimize:    [    left(frac{AT_A}{T_AB}right)^2 + left(frac{CT_C}{T_CB}right)^2 = left(frac{1}{a} - 1right)^2 + left(frac{1}{c} - 1right)^2    ]    This happens when ( a = c ), i.e., when ( ell ) makes angles of ( 45^circ ) with ( CA ) and ( CB ). 7. **Conclusion:**    Since the minimal sum of the areas of the circles is achieved when the line ( ell ) intersects the segments ( BA ) and ( BC ) at equal distances, it implies that the points ( P, Q, R, S ) cannot be collinear. Therefore, ( P, Q, R, S ) form a convex quadrilateral. (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Annie takes a  6  question test, with each question having two parts each worth  1  point.

To determine the sign of ( d ), it is sufficient to compare the squares of the terms:    [    (2sqrt{11})^2 quad text{and} quad (sqrt{5} + sqrt{19})^2    ] 3. Calculate these squares:    - ((2sqrt{11})^2 = 4 cdot 11 = 44)    - ((sqrt{5} + sqrt{19})^2 = (sqrt{5})^2 + 2sqrt{5} cdot sqrt{19} + (sqrt{19})^2)    - Simplify this:      [      (sqrt{5} + sqrt{19})^2 = 5 + 19 + 2sqrt{5} cdot sqrt{19} = 24 + 2sqrt{95}      ] 4.

Therefore,     [    2sqrt{11} > sqrt{5} + sqrt{19}    ]    Hence, ( d > 0 ) and ( sqrt{11} - sqrt{5} ) is greater than ( sqrt{19} - sqrt{11} ): [ boxed{sqrt{11} - sqrt{5} text{ is greater}} ] **Second Method:** 1.

The denominator simplifies to:    [    (sqrt{19})^2 - (sqrt{11})^2 = 19 - 11 = 8    ] 4.

Considering the sequence modulo (p), it must eventually repeat due to the finite number of residues modulo (p). By backward induction, the cycle must contain (0), so there are infinitely many elements divisible by (p). 2. **Choosing (n_0)**:    Choose (n_0) such that in the sequence (u_{n_0}, u_{n_0+1}, ldots, u_{n_0+M}), there are at least (2023) numbers divisible by (p). Then for every (m geq M), (u_{n_0}u_{n_0+1}ldots u_{n_0+m}) is divisible by (p^{2023}). 3. **Divisibility by 2023**:    Since (2023 = 7 cdot 17^2), if none of the (u_n) are divisible by (7) or (17), the sequence modulo (2023) must be in a cycle.

The area of (triangle ABC) can be expressed as:    [    S_{ABC} = frac{1}{2} a d_a = frac{1}{2} b d_b = frac{1}{2} c d_c    ]    where (S_{ABC}) is the area of (triangle ABC), (a, b, c) are the lengths of the sides (BC, CA, AB) respectively. 2. **Summing the Areas**:    Consider the area relation, combining all parts:    [    2 S_{ABC} = a d_a + b d_b + c d_c    ] 3. **Maximizing the Product**:    To find (O) such that (d_a d_b d_c) is maximized, we note from the product of the distances and the algebraic inequality such as the Arithmetic Mean-Geometric Mean (AM-GM) inequality.

This is a well-known result in triangle geometry, indicating that when the product (a d_a cdot b d_b cdot c d_c) is maximized, the point (O) must be such that the individual products (a d_a, b d_b, c d_c) are all equal. 5. **Geometric Interpretation**:    The condition (a d_a = b d_b = c d_c) means that the triangles (BOC), (AOC) and (AOB) formed by connecting (O) to (A), (B), and (C) must have the same area. The only point within (triangle ABC) that satisfies this condition is the centroid, where the medians of the triangle intersect.  6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the maximum product (d_a d_b d_c) is achieved when (O) is the centroid of triangle (ABC).

This means that d is the equal side shared between P_1 and P_2. 7. Finally, considering a_1 and a_2, which are the remaining equal sides in P_1 and P_2, respectively:     - Since d = b_1 = b_2 and both P_1 and P_2 were divided such that one side of the isosceles triangles in each coincides as equal sides with d, a_1 and a_2 must be equal.     - Hence, a_1 and a_2 are two distinct sides of P which are equal.

Xiao Ming approaches this problem using a system of linear equations. Let's break down the solution step by step, adhering to the information provided and the rules for rewriting: 1. **First Scenario Analysis**:    - The problem states that if each person contributes 8 coins, there will be 3 coins left over. This scenario is represented by the equation 8x - 3 = y.    - Here, x represents the number of people, and y represents the price of the item. 2. **Second Scenario Analysis**:    - The problem also mentions that if each person contributes 7 coins, there will be 4 coins short of the total price. To represent this scenario, we need an equation that reflects being 4 coins short when each of the x people contributes 7 coins.    - To adjust for the shortfall, we add 4 to the total contributions made by the people to equal the price of the item. Thus, the equation that represents this scenario is 7x + 4 = y. 3. **Conclusion**:    - Comparing the given options for the second equation that fits the problem's description, we identify that option B: 7x + 4 = y correctly represents the second scenario where each person contributes 7 coins, and there is a shortfall of 4 coins.

To minimize a + b + c, one of the integers, say c, should be the product of the largest prime factors, thus reducing the other factors in the term sum. Taking c = 70 (the highest single product under a cube, 5 times 7^2 = 245 exceeds the square rule for minimum sums), we leave a times b = 35 (since 2450 div 70 = 35). The factors that minimize the sum for 35 = 5 times 7 are 5 and 7. Therefore, a = 5 and b = 7 provide the lowest sum.

The problem can be visualized as coloring the vertices of this graph so that no two adjacent vertices share the same color (proper vertex coloring). 3. **Determining the minimum number of letters:**    This problem is equivalent to finding the chromatic number of the graph representing the grid. In graph theory, the chromatic number of a chessboard-like lattice (grid graph) is 2, because we can color it in a checkerboard pattern. 4. **Checkerboard pattern explanation:**    - Label one set of alternating nodes (like black squares on a chessboard) with letter \`A\`.    - Label the other set of alternating nodes (like white squares on a chessboard) with letter \`B\`.        This ensures that any two adjacent nodes are labeled differently.

(We suppose that there is no place in a decimal representations such that all digits starting from that place are 9's.) *Proposed by A. Golovanov*","output":"To determine if it is possible to color all positive real numbers using 10 colors such that any two numbers differing in exactly one decimal place have different colors, we can use the following approach: 1. **Define an Equivalence Relation:**    Define an equivalence relation equiv on the set of positive real numbers mathbb{R}^+ by stating that a equiv b if and only if a - b has only finitely many non-zero digits in its decimal representation. This relation is:    - Reflexive: a - a = 0, which has no non-zero digits.    - Symmetric: If a - b has finitely many non-zero digits, then b - a = -(a - b) also has finitely many non-zero digits.    - Transitive: If a - b and b - c both have finitely many non-zero digits, then (a - b) + (b - c) = a - c also has finitely many non-zero digits. 2. **Partition into Equivalence Classes:**    The equivalence relation equiv partitions mathbb{R}^+ into disjoint equivalence classes. Let f(a) denote the equivalence class containing a. 3. **Choice Function:**    By the Axiom of Choice, there exists a choice function g that selects a representative from each equivalence class. Specifically, for each equivalence class f(a), g(f(a)) is a representative element of that class. 4. **Define the Coloring Function:**    Define a coloring function c: mathbb{R}^+ rightarrow mathbb{Z}_{10} by setting c(r) to be the sum of the decimal digits of r - g(f(r)) modulo 10. Since r equiv g(f(r)), the difference r - g(f(r)) has only finitely many non-zero digits, making the sum of its decimal digits well-defined. 5. **Verify the Coloring Property:**    If two numbers a and b differ in exactly one decimal place, then their difference a - b has exactly one non-zero digit. Consequently, the sum of the decimal digits of a - b is a single non-zero digit, which implies that c(a) neq c(b). Thus, the coloring function c ensures that any two numbers differing in exactly one decimal place are assigned different colors.

Let's proceed step-by-step.  Step 1: Check for trivial solutions Firstly, consider the simplest cases where n = 1.  - For any prime p, (1, p) is a solution:     - -p is a prime.     - -1 < 2p.     - -(p-1)^1 + 1 = -p + 1 is divisible by 1^{p-1} (trivially true). So (1, p) are solutions for any prime p.  Step 2: Consider the case p = 2 If p = 2, we consider n > 1. The problem simplifies to testing: -2 leq 2p = 4 implies -2 leq 4 text{, which is always true}. Plug p = 2 into the divisibility condition: -(2-1)^n + 1 text{ must be divisible by } n^{2-1} = n -(1)^n + 1 text{ must be divisible by } n implies -1 + 1 = 0text{ is divisible by } n. So, the condition holds for n = 2 and only n = 2 works since -1 + 1 = 0 and n = 2: Thus, (2, 2) is another solution.  Step 3: Assume p geq 3 For p geqslant 3, n must be odd since it's easier to work with prime numbers. Select a prime q that divides n such that q | n and examine the conditions given: - By Fermat's Little Theorem, (p - 1)^q equiv -1 pmod{q}. General condition derived: (p-1)^{an} equiv (-1)^a pmod{q}. Using the above equivalence, we seek integers a and b such that an + b(q-1) = 1. Use Bezout's identity where a and b come from the equation gcd(n, q-1) = 1. For q to apply, assume it is the smallest prime divisor of n: - Thus a must be odd, which implies (p-1) equiv -1 pmod{q} and q | p. - By minimality of q, p = q and n = p is needed.   Step 4: Conclude the solution  Given p = q, substitute to check structure: (p - 1)^p + 1 = sum_{k=0}^p binom{p}{k} (-1)^k p^{p-k}. We analyze this sum: - (p^2) is a major term. - Sum of lesser terms given by A is A mod p^3  (and p^3  divides sum beyond p^2). This implies that p must be 3 (since p = 3 satisfies the criteria where (p - 1)^p + 1 = 2^3 +1 = 9 meets the needed divisibility by p). Finally using divisibility:  (3-1)^3 + 1 = 2^3 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10  n^{p-1} = 3^{3-1} = 9 Finally, this verifies: n=p=3 implies (3,3) # Conclusion: The solutions are (1, p) for any prime p and (2, 2)., and (3, 3) as additional pairs. boxed{(1, p) text{ for any prime p}, (2, 2), (3, 3)}"},{"instruction":"a market, a dozen eggs cost as much as a pound of rice, and a halfliter of kerosene costs as much as 4 eggs.

This means that during the time it was being filled, it leaked some water. The total amount of water that leaked in 13 seconds is the difference between the water poured in and the water the basin can hold, which is 312 gallons - 260 gallons = 52 gallons.

However, (4) vertices belong to more than one face (shared at the edges), which leads to the overcount. Thus, the actual count of unique vertices is indeed 56 (rather than (54)). 5. According to the problem's constraints, this hypothetical path must traverse through each of these nodes. 6. However, since the number of nodes (56) exceeds the number of diagonals (54), it implies that there must be at least one node that this path does not pass through. 7.

Assume that placing fewer than ( n-1 ) lanterns is sufficient.     - If we place at most ( n-2 ) lanterns, then there will be at least one vertex without a lantern. 4. **Identifying a Non-Illuminated Scenario**:     - Consider such a vertex, say ( V_1 ), that has no lantern.     - There are ( n-1 ) corridors (either sides or diagonals) emanating from this vertex since it connects to the other ( n-1 ) vertices. Since ( V_1 ) is not illuminated by a lantern directly placed at ( V_1 ), none of these ( n-1 ) corridors will be illuminated unless lanterns are placed at every other vertex connected to ( V_1 ).

Therefore, we calculate the coordinates of {A'} as follows: - The x-coordinate of {A'} is 2 times 2 = 4. - The y-coordinate of {A'} is 2 times 3 = 6. Thus, in the same quadrant, the coordinates of {A'} are (4,6). # In Different Quadrants: Considering the possibility of {A'} being in a quadrant opposite to A with the origin as the center of similarity, we reflect the coordinates of A across the origin and then apply the similarity ratio. This reflection changes the sign of both coordinates before applying the similarity ratio. However, since the question implies a direct scaling from the origin, the reflection scenario does not apply directly here. The direct application of the similarity ratio already accounts for the possible positions of {A'} relative to A based on the given ratio. Therefore, the initial interpretation of scaling to find {A'} in the same quadrant directly leads us to the coordinates (4,6) for the similar position in the same direction from the origin. Given this understanding, the coordinates of {A'} in a different quadrant scenario do not apply directly in the context of similarity scaling from the origin.

First, we analyze the term log _{2}a=0.5^{a}=0.2^{b}: - Since log _{2}a represents the power to which 2 must be raised to obtain a, and 0.5 = frac{1}{2}, we can see that log _{2}a = 0.5^{a} implies a relationship between a and a power of 2.  - Given that 0.5^{a} = 0.2^{b}, and knowing that 0.5 = frac{1}{2} and 0.2 = frac{1}{5}, we can infer a relationship between the powers of frac{1}{2} and frac{1}{5}. From log _{2}a > 0, we deduce that a > 1. This is because the logarithm of a number greater than 1 to a base greater than 1 is positive. Next, we define a function f(x) = (frac{1}{2})^{x} - log _{2}x and analyze its behavior. We find that f(x) is decreasing on the interval (0, +infty). This is inferred from the properties of the functions involved and their derivatives. Given that f(1) = frac{1}{2} > 0 and f(2) = frac{1}{4} - 1 < 0, we conclude that there is a unique zero of f(x) in the interval (1,2). This means that a, which satisfies the equation 0.5^{a} = log _{2}a, must lie within the interval (1,2). Since a in (1,2), it follows that 0.5^{a} in (frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}). Consequently, 0.2^{b} in (frac{1}{4}, frac{1}{2}) as well, because 0.5^{a} = 0.2^{b}. From the inequality {(frac{1}{5})}^{b} > frac{1}{4} > frac{1}{5}, we deduce that b < 1. This is because as the base frac{1}{5} is raised to higher powers, the result becomes smaller, and to be greater than frac{1}{4}, b must be less than 1. Therefore, we have established that b < 1 < a.

Step-by-Step Proof: 1. **Understanding Small Differences**:    - We need to show that values close to zero can be realized by the differences ( n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} ).     - Consider ( n, m ) such that ( n ) is significantly larger than ( m ). For simplicity, consider ( m = n-1 ).    - We have:      [      n^{1/3} - (n-1)^{1/3}      ] 2. **Estimating ( n^{1/3} - (n-1)^{1/3} )**:    - Use the binomial approximation for small ( x ):      [      (n-1)^{1/3} = n^{1/3} left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^{1/3}      ]    - For large ( n ), (left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^{1/3}) can be approximated as:      [      left(1 - frac{1}{n}right)^{1/3} approx 1 - frac{1}{3n}      ]    - Thus:      [      n^{1/3} - (n-1)^{1/3} approx n^{1/3} - n^{1/3} left(1 - frac{1}{3n} right) = n^{1/3} left( frac{1}{3n} right) = frac{1}{3n^{2/3}}      ] 3. **Generalizing Differences**:    - For any two large integers ( n ) and ( m ), ( n > m ), we use the mean value theorem:      [      n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} approx frac{d}{dx} x^{1/3} cdot (n - m) = frac{1}{3} x^{-2/3} cdot (n - m)      ]    - Choosing ( x ) roughly halfway between ( n ) and ( m ):      [      x approx frac{n + m}{2}      ]    - So:      [      n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} approx frac{1}{3} left( frac{n + m}{2} right)^{-2/3} (n - m)      ] 4. **Denseness in Reals**:    - Since we can approximate any small value with differences like (frac{1}{3n^{2/3}}), which can be made arbitrarily small as ( n ) increases.    - If (alpha) is an arbitrary real number, because the differences ({ n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} }) form a dense set, we can get arbitrarily close to (alpha). 5. **Approaching (sqrt{2})**:    - If we specifically want a difference that is close to (sqrt{2}), we can approximate (frac{k}{j}), where ( j ) is a large integer. We know values of the form (frac{1}{3n^{2/3}}) can form such approximations:      (      k approx sqrt{2} cdot n^{2/3}      )    - By finding sufficiently large ( n ), we approximate (sqrt{2}). By carefully choosing ( n ) and ( m ), the values ( n^{1/3} - m^{1/3} ) will converge to any desired value, hence forming a dense set in reals.

Since each school must have at least one volunteer, we first assign one volunteer to each school. This leaves us with 2 volunteers to be freely distributed among the 3 schools. The problem now becomes how to distribute 2 indistinguishable volunteers into 3 distinguishable schools, which can be solved by the stars and bars method. We represent the volunteers as stars (*) and use 2 bars (|) to divide them into 3 groups (schools). For example, \\"*|*| \\" means one volunteer goes to the first school, one to the second, and none to the third. There are 4 positions to place the stars and bars, and we need to choose 2 positions out of these 4 to place the bars. This can be done in binom{4}{2} = 6 ways. However, this calculation assumes that each school can receive any number of volunteers, including zero, which contradicts our initial condition that each school must receive at least one volunteer. To correct for this, we consider the initial distribution of one volunteer to each school.

Given the symmetry of the parabola and the points provided, the value of m corresponds to the y-value when x = 2. Since y = 0 at x = 0 and considering the symmetry and continuity of a parabola, the value of m must also be 0. This makes statement ③ correct. 4. **Checking if the Graph Passes Through the Third Quadrant**:    For the graph to pass through the third quadrant, there must be points where both x < 0 and y < 0. However, based on the given points and the shape of the parabola, when y leqslant 0, the range of x is 0 leqslant x leqslant 2. This means the parabola does not extend into the third quadrant where both x and y would be negative. Therefore, statement ④ is correct.

Thus, the angles (Ohat{A}M) and (Ohat{C}B), as well as (Ohat{B}C) and (Ohat{M}A), are equal.        This implies:    [    angle OAM = angle OCB quad text{and} quad angle BCO = angle MAO    ]        Therefore, triangles (triangle AOM) and (triangle COB) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) similarity criterion. 2. **Establish the Ratio of Similar Triangles:**    Since (M) is the midpoint of (AD), we have:    [    overline{BC} = overline{AD} = 2 times overline{AM}    ]    Hence, the corresponding sides of similar triangles (AOM) and (COB) are in the ratio of 1:2. Specifically:    [    frac{overline{OM}}{overline{OB}} = frac{1}{2}    ] 3. **Using the Ratio to Determine Area Proportions:**    Since the sides are in the ratio (1:2), the areas of these triangles are in the ratio of the square of their sides, i.e., (1:4).

This means that there are no four points on the circle such that all six segments joining these points have lengths greater than ( sqrt{2} ). 3. **Contradiction Argument**:    - Suppose, for contradiction, that there exist four points ( A, B, C, D ) on the unit circle such that all segments ( AB, BC, CD, DA, AC, BD ) have lengths greater than ( sqrt{2} ).    - The length of a chord in a unit circle is given by ( 2 sin(theta/2) ), where ( theta ) is the central angle subtended by the chord.    - For a chord to have length greater than ( sqrt{2} ), the central angle ( theta ) must satisfy ( 2 sin(theta/2) > sqrt{2} ). Solving this inequality, we get ( theta > frac{pi}{2} ). 4. **Angle Sum Argument**:    - If ( A, B, C, D ) are four points on the unit circle, the sum of the central angles subtended by these points must be ( 2pi ).    - However, if each of the four central angles ( angle AOB, angle BOC, angle COD, angle DOA ) is greater than ( frac{pi}{2} ), their sum would be greater than ( 2pi ), which is a contradiction. 5. **Application of Turan's Theorem**:    - Since ( G ) is ( K_4 )-free, we can apply Turan's theorem. Turan's theorem states that the maximum number of edges in a ( K_4 )-free graph with ( n ) vertices is ( frac{n^2}{3} ).    - Therefore, the number of segments with length greater than ( sqrt{2} ) is at most ( frac{n^2}{3} ).

Substituting y = cos x into the equation of each circle: - **Circle A**:    [   (x - 0)^2 + (cos x - 0)^2 = 2^2   ] - **Circle B**:    [   (x - 0)^2 + (cos x - 1)^2 = 1^2   ] - **Circle C**:    [   (x - 2)^2 + (cos x - 0)^2 = 0.5^2   ] - **Circle D**:    [   (x - pi)^2 + (cos x - 0)^2 = 2^2   ]  2. Analyzing the chances of multiple intersections: - The cosine function also oscillates between -1 and 1 similar to sine but phases shifted. It has infinite peaks and troughs as x to pm infty. - **Circle A and D** with radius 2 are likely to encompass more oscillations of cosine function. In particular, Circle D, positioned at the center (pi, 0), results in aligning peaks of cosine function around odd multiples of pi and troughs around even multiples of pi within its radius for more intersections. - **Circle B and C**, due to their smaller radii and differently placed centers, would have fewer intersection points, especially Circle C which due to a smaller radius and being displaced from the origin will have minimal effects.  Conclusion: Circle D, centered at (pi,0) with radius 2, is most likely to have the maximum number of intersections with the graph of y=cos x because it can effectively cover more peaks and troughs of the cosine function within its radius. Thus, the answer choice is Circle  D. The final answer is boxed{D. Circle D}"},{"instruction":"The perimeter of a square is equal to the circumference of a circle with radius 3 units.

Consequently, neither K nor P is opposite to U. 4. **Determine which faces can be opposite to U:**    - Since K is opposite to P, the possibilities for the face opposite U reduce to I, M, or O.    - From the middle diagram, we notice that O is adjacent to U. Therefore, O cannot be opposite to U. 5. **Assess remaining options:**    - So U must be opposite either I or M.    - If U were opposite I, then O must be opposite M. This arrangement must hold consistently across all diagrams. 6. **Verify with the right-hand diagram:**    - By examining the right-hand diagram, it becomes evident that I and O are adjacent faces.    - Therefore, U cannot be opposite I since O must be opposite either U or another face, but we already know that O is adjacent to U and cannot be opposite to it. 7. **Conclusion:**    - Thus, U must be opposite to M because all other possibilities are exhausted or ruled out.

We need to prove that the relationship between ( y ) and ( x ) can be expressed by the formula ( y = ax + b ), where ( a ) and ( b ) are constants. 2. **Increment Proportionality:**        Given that equal increments in ( x ) result in equal increments in ( y ), we can state this formally as follows: Let ( Delta x ) be a small change in ( x ) and ( Delta y ) be the corresponding change in ( y ).

In a regular polygon, the distance between two points is proportional to the number of vertices between them along the minor arc. 3. **Arc length calculation**: The distance |P_cP_a| is proportional to min{c-a, 2n-1-(c-a)}, where c-a is the number of vertices encountered traveling from P_c to P_a along the minor arc, and 2n-1-(c-a) is the number of vertices encountered traveling along the major arc. 4. **Equality condition**: For |P_cP_a| = |P_cP_b|, we need:    [    min{c-a, 2n-1-(c-a)} = min{c-b, 2n-1-(c-b)}    ]    This implies:    [    2n-1-(c-a) = c-b quad text{or} quad c-a = c-b    ]    Since b neq c, the second condition is impossible.

If no three of them form an isosceles triangle, then the perpendicular bisector of any pair of selected points must pass through an unselected point. There are binom{n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} pairs of selected points and n-1 unselected points. 7. **Contradiction**: By PHP, at least one unselected point must lie on the perpendicular bisectors of at least frac{n}{2} pairs of selected points. This point must be the circumcenter of the polygon, which is not a vertex, leading to a contradiction. 8. **Adjacent unselected points**: If there are no adjacent unselected points, then there must be exactly one selected point between any two unselected points. This leads to a contradiction as well, as shown in the detailed solution.

We need to find the maximum ((M)) and minimum ((m)) possible values of the lengths of the diagonals (AD), (BE), and (CF). 2. **Maximum Value (M):**    - Consider the diagonal (AD). By the triangle inequality, the length of (AD) must be less than or equal to the sum of the lengths of the sides of the hexagon that connect (A) to (D):      [      |AD| leq |AB| + |BC| + |CD| = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3      ]    - This reasoning applies similarly to the diagonals (BE) and (CF). Therefore, the maximum possible value (M) for any of these diagonals is:      [      M = 3      ] 3. **Minimum Value (m):**    - Since the hexagon is convex, all internal angles are less than (180^circ). This implies that the shortest distance between any two non-adjacent vertices (i.e., the diagonals) must be at least 1.    - To see why, consider the diagonal (AD).

This function is clearly a bijection because for every integer (n), there is a unique integer (dn) in (dmathbb{Z}).    - Additionally, (|f(n+1) - f(n)| = |d(n+1) - dn| = |d| in D). Thus, the base case holds. 2. **Inductive Step:**    - Assume the statement is true for any set (D) with (|D| = k-1). Let (D = {d_1, d_2, ldots, d_k}) with (|D| = k).    - Let (md = gcd(d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{k-1})) and (nd = d_k). Then, (d = gcd(md, nd) = gcd(md, d_k)).    - Since (d = gcd(md, nd)), we have (gcd(m, n) = 1). 3. **Constructing the Bijection:**    - By the inductive hypothesis, there exists a bijection (g: mathbb{Z} rightarrow mdmathbb{Z}) such that (|g(n+1) - g(n)| in {d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{k-1}}).    - Consider an infinite grid (q(x, y)) where (0 le x le m-1) and (y in mathbb{Z}). Define (q(0, t) = g(t)) for (t in mathbb{Z}) and (q(x, y) = q(x-1, y) + nd) for all (x, y in mathbb{Z}) with (1 le x le m-1). 4. **Ensuring Bijection:**    - Every multiple of (d) is listed exactly once in the columns (x = 0, 1, ldots, m-1) because they form (mdmathbb{Z} + {0, nd, 2nd, ldots, (m-1)nd}).    - Since (gcd(m, n) = 1), the multiples of (d) are distributed uniquely across the columns. If a multiple of (d) appeared twice, it would imply a contradiction in the bijection (g). 5. **Defining the Function (f):**    - We can define (f) by traversing the grid in a zigzag manner. For example, start at ((0, 0)), move to ((0, 1)), and continue to ((0, m-1)), then move to ((1, m-1)), and so on.    - This traversal ensures that (|f(n+1) - f(n)|) is either (d_k) (when moving between columns) or one of ({d_1, d_2, ldots, d_{k-1}}) (when moving within a column). 6. **Conclusion:**    - By induction, we have shown that for any non-empty subset (D) of positive integers, there exists a bijection (f: mathbb{Z} rightarrow dmathbb{Z}) such that (|f(n+1) - f(n)| in D) for every integer (n).

The sequence starts with the term:    [    5 = 5 times 1    ]    The second term is:    [    6x = (5 + 1)x    ]    The third term is:    [    7x^2 = (5 + 2)x^2    ]    Continuing this pattern, we can see that each term's coefficient increases by 1 more than the previous term's increment:    [    text{general coefficient} = 5 + (n - 1)    ]    For the 50th term (where (n = 50)):    [    text{coefficient} = 5 + (50 - 1) = 5 + 49 = 54    ] 2. **Observe the Exponents**:    Next, we examine the exponents of (x).

Next, we eliminate the parameter from the equation of curve C to get its Cartesian equation:  begin{aligned} x &= t + 2,  y &= t^2. end{aligned}  From the first equation, we can express t as t = x - 2. Substituting this into the second equation, we get y = (x - 2)^2. We now solve the system of equations composed of the straight line and the curve:  begin{cases}  x+y-2=0,   y=(x-2)^2. end{cases}  From the line equation, we have y = 2 - x. Substituting y in the second equation from the system:  2 - x = (x - 2)^2.  Expanding the square, we get:  2 - x = x^2 - 4x + 4.  Bringing all terms to one side of the equation, we obtain:  x^2 - 3x + 2 = 0.  Factoring the quadratic equation, we get:  (x - 1)(x - 2) = 0.  Hence, the possible values for x are x = 1 and x = 2. Correspondingly, for x = 1, we get y = 1, and for x = 2, we get y = 0. Therefore, the coordinates of points A and B where line l intersects curve C are A(1, 1) and B(2, 0). To find the distance |AB|, we use the distance formula:  |AB| = sqrt{(2-1)^2 + (0-1)^2} = sqrt{1 + 1} = sqrt{2}.  Hence, the length of segment AB is boxed{sqrt{2}}. The key to solving this problem is to transform parametric equations into their Cartesian forms, find the intersection points between a line and a curve, and finally, apply the distance formula between two points.

After playing the next innings, the total number of innings played would be ( n + 1 ), and he wants his total runs to be ( 39(n + 1) ) to have an average of 39. He needs to make 79 runs in his next innings, so the total runs after ( n + 1 ) innings would be ( 35n + 79 ).

To solve this problem, we can use **Ramsey's Theorem** which provides a foundation for combinatorial arguments about finding guaranteed structures within a set when partitioned or colored. 1. **Define the Problem in Graph Theory Terms:**    - We represent the 17 scientists as vertices in a complete graph, ( K_{17} ).    - Each edge is colored based on the topic of correspondence between two scientists. Let the three topics be represented by three colors, say red, blue, and green. 2. **Application of Ramsey's Theorem:**    - Ramsey's Theorem ( R(3,3,3) ) states that for any three-coloring of the edges of a complete graph ( K_n ), there is a number ( n ) such that every coloring will contain a monochromatic ( K_3 ) (3 vertices all connected with edges of the same color).    - It is known from Ramsey theory that ( R(3,3,3) = 17 ), meaning if you have complete graph ( K_{17} ) and color its edges with three colors, there is guaranteed to be a monochromatic triangle. 3. **Proof by Application:**    - Given ( K_{17} ) (our 17 scientists), and the edges are colored with three colors (corresponding to the three topics), Ramsey's Theorem ensures that ( K_{17} ) always contains a monochromatic triangle.    - Therefore, there exist three scientists (vertices in the graph), say ( A, B, C ), such that the edges ( AB ), ( BC ), and ( CA ) are all the same color.

Each king attacks the squares that share a common point with the square it occupies. Therefore, each king must be paired with exactly one other king such that they attack each other. 3. **Pairing and Territory:**    We can split the kings into pairs of attacking kings. For each pair, we designate a territory based on their relative positions. The possible configurations of a pair and their territories are shown below:    [    begin{array}{ccc}    times & color{red}{times} & color{red}{times}     times & bullet & color{red}{times}     times & bullet & color{red}{times}     times & times & times     end{array}    ]    [    begin{array}{cccc}    times & color{red}{times} & color{red}{times} & color{red}{times}     times & bullet & bullet & color{red}{times}     times & times & times & times     end{array}    ]    [    begin{array}{cccc}    times & color{red}{times} & color{red}{times} &     times & bullet & color{red}{times} & color{red}{times}     times & times & bullet & times     & times & times & times     end{array}    ]    [    begin{array}{cccc}    & times & color{red}{times} & color{red}{times}     times & color{red}{times} & bullet & color{red}{times}     times & bullet & times & times     times & times & times &     end{array}    ] 4. **Non-Intersecting Territories:**    It is easy to check that no two pairs can have intersecting territories. Furthermore, all the territories are contained within a 13 times 13 square that shares its lower left corner with the 12 times 12 board S. This means that the kings and their territories combined cannot exceed 13^2 = 169 squares. 5. **Calculation of Maximum Pairs:**    Since each pair consists of 2 kings and 4 units of territory, we have at most:    [    frac{169}{6} = 28 + frac{1}{6}    ]    pairs. This means that we can have at most 28 pairs, which corresponds to 56 kings. Therefore, the maximum number of kings that can be placed on a 12 times 12 chessboard such that each king attacks exactly one other king is indeed 56.

Sum the given equations directly: [ sin (A + 45^circ) + sin (B + 45^circ) = 2 ] 2. Since the maximum value for sin x is 1, each sine term must equal 1.

Use the trigonometric identities again: [ sin 2A + sin 2B + 2 cos (A - B) = 4 ] 3. Recognize that for the equation to hold: [ sin 2A = 1 implies 2A = 90^circ implies A = 45^circ quad text{and} quad sin 2B = 1 implies 2B = 90^circ implies B = 45^circ quad text{and} quad cos (A - B) = 1 ] 4. Thus, combining: [ A = B = 45^circ ] **Conclusion**: [ boxed{90^circ} ]  Proof (Bisector Issue): 1. Given triangle ABC with a bisector BD. The configuration and properties of triangle angles and sides are crucial for this proof. 2. Analyze the external and internal angles: - angle ADB is an external angle for triangle BDC. - Hence, angle ADB > angle CBD. 3. By geometry properties in triangle ABD: [ angle ADB > angle ABD ] 4.

Substitute the values ( a = 9 ) and ( b = 4 ) into the equation:    [ x^2 + 4^2 = (9 - x)^2 ]    [ x^2 + 16 = 81 - 18x + x^2 ] 4. Simplify and solve for ( x ):    [ 16 = 81 - 18x ]    [ 18x = 81 - 16 ]    [ 18x = 65 ]    [ x = frac{65}{18} ] 5.

Therefore, f(x) is a decreasing function in the interval (e, +infty). Now, consider f(2018) = frac{ln(2018)}{2018}, f(2019) = frac{ln(2019)}{2019}, and f(4) = frac{ln(4)}{4} = frac{ln(2)}{2}. Since f(x) is decreasing in (e, +infty), we have: boxed{frac{ln(2019)}{2019} < frac{ln(2018)}{2018} < frac{ln(2)}{2}} The final answer is boxed{frac{ln(2019)}{2019} < frac{ln(2018)}{2018} < frac{ln(2)}{2}}. This problem requires us to analyze the monotonicity of a function using its derivative. The key is to construct a new function f(x) = frac{ln(x)}{x} and analyze its monotonicity."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:F,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},I={key:0,class:"empty-state"},W=["disabled"],E={key:0},L={key:1};function N(n,e,h,u,o,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(i(!0),a(y,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(i(),v(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",I,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
